Longitudinal data was available for [ 18 F]florbetapir (A\u03b2) PET (baseline to 4.3\u00b11.9 years), CSF (p)tau (baseline to 2.0\u00b10.1 years), cognition (baseline to 4.3\u00b12.0 years), and [ 18 F]flortaucipir (tau) PET (measured 5.2\u00b11.2 years after baseline to 1.6\u00b10.7 years later). We used linear mixed modelling to study the association between amyloid-\u03b2 CSF/PET status and tau pathology measured in CSF or using PET.

Five years after baseline, [ 18 F]flortaucipir PET uptake in the CSF+/PET-group (1.20\u00b10.13) did not differ from CSF-/PET-(1.18\u00b10.08, p=0.69), but was substantially lower than CSF+/PET+ (1.48\u00b10.44, p<0.001).

Similarly, a follow-up diagnosis was available for 724 (99%) participants with a median interval between baseline and follow-up of 4.1 [IQR: 2.2, 5.9] years.\nWritten informed consent was obtained for all participants, and study procedures were approved by the institutional re-view board at each of the participating centers. ADNI is listed in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry (ADNI-1: NCT00106899; ADNI-GO: NCT01078636; ADNI-2: NCT0123197).\nAcquisition and processing of [ 18 F]Florbetapir PET using Freesurfer was performed as described previously. 19, 20 At least one follow-up PET scan was available for 579 (79%) of participants with a median follow-up time of 4.1 [IQR: 2.1, 5.9] years. We used a neocortical composite score provided by ADNI consisting of the mean uptake in the frontal, cingulate, parietal and temporal regions. We created standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) using whole cerebellum as the reference region and used an SUVR cut-off of 1.11 to determine binarized amyloid-\u03b2 status based on PET. 21, 22 For longitudinal linear mixed modelling, we additionally used SUVR values in 34 regions from the Desikan-Killiany atlas using (i) the whole cerebellum, 23 and (ii) a composite white matter region as reference regions, because the latter has been shown to be more reliable in longitudinal analyses. 24 Finally, we used an early composite region identified in a recent study 25 (including bilateral precuneus, posterior cingulate, insula, and medial and lateral orbitofrontal regions) to capture the early accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2. : medRxiv preprint Next, we investigated longitudinal trajectories of tau pathology (CSF and PET) and cognition (Figure 2, eTable 2 in the Supplement). Compared to amyloid-\u03b2 CSF+/PET+ group, participants with discordant CSF/PET amyloid-\u03b2 status had at baseline significantly (i) lower levels of CSF t-tau and p-tau measures (both p<0.001), (ii) less [ 18 F]flortaucipir uptake in entorhinal cortex (both p<0.001), temporal meta-ROI (p<0.001 for CSF+/PET-, p=0.006 for CSF-/PET+) and Braak V/VI (p=0.002 for CSF+/PET-, p=0.274 for CSF-/PET+), and (iii) better cognitive test scores (MMSE: p=0.001 for CSF+/PET-, p=0.201 for CSF-/PET+; memory: both p<0.001; executive functioning: p=0.010 for CSF+/PET-, p<0.001 for CSF-/PET+). Longitudinally, participants in both CSF/PET discordant groups had lower rates of increase in [ 18 F]flortaucipir uptake in temporal meta-ROI (p=0.010 for CSF+/PET-, p=0.031 for CSF-/PET+) and Braak V/VI composite areas (p=0.022 for CSF+/PET-), and less decline in cognitive test scores (all p<0.001 for both), compared to the CSF+/PET+ group. CSF+/PETparticipants additionally had at baseline worse executive functioning than participants in the CSF-/PET-group (p=0.034). group. The CSF/PET discordant groups were otherwise similar to CSF-/PET-. Clinical Progression Next, we investigated the association between amyloid-\u03b2 CSF/PET status and clinical progression using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression analyses (Figure 3, eTable 3 in the Supplement). Progression to either MCI or dementia occurred less often in amyloid-\u03b2 CSF+/PET-(14%, hazard ratio [HR]= 0.22 [0.12, 0.41], p<0.001), CSF-/PET+ (8%, HR= 0.10 [0.02, 0.41], p=0.001) and CSF-/PET-(10%, HR= 0.16 [0.11, 0.24], p<0.001) participants, compared to the CSF+/PET+ (44%) group. Similarly, progression to dementia was rare in CSF+/PET-(5%, HR= 0.09 [0.03, 0.25], p<0.001) and CSF-/PET-(6%, HR= 0.11 [0.06, 0.17], p<0.001), but occurred more frequently in CSF+/PET+ (38%).

Although these two measures are sometimes considered interchangeable, 2-4 10-20% cases show discordant results, especially at earlier stages of AD. [5] [6] [7] Therefore, it has been proposed that decreased A\u03b242 in CSF without significant tracer uptake on PET (i.e. amyloid-\u03b2 CSF+/PET-) marks the pathological beginnings of amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation. 8, 9 This provides a powerful model to study the dynamic changes in amyloid-\u03b2 as well as tau pathology during the earliest stages in the disease course of AD. Although CSF tau biomarkers have been available for over two decades, 10 tau PET using radiotracers such as [ 18 F]flortaucipir 11, 12 has only more recently been developed. Tau PET offers the unique opportunity to study the spatial distribution of tau\nAn open question to date is whether isolated amyloid-\u03b2 positivity in CSF is followed by significant tau deposition already at this stage, or whether it will be subsequent to more advanced amyloid-\u03b2 pathology detectable by both modalities (i.e. CSF and PET). As tau has a stronger correlation to neurodegeneration and cognitive function than amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation, 13, 14 this is of high clinical relevance. Furthermore, a better understanding of the interplay between the AD hallmark pathologies in early disease stages is crucial for the timing of interventions, as emerging treatments will likely be most effective when substantial neurodegeneration has not yet developed. 15 "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data for this study was downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) website (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/), which also includes information about ADNI inclusion criteria and the procedure of biomarker acquisition. 16 We selected all ADNI participants, who had at least one [ 18 F]florbetapir amyloid-\u03b2 PET scan and a CSF A\u03b242 analysis available within one year. The diagnosis closest to baseline [ 18 F]florbetapir PET within one year was used as the baseline diagnosis.

Thereafter, 0.5mL aliquots were prepared and stored in polypropylene tubes at -80\u00b0C. CSF samples were analyzed for A\u03b242, total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) using the AlzBio3 assays (Fujirebio) on the xMAP platform (Luminex). In case samples were reanalyzed, we used the median value of those results. A cutoff of 192 pg/mL was used to determine amyloid-\u03b2 status based on CSF. 26 28 Thereafter, we created three bilaterally volume-weighted composite regions to cover the full spectrum of tau aggregation: entorhinal cortex, temporal meta-ROI reflecting Braak stage I to IV (including entorhinal, parahippocampal cortex, amygdala, fusiform, inferior and middle temporal cortices), and Braak stage V and VI (including wider neocortical areas).

The models included time in years as a continuous variable, amyloid-\u03b2 CSF/PET group, and an interaction between time*CSF/PET group. All models also included terms for age and sex. The models predicting regional amyloid-\u03b2 PET and tau pathology based on CSF or PET were additionally adjusted for MMSE to account for clinical disease severity. The models predicting cognitive test results were additionally adjusted for education. We used a random intercept and a random slope for all models. We first selected CSF-/PET-as the reference group and interpreted the main effect of CSF/PET group status (CSF-/PET+ and CSF+/PET-) in the models as difference at baseline, and the CSF/PET group*time interaction term as the change over time. Thereafter, we repeated this analysis with CSF+/PET+ as the reference group. We then performed Kaplan-Meier survival analyses to investigate the association between amyloid-\u03b2 CSF/PET status and clinical progression by using both overall progression (CN to MCI or dementia, or MCI to dementia) and progression to dementia (CN or MCI to dementia) as events.

Our main finding was that although amyloid-\u03b2 CSF+/PETparticipants showed longitudinal accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 based on PET, they had significantly less tau pathology based on both CSF at baseline and [ 18 F]flortaucipir 5 years later compared to participants with CSF+/PET+ amyloid-\u03b2 status. Similarly, discordant amyloid-\u03b2 status was associated with better cognitive outcome and a lower risk of clinical progression than CSF+/PET+. We also showed that during follow-up, CSF+/PET-subjects frequently progressed to amyloid-\u03b2 CSF+/PET+, whereas only one participant reached the threshold of tau-positivity based on [ 18 F]flortaucipir PET. Finally, we showed a correlation between tau measures and global amyloid-\u03b2 PET tracer uptake, indicating possible subthreshold accumulation of AD pathology in CSF+/PET-subjects. Taken together, our findings suggest that CSF+/PET-amyloid-\u03b2 status is associated with a distinctly better prognosis than CSF+/PET+, and that a sufficient amyloid-\u03b2 load detectable by both CSF and PET is required before significant tau deposition emerges.\nUsing both CSF tau measures and [ 18 F]flortaucipir PET we found that participants with discordant CSF/PET amyloid-\u03b2 status had less tau pathology than CSF+/PET+ amyloid-\u03b2, and comparable tau load as observed in concordant amyloid-\u03b2 negative participants. It has been proposed that CSF+/PET-status can be caused by CSF A\u03b242 being able to detect amyloid-\u03b2 at an earlier stage due to the decrease of soluble A\u03b242 in CSF preceding fibrillary depositions visualized by PET. This is supported by higher rates of CSF+/PET-compared to CSF-/PET+ across several studies. 7, 37, 38 Previous longitudinal PET studies have shown that subjects with CSF+/PET-amyloid-\u03b2 status show significant accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 over time. 8, 9, 39 We replicated this finding in our study, further supporting the notion that CSF+/PET-amyloid-\u03b2 status identifies the beginnings of amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation. Although participants with CSF-/PET+ amyloid-\u03b2 status had higher [ 18 F]florbetapir tracer uptake at baseline, they did not show significant accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 over time. Combined with the lack of clinical progression in this group, these observations suggest that isolated amyloid-\u03b2 PET positivity might be caused by non-specific tracer uptake in the white matter, processing errors or other unknown factors. 6 In CSF+/PET-participants, the lack of substantial tau pathology based on CSF tau measures at baseline and on [ 18 F]flortaucipir PET five years later, accompanied by lack of cognitive decline and clinical progression, suggests these subjects have a distinctly more favorable prognosis than subjects with CSF+/PET+. This is likely caused by the remarkably slow course of AD, which is characterized by gradual accumulation of pathology over time. 40, 41 Accounting for the more benign prognosis of CSF+/PET-subjects is important for the timing of future interventions at the earliest stages of AD pathology.\nCurrent hypothetical biomarker models suggest that accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 pathology is followed by detectable cortical tau pathology, subsequently leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. 42, 43 Although it has been proposed that CSF+/PET-is followed by conversion to CSF+/PET+, 8, 44 the exact timing of CSF+/PET-status in regard to that timeline, in particular towards accumulation of tau, is unknown. We found that within five years, one third of the CSF+/PET-participants progressed to CSF+/PET+, whereas at that time only one participant exhibited suprathreshold early to intermediate stage tau pathology based on [ 18 F]flortaucipir PET and none showed widespread neocortical uptake (i.e. Braak stage V/VI regions). This finding has at least two implications. First, as the majority of CSF+/PETparticipants did not progress to CSF+/PET+ within 5 years, this indicates that in the majority of cases the CSF+/PET-amyloid-\u03b2 status lasts for several years. Second, accumulation of sufficient amyloid-\u03b2 detectable by both CSF and PET seems to precede significant accumulation of tau pathology. 45 However, we also found a correlation between baseline regional amyloid-\u03b2 PET and tau pathology in the CSF+/PET-group, suggesting that there already might be interaction present between amyloid-\u03b2 and tau. This supports previous work, emphasizing the importance of considering subthreshold accumulation of pathology to better understand disease mechanisms of early preclinical stages of AD. [46] [47] [48] Our study has some limitations. Although ADNI is one of the largest cohorts with both available amyloid-\u03b2 PET and CSF analysis, only a relatively small number of participants with discordant CSF/PET amyloid-\u03b2 status were available. Second, our main outcome measures of tau pathology based on CSF and PET were assessed at different time-points. Although that reduces the direct comparability of these findings, they also complement each other and allow to measure tau pathology both at baseline and several years later. Additionally, relatively short follow-up periods were available for both CSF tau measures and [ 18 F]flortaucipir PET. Therefore, it is possible, that with longer follow-up periods, subjects with discordant amyloid\u03b2 status might show diverging trajectories compared to the CSF-/PET-group. Our interpretation of the study could also be afflicted by the possibility that CSF+/PET-status might reflect a different subtype of AD, although no evidence for that exists. Finally, cut-offs of biomarkers as well as defining amyloid-\u03b2 PET status based on global SUVR are important considerations when evaluating these results. As suboptimal cut-offs might result in misclassification, 49 we used applied widely used and validated cut-offs for both PET and CSF.\nIn conclusion, our findings indicate that a sufficient amyloid-\u03b2 load detectable by both PET and CSF is required before substantial tau deposition emerges. Subjects with CSF+/PETamyloid-\u03b2 profile are at a significantly earlier clinical and biological disease stage than those with CSF+/PET+, and have a distinctly better prognosis for at least five years.
