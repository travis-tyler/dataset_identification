[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] However, cross-sectional studies cannot determine whether trajectories of A\u2424 accumulation differ in individuals with elevated A\u2424 deposition compared with those with minimal initial A\u2424 deposition. Longitudinal investigations of individual differences in trajectories of A\u2424 accumulation in relation to cognitive outcomes are needed. Characterization of individuals with elevated A\u2424 deposition but with normal cognition also provides an opportunity for investigation of factors that explain why some individuals with elevated A\u2424 deposition progress to AD whereas others remain cognitively normal. 13, 14 Furthermore, longitudinal studies in nondemented older adults will provide information about the spatial patterns of A\u2424 change, which may guide more focused neuropathologic studies of the earliest regional changes.\nTo investigate longitudinal patterns of change in A\u2424 deposition, we evaluated 24 nondemented older participants in the Neuroimaging Substudy of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who underwent at least 2 carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography ([ 11 C]PiB-PET) studies during intervals up to 2.6 years. We hypothesized that there is variation in the rates of A\u2424 deposition in cognitively normal individuals and that higher rates of A\u2424 depo-sition occur in those with higher A\u2424 levels at the initial [ 11 C]PiB-PET. In addition, we anticipated regional variation in rates of A\u2424 deposition, with regions that show early A\u2424 deposition, such as the precuneus and the prefrontal cortex, 8, 9 demonstrating the clearest evidence of longitudinal change.

Change in A\u2424 deposition varied across individuals, with some showing no change and others showing annual increases as high as 11.2% during 2.1-year follow-up. Variability in the annual rate of change was affected by global cDVR at the initial PiB-PET, and increases were greater in nondemented older adults with an elevated A\u2424 level compared with a minimal A\u2424 level at the initial evaluation. The ROI analysis showed that longitudinal increases in [\n11 C]PiB retention were observed in the prefrontal, parietal, lateral temporal, occipital, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices.\nUsing cDVR as a global index of [ 11 C]PiB retention, we found increases in fibrillar A\u2424 deposition over time. This finding, together with a previous report of serial changes in [ served increases up to 11.2% DVR over 2.1 years, exceeding the \u00b16.2% test-retest variability reported for the simplified reference tissue model in [\n11 C]PiB-PET studies. 20, 22 On the other hand, some nondemented older adults show no increases in Understanding factors that explain the variability in level and change over time in [ 11 C]PiB retention may help differentiate between normal aging and cognitive impairment.

Continued prospective follow-up of this cohort will determine whether individuals with greater change in [\n11 C]PiB retention will ultimately show accelerated cognitive decline and will clarify the relationships between the trajectories of A\u2424 deposition, age, and cognitive status. ]PiB retention in the orbitofrontal gyrus were significant only when older adults with elevated vs minimal baseline cDVRs were compared, suggesting that at least in this sample, the magnitude of increase in [\n11 C]PiB retention in the orbitofrontal gyrus may be relatively low compared with that in other regions. These findings extend those of previous cross-sectional studies 8, 9 of early A\u2424 deposition and may provide insights into the relationships of global and regional A\u2424 deposition with cognitive decline 25 and changes in brain networks. 10, 26 This study has several limitations.
