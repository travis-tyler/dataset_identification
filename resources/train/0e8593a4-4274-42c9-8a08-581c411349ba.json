Thresholds for the brightness temperature differences between the three channels are suggested as criterion to detect deep convective clouds, and an order relation between the differences is used to detect convective overshooting. The procedure is based on an investigation of the influence of deep convective cloud systems on the microwave brightness temperatures at frequencies from 89 to 220 GHz using simultaneous aircraft microwave and radar measurements over two tropical deep convective cloud systems, taken during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA) campaign. Two other aircraft cases with deep convective cloud systems observed during the Third Convection and Moisture Experiment (CAMEX-3) are used to validate the criteria. Furthermore, a microwave radiative transfer model and simulated mature tropical squall line data derived from the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model are used to validate the procedures and to adapt the criteria to the varying viewing angle of AMSU-B. These methods are employed to investigate the distributions of deep convective clouds and convective overshooting in the tropics (30\u00b0S to 30\u00b0N) for the four 3-month seasons from March 2003 to February 2004 using the AMSU-B data from NOAA-15, -16, and -17. The distributions show a seasonal variability of shifting from the winter hemisphere to the summer hemisphere. The distributions of deep convective clouds follow the seasonal patterns of the surface rainfall rates. The deep convective clouds over land penetrate more frequently into the tropical tropopause layer than those over ocean. The averaged deep convective cloud fraction is about 0.3% in the tropics, and convective overshooting contributes about 26% to this.\nCitation: Hong, G., G. Heygster, J. Miao, and K.

They play a major role in Earth's climate by transporting Earth's heat, moisture, and momentum from lower to upper troposphere. The tropical tropopause layer (TTL) between about 14 -18 km [e.g., Dessler, 2000, 2001; Alcala and Dessler, 2002] is the important transition layer between the convectively dominated tropical troposphere and the radiatively controlled stratosphere [e.g., Highwood and Hoskins, 1998; Sherwood and Dessler, 2000; Thuburn and Craig, 2002] , that accounts for much of the air entering the stratosphere from troposphere. Thus convective overshooting, i.e. deep convective clouds penetrating the TTL, affect the exchange of air between the troposphere and the stratosphere, and thereby influence the physical and chemical processes occurring in the TTL and the stratosphere [e.g., Lelieveld and Crutzen, 1994; Holton et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 1997; Sherwood and Dessler, 2001; Dessler, 2002; Gettelman et al., 2002; Andronache et al., 2002] .\n[3] Observations [e.g., Thompson et al., 1997; Gettelman et al., 2002] and model simulations [e.g., Thompson et al., 1997 ; Di Giuseppe and Tompkins, 2003] have helped to understand the influence of deep convective clouds on the physical and chemical processes occurring in the TTL and the stratosphere. A critical prerequisite for this is the quantification of the frequencies, heights, and locations of deep convective clouds [Alcala and Dessler, 2002] . Because of the lack of ground-based cloud observations over oceans, satellite data including passive measurements of visible, infrared, and microwave radiances and active measurements of radar have been used in the studies of deep convective clouds [e.g., Liu et al., 1995; Hall and Haar, 1999; Gettelman et al., 2002; Alcala and Dessler, 2002] .\n[4] Methods to identify tropical deep convective clouds using infrared measurements are generally based on thresholds of cloud top temperatures, which have been defined with different values [Mapes and Houze, 1993] , for example, \u00c065\u00b0C by Hall and Haar [1999] , \u00c058\u00b0C by Fu et al. [1990] and Gettelman et al. [2002] , \u00c043\u00b0C by Hendon and Woodberry [1993] , and \u00c040\u00b0C by Liu et al. [1995] . Different temperature thresholds result in detecting more or less deep convective clouds. Mace et al. [2001] and Luo et al. [2003] defined that thin cirrus cloud by top temperatures less than \u00c035\u00b0C. The cirrostratus and cirrocumulus fractions are tightly connected with deep convective cloud fractions [Chou and Neelin, 1999] . Thus, it is difficult to distinguish deep convective clouds and cirrus clouds if only the methods based on infrared temperature thresholds are used. Liu et al. [1995] distinguished thin high cirrus clouds and deep convective clouds in terms of cloud top temperatures derived from infrared measurements and a microwave index defined by brightness temperatures at frequencies of 19.35 and 85.5 GHz of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I). However, the method of Liu et al. [1995] is a rainfall retrieval scheme. Their classification is intended to maximize correlations in the retrieved rainfall while the validity for cloud type was not checked [Anagnostou and Kummerow, 1997; Hong et al., 1999] . A convective and stratiform classification scheme independent of any rainfall retrieval scheme using SSM/I 85 GHz brightness temperature observations was developed by Anagnostou and Kummerow [1997] . Hong et al. [1999] improved it using higher resolution microwave observations of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). However, the schemes of Anagnostou and Kummerow [1997] and Hong et al. [1999] only classify convective and stratiform clouds, whereas deep convective clouds are still undistinguished from the convective clouds.\n[5] With high accuracy and excellent space and time resolutions, radar systems can provide direct measurements of the structure of clouds. Before the launch of TRMM in 1997, ground-based [e.g., Heymsfield and Fulton, 1988; Cifelli et al., 2002] , shipborne [e.g., DeMott and Rutledge, 1998; Rickenbach and Rutledge, 1998 ], and airborne [e.g., Heymsfield et al., 1996; Geerts et al., 2000] radar systems were used to observe the vertical structure and microphysical characteristics of deep convective clouds. Some of these investigations showed deep convective clouds penetrating into the TTL. However, as documented by Alcala and Dessler [2002] , these measurements were confined to local geographic regions to study individual cloud systems and were not able to provide observations of deep convective clouds over a global scale. Since the launch of TRMM, the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), the first satellite-borne radar, can provide three dimensional cloud structure on a global scale enabling more accurate observations of deep convective cloud systems than before. The vertical structure of deep convective cloud systems using the PR has been documented widely [Simpson et al., 1998; Nesbitt et al., 2000; Cecil et al., 2002; Toracinta et al., 2002; Alcala and Dessler, 2002; Kelley and Stout, 2004] . Alcala and Dessler [2002] used the PR to identify and characterize deep convection extending into the TTL over the entire tropics. They found that the amount of overshooting convection is about 5% of total deep convective cloud and about 1.5% of the total convective rain area. The detailed vertical structure of convective towers in tropical cyclone eyewalls was studied by Kelley and Stout [2004] using the PR from 1998 to 2001. Convective systems evolve on time scales less than one day and are organized on space scales of the order of 100 km [Hendon and Woodberry, 1993] . Although the PR has high vertical (0.25 km at nadir) and horizontal (4.3 km at nadir) resolutions, the swath of the PR (215 km wide prior to the 2001 boost and 250 km wide afterward) is too narrow to see the entire large scale cloud systems [Kelley and Stout, 2004] . The narrow swath of the PR and the long TRMM satellite return period (four to five days) result in difficulties to monitor short lived convective clouds.\n[6] The Advance Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) series on board NOAA-15, -16, and -17 have been used to observe tropical cyclones [e.g., Kidder et al., 2000] , precipitation [e.g., Staelin and Chen, 2000; Bennartz et al., 2002; Staelin, 2003, 2004] , and clouds [e.g., Zhao and Weng, 2002; Weng et al., 2003 ] using the advantages of their wide swaths (about 2200 km) and wide frequency range of their microwave channels . The key advantage of the AMSU-B channels is the unique ability to penetrate clouds [e.g., Burns et al., 1997; Greenwald and Christopher, 2002] . However, the atmosphere is not entirely transparent at these frequencies in cases where thick clouds or precipitation significantly contaminate the sounder's field of view [Eyre, 1990] . The effects of clouds and precipitation on microwave radiances at the AMSU-B channels have been examined through simulations [e.g., Muller et al., 1994; Burns et al., 1997; Skofronick-Jackson et al., 2002; Bennartz and Bauer, 2003] and observations [e.g., Wang et al., 1997 Wang et al., , 1998 Greenwald and Christopher, 2002] . The presence of hydrometeors in the upper levels of clouds with high cloud top results in large brightness temperature depressions at the AMSU-B frequencies above 150 GHz. Furthermore, for the three channels near to the water vapor absorption line centered at 183.3 GHz (183.3 \u00b1 1, \u00b13, \u00b17 GHz), the farther is the frequency from the center, the larger is the brightness temperature depression [Burns et al., 1997] . This is because the 183.3 \u00b1 7 GHz channel can view deeper into clouds than the other two water vapor channels. The temperature weighting functions of the three water vapor channels maximize at different altitudes and they are above 9 km for precipitating clouds [Burns et al., 1997] . Their different responses suggest a potential to delineate the distributions of hydrometeors above 10 km in clouds [Burns et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997 Wang et al., , 1998 ]. A criterion based on the difference between measured brightness temperatures at 183.3 \u00b1 3 and 183.3 \u00b1 1 GHz was suggested to screen out convective clouds before water vapor retrieval by Burns et al. [1997] .\n[7] The present study derives methods for detecting deep convective clouds and convective overshooting in the tropics using satellite measurements at the AMSU-B water vapor channels. In section 2, in situ measurements of aircraft radar and microwave radiances are used to analyze the effects of deep convective cloud systems on microwave brightness temperatures at frequencies from 89 to 220 GHz, so as to suggest the criteria for detecting deep convective clouds and convective overshooting. The criteria are confirmed by simulated microwave radiances over a tropical squall line system in section 3. The criteria take into account the variation of the viewing angle of AMSU-B over the swath. In section 4, our methods are applied to one year of AMSU-B data from Heymsfield et al., 2000; Cifelli et al., 2002] . Two deep convective cloud systems observed on 25 January and 10 February 1999 during TRMM LBA and two others observed on 26 August 1998 during CAMEX-3 are chosen in our study because there were simultaneous measurements from the ER-2 Doppler radar (EDOP) and the Millimeterwave Imaging Radiometer (MIR) on board the ER-2 aircraft flying at an altitude of 20 km. The EDOP radar is a dualbeam Doppler weather radar at X-band (9.6 GHz) with a nadir footprint of 1 km. Its vertical resolution is 37.5 m, the horizontal resolution along the track is about 100 m [Heymsfield et al., 1996] . The EDOP radar data can provide information on vertical hydrometeor structure, including the melting layer, the convective core locations and heights [Heymsfield et al., 1996] . The MIR is a cross-track scanning radiometer that measures radiation at frequencies of 89, 150, 183.3 \u00b1 1, 183.3 \u00b1 3, 183.3 \u00b1 7, 220, and 340 GHz. It scans in a plane perpendicular to the direction of flight with a swath of \u00b150\u00b0from nadir, which results in a ground swath of about 42 km at its cruising altitude of about 20 km for all frequencies. The radiometric measurement accuracy of the MIR is better than 1 K in the brightness temperature range of 240 -330 K, and about 2 -4 K for brightness temperatures below 100 K. Because the EDOP radar does not sample off nadir directions, only the MIR measurements at nadir are used in this section. "}, {"section_title": "Effects of Deep Convective Clouds on Brightness", "text": "Temperatures at the AMSU-B Channels\n[9] Existing studies of the effects of deep convective clouds on brightness temperatures at the AMSU-B channels using simulations [e.g., Burns et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997; Weng and Grody, 2000; Weng et al., 2003] and observations [e.g., Heymsfield et al., 1996; Burns et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997 Wang et al., , 1998 Weng and Grody, 2000] are primarily focused on the understanding the effects of precipitation and clouds on brightness temperatures. Heymsfield et al. [1996] suggested a possible classification of the clouds and the precipitation according to convective cores, elevated ice layers, and rain without significant ice above the melting layer using brightness temperature differences between 150 and 220 GHz, 89 and 220 GHz, and 37 and 86 GHz, respectively. Wang et al. [1997] primarily investigated the effects of storms on the microwave radiances at the water vapor channels of 183.3 \u00b1 1, 183.3 \u00b1 3, and 183.3 \u00b1 7 GHz. They found an analogy between brightness temperatures at these channels over the stormassociated scattering media and those over a dry atmosphere with a cold ground. Similar results were documented by Burns et al. [1997] , who suggested a criterion to screen out intense oceanic convection using the brightness temperature difference between 183.3 \u00b1 3 and 183.3 \u00b1 1 GHz. This work starts with analyzing the effects of deep convective clouds on brightness temperatures at the AMSU-B channels, especially at the three water vapor channels. However, unlike the aforementioned work, we focus on finding methods to detect deep convective clouds and convective overshooting from measurements at the AMSU-B water vapor channels.\n[10] Figure 1 shows the collocated data collected in the flight track of 2217:30 to 2223:22 UTC on 25 January 1999, including the MIR observed brightness temperatures at frequencies between 89 and 220 GHz, the brightness temperature differences between 183.3 \u00b1 1 and 183.3 \u00b1 7 (DT 17 ), 183.3 \u00b1 1 and 183.3 \u00b1 3 (DT 13 ), and 183.3 \u00b1 3 and 183.3 \u00b1 7 GHz (DT 37 ), and the EDOP radar reflectivities. The EDOP radar reflectivities (Figure 1c) show that the case of January 25 is a perfect mature single-cell cumulonimbus with a mushroom-shaped structure. According to the typical features of a mature single-cell cumulonimbus, the whole structure of the cloud system can be separated into three regions: the cloud anvil region from 2217:48 to 2219:36 UTC, the convective core region from 2219:42 to 2222:30 UTC, and another small cloud anvil from 2222:36 to 2223:00 UTC. In the convective core, reflectivities around 50 dBZ are observed and the reflectivities above the altitude of 10 km are generally around 20 dBZ. The high reflectivities above 10 km observed in the convective tower region around 2221:00 UTC are even over 35 dBZ. The cloud top generally reaches to an altitude of 15 km excluding the small anvil region from 2222:36 to 2223:00 UTC. The highest cloud top approaching 17 km aligns with the convective tower.\n[11] Figure 1a indicates that in the cloud anvil region the high frequencies (! 150 GHz) have larger brightness temperature depressions, the highest depression being observed at 220 GHz, then in sequence, those at the three water vapor channels and 150 GHz, and finally those at 89 GHz. However, when approaching the convective core region, the brightness temperature differences become smaller and smaller along with their largest brightness temperature depressions. This observation is consistent with earlier studies of Wang et al. [1997] . It is due to the particle sizes of the frozen hydrometeors which are smaller in the cloud anvil than those in the convective core [e.g., Heymsfield et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997 Wang et al., , 1998 ]. Furthermore, the sensitivity of scattering to smaller frozen hydrometeors increases with frequency. The brightness temperature differences DT 17 , DT 13 , and DT 37 have different characteristics in the entire deep convective cloud system (Figure 1b) . At the edges of the deep convective cloud system (from 2217:30 to 2217:48 UTC and from 2223:00 to 2223:22 UTC), we have DT 17 < DT 13 < DT 37 < 0 K. This is due to the different temperature weighting functions of the three water vapor channels [Burns et al., 1997; Staelin and Chen, 2000] . The channels further away from the center at 183.3 GHz can see deeper into the atmosphere where they detect higher temperatures in the clear sky. In nearly the complete deep convective cloud region from 2218:24 to 2222:36 UTC, we find the inverse relation DT 17 ! DT 13 ! DT 37 > 0 K, again because the channels further away from the center at 183.3 GHz can see deeper into the cloud, hence being subjected to greater scattering from the middle or low layers of the deep convective clouds [Burns et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997] . In the two anvil regions, the values of DT 17 , DT 13 , and DT 37 generally increase from the edges to the core. However, within the convective core region, when approaching the convective cell, the values of DT 17 , DT 13 , and DT 37 decrease, but the relation DT 17 ! DT 13 ! DT 37 > 0 K still holds. This is because the temperature weighting functions of the three water vapor channels tend to be similar where there are large frozen hydrometeor contents [Burns et al., 1997] . From the above analysis we conclude that the region with DT 17 ! DT 13 ! DT 37 > 0 K matches the entire region of the deep convective cloud system. Moreover, this deep convective cloud system penetrates the TTL (14 -18 km). This process is called convective overshooting [Alcala and Dessler, 2002] .\n[12] Figure 2 shows the collocated observed data from the same instruments as in Figure 1 along the flight track of 1813:24 to 1816:14 UTC on 10 February 1999. We identify three strong convective cells in this deep convective cloud system from the EDOP radar reflectivities (Figure 2c) , with reflectivities over 40 dBZ. They are still as high as 20 dBZ in most regions above 10 km of the deep convective cloud system. The structure of the left deep convective cell is tilted towards the right. Similar to the case of 25 January, the brightness temperatures at 89-220 GHz ( Figure 2a ) have a general negative correlation with the intensity of the deep convective cloud system (Figure 2c ), the regions of large brightness temperature depressions corresponding to the convective cells. DT 17 , DT 13 , and DT 37 ( Figure 2b ) do not show the exact behavior of DT 17 ! DT 13 ! DT 37 > 0 K for the entire flight track. At the left edge of the cloud (from 1813:24 to 1813:42 UTC), the tops of the tilted structure cloud are below 10 km. Although the EDOP radar reaches large reflectivities around 20 dBZ at the cloud tops, the order of DT 17 , DT 13 , and DT 37 is the same as that for clear sky observed in the case of 25 January, namely, DT 17 < DT 13 < DT 37 < 0 K. This behavior appears again in the region from 1815:21 to 1815:45 UTC where there are two cloud layers, the anvil cirrus at the altitude of 8 -14 km and the convective core below 8 km. The anvil cirrus has a high cloud top near the bottom of the TTL at 14 km, but with weak intensity (the EDOP reflectivities below 10 dBZ). The convective core is strong with EDOP reflectivities around 25 dBZ at the top, but this top is below 8 km. This feature again makes evident that the main contributions to the radiances at the three water vapor channels are from the upper layers in deep convective clouds.\n[13] In the deep convective regions excluding the left edge of the cloud system from 1813:24 to 1813:51 UTC and the region from 1815:06 to 1815:45 UTC, the EDOP radar reflectivities are large (around 20 dBZ) above 10 km and the cloud tops exceed 14 km. We also can name these regions as convective overshooting regions because the cloud tops penetrate into the TTL. In these regions all values of DT 17 , DT 13 , and DT 37 are positive (Figure 2b ). Similar to the case of January 25, again the relation DT 17 ! DT 13 ! DT 37 > 0 K holds in convective overshooting regions. However, in the two small regions located around 1813:48, and 1815:06 -1815:21 UTC the above mentioned relation does not hold. We use this fact to distinguish convective overshooting from deep convective clouds, i.e., the values of DT 17 , DT 13 , and DT 37 remain positive but the order relation DT 17 ! DT 13 ! DT 37 > 0 K is not more valid. Concluding, from our analyses of the observations over the two deep convective cloud systems, we define two criteria:\nDeep convective cloud:\nConvective overshooting:\n2.3. Confirmation of the Criteria by Two Cases of In order to confirm the criteria derived from the observations taken from TRMM LBA, one deep convective cloud system and one convective overshooting system observed during CAMEX-3 are analyzed. Figures 3 and 4 show the collocated data collected in the flight tracks of 1238:09 to 1243:59 UTC and 1535:34 to 1546:25 UTC on 26 August 1998, respectively, including the observed brightness temperature differences of the MIR and the EDOP radar reflectivities.\n[15] From Figure 3b , the convective system is a deep convective cloud system since its cloud top is below 14 km. Applying criterion (1) to the MIR observations at the three water vapor channels indicates that from 1240:00 to 1241:48 UTC deep convective cloud has been observed ( Figure 3a ). This result is in agreement with the EDOP observations (Figure 3b ). In the cloud anvil regions (from 1238:09 to 1239:36 UTC and from 1242:00 to 1243:59 UTC), DT 17 , DT 13 , and DT 37 are negative, and in the transition regions between deep convective cloud and cloud anvil they are partly positive, partly negative.\n[16] The deep convective cloud system in Figure 4b has a cloud top above 14 km from 1537:00 to 1542:45 UTC, so this one is a convective overshooting system. Criterion (2), applied to DT 17 , DT 13 , and DT 37 (Figure 4a ), detected convective overshooting from 1538:00 to 1542:45 UTC. We found that the detected convective overshooting is in well agreement with the EDOP radar observations. In the region from 1542:45 to 1543:30 UTC, the convective cloud has cloud top below 14 km and above 10 km (Figure 4b ), so a deep convective cloud has been observed. In this region, criterion (2) does not indicate convective overshooting, but criterion (1) indicates a deep convective cloud (Figure 4a ). Applying criteria (1) and (2) to two other aircraft observation cases confirms that they work satisfactorily at nadir for deep convective clouds and convective overshooting, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Confirmation and Generalization of the Criteria by Simulations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cloud Model Data and Radiative Transfer Model", "text": "[17] The Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model [Tao and Simpson, 1993] is a dynamical cloud model, which uses nearby composite aircraft and radiosonde sounding as initial environmental field to simulate the oceanic tropical squall line that occurred on 22 February 1993 during the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE). The model domain is a 128 \u00c2 128 \u00c2 31 grid with a horizontal resolution of 1.5 km and vertical resolution varying from 0.2 to 1.0 km from bottom to top (at 20 km altitude). The GCE cloud model distinguishes five hydrometeor types: cloud liquid water, rainwater, cloud ice, snow, and graupel. Profiles of temperature and water vapor are also obtained along with profiles of the five hydrometeors. The GCE data at the model time of 360 minutes in the mature squall line are used for the simulations. Since our study is focused on deep convective clouds, only clouds with top height above 10 km are considered. We have classified these clouds into four types, cirrus cloud, deep convective cloud, deep convective cloud with overshooting, and other clouds mainly including stratiform clouds and weak convective clouds. The classification results are shown in Figure 5a .\n[18] The discrimination of cirrus clouds is based on the method of Mace et al. [2001] and Luo et al. [2003] . According to their method, to qualify a cloud layer as cirrus, the temperature at cloud top must be less than \u00c035\u00b0C and the temperature at the level of maximum total ice water content must be less than \u00c020\u00b0C. This method ensures that ice microphysical processes are dominant in the generation region near the cloud top, but excludes deep convective cloud layers that are capped by ice-phase clouds [Luo et al., 2003] . Deep convective clouds normally have a large frozen hydrometeor water content in the upper layers [e.g., Cifelli et al., 2002; Skofronick-Jackson et al., 2003] . From the EDOP radar observations (Figures 1c, 2c, 3b , and 4b), the radar reflectivities of the deep convective clouds at the altitude of 10 km are around 20 dBZ. This is in agreement well with the radar observations of two other mesoscale convective systems in the TRMM LBA [Cifelli et al., 2002] , where it has been shown that radar reflectivity at 10 km can be 20 dBZ for convective towers. This value at or above 14.5 km was also used to identify a convective tower [e.g., Geerts et al., 2000; Kelley and Stout, 2004] . Using the empirical relationship of Heymsfield and Palmer (1) and (2) using the simulated brightness temperatures. Cirrus clouds and other clouds in Figure 5b are the same as in Figure 5a .\n[1986] between radar reflectivity and cloud ice water content, 20 dBZ radar reflectivity corresponds to about 0.52 g m \u00c03 cloud ice water content. Therefore, the GCE cloud model data with cloud top height above 10 km and the layers above 10 km having total ice water content values above 0.5 g m \u00c03 are classified as deep convective clouds. The deep convective clouds with cloud top height above 14 km penetrating into the TTL are considered as convective overshooting [Alcala and Dessler, 2002] . The remaining components are classified into other clouds.\n[19] In this study, a microwave radiative transfer model (RTM) [Kummerow et al., 1996] is used to calculate the microwave upwelling brightness temperatures at the three water vapor channels around 183 GHz. The RTM considers the same five hydrometeor types as those obtained from the GCE cloud model data. All hydrometeors are treated as Mie spheres. The size distributions of rain, snow, and graupel are assumed to be exponentially distributed with\nwhere D is the diameter of particles, N 0 is the intercept parameter, and l is the slope of the distribution depending on N 0 , the density of hydrometeor, and the hydrometeor water content. N 0 values used in this study are 2.2 \u00c2 10 7 m \u00c04 for rain, 10 8 m \u00c04 for snow, and 4 \u00c2 10 6 m \u00c04 for graupel. The same N 0 values have been used in the TRMM version 6 of 2A12 algorithm by C. Kummerow [Jiang and Zipser, 2003; Jiang, 2004] . The densities of rain, snow, and graupel are 1.0, 0.1, and 0.6 g cm \u00c03 , respectively. Wang et al. [1997, 1998 ] suggested that cloud ice in the upper portion of convection should be taken into account at high frequencies of the AMSU-B channels. The distribution of cloud ice included in this version of the RTM is the one given by the fit to observed cloud ice distributions by Heymsfield and Platt [1984] . The particle size of cloud water is gamma distributed according to Liou [1992] . The densities of cloud ice and cloud liquid water are, respectively, 0.917 and 1.0 g cm \u00c03 ."}, {"section_title": "Identification of Deep Convective Clouds From Simulated Brightness Temperatures", "text": "[20] The profiles of hydrometeors, temperature, and water vapor are given as input for the RTM to simulate brightness temperatures at 183.3 \u00b1 1, 183.3 \u00b1 3, and 183.3 \u00b1 7 GHz. For precipitating clouds, the three water vapor channels are independent of the surface emissivity [Staelin and Chen, 2000; Bennartz and Bauer, 2003] , so the surface emissivities at these frequencies are set to a typical value of 0.7 to represent oceans [Muller et al., 1994] . In order to conform with the MIR measurements and AMSU-B observations, the effects of double side bands in the water vapor channels are taken into account by averaging the simulated brightness temperatures at the upper and lower sideband [Wang et al., 1997] , such as averaging the simulated brightness temperatures at 183.3 \u00c0 1 and 183.3 + 1 GHz for the simulated brightness temperature at 183.3 \u00b1 1 GHz, etc. Because our criteria are derived from the MIR measurements at nadir, only nadir simulated brightness temperatures are used in this section. Then, we apply criterion (1) for deep convective clouds and criterion (2) for convective overshooting (Figure 5b) . The locations and ranges of deep convective clouds and overshooting determined by criteria (1) and (2) match well with those directly determined from the GCE cloud model data. Only two very small deep convective clouds located at (x = 42, y = 75) and (x = 52, y = 75) are estimated by our criteria that are not shown in the GCE cloud model data."}, {"section_title": "Criteria for Different Viewing Angles", "text": "[21] Until now, our analyses are only focused on nadir observations and simulations. However, AMSU-B working in cross-track mode looks at the atmosphere with a wide variation of viewing angles. The centers of scanning beam of AMSU-B vary in the range of 0.62\u00b0-58.73\u00b0at a nominal satellite altitude of 850 km. Such variation of the viewing angle results in slant paths influencing the measurements. We modify criteria (1) and (2) by introducing threshold temperatures T D for the deep convective cloud criterion and T O for the convective overshooting criterion:\nDeep convective cloud:\nConvective overshooting:\n[22] In order to adjust the threshold T D for deep convective clouds to different viewing angles, we define for each viewing angle q an empirical quality measure,\nwhere A(q, T D ) is the total area of deep convective clouds in the GCE model field determined from the simulated brightness temperatures according to criterion (4) at viewing angle q and threshold T D , A(0, 0) is the same, but at viewing angle q = 0\u00b0and with T D = 0 K, which is identical to criterion ( The maximum values of C(q, T D ) are almost equal to 1 at viewing angles below 35\u00b0, still higher than 0.9 at viewing angles between 40\u00b0and 50\u00b0, and even over 0.7 at viewing angles of 55\u00b0and 60\u00b0. This indicates the high coincidence of criteria (4) for different viewing angles and (1) for nadir observations. A second degree polynomial fit for threshold value T D and all considered viewing angles q (unit in degree) yield\nwith a standard deviation of 0.18 K.\n[23] For convective overshooting, the empirical quality measure C(q, T O ) which has the similar definition as C(q, T D ) is also investigated (Figure 6 ). At all viewing angles, C(q, T O ) is generally stable when T O is below 15 K. C(q, T O ) quickly decreases when T O is above 15 K. At viewing angles below 30\u00b0, the maximum values of C(q, T O ) are between 0.95 and 0.8. However, at viewing angles above 35\u00b0, the highest C(q, T O ) values are below 0.6, even lower than 0.2 at the viewing angle 60\u00b0. Thus, T O = 0 K is used as the threshold value for criterion (5) to detect convective overshooting. But unlike criterion (4) for deep convective clouds, criterion (5) for convective overshooting works well only at satellite viewing angles below 30\u00b0."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity of Detection to Brightness Temperature Thresholds", "text": "[24] We investigate the sensitivity of the quality measure C (equation (6) Figure 7 shows that the quality measure C varies with the brightness temperature thresholds at nadir. This indicates how strongly a change in the temperature thresholds affects the estimation of deep convective clouds and convective overshooting. For deep convective clouds, when the quality measure C decreases to 0.8, the temperature threshold is about \u00c02.0 or 2.0 K. When the temperature threshold is set to \u00c05.0 or 5.0 K, the quality measure C is about 0.50. Thus, the estimation of deep convective clouds is strongly sensitive to the temperature thresholds. For convective overshooting, the quality mea- sure C is constantly equal to 1.0 when setting the temperature threshold below 6 K. When the temperature threshold varies from 6 to 16 K, the quality measure C changes from 1.0 to 0.8. So the estimation of convective overshooting is independent of the temperature threshold below 6 K. This also reveals that the order relation in criterion (5) is crucial for the estimation of convective overshooting."}, {"section_title": "Application to AMSU-B Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Identification of Cold Clouds Associated With Precipitation", "text": "[25] Initially, we use a method adapted from Greenwald and Christopher [2002] to identify the cold clouds associated with precipitation. Greenwald and Christopher [2002] found that the background brightness temperature at 183.3 \u00b1 1 GHz is remarkably stable from region to region with an overall mean and standard deviation of 241.9 \u00b1 2.1 K, and cold clouds associated with precipitation have an average brightness temperature depression of about 7 K. So if the overall mean value of background brightness temperature at 183.3 \u00b1 1 GHz is set as 242 K, the brightness temperature at 183.3 \u00b1 1 GHz below 235 K (=242 \u00c0 7 K) can be used as the criterion for identifying the cold clouds associated with precipitation. The threshold value of 235 K is also used by Staelin and Chen [2000] for the brightness temperature at 183.3 \u00b1 1 GHz in saturated atmospheres. They documented that hydrometeors in precipitating clouds lower the brightness temperatures at 183.3 \u00b1 1 GHz below those observed over saturated atmospheres (i.e., 235 K). Hence, if the brightness temperature at 183.3 \u00b1 1 GHz is below 235 K, we consider that the field of view of AMSU-B contains the cold clouds associated with precipitation. Once we have identified the cold clouds associated with precipitation, we detect deep convective clouds and convective overshooting by our criteria (4) "}, {"section_title": "Distributions of Deep Convective Clouds", "text": "[26] The distributions of mean deep convective cloud fractions for the four seasons are shown in Figure 8 . The monthly 1\u00b0\u00c2 1\u00b0TRMM 3B43 rainfall product [Huffman et al., 1997] estimated from TRMM, geosynchronous IR, and rain gauge data are averaged over the same three-month seasons. Rainfall exceeding 3 mm day \u00c01 is enclosed by red contour lines. In agreement with the results of Alcala and Dessler [2002] , the geographical distributions of deep convective clouds show a good correspondence with the TRMM 3B43 rainfall contour, qualitatively confirming our detection of deep convective clouds. The distributions of deep convective clouds and TRMM 3B43 rainfall have similar characteristics as those of the time-mean convection described by Hendon and Woodberry [1993] . These include the pronounced ITCZ across the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans, the pronounced South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), intense centers of convection over tropical Africa and tropical America, and the center of convection over the Indian Ocean.\n[27] The most prominent feature of the distributions of the deep convective clouds is the seasonal variability (Figure 8) . In MAM and DJF, the distributions of deep convective clouds are dominantly in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). In contrast, they are shifted to the Northern Hemisphere (NH) in JJA and SON. In general, the summer hemisphere has more convective activity than the winter hemisphere, such as the NH in JJA and the SH in DJF. The deep convective clouds migrate from the NH in JJA and SON to the SH in DJF and MAM. Similar seasonal shifting was also noted by e.g., Chen et al. [1996] , Gettelman et al. [2002] , Alcala and Dessler [2002] , and Jiang et al. [2004] . Chen et al. [1996] studied the multiscale variability of deep convection in relation to large-scale circulation in the warm-pool region during TOGA COARE. They documented that the dominant convective variability was associated with the seasonal cycle with a southward shift from the NH in October -November to the SH in January -February. The deep convective clouds in the pronounced narrow ITCZ have their local maximum fractions between 0\u00b0and 10\u00b0latitude [Chen et al., 1996] . In general, deep convective clouds seem to appear more frequently over oceans in the ITCZ and SPCZ. The SPCZ is more apparent in MAM and DJF than other two seasons, in agreement with the findings of Chen et al. [1996] .\n[28] Comparing with some other analyses using infrared measurements [Chen et al., 1996; Mapes and Houze, 1993; Machado et al., 2002] , our deep convective cloud fractions are smaller, the averaged deep convective cloud fraction is about 0.3% in the entire topics and about 1.0% in the ITCZ and SPCZ for the four seasons. Using \u00c038\u00b0C (cloud top height about 10 km) as the infrared temperature threshold, Chen et al. [1996] found that deep convective cloud fractions in the ITCZ and SPCZ are about 10-20%. The same infrared temperature threshold was also used by Mapes and Houze [1993] , but for moderately cold cloud. include thin high-top nonprecipitating cloud, deep high-top precipitating cloud, anvil with stratiform precipitating cloud, and deep convective precipitating cloud [Liu et al., 1995] . The deep convective cloud fraction derived with the cold infrared temperature threshold at \u00c058\u00b0C by Gettelman et al. [2002] has a similar range as that from Chen et al. [1996] . An even colder infrared temperature threshold of \u00c065\u00b0C (cloud top height about 15 km) was also used to identify tropical deep convective clouds [e.g., Mapes and Houze, 1993; Chen et al., 1996; Hall and Haar, 1999; Machado et al., 2002; Gettelman et al., 2002] . In general, cloud tops colder than \u00c065\u00b0C cover about 20% of the area with cloud tops colder than \u00c038\u00b0C [Mapes and Houze, 1993] . With the \u00c065\u00b0C infrared temperature threshold, Chen et al. [1996] found that the deep convective cloud fraction is below 6% in the ITCZ and SPCT. The same result was reported by Machado et al. [2002] in the TRMM-WETAMC/LBA. With a \u00c063\u00b0C infrared temperature threshold they obtained diurnal variations of the deep convective cloud fraction ranging from 0 to 6%. With this threshold, Gettelman et al. [2002] found a deep convective fraction of 5% in October 1991 in the region from 64\u00b0-77\u00b0E and 4\u00b0-7\u00b0N. With respect to the deep convective fractions derived by high infrared temperature thresholds (i.e., \u00c038\u00b0C), our derived deep convective fractions approach those derived by low infrared temperature threshold (i.e., \u00c065\u00b0C). Hall and Haar [1999] found that the deep convective clouds only covered about 2% of the total possible area in the west pacific for JJA and November to January. Our derived deep convective fractions in the west Pacific in JJA and DJF are generally close to this result (Figure 8 ).\n[29] There are two possible sources of uncertainty for the deep convective cloud fractions derived from the low infrared temperature threshold (i.e., \u00c065\u00b0C). One is an overestimation because high cirrus clouds are tightly connected with deep convective clouds fractions [Chou and Neelin, 1999] . Also the \u00c065\u00b0C cloud top temperature corresponds to the beginning level of convective overshooting (14 km) [Hall and Haar, 1999; Kelley and Stout, 2004] . Therefore, with this threshold, only convective overshooting can be detected whereas the deep convective clouds with top height below 14 km (cloud top temperature warmer than \u00c065\u00b0C) can not be detected. This is the second uncertainty that results in an underestimation of deep convective clouds. Liu et al. [1995] identified deep convective precipitating clouds in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean warm pool region (15\u00b0S-15\u00b0N, 130\u00b0E-180\u00b0E) for the period from November 1992 to February 1993. A \u00c040\u00b0C infrared temperature threshold was used to discriminate the high clouds with top height above 10 km. A microwave index derived from SSM/I brightness temperatures at 19 and 89 GHz was used to detect microwave scattering and emission from precipitating clouds. This approach considered both the cloud top and information on precipitation of deep convective clouds. Their results overcame the two uncertainties of the method for identifying deep convective clouds only by the choice of a low infrared temperature threshold. Their results showed that deep convective precipitating clouds account for 1.05% of the total cloudy pixels. In this region, the average total cloud fraction is about 76% [Hartmann et al., 2001] , so the deep convective cloud fraction in the region is about 0.8% (=1.05% \u00c2 76%) from the results of Liu et al. [1995] . Our averaged deep convective fraction in this region is about 0.78%, which is quite similar to the result of Liu et al. [1995] ."}, {"section_title": "Distributions of Convective Overshooting", "text": "[30] The distributions of convective overshooting, i.e., those deep convective clouds that penetrate into the TTL, grouped by same seasons as those for deep convective clouds, are shown in Figure 9 . The contour lines enclosing all sea surface temperatures (SST) greater than 28\u00b0C derived from the monthly mean NOAA optimum interpolation SST V2 data of NOAA Climate Diagnostics Center (CDC) are also shown. Because the criterion for detecting convective overshooting are only valid for viewing angles from 0\u00b0to 30\u00b0, only such observations have been used. In order to display the deep convective cloud fractions that give rise to overshooting, and the convective overshooting fractions, the convective overshooting fraction of deep convective clouds is weighted by the convective overshooting fraction of total number of samples. It is named weighted convective overshooting fraction.\n[31] The spatial pattern and seasonal variability of the distributions of the weighted convective overshooting fraction are very similar as those of the deep convective clouds. The apparent different feature of the distributions of convective overshooting is that the higher fractions obviously appear over land, not over ocean. This indicates that, although deep convective clouds generally have high fractions over ocean (Figure 8 ), those that penetrate into the TTL are more frequent over land (Figure 9 ). This feature is in agreement with the results of the TRMM PR [Nesbitt et al., 2000; Toracinta et al., 2002; Alcala and Dessler, 2002] , and observations obtained from aircraft radar [Heymsfield et al., 1996] .\n[32] Analyzing TRMM observations in two tropical continental (tropical Africa and South America) and tropical oceanic regions (the east Pacific and west Pacific) in August -September -October 1998 (ASO 1998), Nesbitt et al. [2000] and Toracinta et al. [2002] reported that tropical continental convective clouds often have larger magnitudes of PR reflectivity and smaller decrease in reflectivity with height than tropical oceanic convective clouds. Especially, Nesbitt et al. [2000] found that deep convective clouds seem to favor the western side of the South America and away from the Atlantic coast in ASO 1998. This feature is also apparent in our results in MAM and SON. On the other hand, the similar feature is also observed in South Africa in JJA and SON. Thus, these features are caused by other reasons besides the focusing mechanism for mesoscale cloud systems, which is due to the foothills of Andes Mountains indicated by Nesbitt et al. [2000] . They also pointed out that convection over Africa has the strongest and east Pacific has the weakest PR reflectivities. Using TRMM data in the west Pacific and east Pacific, similar regions as those used by Nesbitt et al. [2000] , Berg et al. [2002] also found that the east Pacific has shallower clouds than the west Pacific from December 1999 to February 2000. Our results confirm these findings (Figure 9 , DJF). However, from our results, we can state with even more confidence that deep convective clouds over tropical Africa have the highest frequency to penetrate into the TTL in MAM and JJA, but those over South America or Central America in SON and DJF. The region with the most frequent oceanic convective overshooting also changes with seasons, such as the SPCT in DJF and the ITCZ over the east Pacific in MAM.\n[33] The geographical distributions of the oceanic convective overshooting fractions show a general correspon- Figure 9 .

This is in agreement with the mechanism stated by Roca et al. [2002] that the convective clouds grow deeper and reach colder temperatures as the surface warms. However, in some regions, such as the ITCZ over the east Pacific in SON and DJF, it seems that the distributions of convective overshooting are generally broader than the regions contained within the 28\u00b0C SST conour lines. In some other regions over ocean, such as the SPCZ in SON, we found the opposite. This feature can probably be explained by the relationships between deep convection, SST, and surface wind convergence [Fu et al., 1990] . They suggested that deep convective cloud is enhanced in regions where either the SST is greater than 28\u00b0C in the absence of strong surface wind divergence, or the SST is less than 28\u00b0C, combined with strong surface wind convergence.\n[34] The averaged amount of convective overshooting is about 26% of total deep convective cloud. This ratio is in agreement with the ratio of cloud tops colder than \u00c065\u00b0C to the area with cloud tops colder than \u00c038\u00b0C (about 20%) [Mapes and Houze, 1993] . On the other hand, our result is much larger than that the value of about 5% found by Alcala and Dessler [2002] . They also noted that the amount is influenced by the sensitivity of the TRMM PR and increasing the reflectivity threshold from 12 to 17 dBZ would increase the amount by about a factor of two. Alcala and Dessler [2002] documented that their results can be considered as a lower limit. Based on this, it seems that our result as depicted in Figure 9 is close to real occurrence."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "[35] The AMSU-B water vapor channels have unique advantages, such as high sensitivity to frozen hydrometeors in precipitating clouds [e.g., Burns et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997; Bennartz and Bauer, 2003] , different sensitivities to vertical distributions of frozen hydrometeors [e.g., Burns et al., 1997; Bennartz and Bauer, 2003] , and negligible impact of the ground surface and liquid water cloud in the lower to middle troposphere [e.g., Muller et al., 1994; Wang et al., 1997; Greenwald and Christopher, 2002; Bennartz and Bauer, 2003] . We have derived methods to detect deep convective clouds and convective overshooting using the brightness temperature differences between the three water vapor channels centered at 183.3 GHz from aircraft observations and model simulations. The criterion for tropical deep convective clouds is DT 17 ! T D , DT 13 ! T D , and DT 37 ! T D . Model simulations determined T D , which increases with the viewing angle across the swath of AMSU-B. The criterion for convective overshooting is DT 17 ! DT 13 ! DT 37 > 0 K, but only for AMSU-B viewing angles below 30\u00b0.\n[36] The methods are applied to AMSU-B data from NOAA-15, -16 and -17 to obtain the distributions of deep convective clouds and convective overshooting in the tropics (30\u00b0S to 30\u00b0N) for four three-month seasons from Toracinta et al. [2002] , and Alcala and Dessler [2002] . It is also found that, deep convective clouds seem to favor the western side of the continents of South America and tropical Africa in some seasons. The matching and dismatching of the weighted convective overshooting fractions and the 28\u00b0C SST contour lines indicate that the enhancing mechanism of deep convective clouds is not only due to the warmer SST, but is also related to such factors as surface wind convergence [Fu et al., 1990] .\n[37] The averaged amount of the deep convective cloud fractions in the entire tropics is about 0.3%, and 26% of them can penetrate into the TTL as convective overshooting. Our deep convective cloud fractions are smaller than the results derived from infrared measurements. The difference between our deep convective cloud fractions and those derived from infrared measurements probably indicate that high cirrus clouds have large contributions on deep convective cloud fractions derived from infrared measurements [Chou and Neelin, 1999] . However, when restricted to the western equatorial Pacific Ocean warm pool region, our averaged deep convective cloud fraction of about 0.78% is in well agreement with the result of Liu et al. [1995] of about 0.8%.\n[38] Although the amount of deep convective clouds penetrating into the TTL in the entire tropics is small, it has important impact on the physical and chemical processes in the TTL and in the stratosphere [e.g., Lelieveld and Crutzen, 1994; Holton et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 1997; Sherwood and Dessler, 2001; Dessler, 2002; Gettelman et al., 2002; Andronache et al., 2002] . The AMSU-B and similar AMSU/HSB (Humidity Sounder for Brazil) sensors on board the platforms NOAA-15, -16, -17, and Aqua promise a high potential contributing to an improved understanding of the important role of deep convective clouds in the tropics by future work in two directions: First, all of the mentioned platforms carry also IR sensors allowing to derive similar parameters of the same time and space. A synergy potential of both sensor types is to be expected, but unexplored. Second, as the mentioned platforms can observe each point on earth about eight times per day [Chen and Staelin, 2003] , combining measurements of all these microwave and IR sensors provides a unique tool to observe the evolution of deep convective clouds in time and space. Both types of investigation will contribute to better understand the features of deep convective clouds and convective overshooting in the tropics, so as to assess the influence of deep coonvective clouds and convective overshooting on the physical and chemical processes in the TTL and stratosphere.\n[39] Acknowledgments.
