We know that people gravitate toward activities when they believe they are good at them and see themselves in certain positive roles. When we raise students to see themselves as readers, they will more likely pursue reading on their own. Smith and Wilhelm (2004) and Alvermann (2001) used the notion of reading identities. In other words, to create lifelong readers, individuals must see themselves as competent readers and understand that their reading identity must reach beyond the classroom.\nAdolescents are quick to judge things in school as related or unrelated to their lives. Often things associated with school literacy are not seen as relevant by adolescents. As a consequence, teens are more likely to reject school tasks and reading along with them. Our youths need to see literacy as personally relevant and having substance for their lives. When they see literacy as useful and fulfilling, they are more likely to identify themselves as readers and to choose to read (Hinchman, Alvermann, Boyd, Brozo, & Vacca, 2004; Wilhelm, 2001) . The Book Bistro strategy does not look like a typical school literacy task. By using a caf\u00e9 setting like those found outside of school, we hoped Book Bistro would mimic a real-life setting for books."}, {"section_title": "Independent reading is critical", "text": "Independent reading is an important aspect of any balanced literacy program (Fountas & Pinnell, 2001; McLaughlin, 2003) . Consistent opportunities for independent reading help build fluency in readers and help develop reader confidence toward increasingly sophisticated books (Clay, 1991; Fielding, Wilson, & Anderson, 1986; Taylor, Graves, & Van den Broek, 2000) . Encouraging reading in school becomes especially critical in middle grades and above because reports show students in these age groups read less on their own than their elementary peers (Goodman, 1996; Tunnell, Calder, & Phaup, 1991) . Independent reading can occur at home or in school, and the payoffs are equally powerful. Students who read at home averaged 25 points higher on the 1992 and 1994 National Assessment of Education Progress tests of reading achievement than those who did not (Goodman, 1996) . Brozo and Hargis (2003) reminded us that students need opportunities for sustained reading in order to grow in their skills and vocabulary. The less time they read, the less growth we observe. More time spent reading translates to increased achievement. Increased achievement in grade-point averages has been correlated to college students who read more for pleasure during summer breaks. College students read magazines most often, with novels-specifically mystery or horror novelstaking a strong second place (Gallik, 1999) ."}, {"section_title": "Book Bistro and independent reading", "text": "As we have hinted, Book Bistro is an independent reading strategy for encouraging students to read books on their own, bring books to class for a scheduled event, and linger over books in a caf\u00e9 atmosphere. It was built around the \"poetry caf\u00e9\" idea-a now-popular strategy where students meet to discuss and read poetry together. Poetry caf\u00e9 honors student choice, promotes the enjoyment of poetry read aloud, and has no other instructional agendas, allowing for aesthetic appreciation.\nBook Bistro uses fiction and nonfiction in the same relaxed atmosphere. Most teachers add ambience to the once-per-month event by bringing in tablecloths, candles, or centerpieces for the tables and arranging for light refreshments. Students arrive with a self-selected book they have recently read and are prepared to share it with a small group of students.\nIn most cases, teachers ask which books students will be sharing in order to arrange groups.\nEncouraging independent reading with ambience: The Book Bistro in middle and secondary school classes By putting students together with others whose books may have something in common, a teacher can help ensure each group has individuals who can enthuse one another. Other criteria for grouping students are always up to a teacher's discretion. For example, teachers will typically make certain the mix of individuals will result in each group having someone who will help carry a discussion. Sometimes teachers might want to rearrange their groups in order to expose students to different authors or genres.\nFor accountability, the teacher provides each student with a three-part form, like a trifold brochure; the middle of the form is filled in by the student about the book they are presentingincluding the bibliographic information and other key details. The other two parts of the form are identical to each other and are used in peer evaluation. Each student fills out the side panels of his or her form for the student sitting to the left and for the student to the right. In this way, each reader assesses two other students. Then, these forms are separated into three parts and collected for inclusion in each student's independent reading file, creating a lasting reading record. Teachers using this strategy believed that through the peer evaluation sheets, they could be fairly certain that various students read conscientiously and were well prepared for the Book Bistro event."}, {"section_title": "Theory into practice", "text": "Book Bistro implements the best of what our field knows about encouraging independent reading. First, Book Bistro uses self-selected books that students enjoy reading. Student choice is a critical factor in encouraging student motivation to read (Allen, 2000; Allington, 2002; Conniff, 1993; Fountas & Pinnell, 2001; Gambrell, Codling, & Palmer, 1996; Gambrell & Marinak, 1997; Schooley, 1994; Shapiro & White, 1991; Thames & Reeves, 1994) . Students need to be able to choose what they read at least some of the time, and especially until they are firmly and unshakably hooked on reading. In order for us to achieve our literacy-educator goals, students must fall in love with the stuff of books. This happens when students discover books they care about and find themselves in, books that are in harmony with their interests.\nSecond, Book Bistro capitalizes on using student discussion to encourage reading. Researchers know that student talk is a primary way that students become motivated to read (Adler, Rougle, Kaiser, & Caughlan, 2004; Allington, 2002; Au, Carroll, & Scheu, 1997; Conniff, 1993; Gambrell & Almasi, 1996; Gambrell et al., 1996; Kasten, Kristo, & McClure, 2005; Manning & Manning, 1984) . As students share and discuss books, they tend to become interested in what peers have read.\nDiscussion should include many voices and be a true interaction among peers. Someone sharing a book he or she recently enjoyed communicates reading enthusiasm, which is contagious. Discussion among peers can change student perceptions of a book, causing students to believe it is easier to read or to consider a particular title or new genre. Many adults can relate to this notion because they have found books they read and enjoyed from the comments and recommendations of friends. Studies of the characteristics of good readers show that proficient readers talk about favorite books with others and choose books recommended by friends (Conniff, 1993; Smith & Connolly, 2002) .\nBook Bistro does not look like typical school literacy strategies that adolescent readers are known to reject. Because it is more closely aligned with what adult readers often do-tell their friends about the books they have been reading-we believe that adolescents are less likely to see this strategy as irrelevant to their lives. Table 1 summarizes the alignment between research and Book Bistro as a strategy."}, {"section_title": "Action research and field testing", "text": "In order to explore this idea in the field, Lori designed an action research study using a ninth-grade Encouraging independent reading with ambience: The Book Bistro in middle and secondary school classes classroom. At the same time, Kim implemented and studied Book Bistro in her seventh-grade classroom. We will summarize each inquiry."}, {"section_title": "Lori's action research", "text": "Ms. Ricciardi is a ninth-grade language arts teacher in a suburban school in northeastern Ohio in the United States. She already employs good independent reading practices in her classroom through reading and writing workshops (Atwell, 1987) . When I approached Ms. Ricciardi about trying out the Book Bistro, she jumped at the chance. Although she was pleased with the reading workshop, she believed that her students were isolated from one another in their independent reading.\nThe 62 students who participated in the action research study were in four different English classes. All students in the study were Caucasian except for one Asian American. The homogeneous ethnicity of the students reflects the school where the research took place.\nWe worked together to make the Book Bistro fit into her classroom for the first trial run. Ms. Ricciardi was concerned about a few of her students who struggled with reading.

(Alvermann & Hagood, 2000; Hinchman et al., 2004; Smith & Wilhelm, 2004) .\nthese students, we tailored solutions to individual needs. For example, one student worried about reading a book in which she was interested in the prescribed time. The librarian helped us find the book on tape so the student could follow along and finish with the rest of the students. Another student expressed concern to the teacher that there were inadequate choices of books at his reading level. Having appropriate resources is an essential component of successful independent reading (Allington, 2002) . Again, the librarian helped us out by finding high-interest, low-readability books to accommodate him and other students.\nData for the study were collected in several different ways. A survey of 24 practicing teachers was taken to discover current independent reading programs and practices in their schools. Interviews were conducted with Ms. Ricciardi three times in order to explore her thoughts on the Book Bistro process. These interviews took place before the strategy was implemented, immediately after the first Book Bistro event, and one week after the first Book Bistro event. Two other surveys were administered to the students in Ms. Ricciardi's classes: one prior to the Book Bistro to inquire into their school-related independent reading habits, and one after the Book Bistro to serve as an evaluation of the process. Finally, class focus-group interviews (four) took place after each Book Bistro to discover students' thoughts and reactions to the strategy, which were videotaped. Table 2 presents sample questions used in the surveys of students and teachers.\nThe results of this action research study were encouraging at all levels. Ms. Ricciardi expressed her enjoyment of the activity as follows:\nI loved watching the students who were so intent in their conversations about their books. Some of these kids have probably never had a real conversation with someone their age about something they read, and there they were, deep in discussion. I think students really put a lot of effort into preparing for this day, which is why they were able to have such good conversations. Their evaluations of each other seemed very thoughtful and complete.\nStudents expressed positive views of the Book Bistro in both the written evaluations and the whole-group interviews. Their comments varied. Some expressed interest in books they had just heard about, saying, \"I think I found two books I want to read next!\" Others compared the Book Bistro to conventional methods of assessing independent reading. One student declared, \"Who wouldn't rather eat good food and talk about good books than write a boring report that no one really cares about?\"\nThe student pre-and post-Book Bistro surveys are shown in Table 3 . It is interesting to note that students were overwhelmingly negative about independent reading before participating in the Book Bistro. However, the surveys of practicing teachers showed that these teachers believed their students enjoyed independent reading in the classroom. Teachers did not know their students' feelings about independent reading as they believed they did.\nTo me, the best evidence that Book Bistro is a worthwhile activity came through the teacher's end-of-the-year evaluations. She reported that 95% of her students had commented on how much they liked the Book Bistro. Ms. Ricciardi is continuing to use the strategy in her classroom and reports the same positive results with her new group of students."}, {"section_title": "Kim's field test", "text": "Kim's class was a block of honors reading and language arts in grade 7.

On the first day, students were asked to bring in the book that they had finished reading for the Book Bistro. An index card was completed by each student giving the book title, author, genre, and a two-sentence plot summary. On the second day, the teacher organized the index cards based on genre or plot to place the students into their groups for the Book Bistro event.

To begin, each student answered two questions from a menu of six open-ended questions about the book. These questions included the following: After these questions were answered, students were divided into groups. The small groups gathered around the room in comfortable arrangements, and soft music was played on an audio cassette player by the teacher. When students began their book talks, they were comfortable with the strategy because the teacher and librarian had modeled it throughout the year.

She found that students were on task and focused for the hour. Students were smiling and laughing during their discussions-a welcome change from the tears and frustration she had seen and heard relating to the computerized system. Students voiced many positive comments about Book Bistro after the event. They enjoyed its casual atmosphere, the books they got to hear about that they otherwise would not have known, and the enjoyable nature of the activity. For the next time, students suggested mixing up genres in the groups so they could hear about other kinds of books and have more time for discussions. After the Book Bistro event, Kim found the peer evaluations were complete and constructive for her grading purposes.\nEvaluation. Kim is required by her school to have a numerical grade for independent reading. She found she could assign points to the index cards students had prepared, to the peer evaluation forms, and to the overall individual participation. Using these components for several points each, Kim computed an evaluation for each student. Overall, student evaluations were strong because students were motivated to participate. Teachers can construct a rubric to evaluate the process in a number of ways, depending on instructional goals."}, {"section_title": "Promising feedback", "text": "Since we initiated Book Bistro in grades 7 and 9, we have had teacher friends who implemented Book Bistro in grades 2, 4, and 11. These teachers reported the same success and student enthusiasm found in Lori's and Kim's studies.\nWhile elementary students may need somewhat more preparation to be ready for Book Bistro-at least the first time-we predict this strategy can work well at all levels of K-12 education. Our younger primary students, for example, may be able to share in a Bistro format about books read to them. And a grouping of younger classes with somewhat older (cross-age) ones could, potentially, be very motivating and beneficial for both parties."}, {"section_title": "Positive attitudes build lifelong readers", "text": "So far, these ventures with Book Bistro have been met with strong, positive student response. We know that the components of Book Bistro closely align with research about encouraging independent reading. We believe these strong, enthusiastic responses are likely to result in students' enjoying their independent reading and finding things they genuinely want to read.\nLong-term research will be required to see if regularly held Book Bistros will affect more than just attitudes. However, because we know that positive attitudes are a requisite foundation for lifelong reading, we are committed to continuing this inquiry. We believe this simple strategy can easily become a regular part of many classrooms and schools and enhance the vitally important independent reading portion of the literacy curriculum."}]
