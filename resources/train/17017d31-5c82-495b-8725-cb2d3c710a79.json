Although amyloid-\u03b2 protein is the core pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease, biomarkers of neuronal degeneration are the only ones believed to provide satisfactory predictions of clinical progression within short time frames. Here, we propose a machine learning based probabilistic method designed to assess the progression to dementia within 24 months, based on the regional information from a single amyloid Positron Emission Tomography scan. Importantly, the proposed method was designed to overcome the inherent adverse imbalance proportions between stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment individuals within a short observation period. The novel algorithm obtained an accuracy of 84%, and an under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 outperforming existing algorithms using the same biomarker measures and previous studies using multiple biomarker modalities. With its high accuracy, this algorithm has immediate applications for population enrichment in clinical trials designed to test disease modifying-therapies aiming to mitigate the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia."}, {"section_title": "M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "\n\n\nagainst a random predictor. The random predictor was created by training each of the algorithms (RUSRF, SVM, regularized logistic regression, and Random Forest) with a randomly permuted set of features derived from the original training set. By doing this, the relationship between the features and the classes are completely disrupted, and the predictor is trained to learn a random pattern. A statistically significant difference from a random predictor was only observed in the RUSRF predictor at p < 0.01, indicating that the novel algorithm was able to learn the classification patterns with a significant difference to a randomly trained classifier. Both regularized logistic regression algorithms showed differences at p < 0.1, indicating a trend. This may be due to the limited number of samples used in the testing set and the skewed proportions of sMCI and pMCI individuals. However, neither the Random Forest predictor nor the SVM predictor showed a significant difference from a random predictor, indicating their failure to learn the prediction relationships from the training set.\nMcNemar's \u07ef \u0b36 test and paired t-test were used to compare the performance of the RUSRF algorithm with other prediction algorithms. The AUC score can be considered a single metric for classifier performance when dealing with highly unequal sample sizes (Eskildsen et al., 2013) . The RUSRF algorithm achieved the highest AUC score and was significantly different to both SVM and L2 logistic regression at p < 0.0025 and to Random Forest at p < 0.0125. Although the AUC of RUSRF was nominally higher than the AUC of L1 logistic regression, it was not significantly different. However, the standard deviation of the AUC in L1 logistic regression was considerably greater than that of RUSRF. This indicates that the performance of the L1 logistic regression is more sensitive to the noise presented in the input features (Frome et al., 2007; Fu et al., 2006) , which can lead to inconsistent results in a clinical setting when used in early diagnosis. We also used the F1 score to compare the predictor performance as it considers both the precision and recall to construct the metric. The RUSRF predictor achieved the highest F1 score and was significantly different from SVM at p < 0.0025 and from L2 logistic regression at p < 0.0125. The F1 score of RUSRF was nominally higher compared to both L1 logistic regression and Random Forest but was not significant. However, in the case of Random Forest, this can be due to the high precision resulting from a high specificity even with a lower sensitivity value. It is important to mention that the F1 score can be influenced by skewed class proportions (Jeni et al., 2013 ) and needs to be considered when used as a performance measure. Both AUC and F1 scores were compared using paired t-tests with Bonferroni adjusted thresholds for inference.\nComparing the sensitivity and specificity between RUSRF and the other predictors was performed using the McNemar's \u07ef \u0b36 test. The sensitivity of the RUSRF predictor was significantly higher only when compared to the SVM predictor. This can be greatly due to the low number of pMCI individuals (n=13) in the test set, as the statistic is calculated considering only the pMCI individuals. Furthermore, both L1 and L2 logistic regression predictors were nominally higher than the sensitivity of RUSRF. However, given the number of pMCI individuals, misclassification of even one individual can cause the sensitivity metric to fluctuate substantially. Although the specificity of both the SVM and the Random Forest predictors were M A N U S C R I P T\nIt is important to mention several limitations of the present study. Any Alzheimer's disease study involving in-vivo data suffers from the inherent uncertainty of the diagnosis (Eskildsen et al., 2013) . This is because the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can only be confirmed with autopsy data. Therefore, any clinical diagnosis will always be \"probable Alzheimer's disease\". It is estimated that around 10% of this \"probable Alzheimer's disease\" diagnosis can be mislabeled \"Lewy Body disease\" or \"Frontotemporal dementia\" (Ranginwala et al., 2008) . Thus, the patterns learnt by the predictor might not be specific to Alzheimer's disease; however, this has been partially addressed by using an Alzheimer's disease specific biomarker such as A\u03b2 PET compared to a general neurodegenerative biomarker such as MRI or glucose metabolism.\nIt is important to emphasize that the population included in this analysis represents a select group of amnestic MCI individuals motivated to participate in a dementia study, as such, for reasons related to the study inclusion criteria these individuals may not represent the general MCI population. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to replicate our findings in a populationbased cohort. Furthermore, the predictor presented here is biased to the [ 18 F]Florbetapir PET acquisition protocol followed by ADNI, as the training and testing was done using only the data acquired from the ADNI database. Hence, clinical implementations of the present study will still require additional reliability assessments by training the predictor using multiple acquisition protocols to increase the robustness of the prediction. Similarly, the feature extraction step included identifying brain regions with a scaled odds ratio above 1.5, based on the expert opinion. The rationale behind this step was to select the anatomically significant brain regions with an increase of odds for developing Alzheimer's disease of 50% for each 1 standard deviation increase of SUVR. However, this step can add bias towards the subjective opinion of the expert and can be avoided by selecting brain regions based on the opinion of multiple experts or by using an automated cluster based technique. Furthermore, due to the computational cost of performing multiple voxel-wise logistic regression analyses, the feature selection technique employed a single voxel-wise logistic regression analysis including all the subjects (excluding the ones used as the final test dataset). However, the stability of the identified regions can be further increased by employing an under-sampling technique in identifying the features.\nIn conclusion, we present a novel algorithm to predict the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia within MCI individuals based on their A\u03b2 PET measurements. The predictor presented here achieved a high rate of accuracy with an AUC of 0.906 for an independent test set. The novel algorithm overcomes the inherent imbalance of proportions between stable and progressive MCI seen in a population of MCI individuals, making it ideally suited for a clinical environment as an early diagnostic tool. Demonstration of such a tool using the data presented in the current article can be found at http://predictalz.tnlmcgill.ca/PredictAlz_Amy.

It is well understood that Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology follows a gradual course with pathologies developing over decades prior to symptom onset (Braak and Braak, 1991; Mosconi et al., 2007) . Thus, there is an increased interest to advance the disease modifying clinical trials to the predementia stages of Alzheimer's disease given the better chances of obtaining tangible disease modifying effects. This has been encouraged by the identification of biomarkers to detect the pathological signatures at the early stages of the disease (Buerger et al., 2006; Fagan et al., 2006; McEvoy and Brewer, 2010; Morris et al., 2009) . However, given the high prevalence of cognitively normal elderly individuals carrying the Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, accurately identifying individuals who are in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease has been a significant challenge. Thus, the development of effective clinical trials has been severely hampered by not being able to recruit individuals who have higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease (Holland et al., 2012) within a time period acceptable to conduct a study.\nIdentification of effective biomarkers signatures to determine the progression of dementia has been a significant challenge to accurately predict the short-term clinical progression. It is believed that the biomarkers of neurodegeneration such as glucose metabolism and brain atrophy would be the most effective, as the other pathological markers such as brain amyloid-\u03b2 deposition and formation of hyper-phosphorylated tau tangles occur years or decades prior to the symptom onset (Clifford R. Jack et al., 2013) . However, numerous studies based on neurodegenerative biomarkers have indicated a decrease in ability to predict the clinical progression when the observation time is more than 18 months. Given that the accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brain is a hallmark characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-based biomarkers can be assumed to provide a better sensitivity to Alzheimer's disease pathology over a longer observation period (Trzepacz et al., 2014) .\nStudies conducted to evaluate the utility of amyloid biomarkers have used the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 measurements due to the relatively higher availability compared to amyloid PET biomarkers. These studies have often combined other CSF measurements such as tau and p-tau concentrations and MRI biomarkers (Apostolova et al., 2014; Davatzikos et al., 2011; Hall et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2012; Young et al., 2012) to accommodate for the limited dimensionality offered by the CSF measurements. However, the possibility to regionally assess Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and the increased availability of amyloid PET images in large-scale aging studies have enabled the evaluation of this imaging biomarker as a diagnostic tool.\nAs the earliest detectable clinical stage of the trajectory towards dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) provides an attractive point of entry to disease modifying interventions (Markesbery, 2010) . However, not all MCI individuals carry Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and progress to Alzheimer's disease in an optimal time frame for clinical trial. Thus, identification of biomarker signatures of MCI individuals on the verge of progression to M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "dementia and predicting the likelihood of conversion, has immediate application in disease modifying clinical trials by including those individuals with high likelihood to progress. This will increase the statistical power of the clinical trial by reducing false positives and would directly impact the associated costs. Furthermore, these information, would also provide important prognostic information for the patients and their families to plan and manage treatment and care (Gelosa and Brooks, 2012) .\nThe prediction of the clinical progression to dementia from MCI phase constitutes a challenge due to the considerably lower number of progressive MCI (pMCI) individuals compared to the stable MCI (sMCI) individuals, invariably creating imbalanced classes (pMCI, sMCI). In a classification study, if the number of samples from a class (sMCI) greatly outnumbers the other classes (pMCI), the classifier tends to favor the overrepresented majority class (sMCI) by ignoring incorrect prediction in the minority class (pMCI). This constitutes a challenge known as the \"class imbalance problem\" and leads to decreased sensitivity of the prediction, which has been currently overlooked in Alzheimer's disease research. While there are a number of techniques developed to address this challenge, such as class weight adjusting, over sampling the minority class and under sampling the majority class (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002) , the latter is identified to perform the best (Seiffert et al., 2010 (Seiffert et al., , 2008 . Random Under Sampling (RUS) is a method of under sampling, which will train each of its base learners with the full minority class and a randomly under sampled majority class. By doing this, each base learner is trained with a balanced set of samples from both pMCI and sMCI classes, removing the bias towards any particular class.\nAmyloid PET images used in the study are [\n18 F]Florbetapir PET scans acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The study cohort presented a pMCI rate of 15.75%, similar to the rates presented by other cohort studies and community studies (Mitchell and Shiri-Feshki, 2009 ). This presents the aforementioned class imbalanced challenge. Current study utilizes RUS, to overcome this challenge. The novel prediction algorithm is presented as Random Under Sampled Random Forest (RUSRF) and is used to evaluate the utility of amyloid PET as a diagnostic tool.\nThe present study aims to evaluate the utility of amyloid PET imaging as an early detection tool for individuals in the Alzheimer's disease pathway. Specifically, we aim to predict if an MCI individual will progress to Alzheimer's disease or remain MCI within a time period of 24 months based on the amyloid PET measurements at baseline. We further believe that the proposed technique can be used to complement the multibiomarker enrichment strategies for clinical trials (Wolz et al., 2016) .\nThis novel technique capitalizes on an optimized feature extraction method for amyloid PET, and a method for addressing the class imbalance problem in the context of a random forest machine learning classifier (Breiman, 2001) . We further compare the performance of RUSRF with other widely used prediction algorithms such as the SVM, L1 and L2 regularized logistic regression, and Random Forest. We believe that the novel RUSRF algorithm will outperform these widely-M A N U S C R I P T\nused prediction algorithms and that the amyloid PET biomarker might serve as an important early diagnostic tool in both research and clinical environments. (Petersen, 2003) .\nbetween the class labels and input features. Furthermore, a paired t-test was performed to compare AUC and F1 scores of the RUSRF predictor against the other four predictors, while McNemar's \u07ef \u0b36 test was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity. However, the overall accuracy of each predictor was not used as a measure of comparison because it can misinterpret the performance when the sample has imbalanced class probabilities. The resulting p values were Bonferroni adjusted to correct for multiple comparisons. The classification analysis was carried out in python programming language using the scikit-learn library, and the statistical analysis was carried out using the R programming language.\nIn a binary classification, Random Forest algorithm performs implicit feature selection based on the parameter called \"Gini importance\" (Breiman, 2001) , which is calculated as the accumulated decrease in \"Gini impurity \u202b\")\u0750(\u0745\u202c . This is defined as;\nis the fraction of the \u074a samples from class \u0747 = \u123c0, 1\u123d out of the total n samples at a node \u202b\u0750\u202c in a binary decision tree in Random Forest. The decrease in Gini impurity results from splitting the node by a threshold \u07ec \u0c08 on variable \u07d9, and sending the samples to two sub nodes \u202b\u0750\u202c and \u202b\u0750\u202c is\nwhere \u202b\u202c = and \u202b\u202c = , the relative sample fractions at nodes \u202b\u0750\u202c and \u202b\u0750\u202c . The optimum split is then determined, which results in the maximum decrease in Gini impurity at node \u202b.\u0750\u202c The accumulation of these decreases in Gini impurity for all nodes \u202b\u0750\u202c in all trees \u0736 in the Forest, is known as the Gini importance \u202b\u072b(\u202c \u0bc0 ) for variable \u07d9.\nThis measure indicates how often a variable is used for a split and how large its discriminative power is in the classification study. In the RUSRF algorithm, the mean of this measure across all the Random Forests, \u202b,\u072d\u202c is used as the measure of feature importance for variable \u07d9.\nSteps followed in the present study are summarized in Figure 1 .\nhigher than RUSRF, their sensitivities were not acceptable for any clinical or research use. Among the RUSRF and logistic regression predictors, RUSRF achieved the highest specificity and was significantly different from L2 logistic regression at p < 0.0125 and from L1 logistic regression at p < 0.025. Although the SVM classifier is used widely in many applications, our analysis indicated that, at its current configuration with a radial basis kernel, it produced a very low sensitivity and is not suitable in identifying progressive MCI individuals. However, the SVM classifier can be trained with a number of kernel functions such as the polynomial kernel functions, sigmoid kernel functions, and linear kernel functions, and this would lead to increased sensitivity and overall classification performance.\nDirect comparisons with other similar studies conducted to assess the predictive capability of amyloid imaging based biomarkers cannot be performed due to a number of reasons (see summarized comparison in Table 3 ). Most studies (Br\u00fcck et al., 2013; Hatashita and Yamasaki, 2013; Clifford R Jack et al., 2010; Wolk et al., 2009) (Teipel et al., 2015) and (Schreiber et al., 2015) have used [\n18 F]Florbetapir PET, however, (Teipel et al., 2015) have used both [ 18 F]FDG PET and MRI biomarkers in combination with amyloid PET as the input features for the predictor. Furthermore, studies with similar observation periods (Br\u00fcck et al., 2013; Ewers et al., 2012; Clifford R Jack et al., 2010; Waragai et al., 2009 ) have reported much higher progression rates. These increased rates may be due to the low number of subjects included (Waragai et al., 2009 ) by specialized memory clinics (Br\u00fcck et al., 2013) and the lower baseline Mini-Mental State Examination scores reported (Br\u00fcck et al., 2013; Ewers et al., 2012; Clifford R Jack et al., 2010; Waragai et al., 2009) .\nNevertheless, these studies except for (Teipel et al., 2015) have not used any model evaluation technique, such as cross validation, to assess how their models will generalize to an independent data set, which is of paramount importance to be successfully used as an early diagnosis tool in a clinical environment. We obtained a higher overall accuracy, AUC, and sensitivity compared to the accuracy reported by (Teipel et al., 2015) . The low sensitivity values reported in (Teipel et al., 2015) may be due the lower proportion of pMCI individuals included in the study, leading to a bias towards the majority sMCI group. The novel algorithm introduced in this study compensates for this 'imbalanced class problem' by using data sampling techniques as mentioned earlier.\nCompared to several previous studies using not only A\u03b2 PET based biomarkers, the algorithm introduced here seems promising with a recorded average AUC of 0.906 for an independent test set (accuracy: 0.84, sensitivity: 0.708, specificity: 0.865). Often, studies use performance measures (AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) based only on cross validation; however, this makes the prediction model biased towards the data set used, as all the samples are used for training at some point in the analysis. The present study uses a completely independent testing set to evaluate the true generalization capability of the model presented. The independent testing M A N U S C R I P T\nset is not used in the feature extraction step or the model training steps. By evaluating the performance of the prediction model based on a completely independent testing set, we can retrieve the true expected performance of the model when used in a clinical environment as an early diagnostic tool. The generalization capability can be further improved by training the model on data acquired from multiple cohorts, as using a test set from the same cohort can add bias to the prediction model.\nThe most important characteristic of the present study is its ability to overcome the inherent imbalance of proportion between pMCI and sMCI individuals and performing comparably or even better than the previous studies. Studies conducted by Cho et al., 2012; Davatzikos et al., 2011; Misra et al., 2009; Teipel et al., 2015 used cohorts with imbalanced proportions similar to the present study to train their prediction models, which resulted in lower sensitivity scores and lower AUC values.\nOne other important outcome from the present study is the relative predictive capability of the investigated brain regions (Figure 3b ) based on A\u03b2 retention. Our study indicated that the four brain regions, the Temporal Occipital Junction, Mid Temporal Cortex, Mid Frontal Cortex and Precuneus to have the highest predictive ability. Other studies conducted with A\u03b2 PET based biomarkers also identified similar regions to have the highest difference between individuals progressing to Alzheimer's disease and sMCI individuals (Br\u00fcck et al., 2013; Koivunen et al., 2011; Teipel et al., 2015) . These regions are known to show A\u03b2 deposition in relatively later stages of the course of Alzheimer's disease. This agrees with the idea that the regions with early deposition of A\u03b2 such as the posterior cingulate cortex, already reaches a plateau in the MCI stage, adding little information to discriminate individuals progressing to Alzheimer's disease, whereas regions with later build-up are more relevant in discriminating stable and progressing MCI individuals. Interestingly, the feature selection technique identified sub-cortical structures such as the Putamen and the Nucleus Accumbens to be used as features for classification. It is worth to emphasize, that patients with AD, have shown increased deposition of A\u03b2 in these subcortical brain regions occurring later in the disease spectrum (Ishibashi et al., 2014) . Furthermore, these regions receive projections from different prefrontal sub-regions, mainly from the medial prefrontal cortex (Ferry et al., 2000; Ong\u00fcr and Price, 2000) , and their associations to with behavioral characteristics and cognitive performance are well known (de Jong et al., 2012; Diekhof et al., 2012) . When evaluating the brain A\u03b2 deposition, the consensus of the field of Alzheimer's disease is to use the average deposition from the brain regions characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. However, this method averages the A\u03b2 deposition in brain regions which accumulate in different stages of Alzheimer's disease, and will result in a sub optimal discriminating capability compared to the method introduced in the article (see Supplementary material for results of RUSRF performance with average brain A\u03b2 deposition).\nIdentifying the relative importance of A\u03b2 deposition in various brain regions provides many benefits to research studies of anti-amyloid agents to evaluate the treatment's effect in preventing or slowing the progression to Alzheimer's disease."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and data acquisition", "text": "The subjects were categorized into 2 groups, stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI), based on the diagnosis on their follow-up visit.

The novel algorithm uses sampling techniques to train multiple Random Forest predictors to calculate the final prediction. The primary goal of the present application is to predict progression to Alzheimer's disease, however, the population contains only 15.71% pMCI individuals. This constitutes a class imbalance problem with a majority sMCI class. In this case, the predictors tend to be biased to predict the majority class (sMCI) and to ignore the misclassification in the minority class (pMCI) (Yen and Lee, 2009 ). To overcome this, the novel algorithm utilizes a data sampling technique named \"random under-sampling\", where the majority class is randomly sampled to create a pseudo training set with equal proportions in all the classes. This technique is closely related to the RUSBoost technique (Seiffert et al., 2008) , however, the base classifier used in the present study is Random Forest, and the iterative boosting method is not employed as the Random Forest classifier uses feature bagging to achieve independence and randomness.\nIn summary, RUSRF algorithm will train \u202b\u072d\u202c number of Random Forest predictors with individual pseudo training sets with equal class distributions. The number of minority class samples (\u0730 \u0c08 )\nin a pseudo training set is equal to the total number of minority class samples in the original training set.

To estimate the best combination of these two parameters, we employed a nested cross validation technique (Huttunen et al., 2012; Moradi et al., 2015) . The outer cross validation step divided the training set (\u0735 \u0bcd ) in to 10 subsets (\u0735 \u0bcd ; \u0745 = 1 \u2026 10) preserving the class ratios of the original population (stratified cross validation).

The best set of parameters was selected based on the AUC from the internal 10-fold cross validation. The performance of the predictor was then evaluated based on the AUC, accuracy (number of correct classifications divided by the total number of samples (in \u0735 \u0bcd\u0be6\u0be7 )), F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall), sensitivity (number of correctly classified pMCI subjects divided by the total pMCI subjects), and specificity (number of correctly classified sMCI subjects divided by the total sMCI subjects) for the original test set (\u0735 \u0bcd\u0be6\u0be7 ).

The RUSRF specificity was different from L2 logistic regression at p<0.0125 and from SVM, L1 logistic regression, and Random Forest at p<0.025. The p value thresholds used here for statistical significance were Bonferroni adjusted for multiple comparisons.\nAccording to McNemar's \u07ef \u0b36 test (Table 3) , only the RUSRF predictor showed a statistically significant difference with the random predictor at p<0.01. Both regularized logistic regression predictors were significantly different at p<0.1. However, the Random Forest predictor and the SVM predictor were not significantly different from the random predictor. The \u07ef \u0b36 statistic for the SVM predictor cannot be calculated as the output from the predictions from both SVM and the random predictor were identical. The SVM prediction for each test case, which was calculated as the mean of the prediction from all 10 iterations was 0. This, resulted in an exaggerated accuracy of 84.15% (all true 0 cases correctly predicted -specificity of 100%). Figure 3a shows the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the four predictors with their respective AUC values. The ROC curve for the novel RUSRF predictor dominated the other curves with an area of 0.91, followed by the L1 logistic predictor, Random Forest predictor, and the L2 logistic predictor. The AUC < 0.5 for the SVM predictor (Table 2) indicated that the SVM predictor is a predictor for the stable MCI class but not for the progressive MCI class.\nThe relative feature importance from the novel RUSRF predictor is shown in Figure 3b . The most important features indicated the brain regions with the highest contribution to predict the M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We have presented a novel algorithm for predicting the progression from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia using baseline amyloid PET measurements. The novel RUSRF algorithm uses the Random Forest classifier as its base classifier along with advanced data sampling techniques to overcome inherent problems of the data sample to improve the prediction accuracy. This algorithm was shown to provide advantages as demonstrated by higher AUC and F1 score when compared to the other widely used prediction algorithms such as SVM, regularized logistic regression, and Random Forest. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggested, that this algorithm could perform comparably to the methods employed using MRI, FDG PET, CSF biomarkers and their combinations (Table 3) . It is important to emphasize that the evaluation of the prediction algorithms, employed a completely independent testing sample, which was never used in training or feature selection steps. This method of evaluation resembles expected outcomes in an application (clinical and research) environment, which can be considered encouraging to be used for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.\nUsing the RUSRF algorithm, we obtained AUC and F1 scores of 0.906 (0.009) and 0.583 (0.044), respectively, for the independent testing set. Generally, the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia of a MCI population within 24 months lies around 16.2% (Mitchell and ShiriFeshki, 2009 ). Thus, in a prediction study, the pMCI class (the subset of individuals progressing to Alzheimer's disease) is expected to lie close to the same proportion, creating imbalanced classes. If the methods to overcome this challenge is not involved, the prediction algorithm will ignore the errors in the minority class (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002) . This can result in exaggerated accuracies, as the predictor can be biased towards the majority class, but it can also result in lower sensitivity for the minority class. In the present study, pMCI individuals were only 15.75% of the sample. Therefore, comparing the prediction accuracy based on the overall accuracy will lead to incorrect conclusions due to the adverse bias towards the majority class (sMCI). In other words, a classifier predicting sMCI, regardless of the input features, will result in 84.25% overall accuracy as there will only be 15.75% incorrect predictions (pMCI individuals predicted as sMCI; 0% accuracy in pMCI class). To this regard, we have excluded the overall accuracy as a measure to compare predictors used in this study; however, we used McNemar's \u07ef \u0b36 test to compare the sensitivity and the specificity. It is important to mention that the majority of studies conducted to predict the progression of Alzheimer's disease dementia from MCI have not considered whether their samples represent the imbalanced proportions of the population (see Table 3 ). This can lead to inconsistent results when the studies are used in a clinical setting as the models have been trained and tested on a heightened representation of the pMCI population.\nGiven that the population used in the present study is a closer representation of the MCI population, the results of the study can be considered transferable to clinical use in early diagnosis.\nMcNemar's \u07ef \u0b36 test was used to evaluate the statistical significant difference between each predictor used in the study (RUSRF, SVM, regularized logistic regression, and Random Forest)"}]
