"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Different NAEP programs are associated with mathematics. The two major programs are the long-term trend study and the main NAEP study. The trend study was initiated in 1973 and has remained constant over the ensuing time period. The main study is subject to design changes in response to standards-based efforts. Only the trend study, which provides a longitudinal view of African American performance, is incorporated into the present review. The NAEP mathematics trend assessment is largely a basic skills examination. To allow measurement of performance trends, subsets of the same items have been a part of successive assessments. Some of the items have been included in each examination. As a result of this practice, the findings from nine NAEP trend assessments provide insight into how African American students' mathematics proficiency has changed between 1973 and 1999. NAEP mathematics proficiency scores are available for 1973, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1999, and 2003. (Because, at the time of the writing of this chapter, 2003 NAEP scores were not included in the trend study, they are not incorporated into this discussion.) Tests are administered to samples of students across the United States at the ages of 9, 13, and 17 years. Scale scores, which range from 0 to 500, provide a common metric for determining levels of proficiency across assessments and demographic characteristics. NAEP scores reflect student performance at five scale levels: The performance-level categories were developed for the 1973 assessment and remained in use through the 1999 assessment. However, the language associated with these categories evolved and changed over this period. Thus, it is important for school administrators and teachers charged with making decisions about curriculum, teaching, and other relevant educational inputs to be aware that although this trend analysis may use language consistent with today's standards-based discourse (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000; Tate, 2004) , the test items may not reflect the problem-solving and reasoning descriptions found in more recent standards documents and state content and performance assessment documents. With this limitation noted, NAEP trend analysis is a valuable gauge of student performance progress over time. Table 1 provides a summary of NAEP African American trends in mathematics from 1973 to 1999.\nMathematics performance among Blacks was higher at 9, 13, and 17 ages of age in 1999 than in 1973-1982. However, there has been no statistically significant change at any age level since the 1980s. The trend suggests that African American progress has slowed and that the gains achieved since 1973 have been more consis- tent on items that reflect low-level and basic skills mastery. Use of NAEP trend data to make school-level decisions is not recommended, since scores are based on samples of students and thus are considered estimates of all students' average performance. This uncertainty is reflected in the NAEP standard errors. This limitation noted, the NAEP mathematics performance trends suggest that Black students, in the aggregate, require additional opportunities to learn moderately complex procedures, algebra, reasoning, and multiple-step problem solving. Beyond the labels associated with NAEP performance levels, what does the NAEP trend study reveal about the scientific advancement of Black children? Clearly, the study indicates that algebraic understanding is underdeveloped (see also Kilpatrick, Swafford, & Findell, 2001; Rand Corporation, 2003) . Other research in mathematics education suggests that concepts such as rational number, ratio, and proportions are serious obstacles to the mathematical development of children (Behr, Harel, Post, & Lesh, 1992) . These concepts are foundational to algebra and some types of problem-solving tasks associated with the mathematics curriculum. It is reasonable to speculate that an increased focus in these areas of the curriculum is worth further investigation by researchers interested in the scientific attainment of Black students. L. S. Miller (1995) examined the intersection of race and SES using data from the NAEP trend mathematics-testing program. Lubienski (2002) provided insights from the main NAEP mathematics assessment of race-SES intersections. The discussion here is limited to the NAEP trend analysis. Miller presented a secondary analysis of an unpublished Educational Testing Service report authored by Bernice Taylor Anderson. In this analysis, \"did not finish high school,\" \"graduated from high school,\" and \"some post-high school education\" were used as proxies for SES. The discussion included NAEP mathematics performance data from 1978, 1982, 1986 , and 1990 by race and SES for 9-and 13-year-olds. Miller calculated that within-social-class gains for Blacks in both age groups were moderate to large between 1978 and 1990. Each SES group's gain estimates were positive in this comparison. The largest gain, of 23 points, was achieved by students classified as \"9-year-old/parent did not complete high school.\" The Miller analysis indicates that the overall gains reflected in the Black trend data at 9 and 13 years of age were produced across all three SES groups. Unfortunately, because of the sample size limitations of the NAEP mathematics tests, it is difficult to determine the magnitude of the improvements in the scores of Black students at each parent education level.\nThe NAEP science trend study includes content and cognitive dimensions (NCES, 2000). The content dimension assesses students' knowledge of life science, physical science, and earth and space science. The cognitive dimension assesses students' ability to solve problems and conduct inquiries and their knowledge of science. There also is an assessment of students' understanding of the nature of science within the context of both the content and cognitive dimensions. A multiple-choice format is used to assess students' knowledge of science. As with the mathematics trend study, the knowledge and skills demonstrated by students are classified into five performance levels. At Level 150, students demonstrate knowledge of the kinds of scientific facts present in everyday experiences. Students performing at Level 200 have some degree of understanding of simple scientific principles. By Level 250, students demonstrate they can apply general scientific knowledge and understanding of life science and basic knowledge of the physical sciences. Level 300 performance is characterized by the ability to analyze scientific principles and data and a growing understanding of physical science concepts. At Level 350, the highest performance level, students can integrate specialized scientific information, including genetics and chemistry. Table 2 provides a summary of NAEP African American trends in science performance from 1973 to 1999.\nIn the 9-year age group, there has been slow growth since the inception of the NAEP science trend study, with performance nearing the point at which some understanding of simple scientific principles is occurring. Similarly, the 13-year group has exhibited a slow rate of growth; there is evidence of understanding of some simple scientific principles, but performance has failed to reach Level 250. In the 17-year age group, the attainment level has been just over Level 250 since 1986; at this level, students demonstrate consistent application of scientific information and understanding of life sciences and some basic knowledge of physical sciences. Reaching Level 300 is the next major challenge for Black high school students. Demonstrating the performance associated with this level, including analysis of scientific principles, analysis of data, and understanding of physical sciences, would reflect the skills and insights aligned with the science requirements of a college preparatory school experience. Perkins, Kleiner, Roey, and Brown (2004) reported a positive relationship between secondary science and mathematics coursework and NAEP scores. The next section examines the scientific attainment of Black students using the secondary curriculum as a measure of advancement."}, {"section_title": "College Preparatory Opportunities in Mathematics and Science", "text": "Two correlates of student mathematics and science achievement that have been used in numerous studies of achievement are (a) increased time on task in cognitively demanding curriculums and (b) number of advanced courses taken in mathematics and science. Research indicates that African Americans and low-SES students are less likely to be enrolled in higher-level mathematics and science courses than middleclass White students (Oakes, 1990; Secada, 1992) . Furthermore, African American students, as a demographic group, are consistently outperformed by White students on national assessments of mathematics and science achievement (Doran, Lawrenz, & Helgeson, 1994; Rodriguez, 2004; Tate, 2005) . Again, the intention here is not to engage in a comparative discussion; rather, the goal is to highlight that a positive relationship between mathematics and science achievement and course taking exists across multiple data sets: NAEP, National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), SAT, and ACT (Perkins et al., 2004 ; \"Stubborn Racial Scoring Gap,\" 2004; Tate, 1997) . However, in the context of discussing scientific attainment and coursework patterns, some comparative analysis is useful.\nFor example, Hoffer, Rasinski, and Moore (1995) examined the relationship between number of mathematics courses completed by high school students of different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds and their achievement gain from the end of Grade 8 to Grade 12. The findings indicated that when African American and White students who completed the same courses were compared, the differences in average achievement gains were small in magnitude, and none were statistically significant. Moreover, none of the SES comparisons showed significant differences among students taking the same number of courses. These findings suggest that some of the racial and SES differences in mathematics achievement in Grades 9-12 are a product of the quality and number of mathematics courses that African American and high-and low-SES students complete during secondary school. A similar argument can be made in secondary science (Perkins et al., 2004) .\nIn an extensive analysis of data gathered in the 1982 High School and Beyond study, data gathered in three High School Transcript Studies (1987, 1990, 1994) , and additional data gathered in 1998, Roey and colleagues (2001) provided insight into scientific course-taking trends among Black students. Arguably, the most relevant data related to scientific attainment and course taking are those associated with advancement in the college preparatory track, which is an indicator of students' readiness for additional study in the sciences. Tables 3 and 4 summarize relevant "}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The indicators examined in this section all reflect slow and steady progress during the decades of the 1980s and 1990s. The NAEP mathematics and science trend studies suggest that Black students are making progress in regard to basic mathematical and scientific concepts. However, the challenging concepts associated with the trend studies represent significant opportunities for student growth. Course-taking patterns suggest that significant progress has been made at the beginning stages of the college preparation curriculum in mathematics and science. Changes in state policy have resulted in many more Black students enrolling in algebra and, to a lesser extent, biology. As the cognitive demands of the curriculum increase toward calculus and completion of the biology/chemistry/physics combination, the percentage of Black students declines dramatically. However, the percentage of students completing this more rigorous sequence of mathematics and science gateway courses increased between 1982 and 1998.\nIncreases in state course requirements and the steady growth of Black students taking higher-level scientific courses have overlapped with a steady trend of Black students earning a larger percentage of undergraduate and master's degrees in science and engineering. Some may argue that these increases are small and not particularly significant in terms of the larger production of scientific infrastructure. However, this growth must be understood in light of the past. Before the 1954 Brown decision and many years after, the United States largely involved a segregated and transparent caste system wherein race greatly influenced all opportunity structures, including scientific attainment and advancement. The next section provides insight into this history."}, {"section_title": "POLITICAL ECONOMY, SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION, AND BROWN", "text": "Scientific knowledge has played a special role in the political and economic advancement of the United States. Trends associated with African American scientific attainment can be understood in light of the historical importance of scienceand thus knowledge of science-in the United States. Separating African American scientific attainment trends from the history and politics of the scientific enterprise in America does a disservice to the progress that has been made to date. With some insights into the history of science in the United States and the politics of science and scientific opportunity to learn as a backdrop, post-Brown trends related to the scientific attainment of African Americans are decidedly more useful. The goal of this section is to briefly describe the role of scientific education in the political economy of the United States. Discussion also focuses on who has had access to scientific education in the United States and to what extent.\nScientific education has been central to the political economy of the United States since its inception. For more than two centuries, economists and public officials have argued that advancement of the country's business and commercial interests rests on a scientifically literate and capable citizenry. Thomas Jefferson (1954) , in his Notes on the State of Virginia, argued for a limited public system of education. He proposed creating small districts of 5 or 6 square miles each that would have their own school and would teach reading, writing, and arithmetic. All residents of the district would be entitled to send their children 3 years at no cost, with additional years paid for by the parents. Under Jefferson's proposed system, the highest-ranked boy whose parents lacked the fiscal means to pay for his education would be sent forward to one of 20 grammar schools for instruction in Greek, Latin, geography, and the higher branches of numerical arithmetic. The boys sent to grammar school were to take a trial or test, and the \"best genius\" was to be selected for 6 years of additional study and the \"residue dismissed.\" In this manner, 20 of the best thinkers would \"be raked from the rubbish annually\" and educated at the public's expense. After 6 years of grammar school instruction, half of the students were to be dismissed and the other half, because of their superior intellect, were to be sent for an additional 3 years of study in the sciences at William and Mary, a college Jefferson envisioned as having a strong scientific focus in contrast to the theological curriculum dominant in this era. The point here is that As a result of the ideological commitment to continuous societal evaluation and reform, counting and measuring were vital components of the republic for several reasons. First, numeracy proponents argued that political arithmetic was objective and opinion free. Thus, numbers could be used to measure social gains and to illustrate the need for community problem solving in arenas where progress and freedom were being impeded. Difficult social problems-from the spread of disease to alcohol consumption-could be analyzed in statistical terms. Second, because numbers were viewed as objective and value free, early advocates of political arithmetic believed they would be more powerful in political debates than rhetorical arguments or personal thoughts. Third, and directly related to the first two points, numeracy was vital because of the role of individual agency in the American political vision. Individual citizens were viewed as the source of action and problem solving in the community. Progress rested on this view of individual actors seeking to optimize self interest, properly understood (Kamens & Benavot, 1991) .\nHowever, there were limits. Most certainly, Negro slaves were excluded from the world of learning about numbers, yet they were objectified mathematically in numerous ways. Perhaps the most notable example of the intersection of mathematics, race, and political economy is found in Article I, Section 2, of the Constitution, better known as the three-fifths compromise. The proposal to count slaves as three fifths of a person predated the Constitutional Convention; it emerged as a response to the problem of taxation under the Articles of Confederation (Meyerson, 2002 ). Southerners did not want to pay taxes on the nearly 40% of the population who were enslaved, so they argued that slaves should be counted as one half or one fourth of \"one freeman.\" A group of northerners urged that, at least for the purpose of taxation, a slave should be counted as the equivalent of a freeman. Ultimately, the 3 to 5 ratio was approved. The political, economic, and educational products of this decision and other practices and customs related to maintaining social inequality, such as post-Civil War segregation policies, remain in various forms to this day (Margo, 1990) . The point here is that academic performance, family wealth, long-term health, and other indicators of social welfare, including scientific achievement, are intergenerational (e.g., Gadsden, 1994; L. S. Miller, 1995; Shapiro, 2004) .\nWhat should not be lost in a chapter of this nature is that access to mathematical literacy is vitally important to an active citizenry and the ability to understand debates related to political rights.3 The Constitution still contains provisions that illustrate how numbers communicate political perspective and advance ideological goals. Mathematics is embedded in the very fabric of American political philosophy. Failure to understand mathematics and the role of mathematics in this democracy is a limiting condition with real consequences for individuals and underrepresented demographic groups (P. C. Cohen, 1982; Robinson, 1996; Tate, 1995) . Clearly, mathematics, particularly school mathematics in the form of arithmetic, was linked to early notions of citizenship and modern political thought.\nDuring the late 18th and early 19th centuries, knowledge in more advanced forms of mathematics such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus was foundational to those seeking careers as surveyors, navigators, and military leaders (Tolley, 2003) . Advanced mathematical topics conferred a collegiate status on institutions offering this academic course of study. Moreover, this course of study was linked to vocational and economic opportunity and was part of the Jeffersonian view of \"nation\": selecting a few White men capable of contributing to society's advancement and then providing them a strong academic preparation in mathematics. This approach to mathematics education is closely associated with Eurocentric philosophies of elitism and social stratification (Joseph, 1987) . Specifically, if mathematics were in any way associated with non-Europeans, this would imply that these individuals were capable of creating and leading their own technology-based economies or able to contribute to political thought and governance. The notion of African American contributions to business leadership and political advancement was clearly counter to the prevailing cultural ethos of Jefferson's era and the subsequent post-Civil War Jim Crow ideology (Woodward, 1974) ."}, {"section_title": "School Science", "text": "Science as a school subject shared similarities with mathematics, but there were some distinct differences. Both mathematics and science had broad support from Thomas Jefferson for the same reason: enhancing the progress of a developing nation (Hurd, 1997) . During his tenure as vice president, Jefferson noticed that science was not part of the schooling experience. He sought congressional support to fund the writing of textbooks that reflected natural history and mechanics, but his request was denied on the grounds that school curricula were the domain of local communities. However, Jefferson was not alone in his support of science. In 1743, Benjamin Franklin founded the American Philosophical Society with the goal of advancing the development of new knowledge and improving the scientific experience; if well executed, this might result in discoveries benefiting the nation's agrarian economy and humankind in general.\nYet, unlike the case with mathematics, science teaching and learning for the masses faced three major objections (Kamens & Benavot, 1991) . First, educators, political officials, and their allies perceived science as an applied, narrow subject not capable of developing loyal and morally upright citizens. Unlike instruction in the classics, science was thought to be devoid of the attributes required to produce reasoning facilities and moral character. Second, science was linked to secular movements and was viewed as undermining religious beliefs and authority. Third, political leaders and the dominant elite saw science instruction as capable of subverting the established political and social order. Those in positions of leadership claimed authority in part because of their insights into the natural and physical worlds. Thus, extending literacy and scientific knowledge to the masses would accelerate their desire for political power and social opportunity.\nAccording to Tolley (2003) , in the years immediately following the Civil War, White middle-and upper-class girls and boys had access to scientific texts and laboratory equipment; however, the picture for students in other ethnic groups and social classes was less certain. Tolley's historical perspective of girls in science also provides insight into the experiences of African American children of both sexes. For example, the postwar years afforded emancipated African Americans the opportunity to study science for their benefit; however, in spite of political rhetoric describing the benefits of scientific education for African Americans, the documentary evidence suggests that the distribution of educational resources was uneven in public school systems, thus contributing to differences in opportunities to learn science between White and African American students. In addition, in the South, just after the turn of the century, African American students studied the sciences in segregated public secondary schools; evidence for some areas indicates that students usually learned scientific concepts without the benefit of laboratory work (e.g., Memphis, Nashville, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Lynchburg, Virginia). In contrast, students preparing to be teachers may have had laboratory equipment and experiences as part of their teacher training institutions. Photographs of African American teacher candidates at Hampton Institute show them conducting experiments in chemistry and physics classes at the turn of the century.\nWhile the 19th century witnessed significant conflict over science instruction and its role in public schooling, opposition to science education weakened in the 20th century as industrialists and policymakers viewed a growing international consensus on the importance of learning both science and arithmetic in schools as a key factor undergirding economic development. The intensity of this line of thinking grew throughout the century. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in the 1950s with the launch of Sputnik."}, {"section_title": "BROWN, THE NATIONAL INTEREST, AND ECONOMICS", "text": "The purpose of this section is to discuss three theories that potentially explain the The media reported that Soviet children were exposed to the hard sciences and mathematics required for the global competition that was at the heart of the Cold War. The embarrassment and shock of Sputnik ignited an effort to advance scientific education in the United States, because it was thought that science was the primary means through which the American dream could be realized and preserved. Theory 1: Brown and the National Interest Bell (1980) argued the interests of Blacks seeking racial equality would be accommodated only when they converged with the interests of Whites. In addition, he noted that the matter of school segregation and the harm segregation inflicted on African American students had been part of legal writing for more than over a century at the time of the Brown decision. Yet, prior to Brown, claims related to the harm of segregated schools were met with orders to equalize facilities or other educational inputs, orders that rarely met with compliance. \"What accounted, then, for the sudden shift in 1954 away from the separate but equal doctrine and towards a commitment to desegregation?\" (Bell, 1980, p. 96 ). Bell's hypothesis was that the break from the long-held segregationist doctrine had to be understood in light of not only growing concern among many Whites regarding racial injustice and immorality but also concern among White policymakers about the national interest.\nBell ( According to Abbott (1981) , in the period surrounding the end of World War II, Norfolk's slow-moving municipal government had done a poor job in managing the city's resources. The city was described in local newspapers as dilapidated, with crowded ghettos, inferior public transportation, a dated airport, and deteriorating streets. The city council, whose majority had close political ties to the organization of Senator Harry Byrd, a key figure in the history of the Virginia battle over school desegregation, was viewed as second rate. Senator Byrd's reaction to the 1954 Brown decision was to engineer the passage of a set of laws that moved Virginia to a course of massive resistance to the Supreme Court decision. In Norfolk, this resistance gained traction in the fall of 1958, when the U.S. District Court ordered the admission of 17 Black students to three junior and three senior high schools. The governor assumed control of the affected schools on September 27, locking the doors on 9,950 White and 17 Black students. Although a total of 36,000 Black and White students continued their education in segregated schools, attention focused on the students restricted from educational access as a result of the resistance strategy. The Norfolk City Council offered outspoken support for massive resistance and assigned the city's problems to ungrateful Blacks.\nThe crisis peaked in the middle of January, when the city council voted to spread the burden of the massive resistance by cutting off funding for segregated Black junior and senior high schools. On January 26, two local newspapers published a position statement signed by 100 leading business and professional men offering support for the preservation of public schools and legal compliance with the desegregation order. Analysis of this \"Committee of 100\" provides insight into the backgrounds of people involved in municipal reform movements in Sunbelt cities (Abbott, 1981) . The men who joined as signatories were respected citizens of means and position but not of extraordinary wealth. Most of the businesses represented on the Committee of 100 shared a chamber-of-commerce perspective toward Norfolk markets and the health of Norfolk real estate. This orientation toward commerce proved successful. Seven days later, the schools reopened and the 17 Black students were admitted. The Committee of 100 is given major credit for resolving the desegregation crisis and, more important, redirecting Norfolk toward its primary goal of economic advancement.\nThe behavior and actions of the Committee of 100 reflect a major paradigmatic shift in political philosophy toward resolving racial issues in the South. According to Bayor (1989) , the history of the urban South until well into the 20th century was more consistent with the pattern of the southern model-Jim Crow politics (see also Woodward, 1974 ). With few exceptions, Whites did not attempt to address or acknowledge Blacks' concerns or in any fashion legitimize them as a political enterprise. Yet, the cities of the postwar urban South, with significant population growth and expanding economies, were led by coalitions of business and civic leaders working to adopt a northern model of race relations that fostered stability and improved the possibility of cooperation among various racial/ethnic communities.\nThe northern strategy of intergroup relations appears to have informed numerous post-Brown desegregation implementation efforts in the Sunbelt. R. M. Miller (1989) posited that, after World War II, the most striking changes in the South's political economy were the decreasing preoccupation with White supremacy and a trend toward investment in and migration to this region. In addition, he argued that this shift made it possible for a successful civil rights movement. The shift in political philosophy was designed for the dual purposes of public image and fairness. Lowering racial tensions made it easier to attract outside capital and to minimize outside agitators in local matters. This shift in philosophy should not be confused with a willingness to share power or spare Black neighborhoods from demolition. While the direct influence of industrialists on matters of equality of educational opportunity in the form of desegregation support is clear, it should not be lost that, on purely academic terms, the South was not prepared for full-scale technological advancement.\nIn part, Bell's theory retrospectively suggests that capitalists understood the need for political stability and improved human capital in order to advance the Sunbelt. There appears to be sufficient evidence to suggest that Bell's theory is plausible. The human resource development component of the South was not sufficient from a capacity perspective for rapid technological advancement. It is doubtful that many business leaders in the South viewed the Brown decision as a mechanism to produce more educated Blacks who could serve as captains of industry in the Sunbelt. Yet, the benefits of political stability and good weather and the promise of expanding economic opportunities resulted in a great in-migration to the Sunbelt on the part of both Blacks and Whites, and reductions in out-migration were seen (Weinstein & Firestine, 1978) . During 1955 During -1960 During and 1965 During -1970 , younger, more educated Blacks and Whites migrated to the Sunbelt, counterbalancing the region's older and less educated indigenous (largely rural and poor) population. As a result of these reductions in out-migration, it is instructive to briefly examine the academic state of affairs among Blacks and the relationship of education to economic well-being in the South in the years leading up to the Brown decision.\nThis examination is part of a third theory, one that represents a shift in that the first two theories attempted to explain why the government and capitalists may have supported Brown. The third theory offers an explanation of why it was imperative for African Americans to support a desegregation policy."}, {"section_title": "Theory 3: Brown and the Economics of Discrimination", "text": "Support for desegregation policy in education was not universal among African Americans in the postwar era (Bell, 2004; Edwards, 1996) . However, most African Americans in the South had seen or experienced the discriminatory practices of Jim Crow segregation and its related influence on economic opportunities. In many respects, Brown was linked to economic advancement in that American cultural norms associate educational preparation with occupational potential (D. K. Cohen, 1970) . However, discrimination can negatively influence this association. Margo's (1990) economic history of the South demonstrates the importance for African Americans to combat discrimination.\nPrior to 1950 in the South, quantifiable indicators of schooling, measured by literacy rates, school attendance, and educational attainment, reflected significant racial differences (Margo, 1990 ). These differences extended to quality factors, as measured by educational inputs such as school funding expenditures, class sizes, and length of the academic year. While the racial gap in illiteracy and school attendance decreased steadily over time, racial differences in educational attainment remained large, declining only toward the end of this period. Margo (1990) estimated that the Black illiteracy rate continued to decrease during the first half of the 20th century, falling to about 25% in 1920. By 1950, he calculated that between 88% and 91% of southern Blacks were literate, as measured by the census.\nWith this information as a backdrop, Margo (1990) employed econometric techniques in an attempt to examine two frameworks for interpreting long-term trends in racial income differences: a supply-side, human-capital model and a demand-side, institutionalist model. The human-capital model focused on racial differences in the quantity and quality of schooling, theorizing that once these differences narrowed after World War II, relative Black status would improve. In the institutionalist model, by contrast, positive growth in the relative economic status of Blacks depended on changes in the economy that increased non-agrarian demands for Black labor. Margo concluded that strict enforcement of the \"equal\" portion of the separate-but-equal doctrine would have narrowed racial differences in school attendance rates, literacy rates, and test scores. Thus, violation of the separate-but-equal doctrine in education contributed to the relatively slower long-term economic progress of Black Americans.\nIn addition, implementing the separate-but-equal doctrine in education would not have been enough to fully equalize educational outcomes. Only a major redistribution of school finances in favor of Black children might have compensated for the intergenerational effects associated with family background that kept Black children out of school, impeded the spread of literacy, and negatively influenced the test scores of Black children. Margo's analysis of employment in the South during the first half of the 20th century, which involved the use of census samples, suggested that differences in quantity and quality of education limited Blacks' participation in the nonagricultural southern economy. Consistent with the human-capital model, a reduction in the racial gap in the quantity and quality of schooling would have improved the employment opportunities of southern Blacks, leading to higher earnings ratios prior to World War II.\nHowever, the quantitative impact of racial differences in schooling was modest, and it was concentrated in certain industries. More and improved schooling would have increased the number of self-employed Blacks in white-collar professions. A major finding was that employment segregation increased after control for racial differences in schooling and other factors. Thus, employment segregation was not centrally a function of racial differences in human capital. Instead, the economic evidence strongly suggests that Black participation in the southern economy was constrained by discrimination and social norms. The state of discrimination led the NAACP to embark on the ambiguous litigation strategy associated with Brown (Bell, 2004) .\nThe three theories just discussed each shed light on why certain groups may have joined the desegregation battle. These theories are plausible and not mutually exclusive. Each describes a shortcoming of discriminatory practices. The next section outlines how science played an important role in making discriminatory practices transparent in the legal struggle to desegregate schools."}, {"section_title": "BROWNAND THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY", "text": "In this chapter, science and mathematics are described as being part of a vision of modern political thought. Both subjects have been viewed as central to the economic advancement and democratic progress of the United States. Thus, it should come as no surprise that the science of psychology and applied statistics played a role in the evidentiary base of Brown. The purpose of this section is to review the role of social science in Brown and related cases, with a particular focus on the evolution of educational opportunities in the post-Brown era.\nToday, studies from the social science discipline, particularly studies focusing on student achievement and related information about student advancement, are commonplace in policy considerations and matters of law pertaining to education (Elliott, 1987 ). This fact is partly a product of advances in the social sciences and the ability of some social scientists to organize programs of study related to questions of policy and law. Arguably, the most important exemplars of this statement in the field of education are found in the litigation leading to Brown, Brown itself, and subsequent cases related to matters of segregation.\nBefore a direct discussion of this issue, some background related to legal thought and social science is useful. Faigman (2004) , in his historical review of the integration of science and law, argued that the Brown decision paralleled a golden age of social science. Prior to the decision, legal theorists and scholars vigorously debated the merits of classical legal thought. According to Unger (1983) The legal realist movement developed out of dissatisfaction with principles of classical legal analysis according to which judicial decision making was viewed primarily as the product of reasoning produced through a finite set of determined rules (White, 1972) . In contrast, many legal realists asserted that legal rules were too narrow and could not provide guidance or definitive answers to courts in specific cases (Llwellyn, 1931) . Legal realism was closely aligned with the philosophical traditions of pragmatism, instrumentalism, and progressivism. With their links to New Deal politics, the realists advocated for identifying a coherent public interest and aligning political strategies to advance it (Lasswell & McDougal, 1943) . To support the design of a political strategy, the legal realists advocated removing dogmas of classical legal theory they believed prevented legal reform and substituting a rational scientific method of legal scholarship (Livingston, 1982) . Specifically, they contended that a more prominent role for statistical method and applications of the behavioral sciences in legal analysis would result in improved and more innovative forms of legal thought and, consequently, social policy.\nBy the late 1920s, legal realists were situated at three major higher education institutions: the law schools of Columbia and Yale and the Institute of Legal Study at Johns Hopkins. These scholars did not seek \"truth\" through the paradigmatic view of legal formalism; rather, they found truth by way of experience, using statistics as a vehicle. This movement was not without problems. The legal realists were enthusiastic converts to the growing field of statistical analysis; however, they had little understanding of it and little desire to collect data or conduct the analyses required to make sense of the complex situations in which they were interested (Faigman, 2004 Instead, Plessy would have to be attacked on principle as harmful to individuals. A change in the legal strategy to focus on individual harm differed from the broader social effects arguments but was deemed timely and appropriate by the NAACP legal team. The evidence drawn from sociology and economics provided information related to the macro-level effects of segregation, but these disciplines lacked the epistemological tenets to make transparent the pain and suffering experienced by individual men, women, and children who were the victims of segregation. It was time for a paradigmatic shift from sociology and economics to social psychology.\nTypically, legislative bodies examine models and evidence from sociology and economics. In contrast, courts are structured to evaluate evidence regarding a specific event or occurrence. Malpractice and accident cases, for example, involve proving that a defendant caused an injury, along with the fact and degree of the injury. Marshall stated that \"if your car ran over my client, you'd have to pay up, and my function as an attorney would be to put experts on the stand to testify to how much damage was done. We need exactly that kind of evidence in the school cases\" (cited in Faigman, 2004, p. 176) .\nOn the recommendation of Robert Carter, a member of the NAACP legal team, the psychological research of Professor Kenneth Clark and his colleague and wife Mamie became part of the new litigation strategy. The Clarks used projective testing to evaluate segregation's effect. A commonly used projective psychological test is the Rorschach, or inkblot, test. Examinees are told to look at a series of inkblots and to indicate what each looks like or what it could be. Because the stimulus is ambiguous, examinees must envision their own structures. Therefore, thoughts, emotions, and habits of mind, some of which are unconscious, are projected into the descriptions of the inkblots. Rather than inkblots, the Clarks used dolls.\nThe procedures and results of the doll tests were reported by Clark and Clark (1952) as part of a larger scope of work focused on investigating the development of racial identification and preferences of Negro children. The participants in this study were presented with four dolls identical in every respect other than skin color. Two of these dolls were brown with black hair, and two were white with yellow hair. The dolls were presented in order-white, colored, white, colored-to half of the participants. For the remaining participants, the order of presentation was reversed. Participants were asked to respond to the following requests by choosing one of the dolls and giving it to the experimenter: 1. Give me the doll that you like to play with-(a) like best. 2. Give me the doll that is a nice doll. 3. Give me the doll that looks bad. 4. Give me the doll that is a nice color. 5. Give me the doll that looks like a white child. 6. Give me the doll that looks like a colored child. 7. Give me the doll that looks like a Negro child. 8. Give me the doll that looks like you.\nAccording to the Clarks, Requests 1 through 4 were designed to reveal preferences; Requests 5 through 7 indicated knowledge of \"racial differences\"; and Request 8 provided self-identity information. Two hundred fifty-three Negro children took part in this experiment. One hundred thirty-four of the children tested formed the southern group. These children were drawn from segregated nursery schools and public schools in Hot Springs, Pine Bluff, and Little Rock, Arkansas. The children had no experience in racially mixed school settings. The northern group of examinees was composed of 119 children from racially mixed nursery schools and public schools in Springfield, Massachusetts. The children in the study ranged from 3 to 7 years of age. The ratio of female to male students was 137:116. The Negro students also were divided into three skin color categories: light (practically white), medium (light brown to dark brown), and dark (dark brown to black). The ratio of students categorized as light to medium to dark was 46:128:79.\nA key finding of the study was that the majority of the Negro children preferred the white doll and rejected the colored doll. Slightly more than two thirds of participants asked to play with the white doll. Fifty-nine percent of the children selected the white doll as a \"nice doll,\" and the same percentage indicated that the colored doll looked \"bad.\" Only 17% of the children labeled the white doll as looking bad. Sixty percent of the children thought that the white doll was a \"nice color,\" as compared with 38% for the colored doll. Many other results were derived from the experiment; however, these findings and some of the qualitative data in the form of unsolicited verbalizations were relevant to the type of individual harm argument Marshall and his colleagues sought to make in the Brown case. According to Clark and Clark (1952): On the whole, the rejection of the brown doll and the preference for the white doll, when explained at all, were explained in rather simple, concrete terms: for white-doll preference-\"'cause he's pretty\" or \"'cause he's white\"; for rejection of the brown doll-\"'cause he's ugly\" or \"'cause it don't look pretty\" or \"'cause him black\" or \"got black on him.\" (p. 560)\nThe findings in the Clarks' study and the research of other social psychologists provided Marshall an evidentiary base to argue the injurious effect of segregation on individual students' racial formation and identity. The NAACP brief to the Supreme Court included a lengthy appendix signed by 35 social scientists arguing that enforced segregation has negative psychological effects on members of the segregated group. Legal scholars have debated for decades the influence of this program of social science research on the outcome of Brown. Cahn (1955) warned:\nIn the months since the utterance of the Brown and Bolling opinions, the impression has grown that the outcome, either entirely or in major part, was caused by the testimony and opinions of the scientists, and a genuine danger has arisen that even lawyers and judges may begin to entertain this belief. Problems involving interpretation can be at least partially attributed to Brown II. In handing down this decision, the Supreme Court failed to indicate its intended outcome. Instead, the court transferred authority for elucidating, assessing, and solving the desegregation challenge to school authorities. The role of the courts was relegated in many cities to a monitoring function. Numerous educational programs devised to appear as \"good-faith\" implementation efforts were instead clever strategies to resegregate within school districts. For example, the Miami and Houston school systems classified Hispanic Americans as White and bused low-income Black children to low-income Hispanic schools, and vice versa (Orfield, 1988) The literature on tracking is extensive and complex. Ferguson's (1998) examination of the effect of schools on the Black-White test score gap included a review of the tracking literature. He concluded that the fundamental problem is not tracking per se. Instead, among critics and proponents alike, the problem with tracking is the expected quality of instruction for the students in question. If teacher assignments were fairly distributed, student placements were flexibly based on student growth, and teaching practices were student centered, then criticism might cease. In addition, if tracking advocates felt confident that the quality of instruction for high-achieving and gifted students would not decline under more heterogeneous placements, they might cease their protests. These remarks are based on the reasonable assumption that consumers of schooling desire to optimize all students' learning opportunities. Moreover, they reflect a belief that important human resources such as teachers can be distributed fairly. Both assumptions are questionable in the context of American schooling, where capital, tax structures, local control, neighborhood differences, and other factors influence educational inputs.\nInterestingly, Ferguson's research in another study captures the realities of the distribution challenge. Ferguson's (1991) study of 900 Texas school districts demonstrated the importance of quality teachers and the unfairness of teacher distribution along racial lines. He found that teacher expertise, as measured by years of experience and level of training, accounted for about 40% of the variance in students' mathematics achievement during Grades 1 through 11. This amount was more than that accounted for by any other factor. In addition, the effects were so strong and the variations in teacher expertise so wide that, after control for SES, the achievement differences between Black and White students were almost singularly accounted for by differences in teacher expertise. Thus, discussions of the pros and cons of tracking must be coupled with concerns about teacher quality. However, there is another factor that must be considered in the tracking debate.\nFerguson's initial argument did not account for at least one socializing factor. For example, J. B. Smith (1996) examined the effects of early eighth-grade access to algebra on students' access to advanced mathematics courses and subsequent high school mathematics achievement. Her findings suggested that early access to algebra has an effect beyond increased achievement and that it may, in fact, socialize students into taking more mathematics. Thus, possession of the algebra credit in eighth grade is a credential that regulates access to more advanced coursework in mathematics. This credential increases both students' and educators' expectations about how the amount of mathematics students will take in high school. The process helps keep students in the college track longer and produces higher achievement as a result. What is clear from discussions of tracking is that tracking is important and that it represents a type of segregation with a legal history linked to Brown.\nTracking is a form of segregation. Green (1999) noted the 1960s and 1970s were a period of reduced broad-based support for equal access and equal educational opportunities, including school desegregation. One artifact of this era was a series of legal challenges opposing tracking on the basis that this practice helped to produce intraschool segregation.4 A major legal challenge to tracking was initiated by the plaintiffs in Hobson v. Hansen (1967), who alleged that tracking in the Washington, D.C., school system fostered racial segregation of students because African Americans were disproportionately placed into vocational and lower academic tracks. Similar to numerous other school districts in the country, Washington, D.C., used a combination of standardized tests and teacher recommendations to organize students into academic tracks. The school superintendent argued that students were sorted on the basis of ability and educational need, not on the basis of race (Hobson v. Hansen, 1967 ). This argument is strikingly similar to Jefferson's desire to provide an education adapted to the years, the capacity, and the condition of an individual.\nThe court did not concur with the superintendent, and it ordered that the tracking policy be abandoned in the school district. Building on the legal precedent of Brown, the court argued that the tracking system was unconstitutional and denied African American and poor children their right to the opportunities afforded to White and more affluent children. In his written opinion, Judge J. Skelly Wright stated that, \"even in concept, the track system is undemocratic and discriminatory. Its creator [the superintendent of schools] admits it is designed to prepare some children for white-collar, and other children for blue-collar jobs\" (p. 407). The ruling was built on two major findings. First, African American students were disproportionately relegated to the lower track, thus segregating the student body. Second, the lower track was determined to be inferior to the academic track in terms of educational quality. The judge argued that students needed stimulating, enriching, and challenging instruction rather than instruction designed to serve perceived levels of ability.\nMoses v. Washington Parish School Board (1972) was another major legal challenge to tracking. The schools of Washington Parish, in Louisiana, were segregated until 1965. In response to court desegregation orders, the school board created and put into place a plan to group students by ability. Similar to Hobson, the plaintiffs argued that ability grouping produced segregation within the district. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the use of IQ tests to place students into tracks positioned African American students at a distinct disadvantage to Whites, a demographic group historically afforded an education superior to that afforded to African Americans. The Fifth Circuit Court concurred, arguing that the use of standardized achievement tests for classification purposes deprived African American students of their constitutional rights. As in Hobson, the court stated that homogeneous grouping was educationally detrimental to students placed into lower tracks, and African Americans constituted a disproportionate number of students in these tracks.\nAnother case heard by the Fifth Circuit Court, McNeal v. Tate County School District (1975), signaled a narrowing of the grounds to litigate questions about tracking. In McNeal, the court ruled that testing could not serve as the instrument to sort students into track placements in a desegregated system until the district had resolved the products of de jure segregation. The court argued that this provision was needed to ensure that the track assignment methodology, in this case IQ testing, was not based on the present results of past discrimination. This decision left open the possibility that curricular and ability segregation in public education might be constitutional. Schools could legally assign students to tracks that resulted in segregated racial groups as long as the segregation was a de facto outcome rather than an explicit goal of district policy (Green, 1999) .\nBetween 1980 Rockford represented a shift from past tracking litigation-for example, Hobson, Moses, and McNeal -with respect to supporting evidence. Prior to Rockford, litigators largely concentrated on the discriminatory intent of school district tracking systems and the disproportionate assignment of African American students to lower tracks. While this strategy resulted in victories for opponents of tracking, the rationale produced by the courts was not consistent. Once a \"biased\" scientific instrument was eliminated (e.g., IQ testing), the practice of tracking could be resumed.\nIn Rockford, social scientist Jeannie Oakes accumulated a set of evidence from the district such as curriculum guides, district reports, enrollment figures (disaggregated by grade, race, track, and school), standardized test scores, teacher recommendations for course enrollment, discovery responses, and deposition testimony. This wealth of quantitative and qualitative evidence convinced the court that tracking practices skewed enrollments in favor of White students over and above what could be reasonably attributed to measured achievement. One example of compelling evidence produced by Oakes was an analysis of the student body by deciles of achievement as measured via test scores. Her analysis focused on student records rather than students themselves. A student record represented one student enrolled into one course. One student who enrolls in four courses will produce four student records. This method allows the analysis to account for students who take courses at different levels in numerous subjects of study. By way of example, consider the data in Table 6 : There are not 2,271 majority students scoring in the ninth decile; rather, majority students scoring in the second highest decile enrolled into a total of 2,271 courses, 74% of which were advanced. Similarly, there were not 227 minority students scoring in the ninth decile, instead, minority students scoring at the second highest decile enrolled in a total of 227 courses, 70% of which were advanced.\nThe enrollment patterns of high-scoring and low-scoring students were very similar. Students at these ends of the spectrum were enrolled in advanced classes at similar rates. The greatest racial disparities occurred at the fifth, sixth, and seventh deciles, where students were perceived as borderline with respect to advanced classes. Oakes's use of disaggregated test data to help create opportunity to learn in more advanced coursework represented a shift from the Hobson, Moses, and McNeal cases, in which IQ testing served as a tool to limit African Americans' access to more rigorous coursework. In each instance, the science of testing played a role in the legal and political debates related to the academic preparation of African American students. Thus, ironically, science as defined by psychology-and, more particularly, by psychometrics-has been vitally important in the legal battles and political challenges associated with opening the scientific pipeline more broadly to include African Americans at all levels. This irony is consistent with the modern view of political thought according to which scientific knowledge is part of the foundation for democratic debate, evaluation, and social decision making.
