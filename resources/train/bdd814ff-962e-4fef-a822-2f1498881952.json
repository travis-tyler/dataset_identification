[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Age differences in height derived from cross-sectional studies can be the result of differential secular influences among the age cohorts. To determine the magnitude of height loss that accompanies aging, longitudinal studies are required. The authors studied 2,084 men and women aged 17-94 years enrolled from 1958 to 1993 in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Baltimore, Maryland. On average, men's height was measured nine times during 15 years and women's height five times during 9 years. The rate of decrease in height was greater for women than for men. For both sexes, height loss began at about age 30 years and accelerated with increasing age. Cumulative height loss from age 30 to 70 years averaged about 3 cm for men and 5 cm for women; by age 80 years, it increased to 5 cm for men and 8 cm for women. This degree of height loss would account for an \"artifactual\" increase in body mass index of approximately 0.7 kg/m 2 for men and 1.6 kg/m 2 for women by age 70 years that increases to 1.4 and 2.6 kg/m 2 , respectively, by age 80 years. True height loss with aging must be taken into account when height (or indexes based on height) is used in physiologic or clinical studies.

Men have been studied since 1958, women since 1978. Initially, men aged 70 years or younger were examined every 18 months, those over age 70 years annually. In 1970, the examination schedule was changed to every 2 years for men aged 20-59 years, every 18 months for those aged 60-69 years, and annually for those aged 70 years or older. Since 1978, all subjects have been examined every 2 years. BLSA subjects generally are well educated, middle to upper-middle class, community dwelling, and in good health. The present study reports on longitudinal analysis of height change with age for 1,068 men and 390 women and on cross-sectional height differences obtained for 1,430 men and 654 women. Because only 6 percent of BLSA participants are members of minority groups, and because the change in height with age may not be the same for different racial groups, these analyses were limited to White subjects. Throughout the course of the study, height was measured by using a movable anthropometer with subjects in their stocking feet. Subjects were asked to stand tall with heels together, head in a \"normal\" position, and eyes looking straight ahead. Data for this report were collected from 1958 through 1993."}, {"section_title": "Statistical methods", "text": "Cross-sectional data. The sex-specific crosssectional age differences in height were quantified by regressing height on age using both linear and quadratic models. In these regressions, each subject was characterized by his or her mean height and mean age during participation in the study. In addition to these regressions based on data from all of the subjects, we tabulated age decade-specific mean heights.\nLongitudinal data. Longitudinal analyses of the change in height with age included only those subjects whose height was measured three or more separate times. A two-stage random effects model was used to analyze the data. The first stage consisted of computing each subject's rate of height loss (|3 Sub j ect ) by regressing the subject's heights on the ages at which the heights were measured, as follows:\nThe second stage began by characterizing each subject by Psub^ and age at enrollment. The subjects were then assigned to one of nine age groups on the basis of their entry age: 17-19, 20-29, 30-39, . . . , and 90-94 years. Within each age group, the subject-specific slopes and entry ages were averaged to produce a decadespecific mean slope and a decade-specific entry age, as well as their associated standard errors. A two-stage random effects model allows for unbalanced and incomplete data. Each subject may have had his or her height measured a different number of times, resulting in unbalanced data. In the data series for any subject, data for one or more of the \"scheduled\" collections times may not have been obtained, resulting in incomplete data.\nTo quantify the rate at which the slope of height on age changes with age, sex-specific regressions were performed in .which the subject-specific slopes of height on age (Psubject fr\u00b0m the linear model above) were regressed on entry age in a quadratic model. The following quadratic equation was used: Ps^ect = Po + Pi(Age -Age) + p 2 (Age -Age) 2 where Psubject = the slope of height on age for a specific subject Age = the subject's age at entry to the study Age = the sex-specific mean age of the subjects included in this study This analysis quantifies the rate at which the slope of height on age (i.e., the velocity of height change, Psubject) changes with age; it gives (through the coefficients P! and p 2 ) the acceleration or deceleration in the rate of height loss that occurs with aging.\nThe effect of initial height on the rate of height loss (Psubject) was assessed by adding entry height to the sex-specific quadratic equations relating age to the velocity of height loss: Psubject = Po + Pi(Age -Age) + P 2 (Age -Age) 2 "}, {"section_title": "+ Height Atentry", "text": "To enable the statistical significance of the coefficients of the quadratic models (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) to be interpretable, that is, to eliminate the colinearity of age and age 2 , the regressions were performed by using \"centered\" terms for age and age 2 (6) .

The cumulative longitudinal changes in height of men and women that occur over the adult life span, from young adult life (e.g., age 20 years) to late life (e.g., age 80 years), were calculated by integrating, with respect to age, the equations relating the longitudinal slope of height to age:"}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal Change in Height of Men and Women 971", "text": "where dAge indicates that the integration is performed with respect to age.\nThe cumulative change in height was used to determine the change in BMI associated with loss of height, assuming weight remains constant:\nChange in BMI = weight initia^h eight illitW -I (p 0 + p,(Age -Age) + p 2 (Age -Age) 2 )dAge where weightj nitial = the weight at the youngest age heighti nitial = the height at the youngest age"}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cross-sectional", "text": "Among both men and women, cross-sectional height decreased with age (figure 1, table 1).

The curvilinear relation shows that height was lost at an increasing rate with increasing age. For men, age explained 14 percent of the variance in height (equation 1, appendix). For women, age explained 22 percent of the variance (equation 2, appendix).

A total of 390 women, aged 17-93 years (mean, 53.5) at entry, were followed for an average of 9 years. The follow-up period ranged from 1.9 to 33.7 years. Subjects' height was measured three or more times. During follow-up, men had their height measured an average of nine times, women five times.

The rate of loss was statistically significantly more rapid among women than among men in the age groups 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 years. (In the age group 40-49 years, the rate of loss was more rapid among women than among men, p < 0.06.) The rate at which women lost height increased more rapidly with age than it did for men. Thus, the difference between the sex-specific slopes increased progressively from age 30-39 through 80-89 years (table 2) . For both men and women, the slopes were significantly negative in the five decades of 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80-89 years.

The combination of age, age 2 , and initial height explained 33 percent of the variance in the rate of loss of height (equation 7, appendix), the same proportion that was explained by using a model that contained only age and age 2 (equation 3, appendix). In an equivalent analysis for women, the coefficient for the height term was not significant at p = 0.60. Although initial height was a statistically significant predictor of the rate of height loss for men, the effect was relatively small compared with the effect of aging. The effect of initial height across the entire range of heights of BLSA males was to increase the rate of height loss 0.054 cm/year for the tallest compared with the shortest men. For men, the addition of initial height to the equation giving slope as a function of age made only minor changes to the value of the intercept and the coefficients of age and age 2 .

Evaluation of the sexspecific integrals for any two ages (e.g., 20 and 80 years) produces the difference between the heights at the two ages, the change in height that occurs over the 60-year period from age 20 to 80 years.

The results of our study demonstrated that in the 60-year period from age 20 to 80 years, BMI increased by an average of 1.5 kg/m 2 for men and 2.5 kg/m 2 for women (figure 5), independent of any change in weight."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our results show that in the BLSA population, men and women lose height with age (cross-sectional analysis) and with aging (longitudinal analysis). The relation between height and aging is curvilinear for men (both the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were statistically significantly quadratic) and somewhat curvilinear for women (the cross-sectional association was statistically significantly quadratic, and the longitudinal association was suggestive at p < 0.16), indicating that the rate of height loss increases with increasing age (figures 1 and 2) . The increasing rate of height loss with aging is evident in the decadespecific longitudinal slopes of height on age (table 2) , which become increasingly negative with increasing age. Women lose height more rapidly than men do; the sex difference is not significant cross-sectionally but is highly significant longitudinally. Interestingly, for women, the decline in height is almost identical in Age (years) FIGURE 5 . Average change in body mass index (BMI) associated with change in height (assuming constant weight) during adult life for men and women in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Baltimore, Maryland, 1958-1993. Loss of height associated with aging was computed by integrating the sex-specific longitudinal equations relating slope to age, resulting in equations that related height to age.

However, for men, the rate of decline is significantly larger in cross-sectional (-0.147 cm/year) than in longitudinal (-0.091 cm/year) analysis.\nThe equality for women and the inequality for men are consistent with a secular or cohort effect for men but not for women. Cohort differences in height must reflect influences during the earlier years of life (intrautero to the end of development). The reason that the BLSA men but not the women show this cohort effect is not clear. Several factors could contribute: 1) The sample size is smaller for women than for men; 2) changes in nutritional practices may have occurred differently for boys and girls; and 3) even though recruitment techniques were the same for the men and women in the BLSA study, it is possible that there were differences in the ethnic or cultural makeup of the men and women recruited over the years, but we are not aware of any such differences."}, {"section_title": "Implications of loss of height for interpretation of the BMI", "text": "The change in height associated with aging has implications for interpretation of the BMI, a commonly used index of adiposity. The rationale for \"correcting\" weight for height is obvious. BMI is generally assumed to be an age-invariant measure of obesity, that is, a given BMI at age 20 years is tacitly assumed to measure the same degree of obesity at ages 20, 30,..., and 90 years. Because BMI is inversely proportional to the square of height, even a small change in height might have a large effect on BMI. The change in height with age has a substantial and increasing effect on BMI beyond middle age (figure 5). In the 60-year period from age 20 to 80 years, BMI on average will increase by 1.5 kg/m 2 for men and 2.5 kg/m 2 for women (figure 5), independent of any change in weight. Therefore, the tacit assumption that BMI measures the same degree of obesity at all ages is incorrect. BMI values increase with age as height decreases, which could lead to an interpretation that obesity has increased. To our knowledge, the values shown in figure 5 represent the first attempt to quantify this artifact.\nAlthough loss of height with aging has a substantial effect on BMI, the relatively minor quantitative effect on BMI of loss of height with aging on the interpretation of guidelines for best weight for height can be appreciated by comparing the height artifact with several published recommendations for optimal BMI at increasing ages. Table 3 presents the optimal BMI at specific ages and the BMI changes due solely to height loss for men and for women. From age 22 to 70 years, the optimum increase in BMI according to the . t The Gerontology Research Center, National Research Council, and Dietary Guidelines for Americans tables are not sex specific, that is, separate tables for men and women were not deemed necessary. In the Metropolitan Life Insurance tables, the BMIs at the midpoint for a medium frame are the same for men and women at their sexspecific average heights: heights were corrected for shoe height (1 inch for men and women; 1 inch = 2.54 cm), and weights were corrected for weight of clothes (5 pounds for men, 3 pounds for women; 1 pound = 0.45 kg).\nGerontology Research Center table (7) (11) do not recommend an increase in BMI with aging. The increase in weight recommended by both the National Research Council and the Gerontology Research Center is significantly larger than that attributable to the age-related loss of height alone.\nIf the denominator in the equation used to calculate BMI (weight/height 2 ) is decreased, the age-associated loss of height artifactually increases the BMI without increasing true adiposity. The artifact becomes important for men after age 50 years and for women 10 years earlier (figure 5). To our knowledge, this artifact has not been quantified previously. However, height is not the only aspect of body composition that changes with age. There is also loss of lean body mass (primarily muscle) and usually an increase in adipose tissue mass. The effect of these changes is to increase true adiposity (percent body fat). The effects of the loss of height and of lean body mass with aging are therefore opposite: height loss increases apparent obesity through an artifactual increase in BMI, while loss of muscle mass (with its consequent decrease in weight) makes older subjects appear less obese than they truly are. Thus, interpretation of any given BMI across the age span as it pertains to partitioning the body into fat and fat-free mass is complex, and a simple adjustment of the observed BMI for height loss will not make BMI an age-invariant measure."}, {"section_title": "Suggestions for future studies", "text": "Our study population was limited to White men and women, and we are unaware of any study of longitudinal change in height in non-White populations. Studies of non-White populations are clearly needed. During each BLSA visit, each subject's height was measured only once. Therefore, we have no data on the reliability of repeated height measurements, a limitation of our study that should be avoided in future studies. Of note, we recently completed a review of the world's literature describing longitudinal change in height (2) . None of the papers we found provided data describing the reliability of repeated height measurements."}]
