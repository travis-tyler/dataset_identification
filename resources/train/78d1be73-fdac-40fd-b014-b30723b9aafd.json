Connecticut River as the primary freshwater 14 source enters near the sound's mouth. The summertime pathways of river water under low 15 discharge and mild wind conditions are studied through both numerical simulations with a 16 passive dye pulse and field surface drifter observations. Within the 19-day modeling analysis 17 period, a third of the river dye pulse moves up-estuary with the near-bottom dense inflow into 18 central and western sound with a spring-neap tidal modulation; another third leaves the sound 19 with the near-surface outflow towards the continental shelf through Block Island Sound. The 20 latter pathway is confirmed by field surface drifter tracks. Three scenarios of wind forcing are 21 tested: a WRF-ROMS Coupled case, a NARR data forcing case, and a No-Wind case. The 22 results show though the sound is tidal mixing dominated, mild winds still alter the position and 23 strength of the estuarine exchange either enhanced by the cross-estuary winds or through lateral 24 straining. On the shelf, winds play a more important role on the fresher estuarine water 25 distribution. The sensitivities of circulation, salinity, and numerical drifter tracks to different 26 atmospheric forcings also are studied. The results suggest that the coupled model has better 27 performance to simulate surface drifter tracks.\n28 Plain Language Summary\n29 Connecticut River is the primary freshwater source to Long Island Sound. It enters near the 30 sound mouth, where dense continental shelf water intrudes in. The aims are to find out where the 31 summer river waters go and what drives it. In particular, the mild wind impacts on the river 32 water distributions are studied. Simulations with a river water dye pulse show two main 33 pathways simultaneously: in 19 days, a third of the river water moves toward the sound head 34 with a near-bottom dense inflow; another third of the river water leaves through the sound mouth 35 at the surface and later on enters onto the shelf. The latter pathway is confirmed by field surface 36 drifter tracks. Three scenarios of wind forcing are tested: a spatial varied wind case, a relatively 37 spatial uniform wind case, and a no wind case. The results show winds speedup the up-estuary 38 transport of the river water in central sound. On the continental shelf, winds play a more 39 important role on the estuarine outflow distribution. Results suggest the spatial varied wind 40 model has better performance on modeling surface drifter tracks. This study gives a clear picture 41 on the summertime Connecticut River water pathways and the related dynamics.\n\n42 Index Terms and Keywords\n43 4235 Estuarine processes, 4219 Continental shelf and slope processes, 4534 Hydrodynamic 44 modeling, 4536 Hydrography and tracers, 3339 Ocean/atmosphere interactions\n45 Connecticut River, freshwater pathway, dye, drifter, ROMS, WRF\n\n46 1 Introduction\n\n47\n\nRiverine freshwater inflows, tides, and winds control estuarine circulation. Typically,\n\n48 riverine freshwater generates vertical and horizontal density gradients such that density increases\n\n49 with depth and towards the estuary mouth. The combination of this buoyancy and tidal mixing\n\n50 often leads to a two-layer gravitational flow with surface outflow of fresher water and bottom\n\n51 inflow of saline water (Geyer & MacCready, 2014). In wider estuaries or with cross-estuary\n\n52 bathymetry variations, the outflow and inflow layers can be laterally (as well as vertically) offset\n\n2\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n53 from each other (e.g. Valle-Levinson et al., 2003; Whitney et al., 2016). Such exchange flow can 54 adjust with spring-neap tidal variations (Ribeiro et al., 2004).\n\n55\n\nThe Connecticut River flows into the Long Island Sound (LIS), a large (160 km length)\n\n56 and wide (30 km maximum width) macrotidal estuary on the northeast U.S. coast. The sound is\n\n57 resonant to semi-diurnal lunar (M2) tides due to its length and bathymetry (20 m average depth)\n\n58 (Wong, 1991). The Connecticut River enters near the sound mouth where tidal currents are 59 strong (~1 ms-1) and contributes approximately 72% of riverine inflow to the sound (Koppelman\n\n60 et al., 1976). Having the primary river entering closer to the estuarine mouth than the head is a\n\n61 major departure from most other estuaries. The positioning of the riverine inflow may create a\n\n62 residual flow field with distinct differences from the classic two-layer gravitational estuarine\n\n63 flow pattern.\n\n64\n\nDuring summertime the Connecticut River discharge (Figure 2) is lower than average\n\n65 (550 m3s-1). Garvine (1975) observed the summer river plume bulge is only 4 km offshore. Tidal\n\n66 motion exerts a strong influence on the plume nearfield salinity distribution. Yet recent studies\n\n67 (Codiga & Aurin, 2007; Whitney et al., 2016) with both observations and numerical methods\n\n68 indicate the upper-layer fresher outflow through eastern LIS is centered to the south (on the\n\n69 opposite side from the Connecticut River mouth) and the lower-layer saline inflow is centered to\n\n70 the north. Links between the river plume and the estuarine exchange flow need to be further\n\n71 studied.\n\n72\n\nWind-driven circulation in large lakes and estuaries with homogenous density are well\n\n73 studied analytically (Csanady, 1973; Winant, 2004). The general flow pattern is downwind in\n\n74 shallow water and upwind in deep water. Winds also play important roles on modifying density\n\n75 structure. Strong winds, such as winter storms (e.g. Goodrich et al., 1987; Whitney & Codiga,\n\n76 2011) and hurricanes (Li et al., 2007), can decrease/break stratification by enhancing vertical\n\n77 mixing; while moderate winds increase stratification by straining along-estuary density gradient\n\n78 (Scully et al., 2005).\n\n79\n\nLIS is wide enough that winds impact can be important in both along- and cross-estuary\n\n80 directions. Whitney and Codiga (2011) found strong along-estuary wind events cause more\n\n81 laterally aligned flows, especially during down-estuary wind events (winter dominant winds over\n\n82 LIS). In summer, winds are weaker, but can have significant spatial variations. Observations and\n\n83 model simulations found summer sea breezes develop along the shorelines of LIS (Sinsky, 2016).\n\n84 However, the role of moderate winds on freshwater distribution and estuarine exchange flow in\n\n85 LIS is still unclear.\n\n86\n\nRegional atmospheric models are well suited to force various real-time models in Mid-\n\n87 Atlantic Bight (Wilkin & Hunter, 2013). However, those 10-30 km resolution models may\n\n88 underestimate wind impacts on estuarine circulation (Scully, 2010; Xie & Li, 2018) and cause\n\n89 errors on predicting surface drifter trajectories (Cucco et al., 2016). Especially, when estuaries\n\n90 are at similar or smaller scales to the forcing resolution. Consequently, observed wind fields or\n\n91 higher resolution modeled winds are needed. Furthermore, two-way coupling may be\n\n92 advantageous for representing wind influence.\n\n93\n\nThere are three objectives of this study. First, detect summertime Connecticut River\n\n94 water pathways in LIS and its ambient water. Second, describe influences of moderate winds on\n\n95 freshwater distribution and estuarine exchange flow. Third, characterize the sensitivity of river\n\n96 water pathways to the treatment of wind forcing (i.e., coupled high-resolution model vs. low-\n\n3\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n97 resolution reanalysis product). The following sections describe methods, results, discussion, and 98 conclusions.\n\n99 2 Methods\n\n100\n\n2.1 Model configuration\n\n101\n\nThe Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is applied to simulate conditions in LIS\n\n102 and the adjacent waters. ROMS is a free-surface, terrain-following (S-coordinates, Song &\n\n103 Haidvogel, 1994), primitive-equation ocean circulation model solving the nonlinear momentum,\n\n104 mass, and tracer conservation equations under hydrostatic and Boussinesq approximations\n\n105 (Haidvogel et al., 2000). Horizontal momentum advection is approximated with a third-order\n\n106 upstream biased and a fourth-order centered scheme for 3D and 2D (vertically-integrated)\n\n107 equations, respectively. A fourth-order centered scheme is applied for vertical advection. These 108 options represent the current default settings in ROMS. A 3rd High-order Spatial Interpolation at\n\n109 the Middle Temporal level (HSIMT; Wu & Zhu, 2010) advection scheme is applied to tracer\n\n110 equations for this study. The generic length scale (GLS) method k-epsilon closure scheme is\n\n111 used for the parameterization of vertical turbulent viscosity and diffusivity. Quadratic bottom 112 friction is prescribed with the bottom drag coefficient of 3\u00d710-3 in most areas. The bottom drag\n\n113 coefficient is enlarged to 5 times in eastern LIS (ELIS) and the adjacent west half of Block\n\n114 Island Sound (BIS) for depths 20 to 85 m in order to obtain better water level simulation results\n\n115 compared to NOAA tidal station data in LIS (New London, New Haven, Bridgeport, CT &\n\n116 Kings Point, NY) and better tidal current results compared to observed depth-averaged M2 tidal\n\n117 currents (Bennett et al., 2010). A similar drag coefficient increase is used in Whitney and Codiga\n\n118 (2011).\n\n119\n\nThe model domain includes the entire LIS and covers its surrounding shelf regions\n\n120 extending from Cape Cod to New Jersey (Figure 1). Both the x- and y-directions are 9.5\u00ba\n\n121 counterclockwise from the east and north, respectively. Note that the model domain and settings\n\n122 are not the same as used in Whitney et al. (2016), though they share many similarities. The\n\n123 horizontal resolution varies from 500 m to 2 km, with the finest resolution inside LIS. Vertically\n\n124 there are 30 sigma layers that are evenly distributed throughout the water column. The\n\n125 bathymetry data is from the NOAA National Centers for Environment Information (NCEI) 3 arc-\n\n126 second U.S. Coastal Relief Model (CRM, http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/coastal/crm.html). A\n\n127 low-pass filter with a 1 km radius is applied to the bathymetry data. Along the open boundaries,\n\n128 sea surface elevation and depth-averaged velocity have Chapman (1985) and Flather (1976)\n\n129 boundary conditions, respectively. These conditions are imposed with both subtidal ocean\n\n130 variables from the HYbird Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and eight semidiurnal and\n\n131 diurnal harmonic tidal constituents (M2, S2, N2, K2, K1, O1, P1 & Q1) supplied from the OSU\n\n132 TOPEX/Poseidon Global Inverse Solution TPXO (Egbert & Erofeeva, 2002). The Orlanski\n\n133 radiation boundary condition (Orlanski, 1976) is applied to 3D velocity and all tracers.\n\n134 According to tests, modeled salinity with original HYCOM forcing is saltier than a 4-yr\n\n135 observational record from Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory\n\n136 (http://www.whoi.edu/mvco/ocean-data) near the model's east boundary. And the wintertime\n\n137 HYCOM temperature is warmer than observations. Modifications are applied to HYCOM data to\n\n138 get better simulations matching with the observations: Salinity is reduced by 0.93 from year day\n\n139 160 to 240; during other times, it is reduced by 0.6. And the maximum salinity is fixed to 34. 140 Temperature is not modified from year day 71 to 200 but HYCOM data is reduced by 2 oC\n\n4\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n141 during in the rest period. Velocity, temperature, and salinity are daily nudged to the modified 142 HYCOM data at the open boundaries.\n\n143\n\nDaily river discharge is supplied from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water\n\n144 Information System (http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) and is scaled up to include the ungauged\n\n145 area. There are four major rivers including the Connecticut, Housatonic, Thames, and Hudson\n\n146 Rivers, and 75 small rivers and non-river coastal watersheds. Two large wastewater treatment 147 outfalls with steady discharges of 31 and 15 m3s-1 are added in East River, NY.\n\n148\n\nThree types of surface forcing are tested: 1. The \"Coupled case\" couples ROMS with\n\n149 Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) to provide atmospheric forcing with a high\n\n150 degree of spatial variability. This process is done by applying the Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-\n\n151 Wave-Sediment Transport Modeling System (COAWST, Warner et al., 2008, 2010). 2. \"No-\n\n152 Wind case\" turns off the wind stress but keeps the surface heat fluxes and air pressure from WRF\n\n153 as in the Coupled case. 3. The \"NARR case\" uses the 32-km resolution North America Regional\n\n154 Reanalysis (NARR, Mesinger et al., 2006) data to force the model with relatively low spatial\n\n155 variability.\n\n156\n\nFor the Coupled case, WRF contains three domains (Figure 1). A 9-km horizontal\n\n157 resolution large domain covers the northeast coast of U.S. Two nested domains are centered on\n\n158 LIS, with 3-km and 1-km horizontal resolutions, respectively. There are 30 vertical layers in\n\n159 WRF. Details of the WRF settings and modification to the NARR data near the coastal region\n\n160 are included in Lombardo et al. (2016). WRF directly supplies shortwave radiation, longwave\n\n161 radiation, latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, wind stress, and air pressure to ROMS. ROMS\n\n162 updates sea surface temperature to WRF. The data exchanging interval is 0.5 hours. The WRF\n\n163 model spins up for 24 hours before coupling with ROMS.\n\n164\n\nFor the NARR case, ROMS applies bulk formulae (Fairall et al., 2003) to compute\n\n165 surface fluxes of momentum, sensible, latent, and longwave heat. The surface winds, humidity,\n\n166 air temperature, surface pressure, net shortwave radiation, and downward long wave radiation\n\n167 are supplied from NARR. A 5-year (2011-2015) comparison of NARR surface air temperature to\n\n168 the NOAA buoy data (http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov) in LIS (Figure 1, marked as white triangles)\n\n169 shows that NARR typically underestimates the wintertime air temperature. By filling gaps from\n\n170 nearby buoys, a group of 5-year time series of buoy air temperature data is obtained. Then signal\n\n171 periods shorter than 20 days are filtered by using a fast Fourier transform, to obtain reconstructed\n\n172 air temperature data. The observation-based air temperature time series are used to replace the\n\n173 original NARR air temperature over water.\n\n174\n\nThe three tests are initialized from a same long-term spin-up run which starts at January 1,\n\n175 2011 forced by NARR data with other settings the same as described above. The spin-up run is\n\n176 stabilized after two years. All cases run for 19 days starting on 21 August 2013, during spring 177 tides (Figure 2, top panel). The neap tides occur at the 16th M2 tidal cycle. The study period is\n\n178 characterized by low discharge from the Connecticut River. The averaged river discharge is 250 179 m3s-1 (Figure 2, second panel), which is half to the annual mean value.\n\n180\n\nThe passive tracer computational capabilities of ROMS are used to track the Connecticut\n\n181 River water. To accomplish this, a pulse of dye (a conservative passive tracer) is released at 12\n\n182 km upstream from the river mouth, where the salinity is 0 throughout the water column. The dye 183 has a unit concentration and is released with a constant 10 m3s-1 flux for one M2 tidal cycle. It\n\n5\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n184 takes about one day for the dye to reach the river mouth, by which time it has completely mixed 185 through the Connecticut River freshwater.\n\n186\n\n2.2 Surface drifters\n\n187\n\nSix CODE/DAVIS type satellite-tracked surface drifters were deployed in the\n\n188 Connecticut River plume near the river mouth from R/V Lowell Weicker. Releasing started two\n\n189 hours before the daytime high tide, with a ~1-hour interval, on 21 August 2013. The drifter floats\n\n190 within the top 1-m water and reports position every half hour. Three drifters reported useful\n\n191 positions longer than 17 days. The longest one lasted for 28 days. The low-cost hand-built\n\n192 drifters were designed by J. P. Manning at NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service\n\n193 (www.nefsc.noaa.gov/drifter/).\n\n194\n\nIn order to evaluate the drifter track's sensitivity to various wind forcing, six 1-m isobaric\n\n195 numerical drifters are released in each of the three model runs at the same times and locations as\n\n196 the field drifters. Furthermore, a cluster of 275 1-m deep isobaric numerical drifters is released\n\n197 from 11 grid cells at the river mouth to obtain statistical information on drifter tracks They are\n\n198 released with half hour interval during the field operational tidal cycle.\n\n199\n\n2.3 LIS survey data\n\n200\n\nThe Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT-DEEP)\n\n201 conducted a regular survey in LIS during 27~29 August 2013. Comparison of salinity and\n\n202 temperature along the sound's channel show, for all three cases, the root-mean-square-error\n\n203 (RMSE) of salinity and temperature is ~0.44 and ~2.2 \u00b0C, respectively. Both RMSE are largely\n\n204 due to bias at this period. The model results are saltier and warmer than observations. However,\n\n205 the salinity and temperature gradient structures are well captured by the models. Deignan-\n\n206 Schmidt and Whitney (2017) reported, compared to CT-DEEP, RMSE of salinity and\n\n207 temperature are 0.89 and 2.28 \u00b0C, respectively, during summer 2013 with a model setup of\n\n208 similar to Whitney and Codiga (2011).\n\n209 3 Results\n\n210\n\n3.1 Summertime winds over LIS\n\n211\n\nThere are conspicuous differences in the wind forcing among runs, therefore it is\n\n212 important to first compare model winds with observations in LIS. The time mean of spatial 213 averaged wind speeds are 4.9, 4.3, and 3.9 ms-1 for WRF, NARR, and buoy data, respectively.\n\n214 Overall, winds during the modeling period are mild. The squared correlation coefficients for the\n\n215 spatial averaged WRF and NARR U-wind (along-estuary) with the buoy wind are 0.74 and 0.79,\n\n216 respectively; the corresponding values are 0.87 and 0.79 for the V-wind (cross-estuary). In\n\n217 general, both the WRF and NARR winds display similar synoptic weather time scale variations\n\n218 to the buoy data (Figure 2), but also have obvious differences on individual wind events.\n\n219\n\n3.2 Summertime hydrographic patterns in LIS and its ambient water\n\n220\n\nThe Connecticut River significantly impacts the salinity field in ELIS. Observations show\n\n221 during high discharge the river front extends more than 10 km toward the sound mouth at low\n\n222 slack water (Garvine, 1974); while the low discharged river plume is only 4 km offshore\n\n223 (Garvine, 1975). Time averaged results show (Figure 3) the Connecticut River plume only\n\n6\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n224 spreads 2 km offshore at the surface and spreads farther westward than eastward. A salt tongue 225 extends from the sound mouth into central LIS (CLIS). Such intrusion is more pronounced at the 226 bottom. It fills the isobaths bounding the deepest areas west of the Mattituck Sill. 227 Correspondingly in LIS, bottom flow moves up-estuary westward and surface flow moves down228 estuary. This aspect of the sound's circulation is consistent with the typical two-layer estuarine 229 exchange flow pattern. On the shelf, the fresher estuarine surface outflow propagates down the 230 Long Island coast.\n\n231\n\n3.3 Summertime Connecticut River water pathways\n\n232\n\nThe progression of Connecticut River waters is revealed by tracking a simulated dye (or\n\n233 passive tracer) pulse originating from the river. Dye distribution progressions are examined using\n\n234 the tidal averaged water-column maximum dye concentrations (Figure 4, top row). For the\n\n235 Coupled case, after 11 tidal cycles, the higher concentration dye (hereafter named \"dye core\") is\n\n236 mostly in ELIS, especially around the river mouth. The eastern edge of the dye has passed\n\n237 through BIS and reaches the shelf; while the western edge just slowly extends over the Mattituck 238 Sill. At the 19th tidal cycle, three tidal cycles after the neap tide, the dye core moves over the sill.\n\n239 After 36 tidal cycles, it has spread along the deep channel in CLIS and WLIS, with a branch\n\n240 attaching to the north shore. Such dye distribution pattern reveals the preferred up-estuary\n\n241 pathways of the Connecticut River water. In BIS and on the shelf, though the concentration is\n\n242 much lower than in the up-estuary areas, the dye spreads faster down- and cross-shelf. At the end,\n\n243 the dye core area is order magnitude smaller than the total dye spreading.\n\n244\n\nThe distribution of Connecticut River water is further studied with along-estuary section\n\n245 views of dye concentration and salinity (Figure 5, top row). At the 11th tidal cycle, the maximum\n\n246 dye concentration in the Coupled case is at the surface of S5 (the nearest section grid to the river\n\n247 mouth). Stratification occurs at 10-m shallower in the dye core region. The dye's western edge\n\n248 reaches the Mattituck Sill. While the 29-isohaline locates east of the sill. After the neap tides, at 249 the 19th tidal cycle, the strongest stratification in ELIS is established, which extends deeper than\n\n250 20 m. Meanwhile, both the dye core and the 29-isohaline has passed the sill along the bottom. At\n\n251 the end, the bottom intruding dye reaches the boundary of WLIS and CLIS. And the arriving of\n\n252 the 29-isohaline enhances stratification in CLIS. At the down-estuary side, the dye is well diluted\n\n253 vertically.\n\n254\n\nAnalyzing time series of dye storage adds quantitative details on the dye spread (Figure\n\n255 6). For the Coupled case, before the neap tide (the 16th tidal cycle), total dye storage in ELIS\n\n256 decreases slowly; but the dye storage 10-m below keeps increasing and exceeds 50%. Between 257 the 20th and 25th tidal cycle, 28% dye quickly leaves ELIS. Among that nearly 20% moves into\n\n258 CLIS primarily through the lower layer. The dye storage in BIS also peaks during this period.\n\n259 The total storage peaks near 30% in CLIS and starts dropping after the dye entering WLIS. 260 Finally, about 5% of the dye enters WLIS, mainly through bottom. After 36th tidal cycles, the\n\n261 dye is about equally stored in ELIS, up-estuary in CLIS and WLIS, and down-estuary in BIS and\n\n262 the shelf. The up-estuary transport is largely associated with the timing of the spring-neap tides.\n\n263\n\nIn order to detect the Connecticut River water surface pathways, six satellite-tracked\n\n264 surface observational drifters were deployed on 21 August 2013 inside the river plume near its\n\n265 mouth (Figure 7, upper left). All drifters reached the sound mouth within three tidal cycles. One\n\n266 (black) was captured by a boat. The rest drifted into BIS through the southwest corner of Fishers\n\n267 Island after three days. Three tidal cycles later, one grounded at Fishers Island due to south\n\n7\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n268 winds. Three of the remaining four went southward across BIS in day 6, 7, and 8, respectively. 269 Then they moved downshelf with the estuarine buoyant outflow. One took three weeks first 270 circling around Block Island clockwise then moved farther cross-shelf.\n\n271\n\nIn the Coupled case, six 1-m isobaric simulated drifters are released at the same times and\n\n272 locations as the field drifters to conduct one-on-one comparison (Figure 7, upper right). All six\n\n273 drifters reached the sound mouth in three to four tidal cycles and entered BIS after 2.5 days.\n\n274 Later on, the simulated drifter tracks capture both the southern cross-sound and the northern\n\n275 circle-island routes. Both the field and modeled drifter tracks reveal the surface down-estuary\n\n276 pathways of Connecticut River water during summertime low discharge condition.\n\n277\n\n3.4 Roles of winds\n\n278\n\n3.4.1 Impacts on river water pathways\n\n279\n\nCompared to the Coupled case, eliminating wind stress alters the dye pulse distribution\n\n280 and the corresponding movement timing (Figure 4, middle row). After 11 tidal cycles, the No-\n\n281 Wind case dye travels slower in the down-estuary direction. However, eight tidal cycles later, its\n\n282 downshelf edge surpasses the Coupled one. At the end, the No-Wind case dye spreads more\n\n283 downshelf and less cross-shelf. In LIS, the dye core travels slower up-estuary but with higher\n\n284 concentration. That indicates the Coupled case has stronger bottom inflow. The along-estuary\n\n285 section views show (Figure 5, middle row) the up-estuary intrusion enters near-bottom after the\n\n286 neap tides. In addition, without wind stress, less dye is mixed into the upper layer in CLIS.\n\n287\n\nBefore the neap tides, more No-Wind dye stays in ELIS and less moves to BIS compared\n\n288 to the Coupled case (Figure 6). However, the main difference occurs during the up-estuary\n\n289 transport stage. Although they both reach a final storage around 30% in CLIS, the No-Wind case\n\n290 dye increases at a slower rate; while the Coupled one increases sharply before reaching a relative\n\n291 steady storage. Less No-Wind case dye moves into WLIS. Despite these notable differences, the\n\n292 squared correlation coefficients of the dye distribution between cases is 0.61.\n\n293\n\nThe one-on-one drifter track comparisons show (Figure 7, lower right) all the No-Wind\n\n294 drifters leave LIS. But their down-estuary tracks are more confined to the western BIS and later\n\n295 along the coast of Long Island.\n\n296\n\nTo obtain more statistically meaningful intercomparison from the drifter simulations, a\n\n297 large drifter cluster is released from the Connecticut River mouth. Counting the number of\n\n298 drifters passing certain grid highlights the preferable drifter pathways for each case (Figure 8).\n\n299 Similar to the one-on-one comparison, all drifters in both the Coupled and No-Wind cases move\n\n300 down-estuary mainly past the southwest corner of the Fishers Island (through `the Race'). In BIS\n\n301 there is a southern route for drifter moving onto the shelf. Pathway differences are better\n\n302 displayed outside LIS. More Coupled case drifters circle around BIS and move farther cross-\n\n303 shelf; while over a hundred of the No-Wind case drifters travel the same downshelf route.\n\n304\n\nIn general, mild westerly winds spread the river water farther offshore on the shelf at\n\n305 surface. In LIS, the presence of wind quickens the bottom up-estuary transport of the river water\n\n306 and also brings more bottom river water to the surface.\n\n307\n\n3.4.2 Impacts on salinity and circulation\n\n8\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n308\n\nThe Coupled case standard deviation of salinity decreases from LIS to the shelf and\n\n309 decreases from surface to bottom (Table 1). The No-Wind case has similar patterns, with slightly\n\n310 higher surface values. The standard deviation of velocities show the Coupled case has more\n\n311 variations in x-direction than the No-Wind case both in LIS and on the shelf. The percentage of\n\n312 RMSE relative to the standard deviation of the Coupled case (Table 2) shows shutting down the\n\n313 wind causes a similar level of velocity alteration both in LIS and on the shelf. However, salinity\n\n314 is more impacted on the shelf. Especially at the surface, where the modification is nearly four\n\n315 times to that in LIS. Generally, winds have higher impact on the shelf salinity than in LIS.\n\n316\n\nOverall, comparisons of the dye pulse and salinity distributions between the Coupled and\n\n317 No-Wind cases indicate the summer wind forcing appreciably influence estuarine and\n\n318 particularly shelf dynamic structures, even though winds are mild.\n\n319\n\n3.5 Influence of wind resolution\n\n320\n\n3.5.1 Winds comparison\n\n321\n\nIn LIS, both the WRF and NARR winds show similar level of temporal variations\n\n322 compared to the buoy data (Table 3). However, the WRF winds' spatial variation, like the buoy\n\n323 winds, is one order of magnitude higher than the NARR winds. In addition, multiregional\n\n324 statistics show the V-component (cross-estuary) of WRF winds has more spatial variation than\n\n325 its U-component (along-estuary), especially in LIS (Table 1).\n\n326\n\n3.5.2 Impacts on river water pathways\n\n327\n\nDye pulse distribution differences between the NARR and Coupled cases show up after\n\n328 the neap tides (19th tidal cycle, Figure 4 & 5 bottom rows). The up-estuary leading edge in the\n\n329 NARR case moves faster than the Coupled one. It is almost half way through CLIS. And its dye\n\n330 core has higher concentration. On the shelf, the dyed area in NARR case is larger and spreads\n\n331 farther offshore than the Coupled case. At the end of the analysis period, more NARR case dye\n\n332 moves into WLIS through the deep channel (Figure 5, between S2 & S3). By this time, the dye\n\n333 pattern on the shelf is differed from the Coupled one, which travels farther downshelf. The\n\n334 squared correlation coefficients of the dye distribution between cases is 0.81.\n\n335\n\nCompared to the Coupled case, the NARR case up-estuary dye transport starts right\n\n336 around the neap tide, occurring three tidal cycles earlier (Figure 6). Eventually, 4% more dye is\n\n337 transported into CLIS. However, the overall patterns of dye transport are similar between the two 338 cases. Both enters WLIS around the 27th tidal cycle, which is five tidal cycles earlier than the\n\n339 No-Wind one.\n\n340\n\nNARR drifters from both the one-on-one comparison (Figure 7, lower left) and the drifter\n\n341 cluster (Figure 8, right) display more similarities on the downshelf tracks to the observations. But\n\n342 the one-on-one comparison does not capture the northern circle-island route. And compared to\n\n343 the Coupled case, the NARR drifter cluster is less dispersed on the shelf, especially during the\n\n344 downshelf transport.\n\n345\n\n3.5.3 Impacts on salinity and circulation\n\n346\n\nFor the standard deviation comparison, the NARR case has identical values to the\n\n347 Coupled one, except a higher surface salinity and lower U velocities on the shelf (Table 1). The\n\n348 percentages of RMSE relative to the standard deviation of the Coupled case (Table 2) show the\n\n9\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n349 velocity variations are in similar level in LIS and on the shelf, but surface salinity is more 350 sensitive to wind variation on the shelf.\n\n351\n\n3.6 Momentum diagnostics of the estuarine exchange flow in CLIS\n\n352\n\nThe dye pulse movement differences in CLIS indicate that the early stage of bottom\n\n353 intrusion (20th ~25th tidal cycle) is a key period to study differences in the exchange flow\n\n354 between cases. Along sect-C (Figure 9, left column), the bottom inflow and surface outflow are\n\n355 bounded by the pycnocline for all cases. The isohalines tilt up northward but with noticeable\n\n356 differences between cases. The Coupled case has the strongest exchange flow, ranging from 357 0.14 to 0.17 ms-1; the NARR case is slightly weaker, but with a strong cross-estuary salinity\n\n358 gradient in the middle depth; while the No-Wind case is the weakest and is nearly half the\n\n359 Coupled case.\n\n360\n\nTidal-averaged momentum analysis is used to further describe the conspicuous\n\n361 differences among cases that are evident in the estuarine exchange flow and salinity structure at\n\n362 section-C (Figure 9, left column). The cross-estuary component of the total pressure gradient\n\n363 term (Figure 9, center column) and along-estuary flow share similar patterns (particularly for the\n\n364 NARR and No-Wind cases), suggesting a geostrophic connection. The corresponding baroclinic\n\n365 term (Figure 9, right column) is chiefly related to the cross-estuary salinity gradient.\n\n366\n\nMomentum balances that are averaged over section-C analyzed (Figure 10) where the\n\n367 sign convention has all the terms on the right-hand side (consistent with ROMS diagnostics)\n\n368 balancing the time averaged local acceleration (that is negligible at this time). Due to the\n\n369 eastward narrowing of the sound, the along-estuary horizontal advection is a big term in all cases,\n\n370 suggesting tides always play important roles with or without wind.\n\n371\n\nFor the No-Wind case, horizontal advection and Coriolis acceleration are balanced by\n\n372 pressure gradient force (PGF) and bottom stress. Note, this balance departs from the classic\n\n373 estuarine balance between pressure gradients and friction. The barotropic and baroclinic PGFs\n\n374 oppose each other with stronger along-estuary components.\n\n375\n\nBoth the Coupled and NARR case have larger cross-estuary wind stress than the along-\n\n376 estuary stress (Table 4). And the presence of wind stress greatly alters the momentum balances\n\n377 from the No-Wind case. Mainly, the barotropic, baroclinic PGFs and Coriolis acceleration adjust\n\n378 accordingly. For the Coupled case, PGF is against the strong southwest wind stress. Compared to\n\n379 the No-Wind case, the along-estuary barotropic PGF is four times smaller; and the cross-estuary\n\n380 barotropic PGF switches direction. The latter pattern is similar to the typical wind-driven\n\n381 momentum balance (Csanady, 1973). Which implies the strengthened exchange flow may be\n\n382 wind-driven. In addition, strong wind mixing largely weakens the baroclinic PGF compared to\n\n383 the No-Wind case. With the impacts of the mild NARR winds, both the barotropic and baroclinic\n\n384 PGF turns from more along-estuary in the No-Wind case to more cross-estuary.\n\n385\n\nA common feature in all cases is the Coriolis acceleration partially opposes the PGF,\n\n386 especially for the NARR and No-Wind cases. This suggests a quasi-geostrophic balance. Garvine\n\n387 (1995) introduces the Kelvin number, ratio of the buoyant structure width to the baroclinic\n\n388 Rossby radius, to classify coastal buoyant flows. Here, the modeled exchange flow width is ~20\n\n389 km and the baroclinic Rossby radius (c/f, c is internal wave phase speed, and f is Coriolis\n\n390 parameter) is ~5 km, the corresponding Kelvin number is 4. A Kelvin number greatly larger than\n\n391 1 has quasi-geostrophic property in the cross-estuary direction. That matches the modeled\n\n10\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n392 momentum diagnostics. Both the windy cases have stronger quasi-geostrophic balance in cross393 estuary direction than the No-Wind case. Which implies they may have stronger along-estuary 394 exchange flow.\n\n395\n\nOverall the diagnostics indicate two ways to intensify the exchange flow. One is via\n\n396 wind-driven circulation. The other is more indirect: winds enhance the cross-estuary density\n\n397 gradient, which then enlarges the corresponding quasi-geostrophic component of the exchange\n\n398 flow.\n\n399 4 Discussion\n\n400\n\n4.1 Summertime estuarine circulation\n\n401\n\nEarly drifter track studies (Gross & Bumpus, 1972; Paskausky & Murphy, 1976;\n\n402 Paskausky, 1977) indicate a two-layer density-driven exchange flow exists in ELIS. Vieira\n\n403 (2000), based on combined observations, pointed out a bottom inflow that moves through ELIS\n\n404 into CLIS. Current observation along an ELIS ferry transect (Codiga & Aurin, 2007) indicate a\n\n405 near-surface outflow skewed to the southern side and an inflow offset deeper and to the north\n\n406 side. Prior model results also show these features (e.g. Whitney and Codiga, 2011; Whitney et al.,\n\n407 2016). This study shows the laterally offset surface-intensified outflow and bottom-intensified\n\n408 inflow exchange pattern not only exists in ELIS but also extends to the whole LIS.\n\n409\n\n4.2 Summertime Connecticut River water pathways and spring-neap control\n\n410\n\nEntering near the estuary mouth, the Connecticut River water pathways interacts with the\n\n411 two-layer exchange flow. A surface branch goes down-estuary with the outflow, then travels\n\n412 down-shelf as a buoyant coastal current; and a bottom branch goes up-estuary with the saltier\n\n413 estuarine inflow. During the 19-day analysis period, about equally a third of dye pulse leaves\n\n414 ELIS in both directions. The surface outflow branch is highly diluted, while the bottom inflow\n\n415 branch travels as a slowly diluting core.\n\n416\n\nMattituck Sill plays an important role on the dye pulse and river water distribution in\n\n417 ELIS and CLIS. First, strong tidal currents over the rough bottom mix the pulse to deep layer\n\n418 (Gordon & Pilbeam, 1975). Second, the topographic tidal residual circulation around the sill\n\n419 brings the pulse southward cross-estuary (Whitney et al., 2014).\n\n420\n\nThe model results disclose that the up-estuary bottom intrusion is the key mechanism\n\n421 transporting the river water westward in summer. The inflow has lateral variations strengthened\n\n422 to the north, and has temporal variations controlled by the spring-neap tidal cycle. Previous\n\n423 surveys support these findings. Based on yearlong bottom current meter records, Gordon and\n\n424 Pilbeam (1975) reported bottom saline inflows enter CLIS through the north end of the Mattituck\n\n425 Sill, then flow west-southwestward along isobaths. They proposed the bottom inflow is the only\n\n426 way for Connecticut River water enters CLIS all year long. Here, the dye pulse pathways support\n\n427 the conclusion, at least for summertime.\n\n428\n\nUnlike the continuous down-estuary dye transport, the strong spring-neap control over\n\n429 the sill sends the dye up-estuary as pulse. With section observations, Valle-Levinson and Wilson\n\n430 (1994) found bottom dense water intrusion over the sill before neap tide and retreated seaward\n\n431 after spring tide during August 1987. Observations during summer 1990 on CT-DEEP station I2,\n\n432 which is on the dye pulse pathway in CLIS, show bottom water density experiences spring-neap\n\n11\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n433 oscillation. Such spring-neap patterns are also discerned in WLIS (O'Donnell et al., 2008) and 434 BIS (Liu et al., 2017). In contrast, without lateral density gradient and run only for five tidal 435 cycles, Signell et al. (2000) simulated fairly uniform bottom inflow in CLIS besides the axial 436 depression.\n\n437\n\n4.3 Wind impacts on estuary circulation and river water distribution\n\n438\n\nSummer winds over LIS are moderate (on average <5 ms-1). In order to find out how\n\n439 important is the role of winds, three scenarios of wind forcing were tested. Both the Coupled and\n\n440 NARR case winds are slightly stronger than the buoy observations. The Coupled winds are the\n\n441 most energetic. All three cases exhibit the up- and down-estuary river water pathways and have a\n\n442 high degree of similarity. Nevertheless, different wind choices bring noticeable variations. For\n\n443 instances, the dye pulse distribution pattern on the shelf, the dye movement timing and strength\n\n444 in CLIS. The No-Wind case clearly illustrates moderate winds are still a necessary influence on\n\n445 the river water pathways and estuarine exchange flow.\n\n446\n\nWinds have two ways to influence the estuarine circulation: directly through wind-driven\n\n447 circulation and indirectly by altering density structures. The wind-driven circulation is first\n\n448 evaluated. The steady-state, non-rotational, linear barotropic wind-driven circulation along a\n\n449 rectangular channel cross section gives an estimate of the along-estuary velocity ~/4 450 (Chen & Sanford, 2009; Whitney & Codiga, 2011), where  is the along-estuary wind stress\n451 (Table 4), H is 28 m of water depth,  is sea water density, K is eddy viscosity. For the Coupled 452 and NARR case, the modeled K are 0.006 m2s-1 and 0.004 m2s-1, respectively. The corresponding\n453  are both 0.035 ms-1.\n\n454\n\nYet LIS is wide enough to consider the Coriolis impacts. Based on Winant (2004), a\n\n455 rotational solution estimation is ~( - y)/, where is the cross-estuary wind stress,\n\n456 a and b are coefficients controlled by f and K (Appendix). The rotational solution introduces the\n\n457 impact from the cross-estuary winds. It also contains the non-rotational solution. For the Coupled 458 case,  is 0.054 ms-1; for the NARR case,  is 0.043 ms-1. The results indicate northward\n459 cross-estuary wind enhances the surface down-estuary flow. However, the increases of exchange 460 flow for the windy cases relative to the No-Wind case are greater than 0.08 ms-1. This implies\n\n461 pure barotropic wind-driven circulation is only part of the mechanism for the exchange flow\n\n462 enhancement. Thus, the winds also indirectly affect the exchange flow in CLIS.\n\n463\n\nThe Wedderburn number evaluates the ratio of wind stress to the aligned baroclinic\n\n464 pressure gradient (Monismith, 1986; Chen & Sanford, 2009):\n\n465\n\n\n\n=\n\n 2\n\n(1)\n\n466 where, L is the estuary length scale,  is the horizontal density difference, and g is the 467 gravitational acceleration. W is applied in the estuary's axial direction with along-estuary wind 468 and density gradient, but it also can be applied in the lateral direction with cross-estuary wind 469 and density gradient. Both the along- and cross-estuary W (Table 4) in CLIS during the early 470 bottom intrusion period (20~25th tidal cycle) are estimated. For the Coupled case, the cross471 estuary W is 0.46, which is larger than the along-estuary W (0.33). It suggests the cross-estuary 472 winds play more important role than the along-estuary component at this time. While for the 473 NARR case, the corresponding W numbers are 0.15 and 0.07. Both are smaller, and the down474 estuary wind is relatively more important.\n\n12\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n475\n\nScully et al. (2005) demonstrate mild down-estuary winds can increase vertical\n\n476 stratification and intensify the tidal averaged exchange flow. In their study wind straining is\n\n477 more important than wind mixing. Wilson et al. (2015) found summertime W in WLIS ranges\n\n478 from 0.75 to 2.5. Due to freshwater input from the East River, the longitudinal density gradient is\n\n479 five times the lateral one. They suggested wind straining play more role on density modification\n\n480 than mixing in WLIS. While the W values in this study are lower than theirs. However, the\n\n481 model results do not suggest much longitudinal straining caused by down-estuary fresher water\n\n482 delivery in CLIS.\n\n483\n\nActually, the straining is more lateral. Though the down-estuary winds in NARR case are\n\n484 mild (<5 ms-1), the wind mixing steepens the isopycnals at the northern upper layer of the section.\n\n485 This generates stronger lateral straining compared to the No-Wind case, and further intensifies\n\n486 the quasi-geostrophic exchange flow. Similar processes have been observed and simulated in the\n\n487 Chesapeake Bay (Guo & Valle-Levinson, 2008; Li & Li, 2011; Xie & Li, 2018).\n\n488\n\nWinds in the Coupled case are somewhat more energetic than the NARR one, with\n\n489 stronger northward winds. Greater wind mixing reduces the lateral straining. But the northward\n\n490 winds tilt the sea level upward from the middle section northward, which generates barotropic\n\n491 up-estuary components and thereby strengthens the total inflow. Few studies focus on the cross-\n\n492 estuary winds effects. Guo and Valle-Levinson (2008) examined impacts of wind direction\n\n493 variation on exchange flow in the Chesapeake Bay. Their model results show cross-estuary\n\n494 winds build up lateral sea level gradient and modify the exchange flow strength.\n\n495\n\nIt also worthwhile to derive a new dimensionless number that rates the relative\n\n496 importance of barotropic wind effects in wide estuaries, with large Kelvin numbers. The axial\n\n497 Wedderburn number can be viewed as the ratio of along-estuary flows driven by along-estuary\n\n498 winds and along-estuary density gradients. Because both terms appear in the same momentum\n\n499 equation, it is sufficient to compare the along-estuary wind stress and baroclinic terms in W. The\n\n500 quasi-geostrophic dynamics likely in the cross-estuary direction of a wide estuary provide a\n\n501 scaling for the along-estuary flow in terms of the cross-estuary density gradient: /,\n\n502 where  and L are cross-estuary scales. The new dimensionless number (Wgeo) is the ratio of the\n\n503 rotational uw expression (given above) to the geostrophic scaling:\n\n504\n\n\n\n=\n\n(-y) gK\n\n(2)\n\n505\n\nThis number compares the along-estuary flows generated by the barotropic response to\n\n506 the wind stress and the geostrophic response to the cross-estuary density gradient. Wgeo is 1 for\n\n507 the Coupled case, suggesting the barotropic response to winds is significant, as strong as the\n\n508 density-driven flow. It is worth to note that both the density-driven and wind-driven flows are\n\n509 parts of the along-estuary exchange flow; horizontal advection also has influence. Wgeo for the\n\n510 NARR case is 0.26, indicating weaker barotropic wind influence for this case. This\n\n511 dimensionless number is applicable to other wide estuaries.\n\n512\n\nOverall, the stronger Coupled winds have a greater role on directly enhancing the\n\n513 exchange flow, and the cross-estuary wind has more contribution on that. While the NARR\n\n514 winds have impacts on exchange flow more indirectly through modification of the density field.\n\n515\n\n4.4 Wind resolution to surface drifter track simulation\n\n13\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n516\n\nIntercomparison of model cases indicate wind is a necessary forcing to simulate\n\n517 reasonable drifter tracks. Further move, surface drifter tracks (and other surface particle paths)\n\n518 are among the hydrodynamic features the most sensitive to winds, with large differences\n\n519 resulting from even mild winds. Higher resolution wind forcing, such as the Coupled WRF\n\n520 winds, can better represent the drifter distribution. Nevertheless, there are mismatches still to be\n\n521 improved. Similar comparisons in a tidal inlet (Spydell et al., 2015) show lower simulated drifter\n\n522 speeds and differences on distribution directions to observations. Besides wind impacts, many\n\n523 other factors (e.g. model resolution, bathymetry) can influence the results. A robust comparison\n\n524 of observed and modeled drifter paths would require many more field releases.\n\n525\n\n4.5 Is coupling necessary?\n\n526\n\nThough WRF winds help on drifter simulations and result in some differences (relative to\n\n527 the NARR forcing) in the estuary and on the shelf, the coupling is computationally expensive.\n\n528 For this study computation time is ten times longer with coupling. On the other hand, both the\n\n529 Coupled and NARR cases offer similar strength of estuarine exchange flow and dye pulse\n\n530 transport in CLIS. That suggests the NARR forcing is sufficient for long-term spin-up and\n\n531 studying seasonal scale processes. While coupling with WRF offers benefits for shorter term\n\n532 simulations focusing on smaller scale features. Both methods perform reasonably well during\n\n533 summertime LIS conditions. Thus, coupling with an atmospheric model has benefits, but is not\n\n534 absolutely necessary to represent many of the main features of this large estuary-shelf system.\n\n535 5 Conclusions\n\n536\n\nSummertime low discharge Connecticut River water pathways are detected by running\n\n537 simulations with a passive dye pulse and surface drifters. Entering at the northern coast near the\n\n538 sound mouth, the special geological position of the river mouth causes its water to have two\n\n539 main pathways. Both interact with the two-layer estuarine circulation. By the end of the 19-day\n\n540 analysis period, the near-bottom up-estuary pathway slowly moves a third of the river water\n\n541 westward with the denser estuarine inflow. This pathway is controlled by the spring-neap tides\n\n542 over the Mattituck Sill. The surface down-estuary pathway quickly transports a third of the river\n\n543 water onto the shelf. And this pathway is confirmed by both satellite-tracked and numerical\n\n544 surface drifters. The remaining third is still in ELIS at the end of the analysis period.\n\n545\n\nThree scenarios of wind forcing are tested: The Coupled case with high spatially varied\n\n546 WRF winds, the No-Wind case with no wind stress, and the NARR case with relatively spatial\n\n547 uniform winds. Comparisons with the No-Wind case show the wind is a necessary ingredient.\n\n548 Inside LIS, without wind forcing, the strength of the exchange flow is reduced and the timing of\n\n549 the river water up-estuary transport is delayed. On the shelf, shutting down the wind significantly\n\n550 reduces the cross-shelf transport of the fresher estuarine outflow, including the Connecticut\n\n551 River water. However, the Wedderburn number and a new analogous dimensionless number\n\n552 (Wgeo) appropriate for wide estuaries with a quasi-geostrophic cross-estuary balance suggest the\n\n553 mild summer winds impacts are secondary in LIS. The mild down-estuary NARR winds cause\n\n554 lateral staining, which alters the position and enhances the strength of the exchange flow in CLIS.\n\n555 Although the slightly energetic WRF winds weaken the lateral staining, the additional northern\n\n556 cross-estuary winds strengthen the exchange flow. Despite the corresponding Wgeo suggests\n\n557 wind-driven flow has similar strength to the density-driven one, the horizontal advection also has\n\n14\n\n\fConfidential manuscript submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n558 strong impacts. Both the lateral staining and cross-estuary winds-driven exchange flow 559 enhancement mechanisms can be applied to other wide estuaries.\n\n560\n\nThe Coupled and NARR cases display similar level of performance on simulating\n\n561 estuarine exchange flow and the river water dye transport in LIS. But the model is more sensitive\n\n562 to different wind forcing on the shelf where the tidal impacts decrease. Although it is\n\n563 computationally expensive, the results suggest a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model, instead\n\n564 of low resolution NARR forcing, offers better spatial variations on modeling drifter tracks and\n\n565 some differences in freshwater patterns in the estuary and shelf. Thus, coupling in this case\n\n566 provides advantages, but it does not fundamentally change the main features of the model\n\n567 solution.\n\n568 Acknowledgements\n\n569\n\nThis study was supported by NSF Grant 0955967 (Physical Oceanography), NASA Grant\n\n570 NNX13AE25G, and UCONN Marine Sciences predoctoral summer funding 2013.
