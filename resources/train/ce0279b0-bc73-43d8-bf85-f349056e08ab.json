This is currently the only non-invasive technique that can be used to view brain nerve tracts in vivo. 2 Nevertheless, the technique has to be validated so that results will be reproducible and usable in quantitative analysis, and so that they reflect real anatomical details. 3 Although many different computer programs for performing tractography are available, and some may be freely used for research purposes, the results they deliver may vary from program to program. This may be due to the algorithms they employ or the manageability of the program itself, since reproducibility of results depends to a certain extent on how the user interacts with the software. 4 Variations can also be found in multicentre studies due to use of different MRI units and different protocols for the capture of DTI images. These changes may affect the measurements of results employing tractography, as indicated by Fischer et al. 5 and\nHeiervang et al. 6 These researchers found that tract volume measurements varied when different diffusion gradients were applied. Furthermore, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has estimated that differences between 1.5 T and 3 T scanners yield a 5% variation in automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) based on volumetrics. 7 AD is the most common type of dementia, and its earliest and most notorious characteristic is memory loss. 8 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to the clinical stage prior to frank dementia in which the patient displays the first changes in memory and cognitive ability that may be observed by other people, but which are not so severe as to interfere with the patient's daily life. 9 The 2008 review by Chua et al. 10 mentions the differences between measurements of certain nerve fascicles in MCI and AD. Based on the above, tractography is very likely to be a potential clinical tool for early detection and control in patients with those diseases. Preliminary studies show a decrease in white-matter connections in patients with MCI and AD. Especially noticeable are the increased mean diffusivity (MD) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in these patients compared to normal controls. These changes were found in the posterior cingulate fasciculus (PCF), [11] [12] [13] the uncinate fasciculus (UNC), 14, 15 or both at once. 16 As Spanish-language literature does not yet contain a study on the reproducibility of tractography, or of its use in AD, we present our contribution. Its purpose is to examine the reproducibility of cerebral tractography measurements of specific fascicles, using a single computer program and DTI, in patients with MCI or AD and in normal controls.

Based on earlier studies, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and the hypothesis that the UNC and PCF play an important role in knowledge and memory, 16 we decided to study these bundles in both cerebral hemispheres. For each fascicle, researchers measured AF, MD, and the volume and number of nerve fibres in the fascicle to study measurement reproducibility. Since earlier studies found the AF and MD indexes to have diagnostic significance, data sets were compared within each study group (ADNI and CIEN), and then between those two study groups."}, {"section_title": "Tractography", "text": "MedINRIA v 1.9.2 was used to reconstruct UNC and PCF bundles (http://med.inria.fr/). 18 This program uses a deterministic algorithm employing the 2-tensor model estimation method. Beginning at a single seed point, each fibre was traced by following the tensor whose main direction of diffusion most closely resembled the preceding direction of diffusion. 19 Tractography was performed with an FA1 and FA2 threshold of 0.2; FA1 is the threshold at which the algorithm begins to reconstruct fibres, and FA2 is the threshold indicating that fibres will be reconstructed until their FA drops below that value. The minimum fibre length was set to 10 mm, meaning that shorter fibres were not recorded. Fibres were reconstructed voxel by voxel with a reduction threshold of 500. Below this threshold, tensors were not estimated because they corresponded to areas of the image that could not be used to measure the fascicles under study. We also used the MedINRIA filter to reduce noise in the images.\nOne of the main sources of variation was the location of regions of interest (ROI) for identifying specific white-matter fascicles. 3 There are different positioning methods, and the location, size, and shape of the ROIs may vary. Furthermore, fascicles extracted using this technique may include fibres that do not belong to the tract being targeted. 6 Since this project studies the interobserver reproducibility of measurements, we first defined a protocol for locating ROIs so as to reconstruct the fascicles in question. Protocols were based on those described by Wakana et al. 3 for the UNC and by Kiuchi et al. 16 for the PCF. Fig. 1 shows the ROI location and the location of the coronal slice over a sagittal slice to select the left UNC. Two ROIs were drawn over a coronal slice along the most posterior plane marking the separation of the temporal and frontal lobes, using an image without diffusion-weighting (b0) to provide a better view of anatomical structures. The first ROI (in red) was plotted such that it covered the entire temporal lobe; the second (white) covered the projections over the frontal lobe. A colour FA image provided a better view of the second ROI, shown as the small green zone in the image and labelled 'ROI2'. We then used the 'AND' option so that only those fibres passing through both marked ROIs would be selected. For the PCF, we used a colour FA map of a coronal slice in which 2 PCF projections could be seen. The first ROI was then drawn over one projection, and the second ROI over another projection. Fig. 2 shows these locations; projections of the PCF are shown on the colour FA map in blue and the coronal slice is located over a sagittal slice to select the PCF. The 'AND' option was also used here so that only fibres passing through both marked ROIs would be selected. These protocols for ROI location were included in an operations manual that was provided to a second observer for the reproducibility study. The manual will also serve as a guide for those interested in performing tractography with MedINRIA 1.9.2. Fig. 3 shows an example of the fascicles delivered by the proposed protocol, with the UNC appearing in green and the PCF in red. Both belong to the left hemisphere.

The analysis examined each data set separately (ADNI and CIEN data). First, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check that measurements followed a normal distribution. We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to analyse intra-and interobserver reproducibility for measurements of FA, MD, volume, and number of fibres in the left and right UNC and PCF in all subjects. ICC values exceeding 0.80 indicate excellent agreement, while values from 0.60 to 0.79 show substantial agreement. 20 One-way ANOVA was used to identify significant differences among means from the 3 study groups. Values of \u02db = 0.05 were established as statistically significant for all tests.\nAs our images had been obtained from 2 separate sources, using different scanners and protocols, we ran a t-test to look for significant differences between the means from the two data sets. Since there were multiple comparisons in each subject group, we applied a Bonferroni correction to obtain a significance level of 0.05/8 = 0.006 for each group."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "All variables display a normal distribution according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. ICC values for intraobserver reproducibility were within the 0.90-0.99 range for the UNC and in the 0.68-0.86 range for the PCF for all 4 measured variables, for both ADNI and CIEN data. In all cases, the confidence interval was 95% with a statistical significance level of P < .001. The interobserver reproducibility analysis yielded the values shown in Table 2 . Here, the highest ICC values correspond to the FA and MD indexes for the UNC, and they fall in the 0.84-0.98 range, which indicates excellent agreement. For all other measurements, reproducibility can be described as substantial. Fig. 4 shows a graphic representation of ICC values for variables in the interobserver comparison. Here, we see the highest levels of reproducibility for FA and MD indexes corresponding to the UNC.\nThe one-way ANOVA test did not identify significant differences among the means from the 3 study groups. However, as we see in Table 3 , one value approached statistical significance (P = .06); this value corresponds to the MD measurement in the right UNC in data provided by CIEN. This nearly significant difference is also shown graphically in Fig. 5 , in which the MD value for the AD group is larger than the MCI value, which in turn is higher than the control group value. Inversely, we observed a tendency towards a decrease in FA values for the same fascicle. There were significant differences between data provided by ADNI and CIEN for the UNC in all 3 study groups, as determined by the t-test for independent samples (Table 4) . Differences were bilateral for FA in the UNC in control and MCI groups, and only left-sided in the AD group. There were differences in MD in the right UNC in both the control and MCI groups. Most of the values measured by the ADNI were lower than those measured by CIEN."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "FA and MD indexes are imaging parameters that are commonly used to assess changes in white matter in numerous diseases. [1] [2] [3] [4] Scientists believe that such factors as axonal density, myelination, and homogeneity in axonal orientation affect the degree of anisotropy in diffusion. It is thought that a decrease in FA and an increase in MD reflect a loss of integrity in brain tissue. 10 Reproducibility was excellent for FA and MD measurement in the UNC, and substantial for measurements of volume, number of fibres, and all measurements in the PCF. As in our study, Heiervang et al. 6 also found that FA and MD measurements were more reproducible than volume measurements. As stated before, the main source of variation of the method is the localisation of the ROIs. UNC measurements are more reproducible because this fascicle is easier to extract than the PCF; tractography in the UNC is not contaminated by other fibres stretching in different directions. 17 These results indicate that the method employed for locating ROIs is reproducible, especially for the UNC. The proposed manual for performing tractography with MedINRIA 1.9.2, which was used by the second observer, is a useful reference for those lacking experience with that software. Anyone interested in this manual may receive it by emailing the authors. The study revealed no significant differences among the 3 study groups. However, for the case that approached statistical significance (MD of the right UNC, measured by CIEN), MD values were higher in AD patients than in MCI patients or in the control group. In turn, FA values in the CIEN database were lower in the AD group than in the other 2 groups for right-sided UNC measurements. This tendency coincides with results from earlier studies. 12, 13, 16 These changes in uncinate fasciculi have also been observed in other types of dementia, such as Lewy body dementia. 21 A decrease in FA in anterior and posterior cingulate fascicles is also found in Parkinson's disease, 22 suggesting that it should be studied more extensively as a potential marker for neurodegenerative disease. 10 Comparisons of the data sets recorded by the two centres showed that there were differences in the parameters measured in each study population. These differences are probably due to variations in the recruitment of patients with different baseline profiles. 23 Completing a DTI study is a complex process; in addition to its long acquisition time (which makes it more sensitive to patient movements), DTI requires high-gradient MRI scanners, which are not universally available. According to Fischer et al., 5 the main variation is the number of diffusion gradients used to acquire the images. In our case, FA and MD values in the ADNI 0.500 data (41 gradients) were lower than those from CIEN data (15 gradients). Nevertheless, results obtained by Heiervang et al. 6 contrast with those from our study: they show that fasciculus reconstructions derived using a lower number of gradients (12) have lower MD and higher FA values than those extracted using 60 diffusion-gradient directions. Our study's most important limitation is its small sample size, which very likely explains why we found no significant differences between groups. Due to the limitations previously mentioned for these MRI techniques, they are not routinely used even by ADNI. 24 However, despite the limitations of the ADNI and CIEN data, the method presented here is reproducible. When this technique has become more widespread and homogeneous, further studies will be required to test for significant differences between patient groups controlled by stage of dementia. As a result, the differences in FA and MD indexes described here may come to be regarded as biomarkers for AD."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "A part of the data used in this study was funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904 "}, {"section_title": "Conflicts of interest", "text": "The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare."}]
