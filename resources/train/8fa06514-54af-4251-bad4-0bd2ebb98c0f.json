It is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Memory loss and cognitive impairments are invariant, early signs of the AD, whereas hippocampal atrophy is one of the earliest histological hallmarks of the disease. Two main lesions are found in the AD brain: the neurofibrillary tangles formed by tau aggregation in neurons, and the senile plaques formed primarily by aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides in the parenchyma. The identification of familial, AD-linked mutations in the genes for amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PS1 and PS2) associated with deregulation of A\u03b2 peptide production suggests that APP metabolism is at the heart of the disease process. This hypothesis was recently strengthened by the discovery of a rare APP mutation that lowered both A\u03b2 peptide production and the AD risk [12] . Lastly, consistent evidence also suggests that common genetic risk factors for late-onset AD (LOAD)-including the APOE gene-may be involved in A\u03b2 clearance in the brain [13] . Taken as a whole, these observations indicate that A\u03b2 production via the deregulation of APP metabolism should still be considered as a key pathogenic factor in AD.\nThree main proteases (\u03b1-, \u03b2-and \u03b3-secretases) are involved in APP processing through (1) the amyloidogenic pathway (\u03b2-and \u03b3-secretases), leading to A\u03b2 production, and (2) the non-amyloidogenic pathway (\u03b1-and \u03b3 -secretase), which prevents A\u03b2 generation by cleaving APP within the A\u03b2 sequence [6] . Recently, new \u03b4-and \u03b7-secretase activities have been characterized [1, 26, 28] , indicating that additional APP processing pathways may exist and may thus modulate A\u03b2 loads. In addition to secretase activities, APP trafficking in the secretory pathway and APP's fate are also essential factors in APP metabolism. APP matures in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus and is then transported to the cell surface. Alternatively, APP can reach lysosomal compartments, where it undergoes proteolytic inactivation [15] . The equilibrium between these two compartments is driven by APP trafficking and maturation. O-and N-glycosylation are prerequisites for making APP available to the secretases at the cell surface and in the endosomal system, and thus for A\u03b2 production. In this context, the various mechanisms that control APP trafficking are being intensively investigated. However, a large proportion of the key molecular players in APP trafficking have yet to been characterized.\nInterestingly, new susceptibility loci for LOAD have been identified using genome-wide association studies (GWASs). One can reasonably assume that some of these genetic factors are involved in APP metabolism and A\u03b2 production. However, it is important to bear in mind that GWAS loci may contain several genes; hence, complex linkage disequilibrium patterns with the sentinel SNP in some of these loci may make it impossible to determine which gene is responsible for the observed signal. Indeed, there are 123 genes of interest within the 19 genomic risk regions identified in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) [9] . Even when a causative gene is eventually characterized, it is often difficult to establish a link with the pathophysiology of AD on the basis of literature data alone.\nGiven this context, we are seeking to develop novel, powerful approaches for empirically testing several GWAS-identified genes in cell-based or animal models. We therefore developed a genome-wide, high-content siRNA screening approach and used it to assess the functional impact of gene under-expression on APP metabolism."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "HSC assay", "text": "We developed HEK293 cells line stably over-expressing a mCherry-APP 695WT -YFP.

After customization for automatic image processing, we screened a genome-wide bank of 18,107 human siRNAs (SMARTpool) by analyzing the impact of transfection in our HEK293 model (in a 384-well plate format). For quality control procedures, the siRNA-PSEN1 and siRNA-APP (Fig. 1c, d ) were used to calculate the strictly standardized mean difference (denoted as \u03b2 in Supplemental Fig. 1 ). The complete screen was performed in triplicate, and only plates with \u03b2 > 3 were analyzed (98.5%) as recommended in highcontent screening (HCS) guidelines [2] . This procedure led us to select 17,354 siRNAs. Furthermore, experiments in which less than 300 cells per well were analyzable were excluded (mean \u00b1 standard deviation cell count per well for the whole HCS experiment: 795 \u00b1 345). The impact of 16,653 siRNA transfections on APP metabolism was then assessed, and the mean variation in both mCherry and YFP signals was normalized against the fluorescence intensity of non-targeting siRNA. It is noteworthy that transfection of siRNA targeting genes already known to modulate APP metabolism (ADAM10, PSEN1, BACE1 and SORL1) showed significant variations for mCherry and YFP signals, compared with non-targeting siRNA (Supplemental Fig. 2) .\nBecause YFP fluorescence is detected weakly, due to its rapid turnover at the membrane [21] , it limited the detection of a down-variation for this signal (Fig. 1e) . Thus, we decided to focus on the mCherry signal as the main read-out for selecting the 5% of hits showing the strongest variations (2.5% upregulated and 2.5% down-regulated) (Fig. 1f) . In all, 832 hits with a potential impact on APP metabolism were selected ( Fig. 1f ; Supplemental Table 1 ). In average, the standard deviation was of 12.4% (\u00b18.1%) for the 832 hits.\nStarting from this list of genes, we investigated potential protein-protein interaction networks by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa). This hypothesis-free approach described a complex interactive network that was primarily centered on APP (Supplemental Fig. 3) . APP was the protein with the highest number of interactions with other proteins in the network-indicating that our HCS approach efficiently detected proteins known to interact with APP. Gene enrichment analysis (using IPA) of the 832 hits identified 10 significantly over-represented pathways; notably, dermatan and chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis (p = 0.0007) is involved in the composition of the extracellular matrix and the glycosylation of proteins like APP (Fig. 1g) . All the other pathways were signaling pathways mainly involving integrin, paxillin or receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (Supplemental Fig. 4 ). These pathways (axogenesis; neuron and neurite development; cell-cell junction maintenance; cell morphogenesis and projection; and integrin-mediated signaling) have been already implicated in the modulation of A\u03b2 secretion [3] ."}, {"section_title": "Identification of FERMT2 as a genetic risk factor that modulates APP metabolism", "text": "We used HCS data to investigate the function of the genes within the LOAD risk loci recently reported in the IGAP's meta-analysis of GWASs [14] . Of the 123 known genes reaching genome-wide significance, 8 were included in the top 5% of hits: OR2AE1, GPC2, PVRIG, PILRA, AGFG2, TRIM35, EPHX2 and FERMT2 (Fig. 2a) suggesting that these genes could be involved in the AD process via the regulation of APP metabolism. However, only PIRLA and FERMT2 showed an effect on the A\u03b2 1-x secretion in HEK293-mCherry-APP 695wt -YFP (Fig. 2b) . Lastly, to assess the potential impact of these genes on A\u03b2 peptide levels in humans, we measured the association between SNPs in these 8 genes and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 peptide levels in a large sample (n = 2886) of AD cases [7] . After gene-wide correction (Bonferroni, p < 0.006), we found that only SNPs within FERMT2 were associated with low A\u03b242 peptide levels (p = 0.0006; Table 1 ).\nOf note, according to the RNA-Seq transcriptome and splicing database (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_ lab/brain_rnaseq.html), FERMT2 (but not PIRLA) is expressed in neurons which are the main sources of A\u03b2 in the brain.

Three siRNA-FERMT2 were associated with an increase in both mCherry and YFP signals, which was consistent with the effect observed when using the siRNA pool (Supplemental Fig. 5 ).\nTo further evaluate the impact of FERMT2 silencing on APP metabolism, we quantified mature and immature forms of APP and the various metabolites of APP. In the HEK293 cell line stably over-expressing APP 695WT (HEK293-APP 695WT ), we observed that a strong increase in mature APP levels was associated with the accumulation of all the APP-derived substrates for \u03b1-, \u03b2-and \u03b3-secretases (C83 and C99 intracellular C-terminal fragments of APP produced, respectively, by \u03b1-and \u03b2-secretases, as well as APP\u03b1, sAPP\u03b2 and A\u03b2 secretions) (Fig. 3a) . Again, similar results were obtained using different siRNA-FERMT2 sequences (Supplemental Fig. 6 ).\nNext, we assessed the impact of FERMT2 silencing on endogenous APP metabolism in HEK293. As observed in HEK293-APP 695WT cells, FERMT2 silencing resulted in a significant increase in mature APP levels (Fig. 3b) . It is noteworthy that mature APP levels also rose after transfection of siRNA-FERMT2 into the HEK293-mCherry-APP 695wt -YFP cell line (Supplemental Fig. 7) showing that the mechanisms were consistent in our cell models expressing APP 695WT in the presence or absence of mCherry and YFP tags.\nLastly, we confirmed the increase in neuron levels of mature APP after lentiviral transduction with shRNA against FERMT2 in a primary neuronal culture (PNC) endogenously expressing APP (Fig. 3c) . Taken as a whole, these results show that FREMT2 silencing (using either siRNA or shRNA) controls the mature APP levels in various models overexpressing (or not) APP."}, {"section_title": "FERMT2 expression controls cell surface levels of APP", "text": "A large body of evidence suggests that APP is mainly cleaved by secretases at or near the plasma membrane. Since FERMT2 silencing reportedly increases the amount of CD39 and CD73 at the cell surface [18] , we looked at whether FERMT2 can interfere with mature APP levels by promoting APP trafficking to the cell surface. If so, this would be consistent with our previous observation in which FERMT2 silencing appeared to be associated with a general increase in mature APP levels, but did not change immature APP levels in total cell extracts. We addressed this hypothesis more specifically by performing extracellular biotinylation experiments; these revealed that FERMT2 silencing strongly increased mature APP levels at the cell surface in HEK293-APP 695wt cells (Fig. 4a) . Conversely, the over-expression of FERMT2 was associated with low mature APP levels at the cell surface (Fig. 4b) . This observation was validated in HEK293 and PNCs (both of which endogenously expressed APP): FERMT2 silencing was systematically associated with more abundant mature APP in cell-surface-biotinylated fractions (Fig. S7 and Fig. 4c, respectively) . "}, {"section_title": "FERMT2 silencing inhibits APP degradation and promotes APP recycling at the plasma membrane", "text": "Since FERMT2 silencing reportedly enhances cell-surface CD39/CD73 levels by promoting their recycling to the plasma membrane [18] , we also looked at whether FERMT2 has a similar effect on APP. To this end, we first explored the time course of APP degradation by using the alkalinizing drug bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) to block transport from late endosomes to lysosomes. We found that siFERMT2 significantly lowered the accumulation of mature APP upon BafA1 treatment (Fig. 5a )-suggesting that FERMT2 silencing may lead to a reduction in APP degradation by lysosomes. We next assessed the impact of FERMT2 silencing on APP internalization. After incubation of HEK293-APP 695wt cells with 6E10 antibody at 4 \u00b0C, the time course of 6E10-APP complex endocytosis was monitored via immunofluorescence (Fig. 5b, c) . After 20 min at 37 \u00b0C, APP was rapidly internalized into small vesicles at all levels of FERMT2 expression. Although internalization was unaffected, the remaining APP staining in vesicles was more intense in cells under-expressing FERMT2 than in control cells (respectively, 47 \u00b1 16 versus 19 \u00b1 9% of the initial APP staining observed at the cell surface before internalization). A similar observation was made at 40 min (32 \u00b1 9 and 13 \u00b1 7%, respectively). These data suggest that FERMT2 lowered lysosomal degradation of APP by favoring the recycling route and thus boosting cell surface levels of APP. Inhibition of \u03b23-integrin reportedly promotes the activation of a RAB4-regulated pathway that (for example) diverts receptor tyrosine kinases (such as the VEGFR) from the degradative route back to the plasma membrane [4] . In order to establish whether a similar mechanism was operating for APP, we measured the effect of FERMT2 silencing on the APP recycling rate (i.e., the proportion of internalized APP colocalized with Rab4). We observed an increase in the proportion of Rab4+/APP+ endosomes; this indicated the induction of the APP recycling and was concordant with the above-mentioned accumulation of APP at the cell surface (Fig. 5d, e) . Importantly, Rab4 expression did not change after siRNA-FERMT2 transfection. Lastly, we found that co-transfection of siRNA-FERMT2 with Rab4A-specific siRNA abolished the accumulation of mature APP (Fig. 5f ). These data show that Rab4A is required for the induction of APP recycling after FERMT2 silencing. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that by facilitating APP recycling after endocytosis, FERMT2 controls the pool of mature APP available for cleavage by \u03b1-, \u03b2-and \u03b3-secretases. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "One can legitimately hypothesize that at least some of the genetic risk factors identified in GWASs have a role in APP metabolism and A\u03b2 production. However, APP metabolism is a complex process and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully characterized yet. Literature data on these risk factors provide indirect clues but clearly cannot ascribe these genes with a genuine impact at a particular step in the pathophysiology of APP processing. Furthermore, a conventional gene-by-gene cell biology approach did not appear to be time-or cost-effective for investigating the 123 genes located within the GWAS-defined susceptibility loci. Hence, we developed an HCS assay for empirically Our genome-wide siRNA screening gave us an overview of the different factors likely to affect APP metabolism and thus enabled us to select the most significant APP modulators (i.e., the 5% throughout the genome showing the strongest variations). From among a total of 832 modulators, we identified 8 genes associated with the AD risk in the largest yet GWAS meta-analysis (the IGAP). Importantly, our approach is not fully exhaustive and it is impossible to exclude that genes involved in APP metabolism are localized outside of the peak defined by the GWAS but regulated by SNP associated with AD risk. Similarly, focusing on the 5% strongest variations may lead to exclude some genes of interest. For instance, although SORL1 was not included in the 832 best hits, under-expression of this gene had significant impact on mCherry and YFP signals when compared with non-targeting siRNA. Moreover, SNPs localized within SORL1 showed an association with the CSF A\u03b242 level (p = 0.007).\nTo validate the potential impact of these genes on APP metabolism in vivo, we assessed the association between SNPs in these genes and the CSF A\u03b242 level in 2886 AD cases. Only FERMT2 was associated with significantly low levels of A\u03b242 (p = 0.0006) after correction for multiple testing. The SNP rs62003531 most strongly associated with the A\u03b242 level was in strong linkage disequilibrium (r 2 = 0.77) with the sentinel SNP rs17125944 (found to be associated with the AD risk in the IGAP's GWAS metaanalysis). It is noteworthy that this sentinel polymorphism was also associated with A\u03b242 levels (p = 0.03)-suggesting that both these SNPs represent the same genetic signal. Taken as a whole, these data indicate that FERMT2 regulates APP metabolism in general and A\u03b2 loads in particular. Accordingly, we observed that FERMT2 silencing led to an increase in mature APP levels and A\u03b2 secretion. Since we also observed that APP recycling was promoted by FERMT2 silencing through Rab4A-positive endosomes, our data strongly suggest that FERMT2 regulates APP recycling and its presence at the cell surface. The extracellular domain of APP is reportedly involved in cell-matrix adhesion and facilitates cell-cell adhesion via transcellular interactions [17] . Interaction between APP and integrin is required for adequate neurite outgrowth and contact guidance [24, 27] . Moreover, abnormal cleavage of APP might impair the protein's functions in cell adhesion and migration [22] . Hence, the regulation of cell adhesion may be important in APP metabolism. Furthermore, FERMT2 expression is required for cell adhesion; recruitment of the focal adhesion kinase FAK and p130CAS is required for \u03b23 integrin signaling [19, 25] . Several lines of evidence have established that integrin signaling controls the trafficking of other receptors and cargos [4] . For instance, inhibition of \u03b23-integrin might promote the activation of a Rab4-regulated pathway that (for example) diverts receptor tyrosine kinases (such as the VEGFR) from their degradation route back to the plasma membrane [20] . These data suggest that FERMT2 has an integrin-dependent impact on mature APP levels via a similar mechanism. It is noteworthy that some of the main regulators of integrin signaling (e.g., \u03b23-integrin, Src, paxillin and p130Cas) were also identified as modulators of APP metabolism in our HCS analysis (Supplemental Fig. 4) .\nAlthough FERMT2 expression appears to control cell surface levels of APP (which might modulate cell adhesion), our data also indicate that a FERMT2 under-expression may favor A\u03b2 production. Interestingly, by using another independent, systematic approach, we have already suggested that low FERMT2 expression might contribute to the development of AD [8] . We reported that the rs7143400-T allele (associated with an increase in the AD risk and located within the FERMT2 3\u2032 untranslated region [3\u2032-UTR]) creates a perfect seed for miR-4504. Co-transfection of the rs7143400-T allele and miR-4504 resulted in lower luciferase activity (relative to the rs7143400-G allele co-transfected with the same miRNA). This observation indicated that a functional SNP within the FERMT2 3\u2032-UTR region is associated with an increase in the AD risk and a potential miR-dependent decrease in FERMT2 expression. It is noteworthy that the rs7134400 SNP is in perfect linkage disequilibrium (r 2 = 1) with rs62003531, which exhibited the most significant association with the CSF level of A\u03b242. Taken as a whole, our data suggest that the rs7134400 T allele is associated with an increased AD risk by lowering FERMT2 expression; in turn, this disrupts APP metabolism and favors A\u03b2 production.\nLastly, we recently highlighted the fact that several GWAS-defined genes already known to be involved in the focal adhesion pathway (Fak, Cass4 and EPHA1) are potential modulators of Tau toxicity in Drosophila [9] . Since genetic risk factors involved in cell adhesion signaling have been associated with A\u03b2 production or Tau toxicity, we suggest that the characterization of these mechanisms should deepen our understanding of the link between amyloid and Tau in the AD process. FERMT2 might be located at the interface between these two hallmarks pathological processes because it has already been described as a modulator of Tau toxicity in Drosophila [23] ."}]
