[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Stroke is the leading cause of prolonged disability in the elderly and the second most common cause of death. 1,2 prior to stroke individuals often experience minor cerebrovascular events such as transient ischemic attacks (tias). according to the World health organization criteria, a tia is defined as a focal neurological deficit lasting for less than 24 hours and presumed to be of vascular origin. 3 these events have been considered crucial \"warning signs\" for increased risk of an upcoming stroke. Stroke has been shown to follow a tia in 12 to 30% of patients, and the highest risk of recurrent cerebral ischemia is within the first 24 hours of the initial event. 4 Without early detection and proper treatment, tias can be followed by more severe ischemic stroke.\nCerebrovascular disease is associated with cognitive impairment that significantly impacts patients in the long term. up to 25% of stroke survivors meet the criteria for dementia within 12 months of an ischemic event. 5, 6 . Chronic cerebrovascular changes, without overt clinical evidence of an ischemic stroke, can lead to cognitive decline, ultimately resulting in vascular dementia. in tia patients, symptoms and tissue deficits are by definition considered temporary, but cognitive impairments have been identified in some studies after initial focal symptoms have resolved.\n7-9 imaging studies in tia/minor stroke patients have identified correlates of cognitive deficits, but a profile describing how cognitive changes evolve over time has not been established. it is unknown whether cognitive impairments remain stable, worsen, or resolve in time ABSTRACT: Chronic cerebrovascular disease and large ischemic stroke are both associated with cognitive impairment. Much less is known about the acute cognitive sequelae of transient ischemic attack (tia). although often overlooked, there is increasing evidence that cognitive impairment does occur following tia. in some patients, cognitive changes persist after resolution of focal neurological deficits, but the temporal profile of these symptoms is unknown. in addition, clinical and imaging correlates of cognitive impairment after tia have not been systematically studied. this under-studied and recognized problem has significant implications for tia patient management. in this review, we summarize the evidence currently available and identify future research priorities.\nR\u00c9SUM\u00c9: Facteurs associ\u00e9s au d\u00e9clin cognitif chez les patients pr\u00e9sentant un accident isch\u00e9mique transitoire. la maladie vasculaire c\u00e9r\u00e9brale chronique et l'accident vasculaire c\u00e9r\u00e9bral extensif sont tous deux associ\u00e9s \u00e0 un d\u00e9ficit cognitif. on conna\u00eet moins bien les s\u00e9quelles cognitives aigu\u00ebs d'un accident isch\u00e9mique transitoire (ait). bien que ce soit rarement pris en compte, il y a de plus en plus de donn\u00e9es en faveur de la pr\u00e9sence d'un d\u00e9ficit cognitif suite \u00e0 un ait.

Systematic Mri studies have found that the proportion of tia patients with positive dWi changes ranges from 11% to 68% 13, (table 2) . the discrepancy in this large range of reported values may be explained by variations in study design, study population and sample size. for example, time from symptom onset to Mri scan varied from within six hours to a median 17 days later. in studies reporting later time points, dWi infarcts may have resolved, while acute studies may have more frequently reported positive dWi scans. additionally, although all studies included tia patients, some also included minor stroke and population sizes ranged from 14 to 1862 patients. Serial imaging studies indicate that some dWi lesions do result in a visible chronic infarct (figure), while others do not. in a study of 42 tia patients, relevant dWi abnormalities were reported in nearly half of patients. 27 of the nine dWi positive patients who had a follow-up imaging study two to seven months after the event, four did not reveal any infarct relevant to the original abnormality. in another multicenter study, dWi scans were performed within 24 hours of symptom onset in 458 patients and acute ischemic lesions were found in 96 (21%) patients. 52 a follow-up Mri was done on 48 patients showing that in five (10.4%), dWi lesions visible on admission had disappeared. in a study by oppenheim and colleagues, 21% of tia patients with baseline positive dWi scans showed no permanent injury when assessed 11.6 months later. 44 lesions that 'reversed' had smaller initial dWi volumes than those that infarcted. although this phenomenon has been referred to as 'dWi reversal' it more likely represents a very small infarct that is below the resolution of standard Mri."}, {"section_title": "Imaging Correlates of Cognitive Impairment", "text": "Studies identifying clinical characteristics associated with the presence of dWi abnormalities in tia patients focus more strongly on functional impairments than cognitive deficits. a longer duration of neurological symptoms and the presence of motor weakness are both associated with the presence of dWi lesions. 34, 41 the impact of dWi lesion presence, location, volume and number on cognitive performance is unknown.

Cognitive changes in acute stroke patients have been assessed quantitatively using different batteries of neuropsychological tests. While detailed neuropsychological testing represents the gold standard in terms of identifying cognitive impairment, this is generally impractical in the acute setting, partially motivating the need for brief yet accurate instruments. the two most commonly utilized tests in cognitive screening for acute stroke are the Mini-Mental State examination (MMSe) and the Montreal Cognitive assessment (MoCa).\nthe MMSe, developed by folstein et al, is a cognitive assessment of patient mental state and has been considered the clinical standard in stroke. 54 the assessment comprises a battery of individual tests that can be administered in approximately ten minutes. the test is scored out of a total of 30 points, with higher scores indicating higher functioning. items are grouped into categories to test orientation, registration, recall, calculation and attention, naming, repetition, comprehension, reading, writing and drawing. the MMSe has however been criticized for being insensitive to mild cognitive impairment (MCi). this test also primarily focuses on assessing memory and language abilities while it fails to assess executive function, a common impairment in cerebrovascular disease.\nthe MoCa was a test designed more recently as a cognitive screening assessment with increased sensitivity to MCi. 55 the MoCa can be administered in a short ten minutes, where patients can score a total of 30 points. the test is divided into eight sections assessing the cognitive domains of visuo-executive function, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation. Cognitive impairment based on MoCa scoring has been designated by a cutoff score less than 26. 55, 56 a number of factors make accurate assessment of cognitive impairment following stroke/tia challenging. depression present following acute stroke has been implicated in worse functional outcome and also exacerbates any acute/chronic cognitive impairment. [57] [58] [59] Cognitive assessments also vary in there is no consensus on the cognitive test most appropriate for assessment of post stroke cognitive impairment. a number of studies have compared MoCa and MMSe after tia with other methods of evaluation including the addenbrooke's Cognitive examination revised (aCe-r), telephone MoCa (t-MoCa) assessment and specific batteries of neuropsychological tests. [63] [64] [65] in a population-based study of 100 patients assessed \u2265 one year after tia or stroke, MoCa and MMSe were compared to the aCe-r for detecting MCi, defined using the neurological disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke network vascular Cognitive impairment battery. 63 both the MoCa and aCe-r had better sensitivity and specificity for MCi compared to the MMSe, which demonstrated a ceiling effect. a study by the same group assessed the t-MoCa against face-to-face cognitive tests in 91 patients with tia or stroke. 64 after one year, MoCa subtest scores for repetition, abstraction and verbal fluency were significantly worse by telephone than face-to-face testing. the tMoCa was therefore considered limited in its ability to assess visuoexecutive and complex language tasks. another study aimed to compare the MoCa with a computerized battery of neuropsychological tests for memory, attention and executive functions to detect mild to moderate cognitive impairments in patients with tia or stroke. 65 in comparison to stroke, tia patients presented significantly better scores through both methods. however, the MoCa was able to identity many more subjects with low scores (<26) compared to the neuropsychological battery."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive Assessments in Vascular Dementia", "text": "the most widely used criteria for diagnosis of vascular dementia is the national institute of neurological disorders and Stroke and association internationale pour la recherch\u00e9 et l'ensignement en neurosciences (nindS-airen) criteria. 66 these criteria rely on neuroimaging by Ct or Mri for evidence of focal brain damage as well as cognitive deficits in at least three cognitive domains (one of which must be memory). patients are diagnosed as having probably, possible or definite vascular dementia based on the strength of the association between cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment. the alzheimer's disease assessment Scale (adaS) is used to assess cognitive dysfunction in individuals with alzheimer disease and other dementias. 67 its subscale, the alzheimer's disease assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (adaS-cog), is the most popular cognitive testing instrument used in clinical trials of nootropics. 68 it consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention and other cognitive abilities. 69 With cutoffs for impairment set at \u226426, MMSe detected cognitive impairment in 10% of patients, while MoCa detected impairment in 55%. in a larger population based study of 413 tia and stroke patients, the MMSe and MoCa were administered at a six month or five year follow-up. 56 defining cognitive impairment as a score of <27 on either test, 58% of patients with an MMSe score within normal limits had an abnormal MoCa. the MoCa indicated poor cognitive function in 70% of all patients. in a more recent study, cognitive impairment in 97 first time tia patients was assessed using MoCa and compared to 100 healthy control patients. 70 tia patients exhibited declined cognitive function with impairments in verbal fluency, memory recall, abstraction, and visuospatial/executive abilities."}, {"section_title": "Temporal Pattern of Cognitive Changes after TIA and Minor Stroke", "text": "the temporal pattern of motor, speech and sensory deficits in tia/minor stroke is an acute onset and relatively rapid resolution with no long-term sequelae. it is unknown to what extent, if any cognition is affected in this population hyperacutely and whether these deficits actually resolve with the other neurological symptoms. longitudinal studies that adequately assess this pattern in tia and minor stroke patients are scarce. Most studies in tia and minor stroke patients lack serial assessment of cognition at multiple time points, including immediately after symptom onset, and only assess deficits several days after symptom onset. in a cross-sectional study of 280 tia and minor stroke patients (national institutes of health Stroke Scale \u2264 3), MMSe was administered both at the initial assessment (baseline) and one month later and then repeated at one, two and five years. 7 patients were divided into two baseline groups: those seen between one and seven days and those seen between 8 and 20 days. transient cognitive impairment (tCi) was defined as a baseline MMSe score \u2265 2 points lower than the one month follow-up MMSe. the rate of tCi in patients initially assessed within seven days (median four days) was 38.9%. this was higher than the rate of 19% seen in those examined between 8 and 20 days (median 12 days). patients with tCi did show a recovery in mean MMSe scores from 23.9 \u00b1 3.6 at baseline to 27.2 \u00b1 3.0 at one month. Sachdev and colleagues examined 128 stroke or tia patients aged 49 to 87 years, with no history of dementia or aphasia as a limiting factor (<3 on the aphasia Severity rating Scale).\n8 the initial assessment was done within three and six months post stroke, and a follow-up assessment 14 months later. at baseline, patients were categorized based on severity into three groups: vascular dementia, vascular cognitive impairment no dementia (vCi-nd) and no cognitive impairment. Cognitive tests showed a mean decline of 0.83 points on MMSe between the two time points. patients impaired at baseline assessment (vascular dementia + vCi-nd), showed a greater decline in visuoconstructive function and abstraction domains than patients with no cognitive impairment. in this study, higher white matter hyperintensity load was a significant predictor of cognitive decline. education level emerged as a protective factor against cognitive decline following the tia/stroke. another study assessed cognitive function in 252 patients with tia or non-disabling ischemic stroke at baseline (within six months of symptom onset) and again after one year. 9 at baseline, after administering MMSe along with the vascular dementia battery, 56% of patients were 'cognitively intact', 40% were 'cognitively impaired but not demented' and 4% were 'demented'. of the 252 patients, only 155 were reassessed at the one year follow-up. of these patients, 120 remained in the same categories as at baseline. nineteen patients (12%) cognitively impaired but not demented at baseline, improved to the point they were considered cognitively intact at one year. nine patients cognitively intact at baseline, deteriorated to cognitively impaired but not demented at the one year follow-up and seven patients who were cognitively impaired but not demented at baseline were demented at one year. demographic variables that differentiated those who deteriorated from those who remained stable or improved included hypertension, age, years of education and MMSe score."}, {"section_title": "Knowledge Gaps", "text": "Most of these studies included patients with large and often disabling strokes. it is therefore unsurprising that cognition is affected in these patients, particularly as many have pre-existing deficits.

one of the first to investigate smoking cessation and cognitive function. 119 this study found that the odds of cognitive impairment was 36% higher among continuous smokers than never smokers and significantly declined in long term quitters. a recent smoking cessation trial recruited 229 older smokers and 98 never smokers to assess how cessation in chronic smokers would affect rate of change in adaS-cog scores measured over 24 months. 120 results demonstrated that chronic smokers who continued to smoke or stopped smoking for less than 18 months experienced greater cognitive decline and greater deterioration of memory scores over two years when compared with never smokers."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Cognitive changes are common in cerebrovascular patients. although there is good evidence that patients with disabling stroke also have cognitive symptoms, there are less data related to tia patients. arguably, these are the more relevant patients to study, as they make functional recoveries, returning to live and the Canadian Journal of neurologiCal SCienCeS work in the community. assessment of cognition in acute stroke patients is challenging, due to the presence of other neurological deficits. this has led to under-recognition of the seriousness of cognitive changes in acute cerebrovascular disease patients, particularly those with minor or even apparently transient symptoms. reliable predictors of cognitive impairment have not been identified, although imaging correlates may hold some promise. the temporal pattern of cognitive impairment after tia has not yet been adequately characterized. given the implications for patient rehabilitation, return to work, and activities of daily living, we suggest that this is a research priority."}]
