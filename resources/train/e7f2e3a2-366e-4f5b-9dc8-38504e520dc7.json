This report describes the water-use categories and data elements required for the 2005 national water-use compilation conducted as part of the USGS National Water Use Information Program. The report identifies sources of water-use information, provides standard methods and techniques for estimating water use at the county level, and outlines steps for preparing documentation for the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nAs part of this USGS program to document water use on a national scale for the year 2005, estimates of water withdrawals for the categories of public supply, self-supplied domestic, industrial, irrigation, and thermoelectric power at the county level are prepared for each State using the guidelines in this report. Estimates of water withdrawals for aquaculture, livestock, and mining are prepared for each State using a county-based national model, although study chiefs in each State have the option of producing independent county estimates of water withdrawals for these categories. Estimates of deliveries of water from public supplies for domestic use by county also will be prepared for each State for 2005. As a result, domestic water use can be determined for each State by combining self-supplied domestic withdrawals and publicly supplied domestic deliveries. Fresh ground-water and surfacewater estimates will be prepared for all categories of use; and saline ground-water and surface-water estimates by county will be prepared for the categories of public supply, industrial, and thermoelectric power. Power production for thermoelectric power will be compiled for 2005. If data are available, reclaimed wastewater use will be compiled for the industrial and irrigation categories.\nOptional water-use categories are commercial, hydroelectric power, and wastewater treatment. Optional data elements are public-supply deliveries to commercial, industrial, and thermoelectric-power users; consumptive use; irrigation conveyance loss; and number of facilities. Aggregation of water-use data by eight-digit hydrologic cataloging unit and by principal aquifer also is optional.\nWater-use data compiled by the States will be stored in the USGS Aggregate Water-Use Data System (AWUDS). This database is a comprehensive aggregated database designed to store both mandatory and optional data elements. AWUDS contains several routines that can be used for quality assurance and quality control of the data, and produces tables of wateruse data compiled for 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000 ."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has compiled and published estimates of water use for the Nation at 5-year intervals since 1950. During 1977, Congress provided funding for the USGS to establish the National Water Use Information Program (NWUIP), which is a cooperative effort with States to collect reliable and uniform water-use information. USGS circulars entitled Estimated Use of Water in the United States present data collected for each State in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (MacKichan, 1951 (MacKichan, , 1957 MacKichan and Kammerer, 1961; Murray, 1968; Murray and Reeves, 1972, 1977; Solley and others 1983 Solley and others , 1988 Solley and others , 1993 Solley and others , 1998 and Hutson and others, 2004) .\nEstimates of fresh ground-water and surface-water withdrawals by county are mandatory for the categories of public-supply, self-supplied domestic, industrial, irrigation, and thermoelectric power. Estimates of saline ground-water and surface-water withdrawals by county are mandatory for the categories of public supply, industrial, and thermoelectric power. Estimates of reclaimed wastewater use by county are mandatory for the irrigation and industrial categories, but null values are allowed if there is an uncertainty about the use of reclaimed wastewater in the county. County estimates for each State for these categories will be prepared for each State using a countybased national model, although study chiefs in each State have the option of producing independent county estimates of water withdrawals for these categories (John Lovelace, U.S. Geological Survey, written commun., 2005 (Kenny, 2004) . Aggregating ground-water withdrawals by principal aquifers (U.S. Geological Survey, 2003) also is optional. Estimating ground-water and surface-water withdrawals for the aquaculture, livestock, and mining categories is mandatory for all States. Commercial, hydroelectric-power, and wastewatertreatment categories are optional for all States. This report describes guidelines for estimating data for the mandatory categories of public supply, self-supplied domestic, industrial, irrigation, and thermoelectric power.\nIn some States, governmental agencies, universities, or private organizations collect water-use information for some categories. For other categories, water-use information is collected from multiple sources or estimated using coefficients and ancillary data. Water-use study chiefs in each USGS Water Science Center are familiar with the availability and reliability of information in their own State and work with their cooperators to produce reliable estimates of water use. This information may be electronically stored in databases developed by an individual State or by the USGS.\nThe Aggregate Water-Use Data System (AWUDS) is a USGS database that is specifically designed to store and manipulate the aggregate water-use information compiled for the 5-year reports. AWUDS also is capable of storing annual aggregate water-use data compiled for the interval years between national compilations."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Scope", "text": "The purpose of this report is to provide guidelines for preparation of State water-use estimates. Water-use categories, data elements, aggregation levels, and documentation requirements are defined for the 2005 national water-use compilation. This information is useful both to those who prepare the estimates and to those who use the data.\nThe scope of the 2005 compilation has been modified from the 2000 compilation. The focus remains on preparing estimates of water withdrawals for the categories of public supply, self-supplied domestic, industrial, irrigation, and thermoelectric power in each State with the addition of domestic deliveries from public supply, thermoelectric-power generation, and reclaimed wastewater use for the industrial and irrigation categories. Combined, public-supply domestic delivery and self-supplied domestic withdrawal data determine total domestic use. Combined, power-generation data and thermoelectric-power withdrawals provide a range of powerproduction coefficients for use in evaluating the quality of the data. Reclaimed wastewater data gage the scale of use of this secondary water source, and this information may be especially valuable in areas of constrained water availability. Deliveries from public-water suppliers to commercial, industrial, thermoelectric-power users Number of facilities Nevertheless, estimates for these categories may be compiled and stored in the AWUDS database as can the optional data aggregated by eight-digit hydrologic cataloging unit (described by Seaber and others, 1987) and principal aquifer (as described by Maupin and Barber, 2005) .\nThe USGS NWUIP, with support from the USGS Office of Ground Water, prepared the guidelines. The document is designed to complement the national water-use workshop that was held November 2005. The methods presented are general in nature and are not intended to replace more specific or detailed methodologies that may be used by some water-use study chiefs. Required documentation of the methodology used by each study chief is part of scientific protocol and is especially important for this study because data availability and reliability vary from State to State.

Fresh ground-water and surface-water estimates will be prepared for the categories of public supply, selfsupplied domestic, industrial, irrigation, and thermoelectric power. Saline ground-water and surface-water estimates will be prepared for the categories of public supply, industrial, and thermoelectric power (once-through and closed-loop cooling systems). Irrigation may be reported either as total or as subcategories of crop and golf course irrigation. The choice of reporting a total or subcategories must be consistent for all counties in the State. Reclaimed wastewater use is a required data element for the industrial and irrigation categories. Zeros should be reported for counties where the delivery of reclaimed wastewater does not occur, but null values can be stored in AWUDS for counties where there is an uncertainty about the use of reclaimed wastewater. Compiling domestic deliveries from public supply and power generated by thermoelectric power plants by cooling type is required. Aquaculture (freshwater by source), livestock (freshwater by source), and mining (freshwater and saline water by source) are mandatory categories. Estimates of water withdrawals for these categories will be provided to the study chief for each county in the State by NWUIP. However, a study chief may decide not to use the nationally generated numbers but, instead, use independently estimated values for water withdrawals for the three categories.\nCompiling total population served by public-water suppliers is required for each county. Once county population estimates are available from the U.S. Census Bureau, NWUIP will provide the data set to the study chief in a format that can be readily input into AWUDS. County self-supplied domestic-population in AWUDS is calculated automatically as the county population minus the county population served by public supply.\nOptional categories and data elements also are summarized in the coding forms in the Supplemental Information section at the back of this report. Data for these categories may be compiled and stored in the AWUDS database. Guidance for compiling data for the optional categories and data elements is available from the guidelines for 1995 (E.

Accessing the data for estimating water use can be as uncomplicated as asking agencies or organizations for the data reported to them or as involved as designing a survey to collect the data. When data are not readily available, for some categories, water-use data can be collected by either an inventory of all sites or a partial inventory of the water-use sites using several sampling techniques. Site-specific water-use data more commonly are available for public-supply, industrial, and thermoelectric-power facilities and less commonly available for self-supplied domestic, irrigation, aquaculture, livestock, and mining water-use sites. When site-specific data are not available, water-use estimates may be determined using ancillary data and a water-use coefficient.\nAn inventory accounts for all of the individual sites and ancillary data in contrast to a partial inventory that queries selected water-use sites using several sampling criteria. Once an inventory has been developed, some or all of the users can be surveyed to determine water usage. Federal agencies cannot distribute surveys without meeting the requirements of the Paper Reduction Act of 1995 (U.S. Congress, 1995) . Generally, the guidelines for developing a survey are as listed.\nIdentify agencies with the authority or legal mandate to collect the data;\nIdentify the type of facilities information needed;\nIdentify the agency and organization sources of facility information for the category of use; Construct a master list of facilities;\nDecide on a sampling approach if not all users are to be surveyed;\nCreate a survey form that is short and easy for the user to complete; Write a concise description of the requested data;\nProvide a contact name and phone number for which to direct questions; Provide a desired completion date;\nInclude a statement of confidentiality;\nIdentify an agency or organization to cooperate in distributing the surveys; the entity may be different from the agency with the authority and legal mandate to collect the data; Develop a tracking process for receiving and managing the returned survey forms; and Implement a follow-up procedure for contacting facilities that do not respond by the requested time.\nA detailed discussion of methodology specific to each category occurs in the category sections.\nTo produce the most complete and defensible data for each State, the greatest effort and time are spent collecting information about the largest users and the largest categories of use in individual States. Compilation of accurate data for the largest public suppliers, industries, agricultural regions, and power plants produces State totals that are fairly reliable. As time and resources permit, data on smaller-volume water users also should be collected within each category.\nWithout site-specific data, water use often is estimated using a coefficient that represents a unit-use water requirement and number of units such as population served, number of employees, acres of cropland, or number of golf courses or golf holes. Some water-use coefficients already have been developed and are part of the technical literature or administrative and legislative documents for a State. If water-use coefficients are not available or perhaps no longer suitable, coefficients can be developed from a representative sample of typical users that are more pertinent to a specific facility, county, or State.

The structure of the classification makes it possible to tabulate, analyze, and publish industry data based on a two-digit major group, a three-digit industry group, or a four-digit industry code.\nThe USGS has assigned each four-digit industry code in the 1987 SIC manual (Office of Management and Budget, 1987) to a water-use category. In some cases, a code may be listed under more than one water-use category. The SIC codes can be useful for assigning withdrawals to the public-supply, industrial, mining, and thermoelectric-power categories.

A master list, at a minimum, consists of the names and locations of public-water suppliers, populations served, and sources of water. The information to build or update this list may be available from previous documentation, one or more State agencies, or USGS water-use databases. The USEPA SDWIS database is\nPublic Supply a secondary source containing information on public supplies obtained from the State agencies that administer water-quality regulations for drinking water. The SDWIS database includes information on the names and locations of systems, source of supply, location of water intakes, and population served for all community water systems (CWS), which are those serving at least 25 persons or 15 or more service connections on a year-round basis. SDWIS does not include any information on quantity of water withdrawn. In some cases, the State agencies providing the data to SDWIS may have more up-to-date and complete information than SDWIS.\nThe approach to estimating self-supplied domestic water withdrawals depends on the type of data available to the study chief. Self-supplied domestic water withdrawals typically are estimated by multiplying the self-supplied population by a self-supplied domestic per capita use coefficient. Selfsupplied population is calculated by subtracting total population served by a public supply in a county from the total census population in the county. The reliability of the estimate of self-supplied population depends on the reliability of the population-served numbers. Self-supplied domestic water withdrawal estimates may be more accurate if the self-supplied domestic per capita use coefficient is determined for separate geographic areas of the State that have distinctive climatic or water-use characteristics. A public-supply domestic per capita use coefficient may be substituted for a selfsupplied domestic per capita use coefficient if the publicly supplied and self-supplied populations are believed to be similar in terms of water use. A suggested method for developing public-supply domestic per capita use coefficients is to\nobtain data on public-supply water withdrawals or domestic deliveries-depending on available data-and population served from a cross section of several small water suppliers that likely serve only residential customers. Public-supply water withdrawals-or domestic deliveries-divided by the population served will result in an estimate of public-supply domestic per capita use. The public-supply domestic per capita use is likely to be similar to a self-supplied domestic per capita use, unless extraordinary conditions influence the patterns of use within the system or within in the self-supplied area. If public-supply domestic per capita use rates are similar throughout the State, an average public-supply domestic per capita use for the entire State may be appropriate. If public-supply domestic per capita use rates developed from the sampling indicate regional differences within the State, an average public-supply domestic per capita use should be estimated for each county or region.\nSelf-supplied or publicly supplied domestic per capita use coefficients also may be obtained from estimates provided by other agencies or from technical, administrative, or legislative literature. Some States have published projections of future water demands and may have calculated per capita use rates. Regional and State planning agencies, State natural-resource agencies, or the State's public health agency are possible sources for this information. Per capita use coefficients also have been determined as part of research conducted by professional organizations, such as the American Water Works Association, and by consulting firms.\nSelf-supplied domestic withdrawals sometimes can be estimated using information from wastewater-treatment facilities that set fees according to metered water use. In areas where sewer districts serve houses that are not on public water supplies, wastewater-treatment facilities often maintain information about self-supplied residences for billing purposes. This information can be used to estimate withdrawals for areas and to develop per capita use coefficients along with population and housing data. State pollution-control agencies also estimate per capita uses when designing wastewater lagoons. These design values, usually from about 80 to 100 gallons per capita per day (gpcd), may provide a good estimate of domestic per capita use. Other coefficients, such as gallons per day per household or gallons per day per household market value, are available from the literature and can be used to determine domestic self-supplied withdrawals in areas for which ancillary data on housing are available.\nDomestic self-supplied withdrawals typically are from wells. The source for about 98 percent of self-supplied domestic withdrawals during 2000 was ground water (Hutson and others, 2004) . Information on the use of surface water for domestic supply may be obtained from the State public health agency, the State agency responsible for permitting or wateruse data collection, census housing data, or local knowledge of areas where surface water is used. Cisterns used to collect rainwater for domestic use generally are considered as surfacewater sources. Springs are considered surface water in some States and ground water in others.\nSelf-supplied industrial withdrawals tend to occur within particular industry groups that require large amounts of water for fabricating, processing, washing, diluting, cooling, or transporting a product or incorporating water into a product. There are exceptions in which the more water-use-intensive industries are publicly supplied and the less water-use-intensive industries are self-supplied. Major industrial groups that historically have been self-supplied include food and kindred products (SIC 2011 (SIC -2099 , paper and allied products (SIC 2611-2679), chemicals and allied products (SIC 2812-2899), petroleum-refining and petroleum-related industries (SIC 2911-2999), and primary metals industries . Although these types of industries historically have used the most water per facility, the most important industry in any given county may not fall into one of these five groups. Therefore, it is important to consider any industries outside these groups.\nConstructing a master list of industrial facilities is fundamental to all of the compilation techniques. A master list, at a minimum, consists of the names and locations of industries, and sources of water. The information to build or update this\nlist may be available from previous documentation, one or more State agencies, or from USGS water-use databases. State reporting programs and individual industries are good sources of data. Reporting agencies have varying criteria for obtaining industrial water-use data; these criteria determine if withdrawals are permitted, registered, or monitored; the trigger levels for reporting and the application of the trigger level to groundwater or surface-water sources; and whether the reporting is Statewide or applies to selected counties or watersheds. If the reporting criterion is a minimum water withdrawal rate and that withdrawal rate is large, a significant number of small industries may not be surveyed. For this reason, some needed industrial facility information may not have been collected by the State agency and, therefore, must be obtained directly from the industry or be determined from other ancillary information.\nMost water for thermoelectric use is self-supplied from freshwater or saline surface-water sources. Smaller quantities are derived from ground-water sources or provided by public suppliers. The recommended approach for compiling data for thermoelectric power is to use site-specific water-withdrawal data and power-generation data. Site-specific data can be that from USDOE-EIA (with the exception of nuclear-fueled power plants) that will be provided by the NWUIP, or can be collected from other sources. Federally mandated information collected and maintained by the USDOE-EIA, includes power-plant ownership, location, method of cooling, sources of water, average withdrawal rates, average discharge rates, operating status, and power generated. This information is collected from monthly and annual surveys of power plants. Information on net power generation and energy source may be found in the EIA-920 combined utility, nonutility, and combined heat and power plant database, formerly and successively, EIA-906 and EIA-759. Beginning with January 2004 data collection, the EIA-920 has been used to collect data from the CHP plants. EIA-767, Annual Steam-Electric Plant Operation and Design Data, contains cooling water information for all natural gas and fossil-and biomass-fueled plants with a generator nameplate rating of 10 or more megawatts. Average rate of water withdrawal, water release, and consumptive use to the nearest cubic foot per second by cooling system type for each generator and power plant are included in the EIA-767 database.\nWater-withdrawal and power-generation data for the nuclear-fueled power plants and for the smaller plants with a generator rating of less than 10 megawatts will have to be collected using a different approach such as contacting the individual utility. If the contact person for a utility is not known, a good place to start is the person at the utility who prepares the Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs) for USEPA. DMRs contain information on volume discharged from all pipes in the facility and can be compared to the permit or permit application as to the source of the water and how it was used. The following selected terminology may help in conversations with utility personnel-blowdown, capacity, drift, and makeup water. These terms are defined in the Glossary section.\nState agencies that administer water rights or monitor water use may have water-withdrawal information. The State agency that is responsible for compliance with USEPA's Clean Water Act is an important source for this information. USEPA administers the PCS database, which was designed to track permit, compliance, and enforcement status data for the NPDES program under the Clean Water Act. An NPDES permit is required for all point discharges into U.S. waterways. The PCS database contains descriptive information on major power-generating facilities, their location, and monthly return flows. The NPDES permit application and the permit itself usually include detailed descriptions of the plant that provide basic information on all the sources of supply for the plant, the different ways in which water is used in the plant, and water included in the reported discharge values.\nPower-generation data can be used to estimate thermoelectric-power water withdrawals. A coefficient to estimate the gallons of water used per unit-hour of electricity generated is calculated using information on water withdrawals and power generation from plants of similar age, design, and cooling methods. This coefficient then can be multiplied by the amount of electricity generated during a specified time period by the plant for which withdrawals are being estimated. Coefficients ideally are derived using the gross power produced, if available. Monthly net power generation, in megawatt-hours, is available in the EIA-920 database but does not include the electricity used to run the power plant itself. The in-power plant electricity use that can be added to the net power is available from other EIA databases, but will not be part of the NWUIP derivative data file provided to the study chiefs. Supplemental Information"}, {"section_title": "Water Withdrawals", "text": "Public-supply withdrawals are compiled for the county in which the withdrawals occur, although the water subsequently may be distributed and used elsewhere. State reporting programs and individual public-water suppliers are good sources of data. Individual State reporting agencies have varying criteria for obtaining public-supply water-use data; these criteria may be based on such permit requirements as size of system or magnitude of withdrawals. Return rates of the required surveys to the State reporting agency, as well as the amount of QA/QC review, also may vary from State to State. For these reasons, some needed public-supply system information may not have been collected by the State agency and, therefore, must be obtained directly from the public-supply system or be determined from other ancillary information.\nStudy chiefs may survey public-water suppliers by telephone calls or visits to the systems. Mail surveys may be used if a State cooperator or other entity participates in the mailing, or if requirements of the 1995 Paper Reduction Act (U.S. Congress, 1995) are met. Usually, information can be obtained from a director of public works, city engineer, city clerk, bookkeeper, manager, or operator.

Useful information to request from these contacts includes the following list of items.\nSource(s) of water.

Surface water usually requires more water for treatment processes, such as backwashing filters, than ground water does.

Many water suppliers purchase and sell water.\nNumber of service connections by type. Numbers of active residential, commercial, industrial, or other meters may be used with a coefficient to estimate delivery amounts by customer types. Coefficients also may be derived from the number of meters, delivery volumes, and population or employment counts. Numbers of active residential meters, including single-family and multifamily housing, are useful for determining population served.\nAmounts of water delivered for several purposes during 2005. Total water use for a public supply is accounted for through deliveries to other public supplies; domestic, commercial, industrial, and thermoelectric-power customers; and public use and losses. Delivery data can be used to develop water-use coefficients for estimating withdrawals for similar public suppliers. Total metered uses also can be subtracted from total withdrawals to determine amounts of public use and losses.\nLocation of retail service areas. Many public-water suppliers serve customers outside city limits or in multiple counties or States.\nEstimating public water and losses and transfer water amounts for public supply is not required; however, the data are likely to be collected as part of the survey. This information can be used to estimate water withdrawals. The difference between total raw water and metered uses is equivalent to public use and losses in USGS Circular 1200, Estimated use of water in the United States in 1995 (Solley and others, 1998) . This publication indicates that public use and losses averaged 15 percent of public-supply withdrawals in the United States during 1995 (Solley and others, 1998) . Public use and losses vary substantially among water suppliers, depending on treatment needs, system efficiency, and the amount of publicsupply water use. For example, older systems and those that are undergoing repairs to lines or towers have greater losses because of leaks, flushing, and tower draining than systems with few problems. Often public use and system losses cannot be separated.\nInformation on water transfers is necessary for estimating public-supply withdrawals. Estimates of total water use for suppliers using a combination of their own withdrawals and purchased water, or for those selling water wholesale, should An effort should be made to estimate water withdrawals for each public-supply system in the county. At a minimum, water-withdrawal data should be obtained for the public suppliers of greater amounts of water in each county. For public suppliers of smaller amounts of water, especially those not surveyed, water use may be estimated based on water-right allocations, average water production, previously reported usage, or changes in population or population served. Sometimes estimates of total withdrawal for a public-supply system are based on estimates of water delivered to residential, commercial, or industrial customers or perhaps only on estimates of publicsupply deliveries to residential customers. Depending on the size of the public-supply system and on the available time and resources, estimates of commercial and industrial deliveries and public use and losses should be added to domestic-delivery estimates to approximate total public-supply water use.\nPublic-supply water withdrawals for the smaller systems also may be estimated using population served and a total public-supply per capita use coefficient. Preferably, the coefficient is derived from public-supply systems of similar size, similar customer base, similar rate structures, similar demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, or similar climatic and geographic settings.\nThere are three general approaches used to compile withdrawal data by industries:\nAcquire site information and withdrawal data for individual industries, focusing on larger ones while striving for an adequate representation of the withdrawals in each county.\nAcquire site information with ancillary data on employment or production, and estimate water withdrawals using water-use coefficients. These coefficients are usually in the form of usage in gallons per day per employee or per unit of product.\nCombine the two approaches by acquiring industrial facility information and water withdrawals for the larger industries and using these data to develop water-use coefficients for estimating withdrawals for the smaller industries.\nIndustrial water information may be acquired through telephone contacts, site visits, or surveys sent out by cooperating agencies. The level of detail obtained depends on the availability of the information and the necessary resources available to collect the data. Confidentiality should be considered. Useful data to acquire include: "}, {"section_title": "Per Capita Use Coefficients", "text": "A per capita use coefficient may be used to estimate total public-supply water use or domestic deliveries from public supply. In each case, the per capita use coefficient usually has a different value. Per capita coefficients for both total publicsupply withdrawals and domestic deliveries are commonly expressed in terms of gallons per person per day and require an estimate of population served. For this report, the per capita use term is differentiated for convenience of discussion: total public-supply per capita use coefficient and public-supply domestic per capita use coefficient. A related term is selfsupplied domestic per capita use coefficient, which is described in the Self-Supplied Domestic section in this report. Total public-supply per capita use is derived by dividing average daily total public-supply water use by the population served only by the system. Total water-use accounts for the water withdrawn and purchased by a system and subtracts from that amount the water sold to other systems. Total public-supply per capita use coefficients are generally larger for systems that serve industrial and commercial users or have large losses. Publicsupply domestic per capita use is derived by dividing average daily domestic deliveries by the population served only by the system. Other sources of total public-supply per capita use and public-supply domestic per capita use coefficients include the documentation from previous compilations, technical literature, or State administrative or legislative documents."}, {"section_title": "Population Served", "text": "Population served refers to the population within a county receiving water from a public-supply system on a year-round basis and excludes vacationers and second-home owners. Persons living on military bases, on Native American Indian reservations, and in prisons constitute a population served by the public-water system serving those communities. Population served by public-water suppliers is estimated for all public-water suppliers regardless of the source of the water (ground water, surface water, purchased water, or a combination of sources of water). Population served is compiled in the county of residence, which is not necessarily the county where the withdrawals occur. Population served within a county cannot exceed the total county population. For the 2005 compilation, population served is required at the county level, but not required by source of supply-ground water or surface water.\nA reliable county estimate of population served depends on collecting information from public-water suppliers that serve customers in that particular county. Crosschecking among several sources is recommended to get a sense of what the population served actually might be for a county. Individual public-water systems, State agencies, and SDWIS are sources of population-served data. Additionally, county estimates of the percent of housing units with public-supply capability were published in the 1990 Census of Population and Housing, Summary Social, Economic, and Housing Characteristics, 1990 (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1991, and http://factfinder.census.gov/ 1990 census, table H023, Source of Water Data Set: Summary Tape File 3 (STF 3)-Sample data). Although the data are 15 years old and apply to the number of housing units rather than the number of occupiedhousing units, the 1990 census data can be an important part of the overall analysis of population served in a county and perhaps serve as a baseline from which to compare the population-served data received from the other sources.\nPopulation-served numbers may be unreliable for several reasons and should be checked. Some potential problems include service-area boundaries, which for many public suppliers do not correspond to political boundaries such as city limits or county lines; therefore, census population is adjusted to accommodate customers living outside city limits or county lines to account for total population served. For water suppliers with service areas that span more than one county, an estimate is made of the population residing in each county.\nIn estimating population served, other errors may be caused by counting the population served more than once, especially if a supplier providing wholesale water supplies to other systems reports a population-served number that may erroneously include both retail and wholesale population-served numbers. Errors in a reported population served sometimes can be detected when comparing aggregated county population served to total county census populations.\nIf population-served numbers are not available, population served can be estimated based on the number of residential connections and the number of persons per household. This technique is useful for determining population in service areas for which no precise population is available, such as large water suppliers that serve parts of multiple metropolitan areas, rural water districts, or self-supplied housing developments. Individual water suppliers can provide the number of residential connections, which may include multifamily dwellings. Because the number of billed residential connections often approximates the number of households that are occupied in the service area, this statistic, although not always available, is preferred to the more general statistic, total number of residential connections. The use of total residential connections would likely overestimate the population served.\nCensus data on housing characteristics for counties and the incorporated places within the counties include ratios of average persons per household. As with the population served numbers from different sources, the reliability of the number of persons per household also should be checked. The population served that is reported by public-water suppliers may be over-reported, if it is estimated using a ratio of persons per household that is too large.\nVacationers and users of second homes in publicly supplied areas-also referred to as nonresidents-are not included in the population-served number because they have been counted in the location of their primary residence. The reduced domestic deliveries from public supplies from residents temporarily leaving their community are generally minimal compared to the increased domestic deliveries that result from concentrating a nonresident population, for example, in resort areas. In a resort or second-home community, the population that is actually served is undercounted resulting in a comparatively larger public-supply domestic per capita use coefficient. For example, a county population of 13,000 persons, of which 10,000 are supplied by a public supply, is supplemented by a steady influx of 5,000 nonresidents year-round, so that the public supply provides water for 15,000 persons. In calculating a public-supply domestic per capita use coefficient, domestic deliveries are divided by the 10,000 persons, not 15,000. To determine if this is a major problem, local public supplies, planners, or consulting firms may be able to provide an estimate of the percentage of second homes in areas that may house a large number of nonresidents."}, {"section_title": "Domestic Deliveries", "text": "Public-supply deliveries for domestic purposes will be estimated for 2005.

For example, meter sizes of 5 /8 and \u00be inch are common for households, although in many areas larger meters are installed for residences because of additional water needed for outdoor watering."}, {"section_title": "Estimating Domestic Deliveries Using Population Served and a Coefficient", "text": "Domestic deliveries from public supply can be estimated using population served and a public-supply domestic per capita use coefficient. More than one public-supply domestic per capita use coefficient may have to be determined for a State. Residential use varies from household to household; however, households served by the same public-supply system often have a common pattern of use influenced by factors such as water rates, water-conservation programs, lot size, customer affluence, climate, and topography. As a result, a public-supply domestic per capita use coefficient can be determined for a system (described earlier in this section). Although publicsupply systems with similar water-use characteristics are likely to have similar per capita use coefficients, among systems, a common pattern of residential use, especially outdoor use, may not exist because of variation in the above set of factors. Therefore, the coefficient for one system may or may not be valid for all systems within the State.\nOutdoor water use can be a significant component of domestic deliveries, especially in arid climates; this outdoor usage is reflected in the per capita use coefficient. In some areas, residential communities may receive potable water from a public-water supplier for indoor use and nonpotable water through a separate distribution system for outdoor irrigation of lawns and gardens. An example of a \"dual-use\" area is where developers provide the nonpotable water to houses in urban areas built on former farmland, using water previously allocated for agricultural irrigation use. Public-supply domestic per capita use coefficients in these dual-use areas generally are lower than in areas where customers use publicly supplied water for indoor and outdoor uses."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 \u2022", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Estimating Domestic Deliveries as a Percent of Total Public-Supply Water Use", "text": "In previous compilations, domestic deliveries had been estimated for some States as a percentage of the total water use for a system, a county, or a State. Because the customer base of public suppliers may vary a great deal, caution should be used in applying county-or State-wide percentages. Some of the percentages applied to total public-supply use for domestic deliveries date back several compilations. Just as the trends in water-use withdrawals have changed, especially since 1980, it is likely that the proportion of the deliveries from the public supply to domestic and other customers has changed, especially for commercial and industrial deliveries. In determining the percentage of domestic deliveries compared to total deliveries, an exploratory sampling of a selected sets of public-supply delivery data should be taken to test if applying a percent to total deliveries would be a valid approach and then to determine what a representative percentage would be for either a county, a region, or the State."}, {"section_title": "Self-Supplied Domestic", "text": "Domestic water use is water used for both indoor and outdoor household purposes. Common indoor uses include water for drinking, food preparation, bathing, washing clothes and dishes, and flushing toilets. Major outdoor uses include watering lawns and gardens and washing cars.

Industrial water users are businesses classified in the SIC codes under construction and manufacturing. Industrial water supplies may be derived from ground water, surface water (self-supplied industrial withdrawals) or reclaimed wastewater or provided by a public-water supplier (publicsupply industrial deliveries). For 2005, reclaimed wastewater use is a mandatory data element for the industrial category. Zeros should be reported for counties where the delivery of reclaimed wastewater does not occur, but null values can be stored in AWUDS for counties where the use of reclaimed wastewater is uncertain."}, {"section_title": "Mandatory but Null Values Allowed", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Water-Use Coefficients", "text": "In the absence of reported data, industrial water withdrawals can be estimated using water-use coefficients and ancillary data such as numbers of employees, units of production, or annual sales. The largest industries should be contacted to acquire actual water-use withdrawal data. These withdrawals then can be used to develop locally adjusted water-use coefficients to estimate withdrawals for smaller industries.\nThe use of coefficients to estimate industrial water use is imprecise because of the variability in factors affecting water use by industries. The specific processes, age of the facility, cost of the water and wastewater treatment, and amount of recycling all contribute to the amounts of water needed by an industry. These factors should be considered when using national coefficients or when developing and adjusting local coefficients for industries not surveyed."}, {"section_title": "Allocation of Water Withdrawals by Source", "text": "Allocating industrial water withdrawals by source and quality of water is often best done by combining local knowledge of water sources for neighboring industrial or publicsupply facilities and applying spatial analysis. Plotting pos-\nsible areas or locations of industrial activity on watershed and principal aquifer coverage maps can help determine the probable sources of water. Many industries are located in specific areas of ample supply of water from rivers or productive aquifers. Determining freshness or salinity of water also may require some knowledge of the type of industrial activity. Spatial analysis may indicate the possibility of tapping into a saline water source; however, the industrial process for which the water is needed may require freshwater. Seawater and estuary-bay water are the primary sources of saline surface water in the United States. Generally, because the use of saline ground water for industrial use is so specific and unique, the saline ground water is known within the State rather than surmised. The USGS ground-water specialist in each State may be able to help identify areas noted for having saline ground water that would strengthen the spatial analysis. For industry, saline water is water that contains 1,000 mg/L or more of dissolved solids."}, {"section_title": "Irrigation", "text": "Water for irrigation is applied by an irrigation system to sustain growth in agricultural and horticultural vegetation and also is applied for the purposes of pre-irrigation, frost protection, weed control, field preparation, crop cooling, harvesting, dust suppression, leaching of salts from the root zone, and the application of chemicals (SIC 0111-0191 and 4971). Irrigation withdrawals include conveyance losses. Irrigation of golf courses (SIC 7992 and 7997), parks, nurseries, turf farms, cemeteries, and other self-supplied landscape-watering uses also are included in the irrigation category. Water may be withdrawn by the irrigator or delivered from irrigation companies, irrigation districts, irrigation cooperatives, or governmental entities, but not purchased from a public supply. Instead, public-supply deliveries for irrigation users, golf courses, parks, cemeteries, and landscaping irrigation are either commercial deliveries or public-use water. The number of irrigated acres by type of irrigation system-sprinkler, surface (flood), and microirrigation are in the irrigation category. Reclaimed wastewater use is a mandatory data element for the irrigation category. Zeros are reported for counties where the delivery of reclaimed wastewater does not occur, but null values can be stored in AWUDS for counties where the use of reclaimed wastewater is uncertain.\nFor the 2005 compilation, States may divide total irrigation water use into crop irrigation and golf course irrigation. In this case, only golf course irrigation withdrawals are included in golf course irrigation; all other landscape irrigation is included with crop withdrawals. If irrigation is divided in this manner, county-level totals for both crop and golf course irrigation are mandatory where applicable, and total irrigation water withdrawals are calculated as the sum of the two subcategories. If irrigation withdrawals are not divided into crop and golf course withdrawals, then all irrigation is reported as total withdrawals and may include both types."}, {"section_title": "Reported Data", "text": "Some States require individual water users or water right holders to measure and report their withdrawals and irrigated acreages for each well or surface-water diversion. These data are considered the best because the location of the withdrawals can be accurately assigned and aggregated to a county, aquifer, or other area. Other sources of reported data may yield partial coverage of irrigation use. USGS cooperative studies may include measurement of site-specific data in local areas within a State. Irrigation districts or other agencies may own water rights and distribute water to users; these entities usually measure both withdrawals and deliveries. Watermasters may have been assigned to measure or compile measured withdrawals and deliveries in some areas, in which case they are excellent sources of data.\nReported measurements are the most defensible data; however, the completeness of reported data varies among States. Before using data that are reported to or by other Federal, State, and local agencies, it is important to understand the level of completeness, the degree of accuracy, and the amount of QA/ QC given to data. USGS water-use study chiefs need to verify whether the data are based on full and complete enumerations, Reported crop acreages may include all crop acreages or just irrigated acreages. Irrigated acreages and water deliveries may be reported for an area of management of a particular agency, or for an entire county. Some data may be censored for privacy reasons in areas with few irrigators. Reported withdrawals and acreage data need to be reviewed for errors, either by the reporting agency or by the USGS water-use study chief. Knowing the level of QA/QC for data that are reported by other agencies may prevent calculations that are based on incorrect assumptions."}, {"section_title": "Surveys and Personal Contact", "text": "Another method of estimating irrigation water use is by a local survey. Surveys that are conducted by USGS rather than a cooperator need to comply with the requirements of the 1995 Paper Reduction Act. Ideally, survey forms include a complete background about why the information is being requested, how it will be used, and by whom. Other important components of the survey are (1) a concise description of the requested data, (2) a contact name and phone number to direct questions to, and (3) a desired completion date. In any case, efficient collection and processing of survey data can be best achieved if the survey forms are short and easy for the user to complete. Typically, other State and local agencies distribute surveys, and the data are shared with the USGS.\nIt is important to get accurate data on water users who use the greater amounts of water; these users typically have more data available than water users who use lesser amounts of water. When developing survey lists, data sources such as the USDA's Census of Agriculture can be used to target counties with the water users who use the greater amount of water. Some of the most beneficial survey information includes: Other useful data include information on crop water shortages, acres harvested and yields by crop, energy sources, water and agricultural management practices, and any agricultural resources that generally are contacted when the irrigator needs additional guidance. "}, {"section_title": "Estimates of Crop Water Needs", "text": "A commonly used method to estimate irrigation withdrawals involves calculating consumptive use for irrigated crops using crop water-consumption coefficients for several crops and system types (see Allen and others, 1998; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1970 , 1976 , 2002 . The amount of water consumed by crops, plus additional water used in conveyance or needed for other irrigation uses, is the total withdrawal. This method requires that ancillary data exist for total irrigated acres for each type of crop, irrigation system efficiencies, conveyance losses, climatic variables, and other irrigation management practices-such as pre-irrigation, frost protection, weed control, and leaching salts from soils. This consumptive-use technique assumes that the irrigation water applied is adequate for optimal plant growth and that the plants are not being irrigated with more or less water than needed.\nApplication efficiency is a measure of the effectiveness of the irrigation system in applying the right amount of water to the soil and root zones over time. Application efficiency must be taken into account if irrigation withdrawals are estimated from crop water-consumption coefficients. Application efficiencies vary with the type of irrigation system and soil, crop, topographic, and climatic conditions. Pertinent climatic conditions that have large effects on irrigation efficiencies include wind speed, relative humidity, and air temperature.\nIn many cases, compilation of State withdrawals based on crop consumptive use, plus additional climatic and soil factors, is not feasible because of the amount of work and level of detailed data necessary. Use of previously determined crop consumption values may be the most cost-effective method of estimating irrigation withdrawals. These values may be obtained from sources such as the USDA irrigation guide (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1970) ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Sampling", "text": "For large irrigated areas where few measurements exist, statistical sampling represents a cost-effective way to estimate irrigation withdrawals. For this method, withdrawals are measured at sample sites where data also are available for such variables as power consumption, lift, or crop type. Water-use coefficients are developed from these sample data and then are used to estimate withdrawals at unsampled sites where the predictor variable(s) is known.\nStatistical approaches may have transfer value to other areas if there is good understanding of the predictor variables, the statistical significance of the predictor variables, and the level of expected accuracy. For example, by understanding the variability of the predictor variable, a specific number of sample sites may be determined that will enable calculations of withdrawals for all sites with a probability that the calculated values are within a specific margin of error. Luckey (1972) and Helsel and Hirsch (1995) provide a complete description of how to determine a sufficient sample size."}, {"section_title": "Allocation of Withdrawals by Source", "text": "If site-specific measurements of withdrawals are unavailable, then the estimates of total withdrawals need to be allocated between ground-water and surface-water sources. Geographic location is the greatest determinate of water availability from each source. Often, there is a predominating source of supply for a given State or geographic area. The best sources of information about water for irrigation are State personnel and county extension agents who work with the political and managerial aspects of water resources. Irrigation districts and equipment dealers are other good sources of local information."}, {"section_title": "Acres Irrigated by System Type", "text": "Estimates of irrigated acres by system type are compiled for each State at the county level. Irrigated acreage is reported by three general methods of application-sprinkler, surface, and microirrigation. Many types of irrigation systems are included in each of these categories.\nSprinkler methods include all boom, center-pivot, lateralmove, low-energy precision application (LEPA), permanent, portable, side-move, side-roll, solid-set, travelinggun, towed, and other sprinkler irrigation systems Surface methods include all borders, ditch, flood, furrow, gated-pipe, surge-flow, water-spreading, and other gravity systems Microirrigation methods include all bubbler, drip, micro-jet, mist, porous trickle-tubing, spray, trickle, and other low-volume irrigation systems, and subsurface systems Reliable data on irrigated acreage also are essential for most methods of estimating irrigation water withdrawals. Sitespecific irrigated acres by irrigation system type generally are difficult to obtain, except if State agencies require irrigators to report detailed information that includes irrigation methods. The USDA census of agriculture, conducted in years ending in \"2\" and \"7,\" provides the most recent national data set of irrigated crop acreages by county (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2002) . The USDA farm and ranch irrigation survey, last released during 2003, provides a national data set of irrigated acreage by irrigation method by State. County assessors also are possible sources for county-level information on irrigated acreage and irrigation system type. Remote sensing has been used as an indirect method of determining acres irrigated and crop types (Raymond and others, 1992) , but is not a common tool used in this study.\nIn some parts of the United States, the growing season is long enough that double and triple cropping can occur on the same irrigated acreage. In these cases, irrigated acres are counted each time the acre is irrigated to reflect the total acreage irrigated during the year; therefore, when any acre of land\nis cropped twice, it is counted as 2 irrigated acres. Counting acreage in this manner produces an application rate that is comparable to a single-cropping season. The irrigation method used on subsequent crops may be different. If multiple irrigation methods are used on a crop in a single growing season, acreages are reported under the method that provides most of the water to the crop."}, {"section_title": "Golf Course Irrigation", "text": "Golf courses may use water from ground or surface sources, purchased water (from a public supplier or irrigation district), reclaimed water from a public wastewater-treatment facility, or a combination of these sources. For golf courses, the best information on source of water is obtained directly from the golf course maintenance personnel. These people usually know how much water is diverted, withdrawn, or delivered from each of the possible sources.\nFactors affecting the amount of irrigation water used at golf courses include course design, climatic conditions, acreage, irrigation systems, soils, availability of water for irrigation, and local irrigation practices. Normally, more water per unit of area is applied to the greens and tees than to the fairways. It is best to obtain metered withdrawals for specific golf courses. If site-specific data are not available, irrigation withdrawals may be estimated using coefficients developed from surveys of golf courses in a State. A survey should include all of the information necessary to compute an application rate based on the consumptive needs of the grasses and the irrigated acres."}, {"section_title": "Thermoelectric Power", "text": "Thermoelectric-power water use is the amount of water used in the process of generating thermoelectric power. All thermoelectric power plants are classified as SIC 4911. The source of the power may be fossil fuels, nuclear fission, or geothermal energy. Thermoelectric power plants typically generate electricity with a boiler, where water is heated to turn it into steam. The steam then is used to turn turbines, which generate electricity. After the steam is used to turn the turbines, the steam is condensed to water by cooling it in a heat exchanger. The condensed water then is routed back to the boiler, where the cycle begins again. The predominant use of water is to cool the steam. Boiler water must be freshwater; however, cooling water may be fresh or saline.\nWater withdrawal requirements at thermoelectric-powergeneration facilities primarily depend on whether or not the cooling water is recirculated. The two general types of cooling are once-through (open-loop) cooling and closed-loop (recirculation) cooling. For the 2005 compilation, water withdrawal and net thermoelectric-power-generation estimates will be compiled for each type of cooling system. Once-through cooling requires the largest amounts of water withdrawal because the water is not recirculated within the facility. The water is withdrawn from a source, circulated through the heat exchangers, and then returned to a water body at a higher temperature. This technology is common in older facilities but generally is not used for new facilities because of increasingly restrictive thermal and other water-quality requirements for return water.\nClosed-loop cooling systems use cooling ponds and cooling towers to recirculate water within the system, thus reducing the overall water withdrawal requirement. Withdrawals to replace cooling water lost to evaporation, blowdown, drift, and leakage are considered \"makeup\" water. A cooling pond is a shallow reservoir with a large surface area to remove heat from circulation water. The rate of heat loss may be enhanced by using spray nozzles. A cooling tower is a structure designed to remove heat from water. The heated circulation water is sprayed into the tower and is cooled by radiation from the sides of the tower or contact with the cooler air. Cooling towers commonly are used where land and water are expensive, or where local regulations prohibit the release of thermal water.\nFor 2005, net power generated is a mandatory data element and the value will be stored in AWUDS in units of gigawatt-hours (GWhs). A GWh is equivalent to 1 thousand megawatt-hours or 1 billion watt-hours.\nSome industrial facilities also generate thermoelectric power. These facilities are combined heat and power plant operation (CHP or cogeneration) facilities. If the data provided from the industrial facility are sufficient to identify water used in power generation, then that amount of water and the power generated are compiled with other county thermoelectricpower water-use data."}, {"section_title": "Data Elements for County", "text": ""}]
