[{"section_title": "", "text": "The number of young people who hold a bachelor's degree has been rising over the last 20 years. Today, among 18 to 29 year olds, 19.8 percent of young women and 15.4 percent of young men hold a bachelor's degree or higher, with an additional 39.3 percent of young women, and 34.9 percent of young men with some college experience (including young people who were still working on their college degrees). See figure 1. In a previous CIRCLE fact sheet we showed that young people who attend or have attended college are generally more civically engaged than those who do not. This finding was consistent with previous studies that have revealed correlations between years of education and political and civic participation. 3 In this fact sheet we limit our analysis to college graduates from the graduating class of 2000, highlighting relationships between core civic engagement measures, on the one hand, and graduates' race and ethnicity, gender, type of college or university, SAT scores, and major field of study, on the other. We use data on college graduates from the Baccalaureate andBeyond 2000/2001 Longitudinal Survey 4 and data on youth and their educational attainment from the Current Population Survey September Supplements (1995 and2005). 5 While, as expected, college graduates are very engaged, and are more engaged than most young people with no college experience, most of the differences we highlight here are modest in size. We find that:  Male Female \u2022 African American and Native American and Native Alaskan college graduates are more highly engaged than Whites; \u2022 that graduates of private universities are more engaged that those who graduate from public institutions; \u2022 that Verbal SAT scores correlate with political participation; \u2022 and that graduates with degrees in law, public administration, planning, or the humanities are more engaged than their peers in other fields. This fact sheet concludes with some basic information about who is attending college."}, {"section_title": "Civic Engagement and College Experiences among Recent Graduates", "text": "The Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B 2000/2001) is a longitudinal survey limited to graduates of fouryear college and university programs, a subset of all people who have attended college. Data from this survey collected in 2000/2001, and representative of the graduating class of 2000, reveal relationships between civic engagement and various specific experiences and attributes of college graduates. We focus on volunteering (a civic participation measure), voting (an electoral participation measure), and attending political meetings and writing opinion letters (measures of political voice). The following graphs highlight instances where participation rates differ significantly and/or where consistent trends emerge from the data. In other words, civic participation rates are not illustrated for those measures on which there is rough parity among all groups of college graduates. When reading these findings, it is important not to draw causal relationships from these data; the data only suggest correlations between certain characteristics of college graduates' experiences or identities and their civic participation rates."}, {"section_title": "Differences by Gender", "text": "Gender is often correlated with some forms of civic engagement; for example, analyses typically show that a higher percentage of women volunteer than men do, though men are more likely to engage in some electoral activities than women. For young people, while there are some distinctions between women and men, many differences are not exceptionally large. 6 Analysis of the B&B 2000/2001 survey generally supports this hypothesis. Out of the handful of core civic engagement indicators for which survey data are available, male and female college graduates demonstrate similar participation rates, but women show a higher rate of volunteering during their senior year of college and after they graduate. In addition, a higher percentage of female graduates voted in the 2000 presidential election than their male classmates did. 7 See Figure 2. "}, {"section_title": "Differences by Race/Ethnicity", "text": "Analysis from the B&B 2000/2001 survey shows differences in civic engagement according to graduates' race and ethnicity. For example, African American college graduates demonstrate a higher rate of volunteering than their White peers do, both before and after college. White and African American baccalaureates demonstrate higher civic engagement rates than their Latino or Asian peers across all six measures of civic involvement. American Indian and Alaska Native college graduates show the highest participation rates in nearly every civic engagement measure of the B&B 2000/2001 survey. Moreover, American Indian and Alaska Native students actually demonstrate increased civic participation (i.e., higher rates of volunteering) after they graduate, unlike the rest of their colleagues. However, these latter statistics reflect small sample sizes and the data should be interpreted with caution. See figures 3, 4, and 5.  "}, {"section_title": "Differences by Size of Post-Secondary Institution", "text": "Civic engagement also differs among recent college graduates according to the size of the university they attended, but the relationships are complex. First, we have found that voter turnout rates decline slightly with the size of a graduate's institution. For example, in 2000, college graduates from the smallest institutions had a self-reported voter turnout rate of 78.7 percent, while those in the largest institutions had a voter turnout rate of 73.5 percent. However, while there is a difference in voter turnout rates, these differences are small; college graduates are voting at very high rates compared to all young people. Second, for several other measures (such as attending meetings), we see the highest participation rates among college graduates from the smallest institutions (those with fewer than 10,000 students) and in the largest ones (those with more than 30,000 students). See figures 6 to 8.  "}, {"section_title": "Differences between Types of Institutions", "text": "Civic engagement rates-at least for volunteering, voting, and writing an opinion letter-differ among recent college graduates according to the type of college they attend. In the B&B 2000/2001 survey, students who graduated from a private university generally demonstrate higher civic engagement rates than their peers at public universities, though these differences are relatively small. See figure 9.  Whether a graduate's alma mater is a historically black college or university also relates to her civic engagement. Graduates of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) show higher volunteering rates than their peers at non-HBCUs. Graduates of HBCUs also show higher rates of participation in political meetings than their peers at non-HBCUs, but they are not as likely to write opinion letters. See Figure 10. Civic engagement is generally positively correlated to graduates' SAT scores. An especially strong correlation is seen between Verbal SAT scores and political participation. 8 Furthermore, a graduate's Verbal SAT score is a stronger predictor of civic engagement than the Math SAT score. From the B&B 2000/2001 survey we find that the higher a graduate's Verbal SAT score, the more likely she is to volunteer, vote, write an opinion letter, and/or attend political meetings. The data also suggest that college graduates with very high SAT Verbal scores (700 and higher) are more likely to vote and write opinion letters than students who have very high SAT Math scores. Furthermore, in contrast to many of the differences highlighted above, differences between graduates who score high on either the SAT Verbal or Math and those who score low are among the largest we report. See figures 11, 12 and 13.   There is also a positive correlation between a graduate's SAT Math scores and her civic engagement. But the relationship is weaker than with Verbal SAT scores, though there is an important exception; students with Math scores below 400 show greater civic engagement than some of their peers with scores above 400, including those students with SAT Math scores over 700 (these are likely students who have relatively higher scores on their Verbal SAT). See figures 14, 15, and 16.  "}, {"section_title": "Differences by Undergraduate Major", "text": "Civic engagement among recent college graduates also varies according to undergraduate major. Of all major groups, students in math, engineering, and computer science show the lowest rates of volunteering and political participation. Conversely, graduates who majored in law, public administration, planning or the humanities demonstrate higher civic engagement rates than the rest of their peers. See Table 1. ."}]
