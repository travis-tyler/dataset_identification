[{"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "The adoption of genetically-modified (GM) varieties of soybean and cotton seed has become nearly ubiquitous in the US, accounting for over 90 percent of acres planted in each crop type since their introduction in 1994 and 1995, respectively. (Wechsler, 2017) The rapid expansion of the market for GM crop varieties, coupled with frequent merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, has prompted concerns of market concentration in both the product market and in the level of innovative activity. (Moscini, 2010;Maisashvili, et al., 2016;MacDonald, 2017) Using data on field trial applications (FTA) for GM soybean and cotton varieties, we estimate the level of concentration in research and development (R&D) activity by agricultural biotechnology firms with and without accounting for M&A activity. Figure 1 reveals that increasing adoption of GM cotton and soybean varieties since their introduction in the mid-1990s was accompanied first by an increase in the concentration of R&D activity followed by a subsequent decrease. Concentration of R&D in GM cotton seed peaked in the early 2000s whereas concentration of R&D in GM soybean seeds peaked in the mid-2000s and remain more concentrated than R&D in cotton. Anderson and Sheldon (2017) show that when R&D investments lead to increases in product quality, the concentration in R&D activity is bounded from below. These results, which Anderson and Sheldon use to estimate the level of concentration in GM corn seed markets, imply that increases in market size yield increased R&D activity by existing firms rather than permit entry by new competitors. Consistent with Lence and Hayes (2005), the overall welfare effects of this activity depend upon product quality, which can be thought of as the cost-saving to farmers of improved GM varieties, and the nature of competition in the product market. We expand upon Anderson and Sheldon (2017) by considering two GM crop types, soybeans and cotton. Unlike the market for GM corn seed which is dominated by the US, the international market for GM varieties of soybean and cotton is substantial with global adoption rates of 78% and 64%, respectively. (ISAAA, 2016) If the financial returns to R&D activity in GM crop varieties expand beyond the domestic market alone, then we would be overestimating the level of R&D concentration along two dimensions. First, if the market share of foreign competitors abroad is substantial then the actual level of R&D concentration would be overestimated. Second, if the relevant market size for domestic firms includes international markets the fitted lower bound to R&D concentration would be \"flatter\" and the theoretical lower bound for large markets would be overestimated. Prior to the release of GM varieties for R&D purposes in the US, firms, non-profits, and government organizations must file an application with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Using FTA from the introduction of GM varieties in the late 1980s through 2010, we construct measures of R&D concentration across agro-climatic geographic regions and across time for each of the crop varieties. We use this two dimensional variation, geographic and intertemporal, in order to estimate the lower bounds to R&D concentration for GM soybean and cotton varieties with and without adjusting for M&A activity. User cluster analysis, we partition US states into nonoverlapping sections in order to allow for geographic spillovers in R&D investment between similar regions. The submarkets that we define are largely consistent with the cotton production regions identified in Larson and Meyer (1996) and the soybean production regions identified in Schaub, et al. (1988). We use a two-step procedure to estimate the lower bounds to R&D concentration. In the first step, we fit a lower bound by solving a linear programming problem using the simplex algorithm and boot-strapping the standard errors. If increases in market size lead to increased R&D activity by existing firms, the non-zero first-stage residuals should fit a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Conversely, if market size increases are accompanied by firm entry and constant (or decreasing) concentration of R&D activity, then the residuals should fit a three-parameter Weibull distribution. These distributions can be estimated via maximum likelihood and tested using a likelihood ratio test. Our results imply that there is evidence that both GM soybean and cotton markets are characterized by increases in R&D activity by existing firms as market size increases rather than additional entry by new competitors. Moreover, although the regional submarkets for soybeans are more concentrated than the regional submarkets for cotton, there is potential for additional concentration in soybean as the fitted lower bound to concentration remains below the theoretical bound for the largest markets. Conversely, smaller-sized submarkets for cotton are already more concentrated than the theoretical minimum such that additional concentration should be viewed skeptically. Finally, accounting for previous M&A activity does not significantly change the estimates for the markets for GM cotton, but significantly increase the level of concentration in smaller and medium-sized submarkets for GM soybeans."}, {"section_title": "II. Theoretical Justification and Empirical Model of R&D Concentration", "text": "Sutton (1991,1998,2007) develops a model of market structure in which market entry and advertising and/or R&D investment decisions are jointly determined. When firms can vertically differentiate their products by investing in advertising or R&D, the equilibrium number of entrants, hence the concentration of firms in the market, remains bounded away from perfectly competitive levels even as the size of the market becomes large. Entry costs are considered \"endogenous\" in the sense that both product quality and the number of market entrants are jointly determined via investments in advertising or R&D. This contrasts with the case in which products are sufficiently homogeneous, or in which product quality is non-increasing in advertising or R&D expenditures, such that all entrant firms offer symmetric, minimum quality. In this case, firms enter the market \"exogenously\" such that the number of entrants (market concentration) is strictly increasing (decreasing) as market size increases. Sutton (1998) derives empirically testable hypotheses regarding the lower bound to market concentration and the lower bound to R&D-to-sales ratio that would be observed in each case. In particular, Sutton illustrates that the market share 1, of the firm offering the highest level of quality in submarket is bounded from below under endogenous entry costs by:"}, {"section_title": "A. A Theoretical Model of Lower Bounds to Concentration", "text": "where ( , ) is a parameter that depends upon the degree of product substitution and the elasticity of R&D costs and \u210e is a measure of product homogeneity in submarket . Conversely, under exogenous entry costs, the market share for all entrants is symmetric and given by: where is the number of entrants when all firms invest in minimum quality. When equation 1is binding, firms respond to an increase in the size of the submarket by escalating product quality rather than permitting entry by additional firms. Equation 2implies that an increase in submarket size will result in entry by additional firms such that the concentration ratio is strictly decreasing. Although these two conditions are stated separately, it is important to note that a single industry may be characterized by either endogenous or exogenous entry costs depending upon the underlying parameters. Equation 1is more likely to arise when products are more homogeneous or closer substitutes, when R&D costs are lower, and when submarket sizes are larger. The extent that R&D and/or advertising investments jointly determine product quality and the number of entrant firms can be tested empirically via cross-industry analysis (Robinson and Chiang, 1996;Sutton, 1998) or across submarkets (Sutton, 1991;Latcovich and Smith, 2001;Dick, 2007;Ellickson, 2007;Marin andSiotis, 2007, Berry andWaldfogel, 2010;Anderson and Sheldon, 2017). Anderson and Sheldon (2017) show that under the same conditions identified in Sutton (1998), the lower bound to concentration in R&D expenditures can also be derived and empirically tested. When R&D investments and market entry decisions are endogenous, then the firm investing in the market-leading level of quality in submarket will have a share of R&D expenditures 1, bounded from below by: where 0 is the fixed setup cost associated with entry, is the number of consumers in submarket , and is the industry sales revenue in submarket . Conversely, the upper bound on R&D concentration is bounded from above by: "}, {"section_title": "B. Empirical Specification", "text": "The lower bounds to R&D concentration, reflected in equations (3) and (4), can be estimated using maximum likelihood when the concentration ratio is characterized by a Weibull distribution (Anderson and Sheldon, 2017). We follow the empirical estimation strategy developed in Sutton (1991) based upon Smith (1985; and the simplex methodology of Giorgetti (2003). In order to derive the empirically testable equations, the R&D concentration ratio must be transformed such that the predicted concentration measures lie between 0 and 1. We first monotonically shift 1, by -0.0001 to address submarkets with only a single entrant and then transform the concentration measure according to: In order to estimate the lower bounds to R&D concentration, the transformed concentration measure for each submarket is normalized by the degree of product homogeneity in the submarket such that the functional form for the estimation is: Estimates of 0 , the theoretical lower bound to market concentration for large markets, and 1 , the slope parameter for changes in the lower bound as market size changes, can be obtained via a linear programming problem such that the residuals are non-negative. The fitted residuals follow a Weibull distribution such that: where \u2265 . The Weibull distribution is characterized by three parameters ( , , ) which reflect the \"shift\", \"scale\", and \"shape\" of the distribution. The shift parameter represents the degree of horizontal shift of the distribution such that when = 0 corresponds to a two-parameter Weibull distribution. The scale parameter reflects the dispersion of the Weibull distribution and the shape parameter captures the degree of clustering around the lower bound. The estimation of the lower bound to R&D concentration involves a two-step procedure. First, we obtain consistent estimates of the lower bound parameters \u03020 and \u03021 by solving a linear programming problem using the simplex algorithm under the constraint that the model residuals are non-negative such that: with standard errors that can be calculated via bootstrapping. Since there are two firststage parameters, there will be \u2212 2 positive fitted residuals \u0302 from the first stage. These residuals can be used to estimate the Weibull distribution parameters ( , , ) via the maximization of the log pseudo-likelihood function: with standard errors that can be estimated according to the asymptotic distributions defined by Smith (1994). The shift parameter estimate \u0302 can be used to test for the validity of the three-parameter Weibull distribution (\u0302> 0) against the restricted, two-parameter Weibull distribution (\u0302= 0). Failure to reject the three-parameter Weibull distribution implies that we are unable to reject that R&D expenditures are exogenous since the transformed measures of R&D concentration are shifted away from the lower bound."}, {"section_title": "III. Data and Descriptive Statistics", "text": "The lower bound to R&D concentration in soybean and cotton seed markets can be estimated according to equation (8) using data for each crop type at the submarket level. We exploit variation in the adoption and prevalence of GM crop varieties across two dimensions: (i) suitability of GM traits to agro-climatic conditions that vary geographically, and (ii) intertemporal variation in the adoption and expansion of GM crop varieties across geographic submarkets. An estimation of the lower bound to R&D concentration in these seed markets requires data at the firm level on R&D investment 1, for each crop type and every submarket. We aggregate state-level data on field trial applications (FTA) of GM crops into geographically distinct submarkets as a proxy for firm-level R&D investment. In addition to the firm-level data used to calculate the degree of R&D concentration, the lower bounds to R&D concentration also depend upon industry-level data on submarket size , the degree of product homogeneity in the submarket \u210e , and the minimum setup costs 0 that a firm must incur in order to enter a submarket."}, {"section_title": "A. Geographic Submarket Cluster Analysis", "text": "In order to estimate the lower bounds to R&D concentration in a single industry, we first must identify distinct submarkets. Previous industry-level analyses of lower bounds to concentration have largely focused on retail industries which can be separated spatially. These include examinations of retail banking (Dick, 2007), supermarkets and barbers/beauty salons (Ellickson, 2007), and newspapers and restaurants (Berry and Waldfogel, 2010). Unlike a retail environment in which firms incur advertising expenditures in each submarket, R&D investment in GM traits face a greater potential for spillovers across submarkets. The potential for spillovers across submarkets rules out the possibility of using patent applications as a proxy for R&D activity since these occur at the national level and are equally applicable to all submarkets. In order to identify the relevant subnational geographic markets for seed varieties, we make a critical identifying assumption that R&D investments in GM seed varieties are recouped within a particular geographic submarket only. Specifically, we assume that if a firm wishes to market its existing GM seed in a different geographic submarket, then it first must test those varieties in the submarket that it wishes to enter. This assumption motivates us to characterize geographic submarkets for soybean and cotton seed according to observable agricultural and climatic differences. Cluster analysis permits us to partition states into regional clusters following a \"natural structure\" of observable agricultural and climate characteristics. We assume a \"prototype-based\" framework such that every state in a cluster is more similar to a prototype state for that submarket than it is to every other submarket's prototype state. We utilize a K-means approach by defining the number of K submarket clusters for each crop type and minimizing the Euclidean distance between each state and the centroid of the cluster. For robustness, we consider alternate K clusters for each crop type as well as minimizing the absolute distance function. 1 The results of the cluster analysis are reported in Table 1 along with the corresponding market shares of US production and number of field trial applications for each submarket."}, {"section_title": "B. Measuring R&D Concentration", "text": "The ideal data for measuring R&D concentration in GM seed markets would be R&D expenditures for each product line in each submarket for every active firm. publishes this database of permits, notifications, and petition applications which includes information on the applicant institution, the status of the application, the plant (or \"article\") type, the dates the application was received, granted, and applicable, the states in which the crops will be released, transferred to, or originated from, and the crop phenotypes and genotypes. Our data covers 1985 through 2010 consisting of 33,440 permits or notifications of release across all crop types. We restrict the sample to include only for-profit firms and to limit ourselves to applications pertaining to the release of GM soybean and cotton varieties. Figure 2 plots the annual number of field trial applications, the number of firms that file an application for a field trial each year, and the average number of applications per firm by year for both GM cotton and soybean varieties. Although the number of individual firms peaked in the early 1990s for both cotton and soybeans, the total number of applications did not peak until the early 2000s for cotton and the late 2000s for soybean even though the number of firms had fallen from previous highs. The number of applications per firm reflect this increased intensity of R&D with the intensity of cotton research peaking in the late 1990s and early 2000s and the intensity of soybean applications peaking in the mid to late 2000s. We aggregate the number of FTA for each firm at the geographic submarket level across five-year intervals in order to derive a measure of R&D concentration that varies across submarkets and across time. We account for potential geographic spillovers by aggregating applications up to the submarket level consisting of states with similar agricultural and climatic characteristics. We aggregate across multiple years to account for the longer-term nature of the research and development process in which year-to-year fluctuations are secondary to longer-run trends."}, {"section_title": "C. Industry-level Data on Market Size, Product Homogeneity, and Setup Costs", "text": "In order to estimate the lower bounds to R&D concentration, we still require submarket size, a measure of product homogeneity at the submarket level, and minimum R&D setup costs. Our primary measure of submarket size is a proxy for total industry sales that we construct using annual data from the June Agriculture Survey and the Agricultural Resource Management Surveys (ARMS). We obtain acreage reports on the total acres planted and harvested at the crop level from acreage reports from June Agriculture Surveys for each state and aggregate within submarkets. The Economic Research Service (ERS) computes yearly seed costs for each crop type based upon ARMS data. After adjusting for inflation, we multiply the annual seed costs by the total acres planted to obtain our proxy for industry sales at the submarket level. As a robustness check, we consider a definition of industry sales at the submarket level for GM seed varieties only. We combine estimates on adoption of GM seed varieties by Fernandez-Cornejo and McBride (2002) for 1996-1999 with estimates provided by the June Agriculture Surveys for 2000-2010 in order to obtain a proxy for submarket-level industry sales of GM crop varieties. 2 These rates of adoption are also used to construct the degree of product homogeneity for each crop type at the submarket level. By definition, the product homogeneity index is meant to capture the percentage of industry sales of the largest product group. We consider product groups as broadly defined: conventionallybred varieties, insect resistant (IR) varieties, herbicide tolerant (HT) varieties, and \"stacked\" varieties consisting of both IR and HT traits. The product homogeneity index is calculated as the percentage of acres planted with the largest product group. 3 The final data required to estimate the lower bounds to R&D concentration is the minimum setup cost associated with entry into the product market. For each crop type, we obtain an estimate of minimum setup cost by summing the total number of public \"scientist years\" (SY), as reported by the State Agricultural Experiment Stations (SAES) and the Agriculture Research Service (ARS), and dividing this sum by the total number of reported projects to obtain an average SY per crop. Using data from Frey (1996) and Traxler, et al. (2006), we multiple the average SY by the private industry cost per SY ($148,000) and adjust for inflation. 4"}, {"section_title": "IV. Empirical Results and Discussion", "text": "The unadjusted measures of R&D concentration, both for the market-leading firm in each submarket and for the largest four firms in each submarket, are plotted against the size of each submarket in Figure 3 for cotton seeds and Figure 4 for soybean seeds. The raw data reveals a considerable amount of concentration across submarkets and across time with the four-firm concentration ratios in cotton seed exceeding 0.75 in every submarket and the four-firm concentration ratios in soybean seed exceeding 0.60 in every submarket. The single-firm R&D concentration ratios for both GM cotton and soybean seeds also appear to be non-decreasing in market size. In order to estimate the lower bounds to R&D concentration, the raw data presented in Figures 3 and 4 is transformed according to equation (5 The first-stage estimates reveal that there exists a lower bound to R&D concentration that does not converge to zero as the market size becomes large. Moreover, the increasing lower bound is consistent with an industry in which increasing in market size are accompanied by escalations in R&D, in order to improve product quality, rather than permit entry by additional firms. The results from especially compared with the theoretical predictions. This reveals that substantial consolidation of R&D activity in soybean seeds following the end of the sample in 2010 could still be expected. From the likelihood ratio tests of the second-stage results, we fail to reject the hypothesis that the first-stage residuals fit a two-parameter Weibull distribution for both cotton and soybeans seeds. That is, we fail to reject the hypothesis that = 0 such that there is no horizontal shift of the distribution that would be consistent with a poor fit of residuals that would arise under exogenous R&D costs. The estimated shape parameter \u0302 is remarkably similar for cotton and soybean seeds and indicates a fair amount of clustering of observations around the lower bound to R&D concentration. Parameter estimates that are less than two confirm the appropriateness of Smith's (1985Smith's ( , 1994 two-step procedure. The estimated scale parameter \u0302 is also consistent with a relatively narrow dispersion of first-stage residuals."}, {"section_title": "A. Robustness Checks", "text": "In order to test the validity of our estimations of the lower bounds to R&D concentration in cotton and soybean seed markets, we consider four robustness checks. First, we consider an alternate definition of submarket size based solely upon an estimate of the number of acres planted with GM varieties only. We subsequently explore the role of the product homogeneity index upon our results by assuming homogenous products which would bias our results towards finding R&D costs to be exogenous. The third robustness check considers an alternate definition of minimum setup costs based upon public sector SY which exceed private sector SY. The greater minimum setup costs should again bias our estimations towards failing to find exogenous R&D costs. Finally, we consider an alternate functional form for market size as proposed by Dick (2007) which allows for the lower bound to R&D concentration to change non-monotonically in market size. The robustness checks, reported in Table 3, generally support our findings of endogenous R&D investments in GM cotton and soybean seed markets. The results reported in columns labeled \"GM Market Size\" differ from our baseline estimations in two dimensions. We limit the submarket size to only those acres planted with GM varieties and also restrict our sample to observations between 1996 and 2010 since commercially available GM varieties were not available between 1991 and 1995. The results from these estimations confirm our baseline estimations of endogenous R&D investments in both sign and magnitude. The theoretical lower bounds to concentration implied by the first-stage estimates increase for GM cotton seeds from 0.473 to 0.600 as well as for GM soybean seeds from 0.786 to 0.953 with both fitted lower bounds increasing more rapidly under the alternate submarket definition. In the second robustness check, we explore the measurement of the product homogeneity index upon our estimations of endogenous R&D investments. These results, reported in the \"Homogeneity\" columns confirm the importance of firms being able to differentiate their products in order to capitalize upon investments in quality. When the product differentiation channel is \"turned off\" the estimation results are consistent with exogenous R&D investments as expected. The \"Setup Costs\" columns report results in which the minimum setup costs are assumed to be consistent with the public sector cost of R&D which exceed private sector costs. Neither the theoretical nor the fitted lower bounds to R&D concentration are substantially changed for either cotton or soybean seeds when the setup costs are assumed to be higher suggesting that the measurement of minimum setup costs is not driving the endogenous R&D investment results. Finally, we consider an alternate specification to permit a nonlinear relationship between the lower bound to R&D concentration and submarket size. These results, presented in the \"Quadratic Market Size\" columns in Table 3, confirm the estimates of GM soybean seeds being characterized by endogenous R&D costs. However, the parameter estimates for GM cotton seed imply that the fitted lower bound to R&D concentration is decreasing in submarket size which is consistent with exogenous R&D costs. An examination into the underlying data reveals that a single outlier, Western states in 2006-2010, is driving these estimation results. In unreported estimations eliminating this single outlier, which consists of a small-sized submarket and low levels of concentration, the market of GM cotton seed is again characterized by endogenous R&D costs."}, {"section_title": "B. Impacts of Mergers and Acquisitions", "text": "In order to examine the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) upon R&D investment and concentration, we adjust the field trial application data to account for changes in ownership of intellectual property. If M&A are resulting in intellectual property assets becoming more concentrated in a small number of firms, then it is possible that the lower bound to R&D concentration increases not due to the presence of endogenous R&D costs, but rather due to this consolidation activity. We utilize company histories and Lexis-Nexis new releases in order to identify M&A activity and the effective merger date in order to construct a measure of R&D concentration accounting for ownership changes. Although completed independently, our list of changes in corporate ownership corresponds to the activity reported in Fuglie, et al. (2011). The estimations of the lower bounds to R&D concentration adjusting for M&A activity are reported for cotton and soybean seeds in Table 4. We continue to reject the null hypothesis of exogenous R&D costs for GM cotton seed with a theoretical lower bound that is significantly different from zero and a fitted lower bound that is non-decreasing in market size. Figure 7 illustrates the theoretical and fitted lower bounds with and without the adjustment for M&A activity for GM cotton seed. Equivalence tests between the parameter estimates with and without adjusting for changes in intellectual property ownership are reported in Table 5. We fail to find evidence supporting the hypothesis that M&A activity significantly increased the lower bounds to R&D concentration in GM cotton. Conversely, the lower bound estimation results for GM soybean seeds change significantly and we fail to reject the hypothesis of exogenous fixed costs (Table 4). These results contrast with the expected results in which M&A activity would increase R&D concentration in these markets. Table 5 reports tests for significant differences in the estimated parameters which confirm these results as the theoretical lower bound accounting for M&A activity is significantly lower and the fitted lower bound is now decreasing, rather than increasing, in submarket size. Figure 8 illustrates the impact upon the estimated lower bounds to R&D concentration in GM soybean seeds when accounting for M&A activity. Inspection of Figures 6 and 8 reveal that the significant shifts in the lower bounds to R&D concentration occur due to increased concentration in medium-sized markets with no change in the largest market sizes."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "Using The situation is less severe for R&D related to GM soybean seeds. Adjusting for previous M&A activity, Monsanto was the market-leading firm in the number of field trials in every soybean submarket. However, the merger between Monsanto and Bayer would increase the unadjusted market share in each submarket by less than 2%. The largest impact in soybean markets may be felt from the merger between Dow and DuPont which previously had been the second and third largest firms, in terms of field trials, between 2006 and 2010. The market share of the second-largest firm in each submarket would subsequently increase from between 12-18% to 21-32%. An additional merger, between Syngenta and ChemChina, reflects one of the main limitations of our current analysis. Although Syngenta has tested GM crops in the US since it was formed in 2000, and previously had tested in the US as Novartis and Ciba-Geigy, ChemChina did not test GM crops in the US during our sample period. Any implications of this merger upon GM crops and the agricultural biotechnology industry would likely be reflected in international markets including China, India, Pakistan, and Brazil for cotton and Brazil, Argentina, and China for soybean production. A key identifying assumption of our empirical model is that the R&D investment associated with field trial applications that are conducted within the US can be recouped solely from the US market. If the R&D investments from the largest submarkets are recouped across a larger international market, the results identifying R&D investments as being endogenous would be unaffected. The major caveat would be if R&D investments that are made in smaller, less concentrated markets are recouped internationally such that the predicted lower bound to R&D concentration \"switches\" from increasing to decreasing such that we would be unable to reject R&D costs as exogenous. Given the regulatory hurdles that exist to gain approval across different countries, such that the minimum setup costs are also likely to be higher than measured, this scenario is unlikely.  1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 "}, {"section_title": "GM Market Size", "text": "homogeneity (h = 1)?^: Bounds calculated using product heterogeneity for largest submarket for each seed type and infinitely-sized market. : Null hypothesis (H 0 ): \u03b8 0 \u2248 -9.210.
