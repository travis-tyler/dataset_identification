[{"section_title": "Gender Differences in Salary and Promotion in Political Science", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "In his examination of the salaries and appointments of men and women in academia, the Director of Research at the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) observes: \"Substantial disparities in salary, rank, and tenure between male and female faculty persist despite the increasing proportion of women in the academic profession.\" (Benjamin, 1999) Yet the question remains as to whether this is true of all of academic disciplines. Research by Ginther (2001) and Hayes (1999, 2003) suggests that women in science and humanities face very different labor markets; the gender gap in these disciplines differs as well. Disentangling the causes of gender disparities in salary and promotion requires an in-depth examination of the relationship between the two. In this paper I examine gender differences in employment outcomes for academics in political science. Compared with other social science disciplines, women in political science face few disparities in salaries and promotion relative to men. This study uses data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) to examine the distribution of women across social science fields and gender differences in salary and promotion. The SED is a census of doctorates awarded in the United States each year. I use the 1974 -2000 waves of the survey to evaluate changes in the distribution of women in social science fields. The SDR is a nationally representative sample of Ph.D. scientists in the United States used by the National Science Foundation to monitor the scientific workforce and fulfill its congressional mandate to monitor the status of women in science. This study uses data from the 1973-2001 waves of the SDR. The SDR collects detailed information on doctorate recipients including demographic characteristics, educational background, employer characteristics, academic rank, government support, primary work activity, productivity, and salary. Academics in the social sciences with special attention paid to those in political science, economics, sociology, and anthropology are included in the analysis. Although the SDR has comprehensive measures of factors that influence academic salaries and promotion, the data lack extensive measures of publications. My evaluation begins with an examination of the distribution of women across social science fields. Next, the gender salary and promotion gaps in social science are considered. The analysis concludes with a comparison of the status of women in political science with women in other academic disciplines."}, {"section_title": "II. The Representation of Women in Political Science", "text": "Women are not equally distributed across social science fields.  Yet compared with other social science disciplines, political science has seen the most rapid increase in the percentage of tenured faculty who are female. Women's representation in academia tells only part of the story about the effect of gender on academic careers. From the macro perspective, women in political science have achieved representation in the academic pipeline that corresponds with the numbers of doctorates awarded. This study now examines the micro-level outcomes of the gender salary and promotion gaps in political science and other social science disciplines."}, {"section_title": "III. The Gender Salary Gap in Political Science", "text": "Salary regressions are estimated for men and women separately over time as a function of those factors that influence salaries such as demographic characteristics, academic background, and employer characteristics. The difference between estimated male and female salaries can be decomposed using a method developed by Oaxaca (1973). This method separates the gender salary gap into two components, the \"explained\" portion of the gap attributable to differences in observable characteristics (such as academic rank and differences in productivity), and the \"unexplained\" portion of the gap attributable to gender differences in the estimated regression coefficients. Employee characteristics such as the academic rank and tenure status of the individual also influence salaries, with salaries increasing with academic rank and tenure. Measures of productivity also affect salaries. These include factors such as whether the individual receives government support, primary work activities, and publications. Having a greater (or lesser) amount of these factors will have an impact on salaries. If men are more likely to work at top-ranked research universities, the gender salary gap will be larger. Salary differences may also result from differential treatment reflected in differences in estimated coefficients. For example, at private institutions if men are paid more than women and private institutions are equally likely to employ both, then the gender salary gap will increase. These observable characteristics may also reflect the preferences and choices of women in social science. For example, women in social science may be more likely to be employed at teaching colleges. However, these characteristics potentially reflect discriminatory practices in social science; women may be more likely to work at teaching colleges because of discriminatory hiring practices on the part of research universities. On average, teaching colleges tend to pay less than research universities and this will have an impact on the gender salary gap. My analysis will not be able to distinguish between those observable characteristics that result from individual choices and those that may reflect discrimination. Yet, taken together, these observable characteristics may explain a substantial portion of the gender salary gap. I examine gender salary differentials by estimating separate models for men and women and using the Oaxaca salary decomposition to account for the explained and unexplained portion of the gender salary gap in 2001. 3 The top panel of Table 1 presents the gender salary gap for political science, economics, sociology and anthropology, and social science excluding political science with all academic ranks combined. The gender salary gap in political science is the smallest of all the social science disciplines considered at less than 12 percent. The gender salary gap can be decomposed into two components-the explained gap resulting from gender differences in observable characteristics and the unexplained gap resulting from gender differences in estimated coefficients. Then entire salary gap in political science is explained by observable characteristics. The negative two percent unexplained gap suggests that differences in coefficient estimates actually favor women in political science. Previous research by Hayes (1999, 2003) shows that the majority of the gender salary gap in the humanities disappears when separate salary regressions are estimated for each academic rank. Since men are still the majority of associate and full professors and these ranks pay more, a large portion of the gender salary gap may be explained by the relative numbers of men and women at various ranks. To examine whether the gender salary gap in the social sciences is explained by rank, I estimated salary differences for each rank (the remaining panels of Table 1). Male assistant professors in political science earn only one percent more than females. This contrasts sharply with economics which has a 16 percent salary gap for assistant professors. The gender salary gap for associate professors in political science is four percent-the largest gap to be found in political science when conditioning on rank. However, the entire gap can be explained by observable characteristics. This gap is less than half the size of the gap in economics and sociology and anthropology. The gender salary gap in political science switches signs for full professorswomen full professors earn five percent more on average than their male colleagues. The entire gap results from coefficient differences that favor women in political science relative to men. This contrasts sharply with economics and social science excluding political science-disciplines that have a 15 and 10 percent gender salary gap for full professors respectively."}, {"section_title": "IV. The Gender Promotion Gap in Political Science", "text": "The salary gap estimates presented above were estimated by academic rank in order to control for men being more prevalent in the associate and full professor ranks. It could be that the gender salary gap is being understated by the previous estimates if women are less likely to get promoted. In order to examine this possibility, I estimate conditional hazard models of promotion to tenure for men and women in political science, economics, sociology and anthropology, and social science excluding political science. 4 Figure 4 presents predicted survival without tenure curves for men and women using data from the SDR. The survival curves can be interpreted as the probability of not obtaining tenure for a given number of years after the doctorate. The survival curves slope downward, indicating that as time progresses fewer people survive untenured (more people are promoted with tenure). The survival curves for political scientists in Panel A of Figure 4 differ markedly from the survival curves of the other disciplines shown. For instance, if we consider the predicted probability of remaining without tenure eight years after receipt of the doctorate by discipline, 45 percent of women and 51 percent of men in political science do not have tenure. This indicates that women are more likely to be promoted with tenure in political science than men eight years after the doctorate. Women's advantage in promotion in political science persists up to 15 years after the doctorate. This contrasts sharply with the other social science disciplines presented in Figure 4. In economics, eight years after receipt of the doctorate, less than half of the men remain without tenure, whereas 65 percent of women remain without tenure. In sociology and anthropology and social science disciplines excluding political science, men are more likely to receive tenure than women. Thus, compared with other social science disciplines, gender differences in the duration to tenure in political science favor women."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "This research has considered the representation of women in the academic pipeline, and gender differences in salary and promotion in academic careers for men and women in political science, economics, sociology and anthropology, and all social science disciplines excluding political science. Although women are less likely to obtain doctorates in political science compared to other social science disciplines, their representation in the academic pipeline closely corresponds to the number of doctorates awarded. Women in political science have increased their representation in the assistant and associate ranks and as tenured faculty more rapidly than women in other social science disciplines. The study next considers the gender gap in salary and promotion in social science. After controlling for rank, the gender salary gap in political science is small when compared with other social science disciplines. In the case of full professors, women in political science have higher salaries on average than men. Finally, the study shows that women are more likely to obtain tenure in political science than their male colleagues after controlling for demographic characteristics, employer characteristics, and publications. Up to this point, women's academic careers in political science have been compared with a limited number of social science disciplines. It is reasonable to place political science in a larger context of other academic disciplines. Research by Hayes (1999, 2003) shows that after controlling for academic rank, women in the humanities earn on average the same salaries as their male colleagues. Despite parity in salaries, women in the humanities are nine percent less likely to be promoted to tenure than men. Research by Ginther (2001Ginther ( , 2003Ginther ( , 2004 and Ginther and Kahn (2004) shows a negligible gender promotion gap in life science, physical science, and engineering. However, Ginther (2001Ginther ( , 2003Ginther ( , 2004) finds a significant gender salary gap at the full professor rank for women in science-men earn 12 percent more than women after controlling for demographic characteristics, employer characteristics, and publications. One-third of this salary gap remains unexplained by observable characteristics. Finally, Ginther and Kahn (2004) find that compared with men, women are 21 percent less likely to obtain tenure 10 years after the doctorate in economics, whereas in political science, women are four percent more likely to obtain tenure. Results from this study and previous research suggest that women in political science have been remarkably successful in obtaining parity and in some cases advantage in terms of salary and promotion when compared with men. This is clearly not the case in other social science, science, or humanities disciplines. Other academic disciplines, my own in particular, may want to learn the secrets of women's unrivaled success in political science. Notes: Salary Gap estimated using linear probability model.
