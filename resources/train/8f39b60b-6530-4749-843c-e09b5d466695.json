Yet, little is known about human capital formation at the post-baccalaureate level despite the increased private and public investments. Over the past two decades graduate enrollment has almost doubled, growing from 1.8 million students in 1997 to 3.0 million in 2017. Additionally, graduate student debt has almost tripled over the same time period, growing from $15.5 billion to $40.1 billion. 1 With the demand for skilled labor expected to continue to rise and outpace supply, the earnings premium for college graduates with advanced degrees is also expected to continue to increase. 2 It is anticipated that these trends will exacerbate the already widening income gap and the associated rise in inequality (Katz & Autor, 1999;Goldin & Katz, 2008). Perna (2006) asserts that stratification of American society is fueled, in part, by the unequal access of minority groups to higher wage employment opportunities. These employment opportunities are increasingly open only to those with post-baccalaureate degrees. While there is evidence of robust labor market returns to education for Black and Hispanic students attending selective institutions, Black and Hispanic students are about half as likely as White students to earn a bachelor's degree or higher (Dale & Krueger, 2002;Carnevale, Van Der Werf, Quinn, Strohl, & Repnikov, 2018). 3 Improving 1 In 2018 dollars 2 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) jobs requiring a post-baccalaureate degree are projected to grow faster than average. The BLS projects that by 2026, jobs requiring Master's and Doctoral/Professional degrees will grow by 16.7% and 13.1% respectively. This is compared to the 10.1% growth in jobs requiring a bachelor's degree. Source: Employment Projections program, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/education-summary.htm 3 Dale and Krueger also find that students from less educated families have large returns to college selectivity, even after controlling for unobserved student characteristics post-baccalaureate attainment is therefore a key aspect of improving social equality measures and access to middle-and upper-class opportunities. Understanding what motivates and hinders people from pursuing graduate education becomes relevant to policymakers attempting to improve social outcomes. Becker's (1964) human capital theory serves as the backdrop for many studies examining the question of school choice. Human capital theory assumes that people invest in their education in order to increase their labor productivity, and consequently their earnings. The optimal level of educational investment is assumed to be based on the perceived net benefits. These net benefits are comprised of lifetime earnings less actual, perceived and opportunity costs. Human capital theory, therefore tends to examine individuals' welfare through the lens of costs/benefits of the human capital investments. There are, however, two limitations to human capital theory that are relevant to this research: First, the human capital approach assumes that all individuals have perfect information with homogenous preferences, tastes and expectations (Dumais, 2002;Marginson, 2019). Productivity differences are therefore assumed to be attributed to the differences in educational investments people make in themselves (Schultz, 1961;Becker, 1994). Second, the theory also assumes that the type and level of educational investments made determine labor market outcomes. However, research on educational outcomes has documented how family background significantly affects where one ends up on the wage-distribution (Dale & Krueger, 2002;Wolniak, Seifert, Reed, & Pascarella, 2008;Bingley, Corak, & Westerg\u00e5rd-Nielsen, 2011;Borgen, 2015). Such findings suggest that socio-economic and other family background characteristics play a role in labor market outcomes. 4 Sociologists note how individuals have distinct preferences, tastes and expectations that guide their choice process. These unobservable characteristics make it difficult to obtain unbiased estimates of the determinants of post-baccalaureate school choice. Typical human capital models fail to capture how two otherwise identical students with different levels of ambition or grit attain different educational levels. Researchers have attempted to overcome the omitted variables bias inherent in these models by expanding on the human capital perspective and proposing alternative conceptual models to help explain the heterogeneous pathways of education (Paulsen & St. John, 2002;Dumais, 2002;Perna, 2004;English & Umbach, 2016;Posselt & Grodsky, 2017). These alternative models rely on Pierre Bourdieu's theories of social reproduction and habitus. Social reproduction is the transmission of cultural and other forms of capital to sustain class status from one generation to the next. Habitus refers to the driving force behind people's actions and preferences. This driving force is an internalization of one's place in the world and influences their views, expectations, and aspirations to determine what is possible for them to accomplish (Dumais, 2002). In his 1986 book The Forms of Capital, Bourdieu proposes that capital formation occurs in three fundamental forms: 1) Economic capital, which relates to possession of, and access to monetary assets; 2) Social capital, which consists of current and potential social networks and relationships that can be mobilized in support of one's objective(s); and 3) Cultural capital, which represents symbols of status and wealth that are transmitted within the family structure to sustain one's social status. Educational sociologists argue that people's habitus, social status, and cultural backgrounds, in addition to their human capital, interact to influence their motivations and actions. This dissertation takes into account the findings from labor economic, sociological and higher education research to examine the determinants of graduate school choice and help clarify the variations in graduate school enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Statement of the Problem", "text": "Post-secondary education is a key path to upward mobility in the United States (Bailey & Dynarski, 2011;Carnevale, Smith, & Strohl, 2010), yet there remains considerable inequality among the demographic that obtain graduate degrees (Perna, 2004). Additionally, intergenerational mobility in the U.S. is one of the lowest among developed countries (J\u00e4ntti, et al., 2006;Hertz, et al., 2008;Ermisch, J\u00e4ntti, & Smeeding, 2012). Despite the rising trend of human capital investment at the post-baccalaureate level, little is known about the transition from undergraduate to graduate education. 5 The research on predictors of graduate school enrollment are relatively underdeveloped in the literature, particularly in comparison to the copious research on undergraduate enrollment behavior and the stratification of undergraduate education (Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003;Posselt & Grodsky, 2017). While a number of studies have examined the determinants of post-secondary education, these studies have tended to focus specifically on undergraduate degree attainment, or postsecondary degree attainment without making a distinction between baccalaureate and post-baccalaureate degrees. The resulting knowledge gap limits our understanding of the drivers that lead students to enroll in graduate school. Despite access to education being a social priority for well over half a century -with numerous laws aimed at improving college access, persistence and completion -much remains to be done. 6 Therefore, further investigation into the determinants of graduate school enrollment is needed to 1) better understand the graduate school choice process; 2) better understand and anticipate the impact of business cycle fluctuations on graduate enrollment patterns; and 3) influence behavior by instituting policies that encourage graduate degree enrollment. By identifying and understanding the determinants of the graduate school choice process we can establish policies that encourage post-baccalaureate enrollment and reap the benefits of a highly skilled, geographically and socio-economically mobile, and productive workforce."}, {"section_title": "Objective of this Study", "text": "What drives individuals to pursue graduate education is still a relatively underexplored topic. While the existing literature sheds some light on the impacts of gender, race, debt, type of undergraduate institution and ability on graduate enrollment, many of these studies are either dated or too narrow in scope.

Therefore, the objectives of this study are: First, using more recent data from a nationally representative sample of bachelor's degree holders, I investigate the determinants of graduate school enrollment using an adaptation of the conceptual models developed by researchers of school enrollment. The model I utilize is based on the human capital model of school choice and includes measures informed by Bourdieu's theories of habitus and social reproduction. Expanding the human capital model to include proxies for habitus, social and cultural capital to account for differences in individual's penchant for graduate education has been shown to improve the model's explanatory power (Dumais, 2002;Perna, 2004). Additionally, I examine how the variables of interest in this model have changed over time by comparing the results from two surveys -the 1993/03 and 2008/12 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Studies.

While the few published studies have advanced our knowledge on post-baccalaureate school choice, they were either focused on a specific graduate degree program, institution, or were conducted using older data. The higher education sector has experienced significant changes over the last 15 -20 years as a result of shrinking governmental subsidies (Barr & Turner, 2013), rise in tuition costs, and an increased reliance on student debt (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013;Carlton, 2015;English & Umbach, 2016). Additionally, and just as importantly, students themselves are a much more heterogeneous group whose attitudes, expectations and information consumption behaviors have changed as millennials have reached college-going age (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013;Morreale & Staley, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "What Do", "text": "We Know About the Returns to Graduate School? There are numerous social and private returns to education -both pecuniary and nonpecuniary -that have been extensively documented. However, most of the research examining educational outcomes does so by aggregating the data to form comparisons between high school, and all post-secondary degree attainment. That is, they investigate the effects of 12 years of education relative to 16+ years of education, obscuring the effects that post-baccalaureate attainment may have relative to undergraduate attainment."}, {"section_title": "Skills premium and lower unemployment", "text": "The skills premium refers to higher wages individuals earn compared to their less skilled -in this context educated -counterparts. By investing in their human capital and pursuing advanced degrees, individuals can increase the price they sell their labor at (Hausman & & Taylor, 1981;Angrist & Krueger, 1991;Card, 1999). For example, many well-paying professions are only available to those who have attained a post-baccalaureate degree, such as medical doctors, lawyers, or college professors. Despite efforts to improve educational outcomes among minority and low-income groups, there remains disparities in the racial and socio-economic composition of those pursuing post-baccalaureate credentials. For example, Black and Hispanic students are still underrepresented in graduate schools relative to their representation to undergraduate degree completers and American society at large (Espinosa, Turk, & Chessman, 2019). Burgess (2016) writes that \"at a national level, a country's stock of skills matters hugely for its prosperity and growth rate. The distribution of skills is a big determinant of inequality, and the relationship of a person's skills to their background is central to the degree of social or intergenerational mobility.\" Katz and Autor (1999) attribute the rise in inequality since the 1970's largely to the rising premium for skills. Goldin & Katz (2008) also find that the rise in inequality was, for the most part, due to an educational slowdown, arguing that if the rate of skill acquisition were to keep up with the rate of technological change, then inequality would fall as average incomes rise. To the best of my knowledge, there have only been four studies in the last decade that have looked at private returns to post-baccalaureate education in the United States. Song et al., (2007) find significant and positive returns to advanced degree attainment. The authors use the 1993 wave of the Scientist and Engineer Statistics Data System (SESTAT) from the National Survey of College Graduates. They use ordinary least squares and two-stage estimation of log earnings, controlling for non-random sorting of students across degrees and fields of study based on GRE scores. The authors use the cost of graduate education, the likelihood of receiving financial aid when earning a bachelor's degree, and parental education as instrumental variables that affect degree choice. Their research sheds light on the role mathematics and verbal skills play in enrollment into post-baccalaureate degrees. They find students in majors requiring strong math skills are much less likely to pursue an advanced degree and tend to terminate their schooling at the bachelor's level. This is in contrast to students in majors requiring strong verbal skills who are much more likely to pursue a graduate degree. Following the model of Song et al., (2007), Stevenson (2016)  cost/benefit ratios and, internal rates of return. 8 The authors find positive returns to Master's degrees in general, with the returns to a Master's in education and business higher than other fields, on average. One of the common statistical problems in school choice is the endogeneity problem of selection bias -that is, a correlation between one or more of the independent variables and the error term. In an attempt to address selection bias, Titus (2007) used propensity score matching to estimate the returns to enrolling in a master's degree program based on data from the B&B:93/97. A benefit of employing this method is that propensity score matching has relaxed assumptions regarding the functional form of the relationship between outcomes and their predictors. Using this technique Titus estimates the average treatment effect on the treated and the untreated based on the probability of a number of treatment alternatives. The alternatives he employs are receiving a master's in: education, business, all other, or no master's degree. 9 Outside of receiving a master's in education or business, Titus (2007) finds no statistically significant effect of completing a master's degree on earnings. While there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the returns to post-baccalaureate education, these studies demonstrate that, on average, advanced degrees do lead to higher salaries postgraduation. Table 1 provides the dollar amount and percentage wage premium for Master's degree holders over Bachelor's degree holders in select occupations, as of 2013. 10 The wage premium ranges from a high of $80,000 for those in the financial services field to a low of $11,900 for elementary and middle school teachers. Having post-baccalaureate credentials has also been shown to reduce the likelihood and duration of unemployment spells (Avery & Turner, 2012;Oreopoulos & Petronijevic, 2013), and increased social mobility for those from disadvantaged backgrounds (Kahn, 2010;Oreopoulos & Salvanes, 2011).  "}, {"section_title": "Social Returns", "text": "None of the research on social returns specifically examined graduate school enrollment. The existing research typically examines the difference among high school dropouts, high school graduates, and college graduates. Based on these studies, there is ample evidence that education has broader social returns, including increased quality of life (Baum, Ma, & Payea, 2010), lower rates of participation in crime (Lochner & Moretti, 2004), higher civic participation (Dee, 2004;Milligan, Moretti, & Oreopoulos, 2004), strengthened democracy (Glaeser, Ponzetto, & Shleifer, 2007), improved health and life expectancy outcomes (Lleras-Muney, 2005;Oreopoulos P. , 2007;Cutler, Huang, & Lleras-Muney, 2015), lower divorce rates (Oreopoulos & Salvanes, 2011), greater life satisfaction (Oreopoulos P. , 2007;Oreopoulos & Salvanes, 2011), and improved parenting skills (Del Bono, Francesconi, Y., & A., 2016) $0 "}, {"section_title": "Economic Growth", "text": "Post-baccalaureate education provides the opportunity to acquire more advanced and specialized skills than those obtained at the baccalaureate level. Similar to research on social returns however, the research exploring the impact of education on economic growth approaches the question by examining post-secondary educational attainment without specifying degree level. Researchers suggest a link between education and labor productivity. A higher educated labor force results in greater technological innovation and progress, supporting faster economic growth (Dellas & Koubi, 2003;Goldin & Katz, 2008;Hanushek & Woessmann, 2012). The relationship between education, productivity, and technological advancement suggest that economic growth and prosperity (both personal and national) is biased towards those with advanced skills."}, {"section_title": "What about Signaling?", "text": "One challenge to the role that education plays in human capital accumulation has been the signaling view. Signaling suggests that schooling does not increase productivity, it merely signals natural ability. Signaling theory stipulates that academically \"able\" individuals will rationally choose more schooling to signaling to employers their ability. This results in an upward bias to the rates of return to education; however, this argument is rarely raised in contemporary research (Burgess, 2016). A number of studies have provided convincing evidence in support of the human capital approach (Chevalier, Harmon, Walker, & Zhu, 2004;Lange & Topel;Arcidiacono, Bayer, & Hizmo, 2010). Lange & Topel (2006) suggest that employers discover individual's talents \"relatively quickly\", adding that signaling has a small impact on private returns. Another argument in support of the human capital approach to education is the spillover effect -the productivity gains generated by the social interactions of workers. Moretti (2004) finds that productivity in manufacturing plants located in cities with a higher fraction of college graduates grow faster than in similar plants in cities with a smaller fraction of college graduates. Braunerhjelm et al., (2017) add to the literature of spillover effects by examining labor mobility and productivity. They provide evidence that labor mobility between firms disseminates knowledge and furthers innovation. Thus, while signaling may have some effect on the returns to education, there is ample evidence that education has a positive impact on labor productivity."}, {"section_title": "Distance Learning", "text": "In the United States, distance learning can be dated as far back as the late 1800's when correspondence coursework was delivered through the postal system. Over the past two centuries, distance learning has evolved with the advent of new technology where today there are web and video-based platforms delivering synchronous and asynchronous instruction . Distance education, online education, online learning and elearning are terms that have been used interchangeably by scholars. 11 Generally speaking, this form of pedagogy can be defined as bridging the space (and for asynchronous instruction, time) between instructors and their students through the use of technology ). There are very few methodologically rigorous studies providing convincing evidence on the effectiveness of hybrid and online courses compared to traditional in-person courses at the undergraduate, let alone the graduate level (Jaggars & Bailey, 2010;Wu, 2015). Overall, the findings differ based on student characteristics such as age and ability, as well as institutional type, with worse outcomes for low-income, lower GPA students enrolled in two-and four-year institutions as well as private for-profit institutions (Xu & Jaggars, 2014;Bettinger, Fox, Loeb, & Taylor, 2017 \nDistance, or online learning has become a central feature of many graduate courses and programs (Kearsley, Lynch, & Wizer, 1995). From a demand perspective, online education has the potential to appeal and reach a wider audience such as early and mid-career working adults, as well as primary caregivers who otherwise would not have access to post-baccalaureate opportunities as a result of traveling and scheduling barriers. From a supply perspective, online education has the potential of generating additional revenue for academic institutions by expanding into non-traditional enrollment markets and supplementing \"bricks-and-mortar\" offerings. Source: Authors calculations US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics using HEGIS \"Degrees and Other Formal Awards Conferred\" and IPEDS \"Completions\" surveys Distance education is concentrated among less-selective, for-profit institutions that operate as \"chains\". In 2013, 32% of students in for-profit institutions were enrolled full-time in an online program compared to 1.3% of enrollment in selective public and private institutions (Deming, Goldin, Katz, & Yuchtman, 2015). One explanation for the slower adoption of online courses at selective institutions is that these institutions compete on the basis of reputation, services they provide, and a unique academic experience. In comparison, for-profit institutions provide offerings that resemble a commodity product and can capitalize on economies of scale (Deming, Goldin, Katz, & Yuchtman, 2015;McPherson & Bacow, 2015). Using IPEDS fall enrollment survey data from 2012 through 2016, (Seaman, Allen, & Seaman, 2018) report a rise in distance course enrollment with a larger proportion of graduates enrolling in distance courses than undergraduates. The data shows that the majority of students taking online courses lived in the same state as the institution they attended with almost 53% of students enrolled in online courses also having enrolled in at least one course on campus. In March 2020, higher education institutions had to quickly switch their academic offerings to an online format as a result of having to close campuses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These spring-term online offerings were quickly put together as a low fidelity mitigation strategy and lacked the process typically undertaken when designing online programs (Grajek, 2020). Whether the industry will embrace online learning as part of the core educational experience over the longer term is difficult to tell. This may be the impetus for accelerating the move to online education, but there remains doubt as to their efficacy, sustainability and accessibility."}, {"section_title": "Previous Research on Graduate School Choice", "text": "As previously mentioned, there is a robust set of empirical literature on undergraduate enrollment. However, the research on graduate school enrollment is relatively underdeveloped in comparison. The existing empirical literature on post-baccalaureate education can be grouped into two broad categories: 1) those examining determinants of graduate school enrollment based on student and family background, as well as institutional characteristics (Ethington & Smart, 1986;Dumais, 2002;Millett, 2003;Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003;Perna, 2004;Perna, 2006;Zhang L. , 2013;English & Umbach, 2016); and 2) those examining the impact of business cycle fluctuations and labor market conditions on the demand for graduate school enrollment (Light, 1995;Dellas & Koubi, 2003;Bedard & Herman, 2008;Goh, 2009;Johnson, 2013;Bogan & Wu, 2018 (Ethington & Smart, 1986;Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003;Zhang L. , 2005). 12 There is evidence suggesting that social origins have a substantial association with access to selective institutions, field of study, and occupational allocation (Torche, 2011). First-generation students, whose parents tend to have less education, are less likely to aspire for and attend graduate school compared to students of more educated parents (Carlton, 2015). Additionally, when first-generation students do attend graduate school, they are less likely to complete their degrees (Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003). These influences at the undergraduate level then indirectly inform the decision to pursue graduate education. The sociological theory most often used in the school choice literature is Pierre Bourdieu's theory of habitus. Paulsen & St. John (2002) define habitus as \"an enduring, internal system of values, attitudes, beliefs, and actions, which is derived from the student's immediate family, community, and school environments and is common to members of one's social class\". As such, habitus refers to the driving force behind people's actions, preferences, and tastes. Habitus, together with cultural and social capital \"consistently frame, constrain, and structure students' patterns of college choice\" (Paulsen & St. John, 2002). Cultural capital refers to the traditions, norms, and expectations that exist and are perpetuated within the family and community structure. Bourdieu & Passeron (1977) call this the \"cultural reproduction of class relations\". Contemporary research has suggested that students acquire cultural competencies through their school environment and that higher quality and status schools develop cultural competencies that help students navigate academic requirements and provide greater interaction with authority figures (Jack, 2016). Reinforcing previous findings that postsecondary school success is, to some extent, based on skills that are acquired through the school environment (i.e. the community structure) rather than the home (Ethington & Smart, 1986;Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003). Social capital on the other hand refers to the social network and resources that an individual can tap into (Veenstra, 2009). Similar to other forms of capital, social capital is productive in that is allows individuals to achieve certain objectives that would not otherwise be as possible in its absence (Coleman, 1988). Lin & Smith (2001) provide a rationale for how investing in and utilizing one's social capital can improve the outcomes of certain actions: 1) Social capital facilitates the flow of information that otherwise would not be available or too costly to acquire; 2) Social ties in strategic positions may influence the individual themselves; 3) It can be viewed by others within the individual's group as endorsement of one's social credentials; 4) Social relationships act as mechanisms of social identity which validates and reinforces individuals' ties and access to certain resources. These features of social capital provide returns to the individual not accounted for in tradition human capital theory. Human and social capital investments have the same objectivesto maximize the likelihood of a certain outcome such as higher pay, or acquiring a desired internship. They differ in that human capital is an acquisition of knowledge and skill through education and on-the-job training that the individual then utilizes to earn higher wages, while social capital is an investment in relationships that can then be 'borrowed' in the pursuit of any number of objectives. In terms of the datasets previously used to examine background characteristics, and social and cultural capital, Ethington & Smart (1986) Ethington & Smart (1986) find that, controlling for field of study and the amount of financial aid, social and academic integration had the strongest effects on the decision to enroll. Their analysis however examined enrollment into graduate school without the ability to explore the different degree types. Other researchers were able to disaggregate graduate education into separate degree programs and found that differentiating between the different types of programs sheds more light on the impact of family background than when graduate education is considered in aggregate. For example, Mullen et al., (2003) find that parents' education has a significant effect on enrollment in professional and doctoral programs, a small effect on master's programs, and no effect on MBA programs. However, parental education had a lower impact once they controlled for test scores and undergraduate institutional characteristics, concluding that parents' educational background matters for some programs more than others. In exploring background characteristics, researches have examined the effects undergraduate institution type and quality has on persistence through graduate education (Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003;Perna, 2004;Zhang L. , 2005;English & Umbach, 2016). Unsurprisingly, they find that in general, the type of undergraduate institutional (two-year, public research, private research, and liberal arts) attended is an important determinant of graduate school enrollment -particularly doctoral programs at research universities (Zhang L. , 2005;English & Umbach, 2016). Mullen et al., (2003) added a control measure for selectivity by calculating average SAT scores and find that the likelihood of pursing a graduate degree increases significantly for those students from public and private research universities as well as selective institutions. With respect to other research, Zhang (2005)  other previous research, they find that both the type of major and undergraduate GPA, played a significant role in the aspiration, application and enrollment decisions of bachelor degree holders. However, contrary to previous results reported by others, they do not find a statistically significant impact of student debt on the graduate choice process. 13 Nor do they find significant differences based on gender or race/ethnicity. They conclude that minorities don't appear to be inherently disadvantaged, and suggest that students' experiences at their undergraduate institutions enhance their social and/or cultural capital, thereby detaching themselves from their inherited social and cultural constraints. In summary, a person's habitus, social, and cultural capital structures play a role in influencing that individual's educational choice process as well as their educational success. From a cultural capital perspective, that success is driven by the individual's values and norms. Whereas social capital facilitates information gathering that would better inform the individual's cost/benefits of pursuing a post-baccalaureate education, choice of institution, the application and admission process, as well as the pursuit of financial aid. The aforementioned studies suggest that including these constructs in the conceptual model works better at explaining and predicting postbaccalaureate enrollment decisions than a standalone economic framework. This modified human capital framework acknowledges that post-baccalaureate persistence is not universal and that persistence varies based on one's surroundings, upbringing and other observable and unobservable backgrounds."}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate Field of Study", "text": "There is a strong relationship between undergraduate field of study and graduate degree type (Altonji, Arcidiacono, & Maurel, 2016). Using the B&B:93/97, Mullen et al. (2003) and Zhang (2005) find that students of biology and math sciences had the highest likelihood of enrolling in a doctoral program, while business majors had the smallest probability of pursuing either master's or doctoral degrees. Using career-value measures from the survey data, Mullen et al. (2003) find a strong positive effect on master's and professional degree enrollment for respondents who sought to influence the political structure; while those aspiring for financial gains had twice the odds of entering an MBA program; and rating career success as an important measure had a negative effect on master's enrollment. A limitation hindering the generalizability of these studies is that these studies captured individuals early in their careers. The time frame in which the data is collected isn't long enough to encompass the typical age in which students earn graduate, professional and doctoral degrees. 14 The data used by Mullen et al. (2003) and Zhang (2005) shows that less than 30% of the students had enrolled in a post-baccalaureate program at the time of the survey. The motivation for students to enroll in graduate education shortly after completing their undergraduate degree may very well vary from those later on in their careers."}, {"section_title": "Impact of Undergraduate Debt", "text": "A number of studies have documented the adverse effect educational debt has on the decision to pursue graduate schooling. Millet 2003, Perna (2004), and Carlton (2015) amongothers, have shown that financial resources play an important factor in student's decision to pursue a graduate degree. Students who have high levels of undergraduate debt tend to be less likely to apply to graduate programs compared to their peers with less educational debt. Additionally, there is evidence that suggests that even in the absence of a \"formal credit constraint\", low-income, minority, and first-generation students tend to be debt averse (Scott-Clayton, 2012; Oreopoulos & Petronijevic, 2013). To better understand the graduate school choice decision of minorities in STEM fields, Malcom & Dowd (2012) estimate the impact of debt on both borrowers and non-borrowers based on PSM analysis using a constrained multinomial probit regression model. The authors subdivide the treatment group of borrowers into two groups, heavy borrowers and typical borrowers, and compare them to the control group of non-borrowers. Based on data from the 2003 National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG), the authors find wide variation in the borrowing patterns of different racial groups: Author's calculations based on data from the Education Commission of the States. http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/MBQuestAFA?rep=AFA1704 20 PROMISE recipients were found to have improved SES outcomes.

Therefore, to understand future graduate enrollment behavior, we need to expand our analysis to include literature on labor market and general macroeconomic conditions that may affect demand for, and completion of graduate education. Becker's human capital model posits that during economic downturns, labor demand and wages are suppressed, resulting in a lower opportunity cost for investing in human capital. Studies documenting the impact of labor market conditions on college enrollment (without distinguishing undergraduate from graduate) have reported conflicting results. Some studies have shown that during a recession, students are more likely to continue their studies and enroll in post-secondary education (Sakellaris & Spilimbergo, 2000;Christian, 2007;Long, Goldhaber, & Huntington-Klein, 2015); while others suggest that depressed labor market conditions drive students to choose terminal degrees that lead to careers without the need for additional schooling (Blom, Cadena, & Keys, 2015). The variability in the results of these studies is due to the different data sets and cohorts examined, as well as differences in the variables of interest. 21 Bedard & Herman 2008 for enrolling into one of the three degree levels -Master's, Professional, and Doctoral -separately. The authors assign the state unemployment rate to individuals based on the year and state where the student completed their undergraduate education. Additionally, they control for individuals earning their Bachelor's degree outside their home state. The authors find that the decision to pursue a graduate degree depends on gender, degree type and GPA. More specifically, they find women's enrollment in all graduate degrees to be acyclical; male master's degree enrollment procyclical; but enrollment in doctorate programs to be countercyclical for males with high GPA as well as for males with undergraduate degrees in STEM fields. One interesting finding from this study is that the authors report similar results when using the state unemployment rate for the student's home state. 22 It could be that home states have similar unemployment rates to institutions' states, or that enrollment at the undergraduate level tends to draw from geographically proximal neighborhoods which have similar unemployment rates. 23 The work of Bedard & Herman (2008) has been modified, extended and updated by a number of scholars to address some of the limitations of that study: First, Bedard & Herman (2008) use the sample of science and engineering majors from the NSRCG survey data, which accounts for approximately one third of all bachelor degrees awarded. 24 Second, more than half of bachelor degree holders continue their post-baccalaureate education more than 19 months after earning their bachelor's degree. 25 In fact, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study-Graduate and First Professional for 2008, 2012, and 2016 show that the average time to graduate degree is 7.38, 6.89, and 7.02 years respectively. 26 Third, the NSRCG survey doesn't capture enough minority students to allow for the examination of racial differences in graduate enrollment behavior. Goh 2009 The NLSY97 oversampled minority respondents to allow for sufficient participation of black and Hispanic respondents for statistical analysis. 28 The authors are therefore able to examine the impact of fluctuations in economic conditions on graduate enrollment based on race. The results of these studies are for the most part consistent, with some variability resulting from nuances of the models. For example, Goh (2009) finds that when including state-level economic indicators, the effect of state unemployment on enrollment in professional programs to be statistically insignificant. She arguing that state-level unemployment may not be a good measure of labor market opportunities for college graduates. This may be because postbaccalaureate graduates, and particularly professional degree holders, are more mobile than other members of the workforce. According to the latest CPS data, 21% of out-of-state movers had a 27 The authors argue that the NLSY survey is superior to the CPS due to its richer set of control variables and the capture of graduate enrollment by type of graduate program."}, {"section_title": "28", "text": "National Longitudinal Survey of Youth|1997 Sample Design & Screening Process: https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy97/intro-to-the-sample/sample-design-screening-process graduate degree compared to 15% who had a bachelor's degree. 29 Goh (2009) finds that professional degree enrollment to be counter-cyclical, and enrollment to be ambiguous for all other graduate fields. She suggests that one explanation for the ambiguity of the results is the opposing interaction of the opportunity cost and credit constraint. Johnson 2013uses statewide variation in unemployment rates as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions with state fixed-effects. The author finds that female graduate enrollment is countercyclical and male enrollment is acyclical, and that poor labor market conditions caused students to switch to part-time study. Johnson finds unemployment to have a non-linear relationship to female enrollment, but no effect on male enrollment. Bogan & Wu 2018use lagged macroeconomic measures including national unemployment rates and the S&P 500 Index. 30 In general, they find that graduate school enrollment is counter-cyclical, with significant variations in the magnitude of the response to the business cycle based on race and type of graduate program (Master's, PhD, and Professional). Bogan & Wu (2018) estimate the impact to be almost twice as large for non-Whites compared to Whites, suggesting a lower opportunity cost for minority groups. A possible explanation of the lower opportunity cost for minority groups is the prevalence of wage discrimination. Carnevale and Fasules (2017) estimate that, on average, Black and Hispanic educated workers earn 81 and 82 cents respectively, for every dollar a White worker with the same level of education makes. In conclusion, while the existing literature on graduate enrollment sheds some light on the impacts of gender, race, debt, type of undergraduate institution, ability, and social and cultural capital on graduate enrollment, many of the studies are either dated or too narrow in scope. Over the past two decades, higher education has experienced significant changes, including shrinking governmental subsidies, rising tuition costs, and an increased reliance on student debt. The student composition is also much more heterogeneous, with different attitudes, behaviors and expectations than those from two decades ago. Additionally, the literature on graduate school enrollment shows a great deal of variability in the impact economic conditions have on graduate school enrollment based on race, gender, ability, program of study and degree level. The most recent of these studies relied on the B&B:00/01 survey; while other researchers have reported on too specific a field of study or institution. 31 These studies pushed the research forward, but their findings prevent us from drawing conclusions that can be generalized into the broader post-baccalaureate context. Given these limitations, there are two main conclusions that can be drawn from the existing literature. First, graduate school encompasses a diverse set of degrees, pathways, and careers. Thus, when feasible, disaggregating the data enables us to examine variations that would otherwise be obscured when studied in aggregate. Second, it is widely accepted in economics that socioeconomic background has a direct impact on school outcomes and future earnings. Sociologists have provided a theoretical context to explain these phenomena, namely habitus, and social and cultural capital. By using economic tools and a multidisciplinary approach to examining graduate school choice, we may conceptually be able to better explain the graduate choice process."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3: TRENDS IN GRADUATE EDUCATION", "text": "In this chapter I examine relevant trends in graduate education using Current Population Survey (CPS), IPEDS, Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Studies, and National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) data. Over the past two decades, graduate enrollment has almost doubled from 1.75 million students in 2007, to 3.02 million in 2017. 32 In comparison, federal student aid for graduate education more than doubled, from $22 billion to $60 billion during the same time period. Figure 2 shows the historical fall enrollment trend between 1988 and 2017. While the total number of graduate student enrollment is on an upward trajectory, examination of the IPEDS data reveals that the trend has plateaued over the past decade at approximately 3 million students. Shifting demographics resulting from low birth rates 20 years ago and a strong economy are some factors contributing to the recent plateauing effect. 33  between 2010 and 2017; while the share of graduate enrollment in private not-for-profit institutions grew from 41% to almost 43% over the same time period. In contrast, the share of graduate enrollment in public institutions has been on a steady decline from 63% in 1988 to 48% in 2017. Why the faster growth in private institutions is not clear. Private institutions do provide greater tuition discounts and aid packages than public institutions. However, the average net price at private doctoral and master's institutions was more than double the net price at public institutions (Baum, Lapovsky, & Ma, 2010;Ma, Baum, Pender, & Libassi, 2019). 1,000,000 1,500,000 2,000,000 2,500,000 3,000,000 3, 500,000 1988 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 1988 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011  income individuals having earned a post-baccalaureate degree compared to 5.5% and 3.5% of middle-and low-income individuals, respectively. 37 Figure 5 depicts field-specific, longitudinal trends for Master's degrees conferred between 1971 and 2016. The data in Figure 5 shows that Master's degree attainment more than tripled, in aggregate, with significant variations among the different fields of study. International students are a significant driver of the growth in post-baccalaureate degree enrollment, having grown 295% between 1980 and 2016. 38 In the Fall of 2017, international students represented 20.3% of total first-time graduate enrollment. 39 While international student enrollment is an important factor in the demand for higher education in the United States, they are out of scope for purposes of this  (Table B8). "}, {"section_title": "Unemployment by Race", "text": "The role of unemployment in the decision to pursue graduate education is theoretically ambiguous. On the one hand, unemployment acts as a constraint by reducing the resources available to invest in education; on the other hand, it lowers the opportunity cost of that investment. A more focused analysis on the cyclicality of graduate enrollment is presented in the next chapter. The unemployment rate of college graduates is about half that of the national average. 41 Among college graduates, there is great variability in unemployment by racial group with evidence of minorities suffering disproportionately during economic downturns (Bogan & Wu, 2018). For example, between 1988 and 2017, Blacks had the highest median unemployment rate at 10.4% followed by Hispanics at 7.7%, while Asians had the lowest median unemployment rate at 4.4%.   greater on-campus diversity is important not only for socio-economic outcomes and social mobility of minority groups, but also for the academic experience of all students and related communities. The Federal government has recently issued guidelines and provided institutions with assistance in support of efforts promoting student-body diversity (U.S. Department of Education, 2016). These efforts are focused on encouraging institutions to not only attract and admit students from various backgrounds and experiences, but to also invest in efforts that provide 43 A 2018 Pew Research Center reported that nearly half of post-millennials -those born on or after 1996 -were non-white. In comparison, roughly 18% of baby boomers were non-white. 1988 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 1988 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008  mortgage loans. 46 The majority of student debt has been concentrated at the undergraduate level with the rise of undergraduate borrowing attributed to the growing number of bachelor degree recipients (Murphy, 2020). However, as depicted in Figure 11, graduate debt has been on a rapid upward trajectory since the 1990's, with the trend plateauing over the past decade. 47   The rise in educational cost in general and subsequent debt burdens has acted as a disincentive for students from low-income and minority backgrounds by imposing a higher cost of entry, adding to the social stratification of that population (Pyne & Grodsky, 2018). Examining graduate educational borrowing by racial groups supports these findings. Figure 12 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 Table 3 through Table 7 provide definitions for the independent variables used in this analysis, their percentage distribution among the sample, the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. The inclusion of these variables in the model was informed by a thorough examination of the research on graduate enrollment. The Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Survey is a robust dataset, however, it is very limited in its direct measures of social and cultural capital (Perna, 2004;English & Umbach, 2016). Approximate measures are therefore necessary to incorporate in the empirical model. While, there is a clear distinction between human, social and cultural capital, the available proxies for these measures in the Baccalaureate and Beyond dataset underly multiple concepts. Therefore, I include them in the same model without ascribing the variables to any specific form of capital.   "}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "The research design in this section is informed by the economic, higher education, and sociological research on capital formation within the context of graduate school choice. Becker's human capital theory serves as the main backdrop for this research. Human capital theory states that education drives marginal productivity of the labor force, and that that productivity in turn improves earnings. Consequently, the choice to invest in education is assumed to be based on weighing the net monetary and non-monetary benefits across all possible alternatives and selecting the option with the highest utility given the individual's expectations and tastes. A major assumption of human capital theory is that individuals have perfect knowledge about the costs and benefits of the alternatives, and are a homogeneous group with respect to their preferences and expectations (Perna, 2004). However, there is great heterogeneity in socio-economic backgrounds, social structures and social inequalities that exists in the United States (Callender & Dougherty, 2018). For example, parents of higher socio-economic backgrounds tend to be better informed about the benefits of education and alternative financing options such as scholarships and grants (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2006;Dumais & Ward, 2010). As discussed in Chapter 2, Bourdieu's social reproduction theory posits that culture capital is passed down within the family structure, which in turn depends in large part on social class. Bourdieu and others have argued that cultural capital of the \"dominant class\" is transmitted, and in many cases rewarded, by the education system (Bourdieu, 1973;Swartz, 1997). Hoxby (2009) finds that student sorting among colleges lead high-ability students -who tend to come from high socio-economic backgrounds -to increasingly concentrate in highly selective college. Attending selective institutions has been associated with higher completion rates and greater labor market returns (Brewer, Eide, & Ehrenberg, 1999;Dale & Krueger, 2002;Cohodes & Goodman, 2012). While there have been great strides made in racial and socio-economic diversification at higher educational institutions (Glynn, 2017), attendance at highly selective institutions is still skewed to the right of the parental wage distribution. 49 Within the sociological literature, studies examining the effects of cultural capital on educational success have reached contradictory conclusions. Dumais (2002) argues that most studies fail to control for the role that habitus -a crucial component of Bourdieu's theoretical model -plays in educational outcomes. Habitus refers to the driving force behind people's actions, preferences, and tastes. This driving force is shaped by individuals' views of their place in the world, and is theorized to be an important factor in determining students' educational expectations and how they navigate educational systems (Dumais, 2002 49 Using the B&B:08/12 data, almost 60% of students enrolled in \"very selective\" institutions had parental income exceeding $62,000 and almost 71% of the students were White 50 Dumais states that \"studying cultural capital while ignoring habitus leaves Bourdieu's theoretical framework incomplete in its practical application. It is necessary to consider both one's resources (capital) and the orientation one has toward using those resources (habitus) to implement the model of practice in the educational field in the way that Bourdieu intended\". 51 As previously mentioned, while there is a clear distinction between human, social and cultural capital, the available proxies for these measures in the Baccalaureate and Beyond dataset underly multiple concepts. Therefore, I include them in the same model without ascribing the variables to any specific form of capital. Professional and Doctorate enrollment were excluded as a result of the small sample sizes which undermine the external validity of the output for these degree levels. Ideally, one would use a logistic regression in a model of school choice, as the dependent variable of interest is binary and can take on only two possible values -enrolled and not enrolled. However, PowerStats only provides the odds ratios for the regression output, thus making a meaningful interpretation and comparison of results not possible. While odds ratios are simple to read, they need to be accompanied by a detailed explanation of the model that produced the ratios in order to be interpreted correctly (Norton & Dowd, 2018). Additionally, one cannot use odds ratios to compare results across models or even across samples without first assuming that unobserved heterogeneity is the same across all the models and samples (Mood, 2010). The alternative to a logistic regression is a linear probability model (LPM). Some researches argue against using an LPM in favor of a probit or logit model citing: 1) in an LPM, the error term has a non-constant structure giving rise to heteroskedasticity and producing biased standard errors (Bellemare, 2015); 2) the linear model can produce predicted values that are negative or greater than one for covariates that are continuous; and 3) the LPM imposes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Angrist and Pischke (2009) respond to these critisims by arguing that even if a conditional expectation function is non-linear, the LPM still provides an approximation of the expectation function. They note that for the right non-linear model, an LPM will give wrong marginal effects; however, the same logic is true for the wrong non-linear model. In an online post discussing LPM's, Pischke states that \"the fact that we have a probit, a logit, and the LPM is just a statement to the fact that we don't know what the \"right\" model is. Hence, there is a lot to be said for sticking to a linear regression function as compared to a fairly arbitrary choice of a non-linear one!\". 52 Given the data limitations inherent in PowerStats and the reasonableness of an LPM, I model the probability of enrolling in a Master's degree program using ordinary least square, and based on measures and characteristics that have previously been shown to influence graduate school enrollment so that: In 2008, students' reported annual incomes were evenly distributed. However, 2009, one year after graduation, a little over 80% reported earning less than $49,200 as depicted in Figure   13. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides extended measures of the unemployment rate ranging from U-1 through U-6. 54 U-6 includes individuals working part-time for economic reasons (PTER). An individual is counted as PTER if they work less than 35 hours per week while wanting to work full-time, and cite weak business conditions or a lack of full-time opportunities as reasons for not working full-time. In 2009, the peak of the Great Recession, the national unemployment rate (U-3) was 9.3% compared to the U-6 rate of 17%. 55 The annualized 2009 salary data in Figure   13 is indicative of the involuntary part-time employment endemic during, and immediately after the Great Recession (Canon, Kudlyak, & Reed, 2014). While there was a rightwards shift in incomes by 2012, almost 71% still earned less than $49,200 (in 2009 dollars). 54 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics defines these measures as follows: -U-1, persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer, as a percent of the civilian labor force; -U-2, job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs, as a percent of the civilian labor force; -U-3, total unemployed, as a percent of the civilian labor force (this is the definition used for the official unemployment rate); -U-4, total unemployed plus discouraged workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers; -U-5, total unemployed, plus discouraged workers, plus all other marginally attached workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all marginally attached workers; and -U-6, total unemployed, plus all marginally attached workers, plus total employed part time for economic reasons, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all marginally attached workers.  Using the B&B:93/97, Perna (2004) finds that parental education was a significant predictor of post-baccalaureate enrollment. Status attainment theory suggests that family socioeconomic characteristics are positively associated with educational attainment (Hauser, Tsai, & Sewell, 1983). Parental education has been found to be a determinant of their children's academic performance, educational expectations, and ability to gain access to high quality postsecondary institutions (Grodsky & Jackson, 2009). Examining parental educational attainment from the B&B:08/12 however, doesn't provide any apparent insights. 56 The distribution of the sample and those ever enrolled in a Master's 56 One possible explanation for the difference in results could be that the B&B:08/12 collected student characteristics and decisions at the onset of the Great Recession when unemployment was rising. Whereas the B&B:93/97 captured this data during period of declining unemployment. The different economic environments could very well have influenced these (and other) measures in ways that make meaningful comparisons difficult."}, {"section_title": "Source: Author's calculations of 2008/12 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study", "text": "program across parental education levels are reported in Table 9. Overall, 45% of respondents reported having parents with less than 16 years of education while almost 29% had postbaccalaureate credentials (16 years plus). Hispanics had the highest share for having parents with less than an Associate's degree, while Asian parents had the highest share of doctoral degree. "}, {"section_title": "Predictors of enrollment into a Master's program", "text": "Using the model specifications discussed in section 4.3, I estimated an ordinary least squared regression of enrollment into a Master's degree program four years after earning a Bachelor's degree. 57 PowerStats was used to perform the linear regression with the resulting output presented in Table 10. The regression was weighted based on those surveyed in 2007-08, when students earned a bachelor's degree, and responded to all follow-up surveys -one year later in 2008-09, and four years later in 2012. This weight includes approximately 13,500 respondents. I compare the results of two models, Model 2 includes highest degree ever expected as a proxy for 57 Approximately 30% of bachelor degree holders had enrolled in a Master's degree program by 2012. This is in comparison to only 5% and 2% of the sample that had ever enrolled in a Professional and Doctorate program, respectively. Therefore, Professional and Doctorate enrollment were excluded as a result of the small sample sizes which undermine the external validity of the output for these degree levels.  Dumais (2002), comparing these two models allows us to test the role habitus plays in the decision to pursue graduate education. The output of Model 1 in Table 10 shows that GPA, age, higher incomes, and type of institution attended are statistically significant measures in the pursuit of post-baccalaureate education. Specifically, individuals having a GPA of 2.9 and higher were 12.9% more likely to have enrolled in a Master's degree program by 2012 relative to those with a GPA less than 2.9. Students older than the typical college-going cohort were 6.9% less likely to enroll in a Master's program compared to their younger counterparts. Individuals earning more than $45,000 in 2009 were 5.7% less likely to have enrolled compared to those earning less than $45,000. While graduates of public doctoral institutions had the greatest likelihood of enrolling in a Master's program at 9.5% relative to all other institution types. Black individuals were 8.8% more likely than other racial groups to have ever enrolled in a Master's degree program. Education majors had a 6.6% higher likelihood of Master's enrolling, while computer and information science, business, and other applied majors had 10.8%, 8.9%, and 7.8% lower likelihood of enrolling in a Master's program, respectively. These findings are consistent with prior research on human capital formation. For example, higher paid individuals face a larger opportunity cost of pursing a postbaccalaureate education as a result of their higher wages; and graduate business programs typically require work experience before considering students for enrollment. Model 2 adds a measure for habitus and shows that having an expectation of earning a Master's, Professional, or Doctoral degree increased one's likelihood of enrolling in a Master's program by 22.6%, 9.8% and 34.6% respectively. Compared to Model 1, the explanatory power of Model 2 more than doubles. The R-squared is often used as a measure of model fit. R-squared is the proportional change in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model and increases in value as more variables are added. Therefore, to compare the explanatory power of the models we rely on the adjusted R-squared. As its name suggests, the adjusted R-squared is a modified measure of fit that takes into account the number of variables in the model. 58 While the adjusted R-squared is still relatively low at 10.6%, the inclusion of degree expectation doesn't change the overall pattern or direction of the other coefficients. This suggests that controlling for highest degree ever expected, students' age, race, salary, type of institution and field of study still play a significant role in the pursuit of graduate education.    To run a regression in PowerStats, the minimum number of observations for each independent variable must be greater than 30. I was therefore unable to examine Asian students due to the number of observations falling below this threshold.    Previous research on human capital formation suggests a relationship between labor market conditions and the decision of college graduates to invest in their post-baccalaureate education. However, the effects of the economic fluctuations on graduate enrollment remains theoretically ambiguous (Johnson, 2013;Barr & Turner, 2013). This is due to competing pressures of opportunity costs and credit constraints. Studies have noted that cyclical changes in unemployment influence an individual's decision to acquire human capital by affecting their opportunity costs. Opportunity costs not only includes the explicit costs of education (such as tuition, room and board), but also the implicit cost that must be foregone to attend school, such as wages (Frank, 2005). Thus, theory stipulates that during times of high unemployment and/or low wage growth, the opportunity cost is lower. This is due to the fact that unemployed and underemployed individuals have already foregone all or some of their wages. Studies have shown that there are large long-term negative wage effects of graduating during economic downturns (Kahn, 2010;Oreopoulos, von Wachter, & Heisz, 2012). Students already enrolled may decide to further persist in their graduate education for fear of not finding a job or finding a job during an environment of suppressed wage growth. 65 Compared to their employed peers, unemployed and underemployed individuals face lower opportunity costs, and education becomes a means of re-entry into the labor force or a means of improving their future earnings potential. Therefore, during times of high unemployment and/or low wage growth, enrollment should increase. Since bachelor's degree holders tend to earn more than their non-degreed counterparts, the opportunity costs of pursuing an advanced degree tend to be considerably higher than those related to a high school, associates, or bachelor's degree (Bogan & Wu, 2018). We would therefore expect market fluctuations to have a greater effect on graduate school enrollment than undergraduate enrollment. On the other hand, the lower opportunity cost during economic slowdowns could be offset by individuals' inability to fund their desired level of investments in their human capital. This credit constraint could be driven by either individual and/or institutional factors. From the student perspective, the credit constraint could be a result of reduced savings, property values, and parental and extended family financial resources. To fund the cost of attendance, students will therefore need to borrow more funds through private loans and may have to accept higher interest rates. Exacerbating the students' situation are institutions who may be facing budgetary challenges. Pressures on institutional finances resulting from shrinking state subsidies, delays in awarding of federal research dollars and lower endowment earnings, all have a negative effect on graduate student funding opportunities, putting upward pressure on the credit constraint effect. Institutions typically respond to these budgetary pressures by increasing tuition prices to counteract the loss of these crucial resources, shifting the burden of human capital investment onto individuals and their families. Given these opposing pressures on the decision to invest in human capital, the question of the cyclicality of graduate enrollment demand becomes an empirical question with the net impact of macroeconomic conditions on enrollment dependent on the relative magnitude of these two effects (Barr & Turner, 2013). This section of the analysis building on the work of Bedard & Herman (2008) to examine enrollment in graduate programs from an institutional perspective. I use an adaptation of their human capital investment model to estimate the effects of changes in county, state and national unemployment rates on fall enrollment over a thirty year time period."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data used to estimate the impact of labor market conditions on graduate school enrollment consists of unemployment and enrollment data for 1988, and 1990 through 2017. Policy, Education Data Portal (Version 0.5.0 -Beta). This data captures the number of students enrolled in the fall term by race, gender, and level of study. The original data included three postbaccalaureate levels of study: graduate, first-professional (such as law and medicine) and postbaccalaureate education. First-professional and post-baccalaureate were dropped from the analysis as a result of the data not being continuous over the time period examined. 68 Additionally, only 66 https://www.nber.org/cycles.html 67 There are only two other papers which studied the impact of the business cycle on graduate enrollment over an extended timeframe. Goh (2009) examined IPEDS data from 1976 -2005, which included four recessions (NBER); and Johnson (2013) used CPS data from 1994 -2010, which included two recessions (NBER). 68 Since the objective of this study is to examine enrollment behavior over a number of business cycles, I dropped first-professional since it only went through 2008, and post-baccalaureate since it only went through 1998. institutions with more than ten years of enrollment data were included in order to establish an institution-specific time trend. Enrollment data by institution was matched with institutional directory data to capture state and county information. To proxy for business cycle conditions, I use county, state and national unemployment  Kienzl, Alfonso, & Melguizo (2007), suggest that utilizing national unemployment rates could lead to aggregation bias by not accounting for heterogeneous labor market conditions that exists within and across states. Since labor market conditions vary significantly across states, the national unemployment rate may not properly capture the opportunity costs in each state. By examining county, state, and national unemployment rates, we can test their impact separately to see how the model specification impacts enrollment. 70 Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Economic Data. According to the BLS, seasonal adjustment attempts to measure and eliminate the effect of predictable seasonal patterns. However, and as a general rule, they note that the annual average estimates are not seasonally adjusted. 71 Johnson 2013; Bogan and Wu 2018 also utilized Bedard and Herman's model using different specifications and datasets as discussed in Chapter 2. Where G* is the propensity of individual i to enroll at time t in a post-baccalaureate program directly after college; UER is the state-level unemployment rate; GPA is a set of three GPA categorical variables; MAJ is a set of dummies indicating the student's undergraduate major field of study; and X represents a series of vectors capturing additional individual characteristics, graduation year and state indicators. By including year and state indicators, Bedard and Herman are controlling for within year and state variations. Although the authors don't explicitly describe their model in this regard, including these indicators translates to running a year and state fixed effects regression model. The authors find that the cyclicality of graduate enrollment demand differs based on gender, graduate degree type and undergraduate GPA. They find women's enrollment in all graduate degrees to be acyclical; male enrollment in Master's degrees procyclical; but enrollment in doctorate programs to be countercyclical for males with high GPA as well as for males with undergraduate degrees in STEM fields. As previously mentioned, one limitation of their study is that they evaluated the probability the fall term using unemployment rates to proxy for labor market conditions so that: Where , , represents the log of graduate fall enrollment at institution i, in State s and year t; is the unemployment rate in year t; represents year fixed effects; represents institution fixed effects and , , is the error term. Year fixed effects control for year-specific idiosyncratic shocks that might impact graduate enrollment across all institutions. Year fixed effects also control for the aggregate rise in enrollment over the thirty-year time period examined. Institution fixed effects allow us to control for institution-specific time invariant unobservable factors that might impact graduate enrollment behavior. I separately examine annual average county and state level unemployment rates for individuals 16 years of age and older. Model (A) prevents us from using the national unemployment rate as the year fixed effects are picking up the breaks that may be occurring annually over time. To adjust for this, I ease the conditions somewhat by substituting year fixed effects with Year and Year 2 , which allows us to pick up the major shifts in the overall trend. The modified equation is represented by Model (B): Where , , , , and , , are the same as in Model (A), Year and Year 2 replace year fixed effects. The year variable is indexed where the year 1988 is set to 0, and 2017 to 29. By indexing year in this manner, we eliminate large numbers from the output and it allows us to more easily interpret the results as any rate of change is most apparent around zero. By running the above specification to include different levels of unemployment (local, state and national) separately, we can empirically test whether graduate enrollment operates more in a local or national market. Our ability to determine which market graduate enrollment operates in will depend on the magnitude of student mobility across counties and states in pursuit of postbaccalaureate education. If there were high levels of inter-state student migration, then the estimated coefficient on unemployment would be biased downwards. Johnson (2013) argued that frictions exist which most likely prevent high levels of cross-state mobility. He cites moving costs, being away from one's family and higher tuition costs as a result of paying out-of-state fees as potential frictions. While to some extent college recruitment is thought to be local, a growing number of graduate student enrollment comes from outside local markets (Hoover & Keller, 2011). In a 2009 report on changes in college selectivity, Hoxby argues that students choose a college far less for of its physical proximity and more for its resources, reputation, and student body. This shift in student need and expectation has resulted in a resorting of enrollment demand, causing selectivity to rise in a small number of institutions (Hoxby, 2009). Increasingly, institutions (particularly public institutions) are relying on out-of-state recruitment efforts to offset the evershrinking local college going demographic resulting from lower birthrates during the past two decades (Hoover & Keller, 2011). Reviewing the Baccalaureate and Beyond Surveys supports the position that there are sizable cross-state migrations after completion of a Bachelor's degree. From the B&B:08/12, 28% of respondents lived and worked in a different state than the one they earned their Bachelor's degree from. While the B&B:93/97 shows that approximately 31% reported living in a different state in 1997 compared to 1993 -the year that they graduated in. Given these trends in post-baccalaureate inter-state mobility, the estimated coefficient on state unemployment could very well be biased. The downward bias would result from students moving from states with high unemployment in order to live, work and/or attend graduate school in states with lower unemployment. The same logic holds true for cross-county mobility vis-\u00e0-vis county unemployment rates. Economic conditions in the county where the institution is located is most likely not what is driving enrollment at that institution. Additionally, there are very low barriers to crossing county lines to live, work and/or attend graduate school. Table 14 provides a summary of the sample means for the variables of interest from the IPEDS data. More females than males had enrolled in post-baccalaureate programs between 1988 and 2017; whites comprise the largest share followed by international students, while Asians comprised the smallest share. 73 In terms of the unemployment rates, the mean national unemployment rate for those 16 years and over is higher than those 20 years and older, which in turn is higher than the 25 years and over. This is due to the fact that younger individuals tend to have less schooling and lack the skills that tend to be in continuous demand in the marketplace. It has been repeatedly shown that unemployment rates are inversely related to education and experience. Schooling and experience have been shown to reduce the incidence and duration of unemployment spells (Ashenfelter & Ham, 1979;Riddell & Song, 2011). From our data, Blacks have the highest mean unemployment rates at 11.2%, while Asians had the lowest at 4.9%. 74"}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": "73 Other races include: American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Island, Two or more races, Unknown, and Other. 74 The unemployment rates for Blacks have almost consistently been twice those of Whites. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment data by race shows that since 1988 Black unemployment was double White unemployment in 23 of the last 30 years. Weller (2019), finds that the Black-White unemployment gap exists at every educational attainment level and for each age cohort. These persistently higher rates for Blacks do not necessarily reflect the lack of individual ability. Rather these trends underscore the lack of available opportunity within the confined of the social structure and racism prevalent in the United Sates."}, {"section_title": "Table 14 -Sample Means", "text": "Looking at the relationship between Fall graduate enrollment and the unemployment rates, Figure 14 depicts enrollment levels and the unemployment rates for individuals over 25 years of age. 75 We can see that graduate enrollment has been on an upward trajectory, increasing from 1.65 million students in 1990 to almost 2.8 million by 2017, with unemployment hitting three peaks   Bogan and Wu (2018) use the NLSY97 dataset to examine the impact of the business cycle on graduate enrollment. The authors find that lagging unemployment rates were more closely correlated with graduate enrollment. As we can see in Figure 14 and Figure 15, graduate enrollment appears to be correlated with contemporaneous unemployment rates. I run a set of regressions to empirically test the relationship between enrollment and lagged unemployment with the resulting output presented in Appendix E. I find that while the R 2 remained relatively consistent, the impact on enrollment diminishes with each additional year of lagged unemployment. This is most likely a result of the IPEDS data capturing Fall enrollment behavior while the unemployment measure used is the annual average. Examining the national unemployment rates more closely reveals that the first-quarter average closely matched the annual average, suggesting that individuals have enough lead time to apply to graduate programs. Graduate program application deadlines normally occur during the spring term or are on a rolling basis. (Doughty, 2009) 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008  174,000 for female and male students respectively. This is consistent with the well documented trend of more women than men pursuing post-baccalaureate education (Barr & Turner, 2013).  1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 % \u0394 Unemployment Rate>25yrs % \u0394 Fall Enrollment Breaking down enrollment by race, Figure 17 compares the annual average national unemployment rate for individuals 25 years and older to aggregate fall graduate enrollment levels by different racial groups. 76 The dotted vertical lines denote the official periods of the recessions. 77 76 Racial descriptive statistics does not include international student 77 Formal periods of the recession were obtained from NBER's website -https://www.nber.org/cycles.html While the racial composition of graduate enrollment was discussed in Chapter 3, it is worth revisiting. As mentioned in section 5.2, this part of the analysis excludes institutions with less than ten years' worth of data in order to establish an institution-specific time trend. Institutions that were dropped consisted largely of private for-profit institutions that opened and closed satellite locations across the United States within a ten-year timeframe. Black students are much more likely to pursue post-baccalaureate education at for-profit institutions across all degree types (Espinosa, Turk, & Chessman, 2019). Therefore, further analyzing the racial composition is justified. All the data presented thus far reflect time series aggregated enrollment which includes secular increases over the last three decades. 78 To eliminate these secular trends, I detrended enrollment data by regressing enrollment on year with the resulting residuals plotted against unemployment rates. Detrending was performed for the different racial groups depicted in Figure   18. 79 Since Whites are a large percentage of graduate enrollment Figure 19 excludes White enrollment which allows us to see some of the subtle differences among the remaining racial group categories. For the three racial groups in Figure 19, we can see some correlation between unemployment and enrollment particularly from the early 1990's through early to mid-2010's. However, the relationship is much more ambiguous at the tail ends of the timeline. One explanation for this rise in recent years is the growing Hispanic population seeking higher education opportunities (Espinosa, Turk, & Chessman, 2019). The authors note that \"each 10-year age cohort had higher rates of college attainment than the next-oldest group\".  Figure 21 shows that while detrended male and female enrollment is highly correlated with unemployment, the differences between the two sexes is harder to decipher.  Table 15 shows the output based on the different unemployment rate levels (county, state and national) using Model (A) which includes year and institution fixed effects, and Model (B) which only includes institution fixed effects. The log-linear models (A) and (B) produce regression coefficients that are easy to interpret (Cameron & Trivedi, 2005). In this case, the coefficient on unemployment rate can be explained as the proportional change in enrollment associated with 1% change in unemployment. The results in columns 1and 3are based on fewer observation due to missing county-level unemployment data for certain zip codes. Including year fixed effects in Model (A) partials out the impact local and state unemployment has on enrollment. By utilizing Year and Year 2 , we are able to use idiosyncratic events in the economy that are not apparent when using year fixed effects. conditions in the county where the institution is located is not a major driving force for enrollment at that institution since students can easily travel across counties. Rather, enrollment at a particular institution is reflecting the economic volatility that is occurring beyond the immediate geographic zone it is situated in. The above institution fixed effects models prevent us from capturing shifts in enrollment that may result from new institutions entering or exiting the graduate school marketplace. To test whether these market dynamics provide any different insights, I run a state fixed effect model with the resulting output shown in Table 16. As discussed in section 5.3, for the institution fixed effect model, institutions with less than ten-year's worth of data were dropped to capture institution specific time trends. In this State fixed effects model, all institutions were included to capture the opening and closing of institutions -common among private for-profit institutions that operate satellite locations across the United States. The results in Table 16 are consistent with those of the institutional fixed effects model. Including year fixed effects (column (1)) partials out the impact of state unemployment. Columns (2) and (3) utilize Year and Year 2 with state fixed effects and show that a 1% increase in state and national unemployment will lead to an increase in graduate enrollment of 2.79% and 4.13% respectively. Given the similarity in results, I use Model (B) from Table 15 for the remainder of the analysis where the main variable of interest is the average annual national unemployment rate for individuals 25 years and older, utilizing institution fixed effects, Year and Year 2 .  Table 17 examines the heterogeneity in effects of economic conditions across different institution types, and shows that a one percentage increase in national unemployment leads to increases in enrollment of 2.66% and 4.92% at public and private not-for-profit institutions respectively -significant at the 1% level. As we will see later on, the faster pace of enrollment at private institutions occurred prior to the introduction of HERA and the expansion of Grad PLUS loans. 80 Why the steeper slope for private institutions is not clear. While private institutions do provide greater tuition discounts and aid packages than public institutions, the average net price at private doctoral and master's institutions was more than double the net price at public institutions (Baum, Lapovsky, & Ma, 2010;Ma, Baum, Pender, & Libassi, 2019). 80 Table 19 shows the impact of unemployment on enrollment at public and private institutions pre-and postpassage of HERA 2005. (1) (2)  two periods, 1988 -2005 and 2006 -2017, with the resulting output presented in Table 18. While there are more years included in the data from the pre-period compared to the post-period, the number of institutions is evenly divided between the two periods with 1,792 institutions pre-2006 and 1,870 institutions post-2006. As expected, enrollment became significantly more responsive to labor market conditions after the borrowing limit on Grad PLUS loans was raised. We can see from the results in Table 18 that with the easing of the credit constraint post-2006, the effect of a 1% change in unemployment on graduate enrollment more than doubles -from 1.96% to 4.24%."}, {"section_title": "Public", "text": "Private Non-Profit For-Profit 1(2) To check whether this trend is mainly driven by the severity and extent of the Great Recession, I dropped data from 2008 through 2010 and reran the model. 81 The coefficient post-HERA remains large (3.83%) and statistically significant at the 1% level. Further examination of the impact HERA had on enrollment by institution type yielded some interesting results. Table 19 shows the results which remain statistically significant at the 1% level across all institution types post-HERA. Unemployment had the largest impact on enrollment at private institutions post-2006, rising from 1.2% to 4.6% compared to public institutions which remained relatively flat. In contrast to the other types of institutions, for-profit institutions experienced a smaller change in enrollment post-2006. This suggests that the easing of the credit constraint played a role in increasing demand despite the rising cost of attendance at private institutions. The data on average graduate level tuition is limited, however at the undergraduate level, average tuition and fees at 81 Resulting output presented in Appendix F Pre-GradPlus Post-GradPLUS (1)  Table 20 shows the regression output of unemployment by sector pre-and post-Grad PLUS using State fixed effects. State fixed effects allow us to control for State-specific time invariant unobservable factors that might impact graduate enrollment behavior over time. The notable finding compared to Table 19 is how much unemployment affected enrollment at private for-profit institutions post-Grad PLUS. After the passage of HERA, a 1% change in unemployment resulted in a 9.2% increase in enrollment at for-profit institutions (significant at the 5% level). This is not surprising given the well documented aggressive marketing tactics of for-profit institutions aimed Pre-GradPlus Post-GradPlus Pre-GradPlus Post-GradPlus Pre-GradPlus Post-GradPlus (1) at minority and low-income groups (Bonadies, Rovenger, Connor, Shum, & Merrill, 2018). Targeting these populations has resulted in for-profit institutions having the highest median percentages of students who have received Pell Grants and Federal student loans, as well as the highest median loan amounts. 83 Examining the effects of unemployment on graduate enrollment by gender and race, shows that national labor market conditions have a greater impact on males than females. Table 21 shows that men are marginally more responsive to unemployment than women with a 1% increase in national unemployment resulting in a 4.41% and 3.58% increase in graduate enrollment for men and women respectively -this difference is statistically significant. One possible explanation for 83 https://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-that-received-the-highest-amounts-in-pell-grants-and-federal-studentloans-for-undergraduates-by-sector-2014-15-240599/?cid=gen_sign_in this difference could be that more men than women tend to lose their jobs during periods of high unemployment (Albanesi & \u015eahin, 2017). The authors report that female unemployment was higher than male unemployment until the early 1980's, with the gap closing during times of high unemployment. After the 1980's however, the gender unemployment gap disappeared except during recessions when male unemployment exceeded female unemployment. The authors attribute the unemployment gap to gender differences in the types of jobs and sectors men and women tend to pursue. The results from Table 21 differ from some of the previous findings of the effect unemployment has on graduate enrollment by gender. 84 This is most likely due to the type and length of the dataset used in this research. The NSRCG data used by Bedard and Herman (2008) only included undergraduate science and engineering majors and they examined the probability of enrolling in a graduate program 19 months after earning a Bachelor's degree. 84 Bedard and Herman (2008) find male graduate enrollment to be procyclical, and female enrollment not responsive to the business cycle. While Johnson (2013) finds female enrollment to be countercyclical and finds no evidence that male enrollment is influenced by the business cycle.  Table 22 depicts gender differences among the different institution types and shows that unemployment results in more men than women enrolling in Public institutions (3.24% and 2.28% respectively) as well as Private Not-for-Profit institutions (5.32% and 4.22% respectively). While the outcome for for-profit institutions is not statistically different from zero for both men and women. Unemployment had a similar effect among the non-White groups' enrollment of 3.27%, 3.37% and 3.09% for Black, Hispanic, and Asian respectively. In comparison, a one percentage point change in unemployment resulted in a 4.52% change in enrollment for Whites. These results are interesting because they suggest that either the opportunity cost was higher or the credit constraint was greater for non-Whites compared to Whites. A higher opportunity cost for non-Whites suggests that Black, Hispanic and Asian students earn more than White students. However, as was previously discussed, there is ample evidence of wage discrimination where Black and Hispanic workers earning less than their White counterparts with the same level of education (Carnevale & Fasules, 2017;Bogan & Wu, 2018).  A more likely explanation is that non-Whites face greater credit constraints in comparison to their White counterparts. Financial resources play an important factor in student's decision choice process with a number of studies documenting the adverse effect educational debt has on the pursuit of graduate education. Students who have high levels of undergraduate debt tend to be less likely to apply to graduate programs compared to their peers with less educational debt. And lowincome, minority and first-generation students tend to be more debt averse (Millett, 2003;Perna, 2004;Malcom & Dowd, 2012;Scott-Clayton, 2012;Oreopoulos & Petronijevic, 2013;Scott-Clayton & Li, 2016). Scott-Clayton and Li (2016) report on the disparate impact student debt has on Black and White students. The authors find that Black students default on their undergraduate student loans at triple the rate of their White peers. Additionally, comparing the amount of outstanding federal undergraduate debt, the authors find that 48% of Blacks owed more four years after graduation than they did at graduation, compared to 17% of Whites. I explore racial differences further by examining the impact of unemployment before and after HERA with the results reported in Table 24. These results show that prior to 2005 and the expansion of Grad PLUS loans, the unemployment rate had a similar impact on each racial group -highest for Hispanics at 2.64%, with Whites, Blacks and Asians at 1.86%, 1.42%, and 1.62% respectively. The divergence of White enrollment occurred after the expansion of Grad PLUS loans. This finding supports the notion that non-White students had higher credit constraints than their White counterparts. Previous research has found that the compliance costs associated with the complexity of the federal financial aid system falls disproportionately on non-White and lowincome students (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2006). The easing of borrowing for graduate education through Grad PLUS loans did what it was intended to do -expand graduate educational opportunities. However, non-White students are still lagging behind their White peers.  "}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations", "text": "The IPEDS data used in this study provides three post-baccalaureate levels of study: Graduate, First-professional, and Post-baccalaureate certificate. Unfortunately, IPEDS stopped collecting First-professional and Post-baccalaureate certificate information beginning in 2009 and 1999 respectively, and were excluded from the analysis due to their lack of availability over the 30-year period examined. While the data is available over a shorter timeframe, it would be interesting for future research to explore First-professional enrollment to see whether they are more or less sensitive to changes in the labor market compared to Master's enrollment. Another limitation is that programs comprising Graduate enrollment encompass a heterogeneous set of requirements, time to completion, and expected salaries as evidenced by the wide range of starting salaries of post-baccalaureate graduates mentioned in section 2.1.1, Table 1. Disaggregating graduate education into separate degree programs sheds more light on the impact of family background than when graduate education is considered in aggregate (Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003). It would be interesting to see if different fields of study responded differentially to labor market forces. Unfortunately, the data doesn't capture enrollment data that includes undergraduate field of study. Finally, IPEDS doesn't provide sufficient demographic and student characteristics information to allow a full examination of the determinants of graduate school enrollment and how the business cycle affects different subgroups aside from gender and race."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSION", "text": "This research builds on the growing literature that combines an economic framework of graduate school choice with the sociological theory of social reproduction. Paulsen (1990)  choice is the recognition that educational attainment is not homogenous, rather it varies across different racial and socioeconomic groups. However, according to Dumais (2002) many researchers fail to control for the role that habitus plays in educational expectation and persistence. Therefore, this dissertation develops an econometric model of graduate school choice whose variables are informed by the research on human, social, and cultural capital as well as habitus. Using the B&B:08/12 survey, I find students with a Business undergraduate major, and those with higher incomes have statistically significant lower probabilities of enrolling in a Master's degree program four years after earning their Bachelor's degree. Having a higher GPA, and having attended a public doctoral or private undergraduate institution resulted in a statistically significant higher probabilities of enrolling in a Master's degree program. However, the measure with the greatest impact on the portability of post-baccalaureate enrollment was students' expectation of educational attainment. Highest degree expectation was used as a proxy for habitus and adding it to the model more than doubles the indicator of model fit -albeit the adjusted Rsquared remained relatively low at 10.6%. It is worth noting that the role of habitus in this analysis is not clear-cut. It is difficult to determine whether students in their senior year develop an expectation of post-baccalaureate education because of their undergraduate experience and/or good academic performance, or if their expectation post-baccalaureate education is what is driving them to achieve a high GPA. Even when restricting the model to those who had not applied to a Master's program during their senior undergraduate year, expectation remained statistically significant. Clearly more research on postbaccalaureate persistence is needed and should consider the effects of students' expectations captured much earlier in the choice process. Additionally, I find many of the variables previously used as proxies for social and cultural capital not to have a statistically significant effect in my model specification. These results should be interpreted with caution. One objective of this dissertation was to develop a model of graduate school enrollment utilizing proxies for habitus, social and cultural capital to account for differences in individual's penchant for graduate education. However, when closely related variables are included in a regression, the model often cannot distinguish which explanatory variable is driving the association with the dependent variable. By including these measures, we may be controlling for many of the paths by which socio-economic status affects education. This underscores the difficulty in finding appropriate measures that capture the intended underlying effects posited in Bourdieu's theories. This dissertation also contributes to the literature on the cyclicality of human capital investment by quantifying the effects of the business cycle on graduate school enrollment before and after the expansion of Grad PLUS loans introduced in the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 (HERA). I use IPEDS data over a thirty-year time span to assess how responsive graduate enrollment is to business cycle fluctuations by gender, racial group, and institutional sector. I find evidence suggesting that inter-state mobility for students attending graduate school may be higher than previously hypothesized; thereby resulting in a downward bias when utilizing state unemployment rates. Using national unemployment rates, I find evidence suggestive of a causal relationship between labor market conditions and graduate enrollment. Overall, the results reported in this research indicate that graduate enrollment is countercyclical to the unemployment rate and that HERA had a significant and positive impact on graduate enrollment by easing the credit constraint. Specifically, while HERA eased the credit constraint and expanded graduate opportunities across all racial groups, Whites seem to have benefited the most in comparison to their non-White peers. A likely explanation is that compliance costs associated with the complexity of the federal financial aid system fall disproportionately on non-White and low-income students, resulting in higher credit constraints for these groups (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2006). This is a reminder that while neoclassical economic frameworks leave it to the individual to achieving positive outcomes, there remains structural racial factors that limit and prohibit minority and low-income groups from achieving their full potential. In April 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the United States had an unemployment rate of 14.7%. Unlike prior recessions that were a result of an underlying structural problem or particular adverse economic event, the 2020 recession is a result of a public health mandate restricting travel and in-person interaction. During the three recessions encompassing the time period examined, the opportunity cost effect outweighed that of the credit constraint. Whether the most recent events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a similar pattern remains to be seen. It would be interesting for future researchers to explore enrollment behavior for academic year 2021, but more generally more insight is needed in how business cycle fluctuations affect enrollment into the different graduate programs. Disaggregating the degree programs should enable us to examine variations that are otherwise obscured when studied in aggregate. Doing so would inform policymakers and academic institutions on which programs need investments and support to accommodate additional capacity. Ensuring a space for students to acquire postbaccalaureate credentials increases the stock of skilled labor and has the potential of limiting the negative effects of a contracting economy. The weight variable used in this table is WTE000 -Students who received a bachelor's degree in the 2007-08 academic year and responded to all interviews (2007-08, 2009, and 2012). Includes approximately 13,500 graduates. "}, {"section_title": "Appendix D -Sample means", "text": ""}]
