[{"section_title": "", "text": "T here has been a long-term debate in the world of academia as to whether disciplines are producing \"too many PhDs\" for the number of academic positions available. During the last several recession and post-recession years, there has been increased anxiety on the part of graduate students, graduate advisors, dissertation chairs, and department chairs in the social sciences that new PhDs would not be able to find jobs. This uneasiness was rooted in reality as the number of positions advertised in disciplinary job banks fell for at least one or two of the years since the recession of 2008. Today, however, there is reason for optimism as many of the social science disciplines have begun to emerge from the abyss caused by the recession. In 2010-2011 or 2011 (depending on the time frame for data collection) there was a rise in the number of jobs available for historians, political scientists, and sociologists. The American Historical Association, the American Political Science Association, and the American Sociological Association reported 10 percent, 12, percent and 28 percent increases in job advertisements respectively. In contrast, the American Economic Association reported that the number of jobs advertised remained flat, although there was a 21 percent increase over 2009 (see Figure 1). While this research brief compares changes in jobs advertised through these four social science associations' job banks, it is important to note that each association collects different kinds of data, uses somewhat different data gathering methodologies and coding schemes, and covers slightly different time periods. In addition, because we sometimes used more than one source of reporting for each discipline, the within-discipline analysis may not be totally consistent. As a result, comparisons are not perfect. Moreover, these advertisements do not account for all job openings in the disciplines. For example, some small schools hire locally and do not advertise in national job banks and some non-academic employers have alternative means of disseminating job notices. In spite of these problems, this research brief gives a more complete picture than discipline by discipline comparisons."}, {"section_title": "The Latest Information About", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Social Science Jobs for New PhDs", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "NEW PHDS", "text": "In 2010 (the last year for which data is available for the number of new doctorates), there were 638 new PhDs in sociology, 728 in political science, 1,009 in history, and 1,038 in economics, according to the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates. How does this compare to the number of full-time, tenuretrack positions available to new PhDs? ACADEMIC JOBS PER NEW PHD Although social science disciplines are emerging from the recession, all of the disciplines discussed here, with the exception of economics, still appeared to have more new PhDs than assistant professor positions in the most recent calendar or academic year. This oversupply decreased compared to previous years, however. In 2009-2010 41 percent of all jobs advertised through the American Political Science Association's e-Jobs database were for assistant professors. By 2010-2011 the percentage of jobs for assistant professors increased to 42 percent of all jobs (with a 17 percentage point increase in the number of jobs   a Temporary, visiting, and part-time faculty positions are excluded. 76 of these types of positions advertised in the Job Bank in 2011.

It does not take into account the unplaced or under-placed scholars from previous PhD cohorts that will likely continue to make the job market challenging for newly-minted PhDs for several years to come. Another important qualifier is the relationship between the number of jobs available in particular disciplinary subfields and the number of new PhDs prepared to teach and do research in those subfields. Political science, economics, and history report the number of jobs in each major subfield of their discipline. Political science saw increases in jobs in international politics and declines in American and comparative politics. These are the subfields in which most PhDs major. History reported that the most advertisements were for positions in North American and European history, with both of these subfields increasing since the previous year. The largest number of applicants was in these two subfields. In sociology, by coding the sub-fields requested, we found a mismatch in some subfields between the number of graduate students majoring in them and jobs available in those subfields in 2010 (a year prior to the employment data). This resulted in an oversupply of jobs in social control, law, and crime and deviance, and an undersupply of jobs in inequalities and stratification (see \"Moving Toward Recovery: Findings from the 2010 Job Bank Survey\" for a more detailed list of the mismatched subfields, http://www.asanet. org/research/Moving_Toward_Change_2010_ Job_Bank_Survey.pdf) Economics saw the largest percentage increase in positions in agricultural and natural resource economics, financial economics, and mathematical and quantitative methods (the largest advertised subfield). Economics did not report the number of new PhDs in these subfields."}, {"section_title": "JOBS IN GRADUATE DEPARTMENTS", "text": "Only sociology and economics report the percent of jobs found at schools with graduate programs versus schools that do not offer advanced degrees. During 2011 in sociology, approximately 83 percent of advertised jobs were found at schools offering graduate programs (including PhD and masters-only institutions). This percentage remained unchanged from the previous year. In economics, a similar percentage (about 84 percent) of advertised jobs in 2010 was at institutions with graduate programs, a 17 percentage point increase over the prior year. Likewise, only sociology and economics report on the advertising cycle, that is, the number of jobs advertised each month. In sociology, September was the month with the greatest number of listings for academic jobs, while April had the fewest. The jobs advertised in August and September usually begin the following fall semester. In economics, the highest advertising month for academic jobs was October, while the lowest months were January and July (see Figure 3). "}, {"section_title": "CONTINGENT ACADEMIC POSITIONS", "text": "Not all advertised positions in the academy are for tenured or tenure-track positions. A portion of faculty positions may be contingent (that is, without long-term contracts or tenure), although how these positions are categorized varies. They can include temporary or visiting faculty members who usually hold one-year appointments as well as instructors or lecturers who may be temporary or visiting, or who may have yet to complete their PhDs. We do not have data from economics and history reporting the number of contingent positions advertised. In 2010-2011, political science listed the number of temporary positions at 17 percent of all jobs advertised (down slightly from the prior year, but up since [2008][2009], while sociology listed the number of instructors and lecturers at about 9 percent, up from 6 percent in 2009 and 8 percent in 2010. In addition to the 55 lecturer/instructor positions shown on Table 1b, there were an additional 76 positions for temporary and visiting faculty in sociology in 2011 for a total of 18 percent of all jobs (these data are not shown on Table 1b). Other non-fulltime academic positions include post-doctoral and administrative jobs. In sociology, close to 14 percent of all advertisements were for post-doctoral positions, up by 48 percentage points since 2009 (from 83 to 123 positions). In political science, post-doctoral positions accounted for only about 8 percent of all advertisements, and the number did not increase substantially since 2009-2010. But, interestingly, the number of post-doctoral positions in political science has almost quadrupled since 2003-2004. While not yet a required rite of passage as it is in the physical sciences, these findings suggest that the importance of the post-doc is increasing in the social sciences and that this practice of securing a postdoctoral-position may be becoming more normative. Finally, although they comprise a relatively small percentage of all jobs, administrative positions increased in sociology from 10 to 25 percent of all non-faculty jobs (see (See Tables 1a and 1b). These positions, however, are probably not open to new PhDs."}, {"section_title": "JOBS OUTSIDE OF THE DISCIPLINE", "text": "Unlike sociology, political science, history, and economics do not report whether there are advertisements in their job banks for academic positions outside of their disciplines. In sociology, there were an increasing number of advertisements for positions in departments other than sociology. The number of these positions for assistant and open and multiple-rank positions available to new PhDs increased by 67 percentage points, from 127 jobs in 2009 to 212 jobs in 2011. These positions outside of sociology included jobs in the media and communications, women's studies, health and medicine, government and policy, education, international studies, and other fields. The increase in jobs outside of the discipline that are available to sociologists is good news for the discipline, demonstrating the growing market for sociologists. However, not all of these non-sociological positions will necessarily be filled by sociologists (see Figure 4)."}, {"section_title": "JOBS IN PRACTICE", "text": "Historically, social science disciplines have encouraged their graduate students to pursue academic jobs, as opposed to jobs outside of the academy. With such a history, it is perhaps not surprising that political science reported that an extremely small percentage of all positions advertised were non-academic jobs (about 2 percent in 2010-2011). This share has remained relatively stable over the last decade. In contrast, sociology reported that employers advertised a lower percent of jobs in sociological practice in 2011 compared to 2010 (see Tables 1a and 1b). At 31 percent in 2011, economics reported the highest percent of non-academic jobs in its job bank, although the percentage of these jobs in economics fell by 7 percent. The American Historical Association did not report the number of advertisements for positions outside of the academy. While social science disciplines have typically pushed their students toward academic careers, that is beginning to change. For example, the American Historical Association and the American Political Science Association have begun to counsel graduate students to be flexible and to consider positions outside of the academy. More specifically, in September 2011, the President and the Executive Director of the American Historical Association called on history departments to stop referring to non-academic jobs as \"alternative\" careers and to view them as equal options. The American Sociological Association has also started to move on the issue of non-academic careers. Several years ago, the association appointed a task force to make recommendations about positions that were referred to as \"public sociology.\" In addition, the American Sociological Association has a section called Sociological Practice and Public Sociology, whose leaders include sociologists in applied, research, and policy positions. Some experts believe that giving academic and non-academic positions equal billing will change the nature of doctoral education Despite new emphasis on valorizing careers outside of the academy, data from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctoral Recipients suggest that PhDs looking for non-academic positions cannot rely on their discipline's job bank to learn about these jobs. According to the NSF's survey, sociology has the highest percentage (70 percent) of PhDs employed in 4-year educational institutions followed by history (67 percent), political science (66 percent), and economics (56 percent). These percentages are considerably above the non-academic jobs advertised."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In 2010 and 2011, social science disciplines began to emerge from the abyss which resulted from the 2008 recession. Sociology experienced the highest percentage increase in jobs while economics had the most jobs per new PhD. Even before the recession, however, some disciplines, particularly history, had experienced a longstanding gap between the number of new PhDs and the number of academic jobs. Other disciplines such as economics have seemingly had enough jobs for each new crop of PhDs even during the recession years. Sociology did not experience a gap between PhD production and job availability for many years until the 2008 recession and now appears to be filling in the gap with additional positions. Political science appears to be filling in the gap as well. It should come as no surprise that addressing this aforementioned gap is the impetus for the more positive attitude social science disciplines have begun to take toward non-academic careers for PhDs. As noted earlier, each discipline collects and reports somewhat different data, uses somewhat 165 different methodologies and coding schemes, and covers slightly different time periods, making between discipline comparisons challenging. In that light, we recommend that some standardization of data collection, analysis, and public reporting be undertaken so that side by side comparisons can be made more easily. A future brief will provide information on the outcome of job advertisements including the percentage of jobs that are cancelled, filled, or not filled."}]
