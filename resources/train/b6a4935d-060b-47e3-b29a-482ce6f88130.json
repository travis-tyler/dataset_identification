[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background. Current knowledge of age-associated increases in blood pressure is based primarily on unscreened population studies that may not be representative of healthy men and women. We examined longitudinal patterns of change in blood pressure in healthy male and female volunteers from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)."}, {"section_title": "I", "text": "T is generally believed that systolic blood pressure increases sharply with age in most industrialized societies and that diastolic pressure rises modestly and plateaus or declines after middle age (1) (2) (3) (4) . A number of studies also indicate that average systolic and diastolic pressures are higher in women than men after age 45-55 (1) (2) (3) (4) . To a great extent, this view of age-associated differences in blood pressure has been derived from cross-sectional studies of populations which included individuals with known hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. In contrast to cross-sectional studies, longitudinal data have produced inconsistent results regarding gender-and age-associated changes in blood pressure (3, (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, the longitudinal studies have varied widely in inclusion criteria and in control for historical variations in the treatment of hypertension. The fact that the increase in blood pressure with age does not occur uniformly or universally (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) indicates that an increase in blood pressure with advancing age is not inevitable. Thus, the age-associated increase in blood pressure observed in unscreened population studies may not be representative of blood pressure changes in healthy men and women. Therefore, we have examined age-associated crosssectional and longitudinal trends in blood pressure of 17-to 97-year-old male and female volunteers from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), who have been rigorously screened to exclude health problems or medication usage that might affect blood pressure."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Study population. -Participants are male and female volunteers in the BLSA, an open-panel multidisciplinary study of normal human aging that is conducted by the National Institute on Aging (20) . Participants are predominantly White (95%) and well educated (over 75% have a bachelor's degree or higher). The participants are scheduled to visit the Gerontology Research center at approximately 2-year intervals where they stay for 2.5 days of evaluation and testing including a physical examination by a health care provider (i.e., physician, physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner), inventory of medications used, and an intensive set of medical, physiological, and psychological evaluations.\nBetween 1958 and 1991, 1,478 men and 645 women had blood pressure measurements taken during one or more of their BLSA visits. Because blood pressure can be affected by various diseases or medications, we censored the data of 231 men and 97 women for visits following the diagnosis of any of the following conditions: probable or definite myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or Q-wave abnormalities on resting ECG (Minnesota Code 1:1 or 1:2); stroke; aortic valvular disease; untreated thyroid disease; renal disease; diabetes; or congestive heart failure. Blood pressure measurements were also excluded at visits where the participants were taking the following medications: diuretics, antihyper-"}, {"section_title": "M178", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PEARSONETAL.", "text": "tensive or cardiovascular medications, bronchodilators, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, central nervous system stimulants (2005 visits in 688 men; 976 visits in 420 women), or had other conditions that might affect blood pressure (hemoglobin 2= 17.0 g or serum creatinine s* 1.5 mg/dL; 206 visits in 154 men, no visits in women). In addition, any blood pressure measurements taken within 2 years of death (49 visits in 44 men and 5 visits in 5 women) were excluded to avoid any bias due to occult diseases that might have affected blood pressure. The censoring and visit exclusions resulted in the exclusion of all data for 441 men and 312 women. Thus, the final screened male study group consists of a total of 4,422 observations on 1,037 men (70% of all BLSA men) whose beginning age in the study was between 17.2 and 96.7 years, and the screened female study group consists of a total of 749 observations on 333 women (52% of all BLSA women) whose beginning age in the study was between 18.6 and 92.7 years (Table 1) .\nProcedures. -On the first day of each biennial visit, BLSA volunteers undergo an extensive medical history and physical examination. A seated blood pressure is taken in both arms with a manual sphygmomanometer appropriately sized to the arm of the participant. Systolic and diastolic pressure are defined by the first and fifth Korotkoff sounds, respectively. We use the mean of the blood pressures from the two arms at each visit. In males, we use biennial physical examination blood pressure measurements collected from 1958 to 1991. Because women did not enter the BLSA until 1978, we use measurements collected from 1978 to 1991 for women. Height and weight are measured in undergarments and without shoes. Body mass index (BMI = weight in kg/ height in m 2 ) is calculated from anthropometric measurements taken at each visit. Individuals are classified as current cigarette smokers if they report smoking any cigarettes on a regular basis at that visit.\nStatistical methods. -The mean blood pressure at baseline visit (\u00b195% confidence intervals) is reported for each 5-year age group in all BLSA participants and in the screened group to determine the baseline comparability of the two groups.\nLinear mixed-effects regression models are used to analyze the longitudinal data (21, 22) . Mixed-effects models allow estimation of the group-average blood pressure curve and also allow each subject's estimated longitudinal change to deviate from the group average. Details of the linear mixed-effects model are provided in the Appendix.\nTo determine whether the longitudinal 10-year rate of change in blood pressure differs depending on baseline blood pressure level, we use mixed-effects models to predict the change in blood pressure levels. Linear regression models are then used to examine the association between estimated 10-year rate of change in blood pressure and baseline estimated blood pressure level in individuals with at least 6 years of follow-up (n = 462 men and 88 women). A two-tailed p-value of less than .05 was required for statistical significance in all analyses."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The number of participants is fairly evenly distributed across the age range, although the number of participants over age 80 is limited (Table 1) "}, {"section_title": "AGE-ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE", "text": "Ml 79 ent in individuals who died or withdrew from the BLSA compared to participants who remained active (p = .89 and p = .91, respectively, for systolic and diastolic pressure in men; p = .98 and p = .49, respectively, in women). An analysis to identify birth cohort effects did not identify any consistent effects (data not shown). Table 2 shows the proportion of participants who were hypertensive at their first examination and the distribution of changes in blood pressure observed over approximately 10 years (mm Hg per decade assessed at the examination nearest to 10 years after first exam). The proportion of hypertensives increases with age in both men and women but is lower in women in each age group. With increasing age, the proportion of men who exhibit increases in systolic blood pressure greater than 5 mm Hg per decade increases from 34% for men aged less than 40, to 48% for men aged 40-59.9, and 54% for men aged 60 and above, whereas 35^40% of women in each age group exhibit such increases ( Table 2 ). For diastolic blood pressure, 35-45% of men and women exhibit increases greater than 5 mm Hg per decade regardless of age. However, men and women age 60 and above both show an increased proportion of individuals with decreases greater than 10 mm Hg per decade compared to younger ages.\nEffect of screening. - Figure 1 shows the means ( \u00b1 95% confidence intervals) of the observed blood pressure levels at baseline visit by 5-year age groups for all BLSA participants and for rigorously screened men and women. The confidence intervals in Figure 1 and subsequent figures are wider in women than men because of the smaller number of observations in women. The cross-sectional results from the screened and unscreened data sets are nearly identical for diastolic pressure. However, systolic pressure is approximately 3-5 mm Hg higher in the unscreened men and women after age 60. Systolic pressure increases with crosssectional age in both the screened and unscreened groups. Cross-sectionally, diastolic pressure appears to plateau between ages 50 and 60 in men and at approximately age 60 in women. Although gender differences in systolic and diastolic pressure narrow with age, there is no evidence of a gender cross-over in either the screened or unscreened data sets.\nCross-sectional vs longitudinal age effects. - Figure 2 and Table 3 show the systolic and diastolic pressure levels and longitudinal changes over 10 years of follow-up as estimated by the linear mixed-effects models. The blood pressure levels shown at the beginning of each 10-year longitudinal curve represent the cross-sectional estimates for different ages at entry into the BLSA. The cross-sectional and longitudinal results for both systolic and diastolic pressure are not significantly different in either sex, except for systolic pressure in men at ages 40 and 70 ( Figure 2 , Table  3 ). Forty-year-old men have higher systolic pressures at their initial visit than 30-year-old men who are followed longitudinally to age 40. However, blood pressures in these same men measured in the supine position at first awakening do not reveal a longitudinal decline in systolic pressure in 30-year-olds (data not shown). The lower initial systolic and diastolic pressures in the 70-year-old group of men compared to 60-year-old men who were followed to age 70 probably represent recruiting bias or selective survival. Men who join the BLSA at older ages tend to be healthier than men who joined at younger ages and who reach a similar age while in the study (23) . Because of the shorter follow-up in women, this recruiting bias is less evident in female BLSA participants.\nPrior to age 45-50, systolic pressure increases with age cross-sectionally but is relatively stable longitudinally in both sexes (Figure 2 , Table 3 ). The longitudinal increase in systolic pressure is approximately 5 mm Hg per decade in both men and women at age 50. After age 50, the longitudinal rate of increase in systolic pressure accelerates to over 8 mm Hg per decade in men, whereas in women the rate of Figure 1 . Observed cross-sectional average (\u00b1 95% confidence interval) systolic and diastolic blood perssures for (a) the unscreened BLSA data set and (b) the BLSA data set screened for health problems or medications that affect blood pressure. Circles represent the mean blood prressure for women, and triangles represent the mean blood pressure for men. increase slows to 4 mm Hg per decade at age 60 and is virtually flat after age 70. Diastolic pressure increases longitudinally at a constant rate of 1 mm Hg per decade in men aged 30-80 (Table 3) . However, in women, diastolic pressure changes minimally before age 40, increases at a rate of 3-4 mm Hg per decade during middle age, then plateaus at age 60, followed by evidence of a decline after age 70."}, {"section_title": "E ES )d Pressi", "text": "Gender differences. -Both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, women have significantly lower systolic and diastolic pressures than men at all ages ( Figure 2 , Table 3 ). The gender difference in systolic pressure narrows from approximately 12 mm Hg at age 30 to approximately 6 mm Hg at age 70, but there is no gender cross-over. The gender difference in diastolic pressure narrows only slightly from 5.8 mm Hg at age 30 to 4.3 mm Hg at age 70. Use of estrogen-containing medications (i.e., estrogen replacement therapy, contraceptives) does not significantly affect systolic or diastolic pressure in BLSA women overall (p = .59 for systolic and p = .73 for diastolic), or in women younger than 45 years (p = .87 for systolic and/? = .58 for diastolic), women aged 4 5 -54.9 years (p = .45 for systolic and/? = .43 for diastolic), or women 55 years or older (p = .96 for systolic and p = .40 for diastolic).\nBaseline blood pressure and subsequent rate of change. -In these healthy individuals, baseline blood pressure levels accounted for less than 5% of the variance in 10-year rate of change in blood pressure, except for systolic pressure in men. Figure 3 shows that high baseline systolic pressures tend to be associated with more rapid increases in systolic pressure in men of all ages. Baseline systolic pressure accounts for 14% of the variance in rate of change in systolic pressure. In men, each 10 mm Hg elevation in baseline systolic pressure is associated with approximately a 2 mm Hg per decade increase in the 10-year rate of change in systolic pressure, regardless of age."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Previous unscreened population studies have been extremely useful in understanding the medical and public health ramifications of the associations between chronologic age and blood pressure. However, the findings from unscreened samples may not be generalizable to healthy individuals. The present study has the advantages of careful screening to exclude individuals with diseases or medication usage that may affect the age-associated trends in blood pressure and a long-term longitudinal design across a broad age range in both sexes. Thus, these findings provide a clearer description of age-associated changes in blood pressure in these healthy BLSA men and women without the confounding influences of diseases or medications known to affect blood pressure. Additional findings include: (a) BLSA cross-sectional and longitudinal findings are more similar than has been observed in studies of unscreened samples; (b) there is no evidence of a gender cross-over in this group of healthy men and women; and (c) compared to previous studies of unscreened samples, healthy BLSA men and women show a weaker association between baseline blood pressure and subsequent rate of blood pressure change.\nAge effects. -The BLSA cross-sectional and longitudinal findings are generally quite similar. On average, systolic blood pressure is relatively stable in healthy men and women until middle age (approximately age 50 in men and age 40 in women), then increases by 5-8 mm Hg per decade. Women may show some longitudinal evidence of a plateau or decline in systolic blood pressure after age 70, but men do not. Diastolic pressure increases steadily in healthy BLSA men at a rate of 1 mm Hg per decade with no sign of a plateau or decline. Diastolic pressure in women is relatively stable between ages 30 and 40, increases significantly between ages 40 and 60, but then stabilizes and may decline slightly after age 70. Overall, systolic pressure increases about 15 mm Hg in men and 21 mm Hg in women between ages 30 and 70 years, whereas diastolic pressure increases only 3.5 mm Hg in men and 5 mm Hg in women over this interval.\nThus, these healthy BLSA men do not show any sign of a plateau or decline in systolic or diastolic pressure, whereas women exhibit a plateau for both systolic and diastolic pressure. This contrasts with other longitudinal results in unscreened samples in which systolic pressure did not plateau over time in either men or women, whereas diastolic pressure exhibited a plateau followed by a decline in both men and women (3); both systolic and diastolic pressure declined in men and women aged 65-98 years (5), or systolic pressure declined after age 65 in both men and women primarily due to secular trends in treatment of hypertension (24) .\nThe similarity between the BLSA cross-sectional and longitudinal findings probably reflects the health and medi-cation screening in our study. The screening minimizes the confounding effects of age-associated differences in the incidence and prevalence of hypertension and its treatment. Furthermore, our analyses do not reveal any significant selective attrition with respect to blood pressure in these healthy men and women. In contrast, the Framingham study (3) shows a more marked difference between cross-sectional and longitudinal results, perhaps because their results are based on an unscreened sample in whom selective mortality associated with hypertension would be expected to have a greater impact. Other studies have observed significant cohort differences in systolic and diastolic pressure in men and women over age 65 (5) .\nGender difference. -BLSA women have lower blood pressures than men across the adult age span and do not exhibit the gender cross-over in systolic pressure which has been observed in most cross-sectional studies. In this study, longitudinal rates of change in blood pressure are similar between sexes. These findings are not affected significantly by use of estrogen-containing medications, although we could not control for dosage or individual medications. Diastolic pressure is approximately 4-6 mm Hg lower in women than in men at all ages, whereas the gender difference in systolic pressure shrinks from approximately 11 mm Hg lower for women at age 40 to only 5.5 mm Hg lower at age 70. This is similar to longitudinal results reported from the Framingham study, where the mean systolic pressures of men and women converge but do not cross over, and the ageassociated trends for diastolic pressure are roughly parallel in men and women (3). The gender cross-over observed by others in unscreened samples may be related to a combination of selective mortality in men with elevated blood pressure, more aggressive treatment of hypertension in men, and perhaps age and cohort differences in the treatment of hypertension.\nBaseline blood pressure and subsequent rate of change. -A number of studies in unscreened samples have reported a significant positive association between baseline blood pressure levels and subsequent rates of blood pressure change (9) (10) (11) (12) . In healthy BLSA men and women, baseline blood pressure level explains little of the variance in 10-year rate of change in blood pressure, except for a modest relationship for systolic pressure in men. The weaker association in these healthy volunteers suggests that the accelerated rise in blood pressure in men with higher initial pressures may reflect the progression of hypertension rather than an aging effect per se.\nBetween-subject variability. -Although average patterns can be detected, there is a significant degree of betweenperson variability in both blood pressure level and longitudinal pattern of change that makes it difficult to extrapolate the average trends to individual subjects. At any age, many individuals show little or no longitudinal increase in systolic or diastolic pressure. Thus, age-associated increases in blood pressure are neither universal nor inevitable.\nStudy limitations. -Although longitudinal studies allow a direct estimation of changes in blood pressure, they are still subject to possible confounding due to cohort effects, secular trends, selective attrition, and other factors. However, examination of the BLSA data revealed no evidence of these biases. Although our efforts to screen for medical problems that affect blood pressure might have missed some occult disease, this is unlikely to seriously bias the results because similar findings are obtained in the unscreened data. Since the BLSA study group is predominantly White and middle to upper class, these results may not be generalizable to minority or lower socioeconomic groups. Lastly, BLSA participants are health-conscious volunteers who may be more likely to take an active role in prevention and intervention efforts than the general population."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "These findings demonstrate that in a group of male and female volunteers screened to exclude diseases and medication use that affect blood pressure, cross-sectional and longitudinal blood pressure patterns are more similar than is usually observed in unscreened population studies. In further contrast to previous studies in unscreened populations, these healthy volunteers have no gender cross-over in blood pressure and have only a weak association between baseline blood pressure and subsequent rate of pressure change. These findings suggest that several of the previously described age-associated patterns of blood pressure change partially reflect the effects of hypertension and its treatment, rather than intrinsic blood pressure changes in healthy individuals as they age."}]
