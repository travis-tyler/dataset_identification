[{"section_title": "", "text": "Theories of school dropout (Appleton et al., 2008;Fredricks et al., 2004;Rumberger, 2006) and a growing body of research also suggests that contextual (Dotterer & Lowe, 2011;Hong & Ho, 2005;Patrick, Ryan, & Kaplan, 2007;Ryan & Patrick, 2001;Wang & Holcombe, 2010;You & Sharkey, 2009) and self-system (Caraway et al., 2003;Furrer & Skinner, 2003;You & Sharkey, 2009) variables influence school engagement and dropping out from school. However, it is not clear how aspects of social context influence multiple forms of engagement simultaneously or how different types of contextual and self-system variables interact to affect students' engagement and lead to decisions to dropout from high school (Fredricks et al., 2004). The self-system model of motivational development (SSMMD) integrates contextual and self-system variables and provides a framework for describing processes that initiate and sustain a decline in student engagement (Connell & Wellborn, 1991;Skinner, Furrer, Marchand, & Kindermann, 2008;Skinner, Kindermann, Connell, & Wellborn, 2009;Skinner & Wellborn, 1994). Using the SSMMD, the central objective of the present study is to empirically test the mechanism involved in the dropout process."}, {"section_title": "Self-system model of motivational development", "text": "SSMMD posits that individuals possess an innate need to connect with others and interact effectively with their environment. It also asserts that the relationship of a given social context (e.g., family support, teacher support, peer support) and an individual's self-system processes (e.g., perceived identification with school, perceived control) is influenced by the extent to which the social context meets or ignores (fulfills or neglects) these basic needs. Further, self-system profiles differentially influence engagement-related behaviors, which directly contribute to educational outcomes such as student achievement and dropping out. That is, SSMMD suggests that 1) self-systems mediate the relation between a social context and school engagement and that 2) engagement mediates the relation between self-system processes and student outcomes. This model is shown in Fig. 1. Studies have provided empirical support for SSMMD, as applied to academic achievement (Connell, Spencer, &Aber, 1994;Skinner et al., 2008;Wang & Holcombe, 2010). For instance, Connell et al. (1994) conducted path analyses among a sample of 10-to 16-yearold African American youth. Nearly all proposed relations based on SSMMD were significant. In particular, students' perception of parental involvement predicted self-system processes (a composite measure of perceived competence, perceived relatedness to self, and perceived relatedness to others), which in turn predicted students' emotional and behavioral engagement. Engagement predicted educational outcomes (a composite measure reflecting the degree of risk for school departure based on attendance, test scores, grade-point average, suspension, and retention). Skinner et al. (2008) found that teacher support and students' self-system processes (perceived control, autonomy orientation, and sense of relatedness) were significant predictors of behavioral and emotional engagement. Moreover, self-system processes mediated the association between teacher support and student engagement. More recently, Wang and Holcombe (2010) examined the relationships among middle school students' perception of school environment, engagement, and achievement. Structural equation modeling revealed that students' perception of school environment in seventh grade (performance goal structure, mastery goal structure, support of autonomy, promotion of discussion, and teacher social support) affected their school engagement (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement) and, in turn, influenced students' academic achievement in eighth grade. In contrast, empirical support for SSMMD, as applied to dropping out from high school, is limited. Available evidence, however, suggests that SSMMD can provide an organizing framework for better understanding the role of contextual, self-system, and engagement variables in dropping out from high school. To illustrate, Connell, Halpern-Felsher, Clifford, Cri-chlow, and Usinger (1995) used SSMMD to examine behavioral, psychological, and contextual predictors of staying in high school among a sample of African American adolescents. The authors found that higher levels of support from teachers and adults at home were associated with higher levels of perceived competence, perceived relatedness, and perceived autonomy. These self-perceptions then predicted students' level of school engagement. School engagement positively predicted males' staying in school. Among females, the association between engagement and staying in school was not significant. These findings, while promising, are subject to important limitations, notably the unidimensional conceptualization of the engagement construct and the relatively homogenous sample (African American adolescents from an urban school district). There is a need for replication with other populations. There may also be value in applying more nuanced conceptualizations of the engagement construct, including multidimensional models. Researchers have tended to study the impact of either teacher or parent support on selfsystem and engagement (Hong & Ho, 2005;Patrick et al., 2007;Ryan & Patrick, 2001;You & Sharkey, 2009). Past research has linked teacher support to student self-system and engagement. Support from teachers enhanced students' focus on mastery of goals (Patrick et al., 2007), feeling of academic efficacy (Patrick et al., 2007;Ryan & Patrick, 2001), and self-regulated learning (Ryan & Patrick, 2001), which in turn facilitated students' cognitive and behavioral engagement (Patrick et al., 2007;Ryan & Patrick, 2001). Although support from teachers is important for student learning and development, support from parents is also related to student self-perception and engagement. Parent support promotes students' perception of control and perception of self, which in turn promote engagement and benefit student learning (Hong & Ho, 2005;You & Sharkey, 2009). However, few studies have examined the impact of both supports in a single study. As a consequence, little has been learned about how parent and teacher support influence and differentially predict students' self-system and engagement. Finally, the relationship of engagement and dropping out is understood primarily in terms of student behavior. For example, Finn and Rock (1997) found that behavioral engagement significantly differentiated unsuccessful school completers, successful school completers, and school dropouts among 1803 minority students from low-income backgrounds. Rumberger (1995), using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, found that moderate to high absenteeism, behavior problems, and having no school or outside activities were highly predictive of dropping out. More recently, Ream and Rumberger (2008) investigated the effect of behavioral engagement on school completion and dropout among Mexican American and non-Latino White students, finding that engagement directly influenced high school graduation. Archambault, Janosz, Fallu, and Pagani (2009) used a three-part engagement construct encompassing behavioral, affective, and cognitive dimensions to successfully predict dropout. Although the global measures of engagement predicted school dropout, behavioral engagement was the only unique factor with statistically significant predictive value. In contrast, few studies have examined academic engagement as it relates to dropping out from high school."}, {"section_title": "Purposes of the present study", "text": "The present study addresses limitations in the research on engagement and dropping out where SSMMD provides the theoretical framework. We assess how indicators of social context (e.g., teacher and parent support), self-systems (e.g., perception of control, identification with school), and engagement (e.g., behavioral and academic engagement) relate to academic achievement and dropping out of high school. Fig. 1 depicts the proposed model, which comprises five parts. We hypothesized that higher levels of support from teachers and parents would positively influence students' perception of self, that positive self-perceptions would positively influence students' behavioral and academic engagement and academic achievement, and that high levels of behavioral and academic engagement and achievement would decrease the likelihood of dropping out of high school.

The base-year study was carried out in a national probability sample of 752 public, Catholic, and private schools in the spring of the 2001-2002 academic year. In total, 15,362 students completed the base-year questionnaire, as did 13,488 parents, 14,081 teachers, 743 principals, and 718 librarians (Ingels et al., 2007).

First, we assessed the fit of the measurement model, using confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). Second, we used structural equation modeling to test our hypothesized model of dropping out of high school. We used bootstrapping to test the indirect effects (see Preacher & Hayes, 2008;Shrout & Bolger, 2002). We requested the recommended minimum of 500 bootstrap samples (Cheung & Lau, 2008) drawn with replacement from the full dataset of 14,781 cases. Bootstrapping is a recommended method for testing mediation, as it does not require the normality assumption and has greater statistical power and control for Type I error than the widely used three-step multiple regression approach ( Baron & Kenny, 1986) or the Sobel (Sobel, 1982) test (Fairchild & McQuillin, 2010;Lau & Cheung, in press;MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002;MacKinnon, Lockwood, & Williams, 2004;Preacher & Hayes, 2004;Shrout & Bolger, 2002). Support for a mediating role is indicated if the bootstrap (bias-corrected) confidence interval does not include zero. In that case, we can conclude that there is a 95% probability that the indirect or mediating effect is significant. We conducted all statistical analyses with Mplus 5.21 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1993. Because most of our measures are categorical, we used robust mean-and variance-adjusted weighted least squares (WLSMV) to estimate our models. The WLSMV estimator produces consistent parameter estimates, unbiased standard errors, and corrects \u03c7 2 when there are categorical variables (Brown, 2006;Muth\u00e9n & Satorra, 1995). WLSMV utilizes all available data without either imputing values or deleting cases, based on the assumption that missing data is missing completely at random (Little, 1995). To evaluate the fits of the measurement and structural models, we relied on a set of test statistics: the Steiger-Lind root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; Steiger, 1990), the Bentler comparative fit index (CFI; Bentler, 1990), and the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), which are less sensitive to large samples than the more traditional chi-square statistic. We followed the Hu and Bentler (1999) guidelines for evaluating the fit between the target model and the observed data: 1) RMSEA values less than 0.05 indicate excellent fit, and values in the vicinity of 0.08 indicate acceptable fit; 2) CFI and TLI values of .95 or greater indicate an excellent fit, and coefficients of 0.90 indicate a good fit."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Measurement model", "text": "The first step in our analyses involved confirming the existence of our hypothesized latent constructs via CFAs. In the first CFA model, we specified a five-factor model to verify the structure of school engagement in terms of behavioral engagement and academic engagement, the structure of self-system processes in terms of perception of control and identification with school, and the structure of academic achievement. As Table 2 suggests, all item parcels loaded significantly onto their respective factors, with standardized loadings ranging from .48 to .67 on behavioral engagement, from .20 to .87 on academic engagement, from .69 to .83 on perception of control, and from .62 to .79 on identification with school.

The self-system model proved to be valid. First, results revealed that contextual factors, including teacher support and parent support, positively influenced students' self-perceptions (perceived control and identification with school) and school engagement (academic and behavioral). Second, students' perceived control positively influenced academic engagement and achievement, while identification with school negatively influenced achievement and positively influenced academic and behavioral engagement. Third, as expected, academic and behavioral engagement positively influenced students' achievement, and academic and behavioral engagement and achievement measured in 10th grade influenced dropping out of school in 12th grade. Fourth, engagement fully mediated the relation between the self-systems and dropping out of high school. Also, self-systems partially mediated the relation between the social context and school engagement. Given these results, the present study contributes to the school engagement and dropout literature in five ways. First, using data from a nationally representative sample, this study provides empirical support for SSMMD as applied to the important problem of dropping out of high school. Although similar models of school dropout were recently proposed by Appleton et al. (2008), Fredricks et al. (2004), and Rumberger (2006), the authors did not test the underlying process model empirically. The only study that empirically tested the SSMMD as applied to the dropout process was conducted by Connell et al. (1995). The results of the present study not only confirm Connell el al.'s finding, but also extend it to a nationally representative sample of high school students. Additionally, by measuring engagement as a multidimensional rather than a unidimensional construct we underline the importance of behavioral and academic engagement in the dropout process. Second, this study provides further support for the role of social context in self-system processes and school engagement. Most research to date has focused on the impact of teachers (Patrick et al., 2007;Ryan & Patrick, 2001) or of parents (Hong & Ho, 2005;You & Sharkey, 2009) on student self-system processes and school engagement. Very little work has compared the relative impact of the two sources of social support. Results from this study suggest when teachers show interest in students, praise their efforts, and contribute to community building within the school; they directly influence students' perception of self and nurture students' levels of school engagement. Similarly, when parents speak frequently with their children about school-related topics, they contribute to students' sense of identification with school, their general perception of control. As control and identification with school are enhanced, these energizing internal mechanisms motivate students to be academically and behaviorally engaged in school activities. Third, the findings suggest that students' self-systems affect their school engagement and academic achievement. This result not only confirms previous findings (Furrer & Skinner, 2003;Legault, Green-Demers, & Pelletier, 2006;Skinner et al., 2008), but also provides new evidence about the magnitude of the effects. The direct effect of identification with school on behavioral engagement (\u03b2 = .24) was twice the magnitude of the direct effect of identification with school on academic engagement (\u03b2 = .04). In addition, the effect of perceived control on academic achievement (\u03b2 = .39) was about twice the magnitude of the effect on academic engagement (\u03b2 = .19). Contrary to our expectation, the effect of perceived control on behavioral engagement was not significant (\u03b2 = .03). Hence, our findings suggest that behavioral engagement was more influenced by perceived identification with school, and academic engagement and achievement were more related to perceived control. That is, students who identify with their school are more likely to conform to classroom rules and regulations, and students who believe in their ability to control the outcome of their educational experience are much more likely to work hard, complete homework, be attentive in mathematics and English classes, and score higher on achievement tests. Fourth, our results suggest that behavioral and academic engagement and academic achievement are key variables to consider when predicting high school dropout. This finding is in line with research that has shown that behavioral disengagement (Archambault et al., 2009;Ekstrom, Goertz, Pollack, & Rock, 1986;Finn, 2006;Ream & Rumberger, 2008) and academic achievement (Battin-Pearson et al., 2000;Hardre & Reeve, 2003) are precursors of dropping out of high school. However, the present findings expand this research and provide evidence that academic engagement also is also a significant predictors of dropping out of high school and that it's utility in predicting dropout is similar to that of behavioral engagement. Educators and policymakers interested in preventing school dropout may want to consider how to implement intervention strategies aimed at increasing students' academic and behavioral engagement and academic achievement (Reschly, 2010). Fifth, this study suggests that academic and behavioral engagement are critical mediators between self-system processes and dropping out of high school. This finding suggests that students' perception of control and identification with school may serve a dynamic purpose by initiating and sustaining a willingness to participate in academic activities and to conform to school rules and regulations, which in turn decrease the likelihood of dropping out of high school. The current study has several limitations. First, the data were from an extant database; therefore, the measures of parent support and teacher support were limited in scope and design. Parent support is a multidimensional construct (Epstein, 1995;Fan, 2001). However, in this study, we examined only one dimension of parent support. More studies employing the multidimensional approach of parent involvement are warranted. Similarly, we focused on only one facet of school context: teacher support. The ELS did not collect data about further aspects of teacher work, including support of autonomy and promotion of performance goals. Future research should investigate these aspects of teachers' work. Second, we relied mostly on self-report information from students and teachers to assess perception of social context, perception of self, and school engagement. Although self-report measures are appropriate \"when the theory or construct involved is attitudinal or perceptual\" (Schmitt, 1994, p. 393), one could draw a more comprehensive picture by implementing multiple methodologies (e.g., observations). Third, findings are based on two time point. Thus, it is not known how results might vary if studied across multiple time points. Future research with longitudinal data could address this limitation. In summary, despite the limitations, the findings of the present study are significant for both theory and practice. The study contributes to the literature by explicating the contributions and interactions of social context, self-system processes, and school engagement in predicting dropping out from high school. More specifically the present results highlight the centrality of supportive teachers and parents for promoting positive self-perceptions of control and identification with school and for nurturing student academic and behavioral engagement. Our results also underscore the importance of behavioral and academic engagement and academic achievement in predicting dropping out of high school. Our data offer further evidence that behavioral and academic engagement mediate the link between self-systems and dropping out of high school and that self-perceptions mediate the relations between teacher and parent support and academic and behavioral engagement. Future studies that focus on applying SSMMD to high school dropouts might consider testing this model across genders and ethnic groups.
