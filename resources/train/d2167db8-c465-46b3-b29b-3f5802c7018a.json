[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "English as a second language (ESL) is meant to provide a meaningful education for students learning English (ELLs); however, its effects remain largely unexplored. Using longitudinal, nationally representative data from the Educational Longitudinal Study, the authors estimate the effects of ESL placement on language minority (LM) adolescents' college preparation and academic achievement. Findings indicate that LM students who most closely fit the EL profile (recent immigrant, relatively low English proficiency) experience positive math outcomes and null effects in other academic areas; however, LM students who fit this profile less well experience negative effects.

We define language minority students as those students who speak a language other than English in the home. The term language minority is inclusive of both competent biliterates and limited English proficient (LEP) students, often referred to as English language learners (ELLs). 1 As immigrant language minorities settle into their adopted communities, schools must provide programs and curricula to deal with the unique pedagogical needs of this growing population (Chapa & de la Rosa, 2004; Wortham, Murillo, & Hamann, 2002) . As the language minority population has grown, educators have developed procedures and processes by which to identify students in need of linguistic support services, a process with great variability (Abedi, 2004; Ragan & Lesaux, 2006; Rivera, Vincent, Hafner, & LaCelle-Peterson, 1997) . In fact, federal policies have long mandated the identification of ELL students within the language minority population and provision of services for them (Lau v. Nichols, 1974) . Once identified for placement into language assistance programs, the most common of which is English as a second language (ESL), ELLs often enroll in ESL courses in addition to the academic coursework required for graduation.\nTo meet their linguistic needs (e.g., the need for instruction in and exposure to school-specific academic vocabulary in English, the need for modified instruction designed to simultaneously incorporate academic content and English vocabulary, etc.), secondary ELLs are placed in ESL and sheltered content-area coursework designed to address their limited proficiency in English (Minicucci & Olsen, 1992; Rivera et al., 1997; Zehler et al., 2003) . In theory, such placement should result in improved achievement compared to other language minority students with comparable levels of English proficiency not placed in ESL coursework. However, further research is necessary to better understand the effects of ESL placement, research that takes into account students' English proficiency and other potential covariates.\nIn addition, students placed in ESL often demonstrate other attributes that may affect their academic performance (e.g., poverty, limited years in the United States, immigrant status), making it difficult to disentangle these selection factors from an effect of ESL placement. This study attempts to address these issues, exploring the effect of ESL placement on language minority students' academic achievement while taking into account not just language proficiency but also prior achievement, individual background characteristics, and characteristics of the school, which may be related to academic achievement and placement into ESL programs."}, {"section_title": "Educational Policy and Language Services", "text": "Under the Lau (1974) decision, the 9th U.S. District Court ruled that schools were responsible for providing language minority students equal and comprehensible access to the academic curriculum. Recognizing that language minority students in U.S. schools must simultaneously learn English and content-area academics to fully participate in either the U.S. workforce or higher education, the court ruled that simply placing them alongside their native English-speaking classmates did not constitute an equality of educational opportunity. Although Lau did not require schools to adopt any one specific language assistance program, it did require that educators in schools identify students with limited English proficiency and implement services designed to assist ELLs.\nAlthough the linguistic support services that schools may provide are not prescribed under Lau (1974) , the most common services offered at the secondary level are language-based ESL coursework and sheltered and/or specially designed academic instruction in English (SDAIE) content-area (e.g., math, science, social science) courses (Rivera et al., 1997; Zehler et al., 2003) . SDAIE and sheltered content-area courses are designed to cover the same curricular content as parallel courses for native English speakers but with pedagogical methods focused on the linguistic needs of ELLs (Chamot & O'Malley, 1996; Echevarria & Graves, 1998) . Although English acquisition and academic achievement are not mutually exclusive, research has documented educators' tendency to view English proficiency as a prerequisite to ELLs' entry into academically rigorous coursework (Callahan, 2005; Harklau, 1994b; Minicucci & Olsen, 1992) . We posit that once a student is identified for ESL placement, this identification itself may shape her or his access to academic content and alter her or his subsequent achievement. The need to make room for ESL services within an already crowded high school graduation schedule may preclude access to the academic preparation necessary for college. Alternately, educators may perceive ESL placement as an indicator that a student is not yet ready for more rigorous college preparatory curriculum and enrollment.\nas ELLs (Abedi, 2004; Zehler et al., 2003) . Students' identification for ESL services brings them to the attention of most administrators and educators because of federal requirements regarding the services they are to receive (Casta\u00f1eda v. Pickard, 1981; Lau v. Nichols, 1974) . The recent No Child Left Behind Act (2002) further strengthens federal mandates with requirements regarding annual assessment of both English proficiency and academic progress for ELLs. Although language services are federally mandated, the procedures for identification, placement, and program of services vary at the school and district levels (Rivera et al., 1997; Zehler et al., 2003) . The programs and services administrators choose to meet students' linguistic and academic needs often depend on the size and prevalence of the language minority population (Cosentino de Cohen, Deterding, & Clewell, 2005; Schwartz & Steifel, 2004) . In addition, the availability of teachers qualified to provide linguistic services may also vary and, in turn, may further limit placement options, especially in schools that enroll relatively few language minority students. Abedi, Hofstetter, and Lord (2004) point to the lack of consensus on LEP identification guidelines across institutions as part of the problem in not only assessing but also instructing ELLs. Typically, identification of language minority students begins with a home language survey, completed by the parents, indicating the use of a language other than English in the home (Mahoney & MacSwan, 2005) . However, recognition of language minority status is just the first step in the LEP identification process. Following identification of a language other than English in the home, the student's level of English proficiency must then be measured with a stateapproved language assessment tool, a test that varies from state to state (Ragan & Lesaux, 2006) . The complex relationships among language minority status, English proficiency, and the tools used to measure this proficiency suggest a need to clarify the ESL identification process at a minimum and to remain cognizant of these complex interactions in all facets of ELL education. Ragan and Lesaux (2006) found that the proportion of language minority students identified as ELLs varies across states; some states identify more language minority students as ELLs, and some states identify fewer. In other words, the same student may be identified as ELL and placed in ESL in one state but not in another. Further complicating the issue, ELL status highly correlates with a number of non-language-related factors, including poverty (Ragan & Lesaux, 2006) and exposure to substandard resources (G\u00e1ndara, Rumberger, Maxwell-Jolly, & Callahan, 2003) . ELL identification processes then vary not only across schools, districts, and states but also across the academic career of the individual student (G\u00e1ndara & Merino, 1993; Linquanti, 2001; Ragan & Lesaux, 2006) . 2 The lack of a uniform definition of ELL is but one factor that may contribute to the lower educational achievement of language minority students (August & Hakuta, 1997) . A clearer understanding of the factors that inform ELL identification will enable scholars in the field to better assess the effects of subsequent ESL placement."}, {"section_title": "Academic Preparation, Secondary Schools, and Stratification", "text": "Stratification among students typically increases in high schools as some enroll in college preparatory coursework and others struggle to complete basic high school graduation requirements (Schiller & Muller, 2000) . For ESL students and others perceived to be at risk, educators may focus on graduation even when students themselves have higher educational expectations, inadvertently limiting access to academically rigorous courses (Callahan & G\u00e1ndara, 2004; Schiller & Muller, 2000) . Meanwhile, preparation for higher education remains the exclusive domain of the mainstream majority. Although high school graduation is indeed a commendable goal and is by no means without obstacles (Romo & Falbo, 1996; Schiller & Muller, 2003) , an unwitting overemphasis on basic graduation requirements may come at the expense of academically challenging coursework.\nEnrollment in the core content areas-math, science, and social science-provides one measure of the rigor of a given student's course taking. Completion of advanced math coursework is an especially strong predictor of college enrollment (Adelman, 1999) . Students enrolled in more advanced math and science coursework with greater access to academic content demonstrate greater gains in achievement than students placed in less advanced courses (Schneider, Swanson, & Riegle-Crumb, 1998) . In addition, exposure to a wider range of social science coursework, more AP and honors classes in particular, is indicative of greater academic rigor, beyond the base graduation requirements (Goodlad, 1984; Jenness, 1990; Thornton, 1994) . Academic preparation in secondary school often determines a student's viability in higher education and in the professional world (Ingels, Curtin, Kaufman, Alt, & Chen, 2002) . For ESL students in particular, access to math, science, and social science curriculum may be a critical indicator of academic rigor."}, {"section_title": "Language Minority Student Achievement", "text": "ELLs are frequently placed in lower level coursework (Wang & Goldschmidt, 1999) , which may ultimately affect academic achievement and attainment. This may be because of their ESL placement, or it may be because they have some other attribute that influences their course placement. The school's placement of the student in ESL may preclude simultaneous enrollment in ESL and advanced academic coursework. Classes that are offered infrequently across the school day (e.g., advanced math, certain foreign language courses, and band or orchestra) may produce scheduling constraints that shape the student's remaining class assignments (Riehl, Pallas, & Natriello, 1999) . ESL coursework may also take space in a student's schedule normally reserved for electives, an umbrella under which advanced science and social science courses often fall. Restricting curricular options hampers not only academic development but also exposure to mainstream peers.\nFor language minority and ESL students, access to an academically challenging program has both academic and linguistic benefits (Lucas, Henze, & Donato, 1990; Roessingh, 2004; Walqui, 2000) ; indeed, research suggests that one of the most efficient paths to English proficiency is via content-area instruction (Chamot & O'Malley, 1996) . Although discrete instruction in English is of course a central facet in a program of linguistic support services, research suggests that to be most effective English instruction must be integrated within an academic context (August & Shanahan, 2006; Lyster, 2007; Norris & Ortega, 2000) . If ESL placement constrains students' exposure to academic content, the cumulative effects may be substantive and significant. One might hypothesize that placement in ESL services need not preclude access to challenging academic content (e.g., college preparatory curriculum); however, programs that attempt to simultaneously provide linguistic support services and ensure high levels of content-area instruction are few and far between and rarely provide the outcome data to determine their effectiveness (Roessingh, 2004; Walqui, 2000) . The powerful effect of curriculum differentiation on adolescent achievement (Hallinan & Kubitschek, 1999) suggests that systematically relegating ELLs to less challenging coursework will inhibit not only their English acquisition, but also their ability to professionally and academically integrate into mainstream society as young adults. ESL support services under Lau were initially conceived as a means to ensure academic parity and equity in curricular access (Lau v. Nichols, 1974) ; whether they do so at present remains an empirical question.\nThe effect of ESL placement on the achievement of language minority students merits serious exploration. The documented variation in ELL identification allows for the comparison of the achievement of language minority students with comparable levels of English proficiency either placed or not placed in ESL services. We hypothesize that language minority students placed in ESL may receive academic preparation different from that of their peers not placed in ESL and that ESL placement may actually preclude rather than ensure equity in curricular access. Furthermore, we argue that as a result of schools' processes, ELL identification may function as a lasting label (DeJong, 2004; Linquanti, 2001; Mahoney & MacSwan, 2005) , all but ensuring long-term educational effects for these students. Developed to ensure equitable access to academic content, in theory ESL placement should result in a boost in achievement for those language minority students compared to language minority students with comparable levels of English proficiency who are not in ESL. However, to date, there has been a dearth of research on the effect of ESL placement on language minority students' academic achievement."}, {"section_title": "The Present Study", "text": "ESL placement is a critical component in the education and schooling of language minority ELL students. Although Lau v. Nichols (1974) mandates that students' linguistic needs be met so that they may take advantage of the full academic curriculum offered in schools, it is also possible that in practice ESL placement functions to exclude them from those very courses. This may be especially evident among ELL students' college preparation.\nControlling for important individual and school-level factors within fixed effects hierarchical generalized linear modeling (HGLM) models, we first investigate the effects of ESL placement on five academic indicators related to college going: college preparatory enrollment in (a) math, (b) science, and (c) social science; (d) cumulative GPA; and (e) math test scores. We then estimate the effect of ESL placement on these same outcomes employing a multilevel propensity score modeling technique introduced by Hong and Raudenbush (2006) intended to reflect a quasiexperimental design. We use these two approaches because of the challenges presented by the individual, social, and academic variables associated with both ESL placement and student achievement, the small number of students placed in ESL, and the strong assumptions embedded within traditional linear regression techniques. We analyze new, nationally representative data from the Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS), the most recent high school longitudinal study conducted by the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics (NCES; Ingels et al., 2007) .\nOur analyses begin with the estimation of the effects of ESL placement on our five college preparatory outcomes, before and after accounting for school characteristics, background characteristics, English language proficiency, parental involvement, and prior achievement. These models allow us to understand the estimated effect of ESL placement on academic preparation after controlling for important confounding variables using traditional hierarchical linear regression techniques. We next use a multilevel propensity score approach (Hong & Raudenbush, 2006) , which is better designed to deal with the selection of students into ESL and the low rates of ESL placement in high school. Propensity score techniques ensure that estimates of the effects of ESL are based on the comparison of language minority ESL and non-ESL students who are similar on individual-and school-level selection factors."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We use data from ELS, which provides individual, family, and school characteristics of a nationally representative sample of sophomores enrolled during the 2001-2002 school year. More than 15,000 sophomores nested in 752 public and private high schools were surveyed. ELS includes detailed information on the high schools these students attended throughout their secondary school career and the complete high school transcripts for more than 14,726 of these students, allowing analysts to examine the processes that influence high school achievement and preparation for college. The sophomore cohort was first surveyed in 2002 and then followed up 2 years later in 2004. In 2005, transcripts were collected from the high school last attended by these students. These transcripts provide a detailed look into the academic achievement and course-taking patterns of this sophomore cohort."}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "Our sample consists of ELS sophomore cohort language minority students who were included in the base year survey and first follow-up transcript component, resulting in an analytic sample of 2,352 students in 523 schools. This represents 13.5% (weighted) of the sophomore cohort base year respondents included in the first follow-up transcript component (N = 14,051). We define language minority based on students' responses to the question, \"Is English your native language (the first language you learned to speak when you were a child)?\" Those who report that English is not their native language are coded as language minority; all others are coded as native English speakers. Appendix A shows a comparison of language minority students with transcript data to their non-language minority counterparts.\nNot surprisingly, the language minority population is more likely to be Latino or Asian and to have lower levels of family resources such as parents' education and income. Although Appendix A shows unweighted means, comparisons using weighted means are not substantively different.\nAlthough transcripts were collected for 91% of the base year and first follow-up sample, including respondents who transferred to another high school or dropped out, some limitations may arise from restricting the sample to those for whom a high school transcript was available. However, as shown in Appendix A, the sophomore cohort base year language minority students (n = 2,595) and sophomore cohort transcript study language minority students (n = 2,352) look very similar on important background characteristics related to both academic outcomes and ESL placement, including race and ethnicity, family resources, time of arrival in the United States, English proficiency, native language use, and base year reading score.\nAll models are weighted with the crosssectional transcript weight, which is designed to account for unequal probability of selection into the transcript study and participation in the survey (Ingels et al., 2007) . ELS oversampled subgroups with higher likelihoods of ESL placement, including Asian and Latino students. However, although the transcript sample weights are used to adjust for disproportionate probability of selection into the sample and survey nonresponse, sample selection issues in our analyses may still remain. The 2002 sophomore cohort sample excludes a small percentage of individuals who were deemed unable to complete the base year survey and assessment tests or were \"questionnaire incapable\" because of limitations such as disability or lack of English language proficiency. 3 It is probable that selection bias has made our language minority sample higher than average in terms of English proficiency and perhaps academic preparation. Thus, if ESL placement is most effective for the least English proficient students, our results may be biased toward showing a null or negative effect. However, if students with moderate to high English language proficiency benefit the most, then we may be underestimating any negative effects of ESL placement.\nVariables ESL placement. Our central variable of interest is a dichotomous indicator of ESL placement during high school (1 = yes). ESL placement is determined by high school course taking reported on student transcripts as well as by a school report indicating whether or not a student was ever in a high school bilingual or ESL program. Exploratory analyses indicate that the school report alone is insufficient to determine ESL placement; many students not identified as being placed in an ESL or bilingual program by the school report have ESL-identified coursework on their transcripts. We conceptualize ESLidentified coursework as those courses designed to meet the linguistic needs of ELL students, either through discrete, language-based ESL instruction or via modified academic content-area instruction (sheltered, SDAIE, primary language or bilingual).\nAlthough the Classification System for Secondary Courses (CSSC) is used to code courses on transcripts, the ELS transcript data also include the course titles used by the schools as they appear on the transcripts. Although the CSSC codes identify groups of courses by subject and level (e.g., Algebra I, Organic Chemistry), they do not necessarily indicate whether a course is an ESL course in most cases. Solely relying on CSSC codes results in losing sheltered and SDAIE content courses and other courses specifically designed for ELL students. Thus, we rely on specific course titles as well as the CSSC coding and cross-reference both to designate a course as ESL (Muller et al., 2007) .\nThe process of identifying ESL courses requires searching for course titles based on keywords or phrases known to indicate ESL-type courses in the course-level transcripts for each student. Keywords include but are not limited to the following indicators of services and terms specific to ELL students: English language learner (ELL, EL, LEP), English as a second language (ESL, ESOL, second language, language development, and English development), sheltered or SDAIE (SHL, SHEL, SDAIE), and bilingual (BIL, BL). From a total of 638,967 unduplicated course records, we culled 3,494 ESL-identified courses taken by ELS respondents. High school courses developed to meet ELL students' linguistic needs fell into three mutually exclusive categories: (a) traditional language-based ESL coursework, accounting for 78.8% of the courses; (b) sheltered or SDAIE content-area instruction in English, 17.7% of the courses; and (c) primary language-bilingual content-area instruction, 3.5% of the courses.\nOf the 2,352 ELS sophomore cohort language minority students with valid transcript data, we identified 415 (17.6) with at least one ESL course on their transcript. In addition, we identified 78 students (3.3%) with a school report of ESL or bilingual placement but no ESL coursework listed on their transcript, resulting in a total of 493 students placed in ESL coursework (21.0%) in our sample of language minority students. Disaggregating by type of ESL course, we identified 388 of the 415 students with an ESL course on their transcript (93.0%) as having been placed in at least one language-based ESL course in high school. A smaller percentage of our sample, 167 of the 415 (40.0%), had a sheltered, SDAIE, or bilingual content-area course listed on their transcript. Of these 167, 140 students had a sheltered or SDAIE course listed on their transcript, whereas only 27 students had a bilingual course listed on their transcript.\nBecause of the relatively small numbers of course takers in each category, we combined the three categories. However, we recognize the substantive differences among these categories, both as researchers and as practitioners involved in ELL education. Consequently, we estimated two sets of models, one in which the ESL courses were combined into one measure and one in which language-based ESL, sheltered, or SDAIE coursework and bilingual coursework were included as separate measures. 4 Here, we present results estimating the effects of ESL placement as a combined measure and note the estimated effects for the disaggregated measures of coursework, which are not shown. Results from these additional models are available on request.\nThis study is designed to explore the effects of schools' treatment and processing of students identified for ESL placement rather than the effects of actual classroom instruction. As such, we argue that ESL placement serves as a viable indicator of schools' labeling policies and processes. Although we are unable to measure the length of time students have been in ESL programs in the United States, models estimating the effect of ESL placement include measures of age, grade in school on arrival, length of residence, and generational status.\nAcademic preparation and achievement. Our dependent variables are (a) college preparatory math enrollment, (b) college preparatory science enrollment, (c) college preparatory social science enrollment, (d) cumulative grade point average (GPA), and (e) 12th grade math achievement test scores (math Item Response Theory [IRT]; Ingels et al., 2007) . We use the constructed math and science pipeline variables in ELS and the subject-specific total course credit variables from student transcripts for our math and science college preparatory variables. Individuals are assigned a 1 on college preparatory math if they received one math credit higher than Algebra II and at minimum two other math credits; otherwise they receive a 0. Individuals are assigned a 1 on college preparatory science if they received one science credit higher than General Biology and at minimum two other science credits; otherwise they receive a 0. Because social science courses are often taken as the core high school graduation requirements and therefore do not distinguish college goers from others (Niemi & Smith, 2001) , our indicator of college preparatory social science is honors and advanced social science coursework. These courses are mainly composed of college-bound students, although not all college-bound students take these courses. Here, students are assigned a 1 on college preparatory social science if they enrolled in one or more honors or AP social science classes; otherwise they receive a 0. Cumulative GPA is a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 4 representing the average grades received in all courses throughout high school. We use cumulative GPA rather than academic GPA to include all coursework specifically designed for ELLs, regardless of its college preparatory status. End of high school math achievement is measured using 12th grade math IRT scores.\nIndividual and family characteristics. Unless otherwise indicated, information for the following variables was taken from the base year survey. Race/ethnicity is coded into six mutually exclusive categories: White; Black or African American; American Indian or Alaskan Native; Asian, including Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; Multiracial; and Latino or Hispanic. The first five race categories exclude individuals of Latino or Hispanic origin. We further disaggregate the Latino category into Mexican and non-Mexican Latino and the Asian category into Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, South Asian, and Southeast Asian to capture the diversity of immigrant groups and their experiences within the U.S. educational system.\nWe include several measures of language ability and language use, including an index representing the student's self-reported English language ability, an index representing the student's frequency of native language use (more information about these and other composite variables can be found in Appendix B), an indicator of whether or not the respondent's parent uses a language other than English at home, and whether the parent questionnaire was completed in Spanish.\nParents' education was created using NCESconstructed variables that indicate the highest level of education achieved by both the student's mother and father, based on parent reports augmented with student reports when necessary. Each variable includes eight categories ranging from did not finish high school (1) to completed Ph.D., M.D., or other advanced degree (8). We take the maximum value of both parents' highest level of education. NCES filled in missing values using logical imputation, a weighted sequential hot deck procedure, and a multiple imputation procedure based on 18 variables, 14 of which were key demographic and family background variables (see Ingels et al., 2007) . A similar method was used by NCES to impute income, 10th grade reading score, and language minority status. We include a dummy variable indicating that language minority status was imputed in all models because of its association with both ESL placement and academic performance. For missing values on variables not imputed by NCES, we use the multiple imputation option in HGLM, which averages the estimates of five separately imputed data sets created using the ICE command in STATA. We ran models using multiple imputation as well as sample mean and mode substitution, and results were not substantively different. Appendix C lists measures with missing data and the number of cases imputed for each.\nFamily composition is measured with a dummy variable indicating a two-biological-parent family, with all other categories as the reference. To measure yearly income, we recode the NCESconstructed income variable into five categories based on the distribution of the students in our sample and the relationship between ESL placement and income categories, ranging from 0 (less than $10,000) to 4 (greater than $75,000); in addition, we control for number of family resources (see Appendix B). To measure age, we split the continuous date/month/year birth date variable into quartiles and include the lowest quartile as the reference category.\nMeasures of generational status are based on parent-reported student place of birth, mother's place of birth, and father's place of birth. Firstgeneration students are those born in Puerto Rico or a country outside of the United States. 5 We further disaggregate first generation by those who arrived 5 or fewer years and 6 or more years prior to the survey. Second-generation students are those who were born in the United States but have at least one parent who was born in Puerto Rico or a country outside of the United States. Third-generation students are those born in the United States with both parents also born in the United States. In addition, we control for whether or not the respondent was placed in sixth grade or higher on arrival in the United States.\nParental involvement. We include several measures of parental involvement that are taken from the parent survey, including how often the parent or spouse contacted the school about the respondent's academic performance since school opened in the fall, how often the parent contacted the school about the respondent's course selection, and an index measuring the extent to which the parent or spouse provided advice about school (see Appendix B). As an additional measure of socioeconomic status and parental investment in the respondent's schooling, we control for whether or not the parent is currently saving for the respondent's college education. Finally, we include an indicator of whether or not the student's family has rules regarding maintaining GPA.\nPrior achievement. Constructed using transcript data, 9th grade math placement is a dichotomous variable indicating whether the student received credit in Algebra or higher math in 9th grade. This is an important indicator of being on track to meet the college preparatory math requirement, Algebra II or higher. Cumulative GPA for 9th grade is taken from students' transcripts, and 10th grade reading scores (IRT) are taken from results obtained during the base year survey; math and reading are the only two content areas for which test score data are available in the ELS data set (Ingels et al., 2007) . We also control for parent report of whether or not the student was retained before 9th grade and whether the respondent required base year test accommodations. We include the earliest available indicators for achievement categories (9th grade for grades and course enrollment and 10th grade for standardized test scores) as well as a measure of college aspirations (see Appendix B).\nSchool characteristics. Because the characteristics of the schools that ESL and non-ESL students attend may vary and be associated with academic outcomes, we control for a variety of school characteristics at Level 2. We include controls for school region (Midwest, West, South), locale (urban), and student-teacher ratio and an index measuring the degree to which aspects of the school environment hinder students' learning (learning hindrances; see Appendix B). In addition, we control for the proportion of LEP-identified students within the school, the proportion of minority students, the proportion of Asian students, the proportion of students receiving free lunch, and the proportion of students in special education programs. Finally, we include a control for whether or not data available from school administrator reports and student transcripts show that the school offers a program designed for ELLs. We include the logit transformation of proportions in models to account for the non-normal distributions of these variables.\nSchool region, locale, proportion free lunch, level of learning hindrances, proportion LEP, and proportion in special education are all taken from the base year school administrator survey.\nProportion minority and student-teacher ratio are taken from the ELS attached 2000-2001 Common Core of Data (CCD). We construct the proportion of Asian students and the proportion of immigrant (first and second generation) students by aggregating individual data within schools. We construct a dummy variable indicating whether or not the school offers specially designed courses for ELLs using both school administrator and transcript data. A school is identified as offering ESL if the school administrator reports that any students within the school are enrolled in ESL or bilingual programs or if any students within the school have a school report of ESL or bilingual placement or any type of ESL coursework on their transcript. Similar to missing data at the individual level, we use the multiple imputation option in HGLM, which averages the estimates of five separately imputed school-level data sets created using the ICE command in STATA. Appendix C lists schoollevel variables that have missing values and the number of cases imputed for each. Table 1 displays means and standard deviations for the dependent and independent variables first for all language minority students and also by ESL placement. The relatively lower levels of college preparatory enrollment for students placed in ESL address the relative academic disadvantage experienced by language minority students in ESL. Table 1 shows that, among other risk factors, language minority students placed in ESL tend to be slightly older and to have parents with lower levels of socioeconomic status (as measured by education, income, family resources, saving for college), are less likely to be living in intact families, and have lower levels of academic preparation than their non-ESL counterparts. Not surprisingly, language minority students placed in ESL are much more likely to have arrived in the United States 5 or fewer years prior to the survey and to have been placed in sixth grade or higher on arrival."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Plan", "text": "We first estimate the effect of ESL placement on college preparation with a series of fixed effects multilevel models using HLM 6.04 software. These models provide information about the college preparation of language minority students placed in ESL relative to those not placed in ESL in high school. For each of our five outcomes, college preparation, and academic achievement, we run three separate models that include, progressively, (a) individual, family, and school characteristics, (b) 9th grade academic indicators, and (c) 10th grade reading score. All models are weighted with the crosssectional transcript weight, which is designed to account for unequal probability of selection into the sample and participation in the survey (Ingels et al., 2007) . ELS oversampled both Asian and Latino students, and certain subgroups, including Latinos, were less likely to be included in the transcript component. To estimate models of college preparatory enrollment (math, science, and honors social science), which are dichotomous outcomes, we perform hierarchical logistic regression; to predict academic achievement (GPA and math test scores), we perform hierarchical linear regression. The above models provide estimates of the effect of ESL placement on language minority students' achievement from a series of regression models with traditional statistical controls. In addition to these generalized linear models, we employ a multilevel propensity score stratification technique developed by Hong and Raudenbush (2006) to better estimate the impact of ESL placement on college preparatory enrollment and academic achievement. 6 This technique is well suited for dealing with potential selection bias into the treatment group (ESL placement) that may be related to pretreatment characteristics at the individual, family, and school levels. In addition, even in large samples, few high school students are placed in ESL, and most demonstrate a relatively low risk for ESL placement. Consequently, language minority students who do and do not take ESL may not be comparable on selection factors. Stratifying students based on the propensity for placement into ESL ensures that the estimated effect of ESL placement is based on the comparison of treatment and nontreatment groups with equivalent risk (or propensity) for ESL placement (Dehejia & Wahba, 2002; Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) , which cannot be done using standard regression techniques.\nPredicting propensity for ESL placement. In addition, HGLM is limited in the number of pretreatment covariate controls allowed because of limited degrees of freedom and related standard error inflation. Propensity score techniques allow the analyst to create one index per student that captures multiple pretreatment factors. Drawing from preliminary bivariate analyses and from prior research exploring ESL placement, classrooms, and students, we identified a number of factors that correlate with ESL placement and academic achievement. Using multi-level logistic regression, we predict a student's propensity to be placed in ESL with 52 covariates used in our initial generalized linear models. We include not only individual-level characteristics such as family background, individual and family language use, prior achievement, and parent-school involvement but also variables measuring school context. Appendix D details the variables included in the multilevel propensity score model, their coefficients, and their standard errors.\nELS data are limited in that there are no qualifiers for length of time in ESL program, an obvious concern for educators and researchers alike. To address this issue, the above models predicting ESL placement take into account generational status and also indicate length of time and grade on entry in U.S. schools for firstgeneration students.\nAfter predicting a propensity score for each student, we divided our sample into 11 strata based on the logit of this propensity score. The mean of the logit of the propensity score is not statistically different between the treatment and nontreatment groups within each stratum; the balance in the logit of the propensity score for ESL placement in ESL schools is shown in Appendix E. In addition, balance was achieved in each stratum for nearly all (96%) pretreatment covariates. After balancing the treatment and nontreatment groups on a variety of pretreatment factors, we then compare the means of our outcomes (college preparatory math, science, and social science; cumulative GPA; and math IRT scores) within each propensity stratum to estimate the effect of ESL placement after balancing. Appendix F displays the within-stratum outcome differences by ESL placement for the 11 strata.\nEstimating the effect of ESL placement. Finally, to understand the effects of ESL placement on academic outcomes among students nested within schools, we combine multilevel regression modeling and propensity score stratification to estimate the average effect of ESL placement on our academic outcomes. For college preparatory math, science, and honors social science coursework, we estimate hierarchical logistic models. For cumulative GPA and 12th grade math achievement test scores, we estimate hierarchical linear models. All models include dummy indicators for 10 of the 11 propensity strata, which classify students at risk for ESL placement, as well as the logit of the estimated propensity to be placed in ESL. In addition, to test for variation in the effect of ESL placement, or causal heterogeneity (Morgan, 2001) , we estimate hierarchical linear models that include interactions between medium-propensity (4-7) and low-propensity (0-3) score ranks and ESL placement, with high-propensity score ranks (8-10) as the reference category. This allows us to estimate differences in the effect of ESL placement for students who have a higher propensity for placement (and also tend to be more recent immigrants with relatively low levels of English language proficiency) compared to those with medium and low propensity (who tend to be long-term English learners primarily schooled in the United States). All propensity score analyses were run with and without the common support option, which deletes from analyses non-ESL students with no risk of ESL placement and ESL students with extremely low risk of ESL placement. Employing the common support option did not change our substantive findings."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ESL Placement and Academic Outcomes", "text": "We first turn to results derived from our nested hierarchical generalized linear regression models that address our primary research question: What are the effects of ESL placement on college preparatory enrollment and academic achievement among language minority students? In addition, we ascertain which factors account for any negative estimated effect of ESL placement on academic outcomes. The first model includes a variety of individual, family, and school characteristics, the second model includes 9th grade measures of achievement, and the third model includes 10th grade reading test scores. The three college preparatory course enrollment outcomes are shown in Table 2 ; the two academic achievement outcomes (test scores and GPA) are shown in Table 3 .\nCollege preparatory course enrollment. Table 2 shows that language minority students placed in ESL are less likely than non-ESL language minority students to enroll in college preparatory coursework by the end of high school, as shown in Model 1 for each outcome. Specifically, language minority students placed in ESL are 49% (i.e., 1-exp(-.68)) less likely to enroll in college preparatory science coursework relative to language minority students not placed in ESL. In addition, those placed in ESL are 36% less likely and 56% less likely than their counterparts not placed in ESL to enroll in college preparatory math and social science coursework, respectively. These negative effects are found even after controlling for a variety of individual, family, and school background characteristics, including important covariates such as socioeconomic status, generational status, grade in school on arrival to the United States, English language ability, and native language usage.\nIn Model 2, which adds indicators of 9th grade achievement, we find that the statistically significant negative estimated effect of ESL placement remains for college preparatory science and social science coursework. The statistically significant negative estimated effect of ESL placement on college preparatory math coursework is rendered insignificant once controls for 9th grade achievement are added to the model. Finally, after controlling for 10th grade reading score in Model 3, we still find a statistically significant negative effect of ESL placement on college preparatory science and social science coursework and no effect of ESL placement on college preparatory math coursework. After controlling for individual, family, and school background characteristics, 9th grade achievement, and 10th grade reading scores, language minority students placed in ESL are 45% less likely to enroll in college preparatory science coursework and 48% less likely to enroll in college preparatory social science coursework than language minority students not placed in ESL.\nIn a replication of Model 3 for college preparatory math course taking (not shown but available on request), we find no statistically significant effects when we disaggregate ESL placement into four distinct types. However, it is worth noting that the coefficient representing high school bilingual placement is negative, as is the coefficient for school-reported bilingual or ESL placement; however, the coefficient for sheltered or SDAIE is positive, whereas the coefficient for Coeff."}, {"section_title": "SE", "text": "Coeff.\nCoeff.\nCoeff.\nCoeff.\nCoeff.\nCoeff.\nCoeff.\nCoeff.

These results, although not statistically significant and based on small sample sizes, suggest that the effect of ESL placement on math course taking may vary by the type of ESL coursework in which students are placed. However, the same model for college preparatory science course taking suggests a negative effect of all types of ESL placement; we find a statistically significant negative effect of placement in only language-based ESL courses, bilingual content-area courses, and school-reported bilingual or ESL placement. In addition, although not statistically significant, the coefficient for sheltered or SDAIE content-area placement is also negative, suggesting that all types of ESL placement may have a negative effect on college preparatory science course taking.\nFor college preparatory social science course taking, we are unable to disaggregate sheltered or SDAIE and bilingual content-area course placement because of sample size (in combination with a small number of students taking honors social science), yet we find a negative, statistically significant effect of SDAIE or bilingual content-area course placement, a negative but not statistically significant effect of languagebased ESL placement only, and a positive but not statistically significant effect for schoolreported bilingual or ESL placement. Although we are unable to disaggregate bilingual and sheltered or SDAIE content-area placement, these results suggest that both traditional languagebased ESL as well as content-based ESL coursework may have a negative effect on social science course taking. Academic achievement. Table 3 presents models predicting two key achievement outcomes, 12th grade math test scores and GPA. Similar to the findings about course taking in Table 2 , we find that language minority students placed in ESL earn lower grades and lower scores on the math achievement test in 12th grade compared to their counterparts not placed in ESL after controlling for important individual, family, and school characteristics. Language minority students placed in ESL earned 0.18 less of a grade point and almost 4 points lower on the 12th grade math achievement test than did their counterparts not placed in ESL. We also find that this statistically significant negative estimated effect of ESL place-ment on grades persists after controlling for 9th grade achievement in Model 2 and 10th grade reading score in Model 3. After accounting for background characteristics, 9th grade achievement, and 10th grade reading scores, language minority students placed in ESL earn almost one tenth less of a grade point than language minority students not placed in ESL. In a replication of Model 3 predicting grades that disaggregate the ESL course-taking variable, we find no statistically significant effects of the four types of ESL course placement, yet all of the coefficients are in a negative direction, suggesting that both traditional language-based ESL as well as content-based sheltered or SDAIE or bilingual course placement may have a negative effect on cumulative grade point average.\nFor math test scores, although the statistically significant negative estimated effect of ESL placement on math test scores persists in Model 2, the effect is rendered insignificant once reading test score is added in Model 3. In addition, in the replicated version of Model 3 that disaggregates the ESL placement variable, none of the ESL variables are statistically significant, yet the coefficients for bilingual content-area coursework and school-reported bilingual or ESL placement are negative and the coefficients for languagebased only and sheltered or SDAIE are positive, although not close to statistical significance. These results, in combination with results from Model 3 disaggregating ESL placement and predicting college preparatory math course taking, suggest that the effect of ESL placement on math achievement outcomes may vary by the type of ESL course placement, although in no case do we estimate a significant positive effect. In the next set of analyses we use a multilevel propensity score stratification technique to test the robustness of our findings for the average effects of ESL placement as well as causal heterogeneity in the effect of ESL placement on our academic outcomes.\nCoeff.\nCoeff.\nCoeff.\nCoeff. she or he is placed in core academic curriculum with either mainstream or ELL-certified teachers. 8 Mainstream educators may object to the placement of an ESL student in upper level academic classes as they do not feel equipped to or possibly do not care to address the student's linguistic needs. Alternately, she or he may be placed in one of the SDAIE or sheltered content courses offered at the school. With one to two periods of her or his schedule claimed by ESL, plus the core graduation requirements and a preference for placement with ELL-certified teachers, there is little room left for electives, including upper level science and social science coursework. Unintentionally, the school has translated her or his LEP ELL status into limited academic aptitude. Her or his enrollment in engaging, challenging curriculum is placed on hold until she or he displays sufficient English proficiency. Trapped in a simplified curriculum, she or he has little opportunity to develop critical academic language, her or his engagement with school wanes, and her or his grades suffer. As many of the more advanced high school courses have prerequisites, any diversion from the pathway into advanced classes may become a disadvantage for college preparation.\nIn the initial fixed effects HGLM models (Tables 2 and 3) , the strong explanatory power of prior achievement suggests the role of schools' processes and procedures in shaping the academic trajectories of language minority students. Under the auspices of ESL placement, when a student is identified as \"limited\" in English, intentionally or not, her or his access to academic content is delayed until she or he is deemed sufficiently proficient (Harklau, 1994b; Linquanti, 2001; MacSwan & Rolstad, 2003) to engage with the academic content, the same academic content in which she or he is now behind as she or he has had limited exposure while learning English. The different effects of ESL placement for high-and low-propensity students suggest a potential benefit to more efficient exit from ESL programs. It is entirely possible that students who entered U.S. schools prior to high school may have also experienced initial benefits from ESL placement; our results suggest that these students then do best when they transition out of the courses before the high school years.\nIn addition, for language minority students in the lower strata-those less likely to fit the ELL profile-ESL coursework may take space in a schedule that might otherwise be filled with advanced or elective science and social science coursework and may thus preclude students' access to more academically rigorous and engaging coursework. Students placed in less engaging coursework achieve at lower levels (Hallinan & Kubitschek, 1999; Hoffer, 1992) ; our findings suggest this process may be at play for language minority students placed in ESL. Although prior ethnographic research attests to the social and academic marginalization of ESL students in substandard academic, primarily languagefocused programs within the larger high school context (Dillon, 2001; Harklau, 1994a; Olsen, 1997; Valenzuela, 1999) , it has never been clear whether this has been because of limited English proficiency, academic tracking, or a combination of the two. Our findings suggest that once schools place a student in ESL, access to college preparatory resources is reduced or, at the very least, not enhanced. Schools' overarching goal for ELLs requires a shift from mere high school completion to postsecondary preparation.\nRecent immigrants, for whom the system of linguistic support services was designed, may benefit from these supports with respect to mathematics outcomes in the early stages of English language acquisition. ESL placement appears to function in a more positive manner for this group. One limitation of our data, however, is that some students, including those with very low English proficiency, were declared incapable of completing the survey in the base year. This small number of students was also very likely to have been placed in ESL coursework. Based on our findings, which suggest some limited or positive effects for students most in need of ESL services, it is possible that we have underestimated these positive effects for this select group of students."}, {"section_title": "Multilevel Propensity Score Stratification: The Estimated Effect of ESL Placement", "text": "To estimate the effect of ESL placement on the academic achievement of language minority students using a propensity score stratification approach, we begin by estimating which individual-and school-level factors predict placement into ESL programs (see Appendix D). In theory, language minority status and English proficiency level should be the primary if not sole determinants of ESL placement; however, in practice, predicting ESL placement is much more complex (Ragan & Lesaux, 2006; Rivera et al., 1997) . After predicting ESL placement, obtaining a propensity score for each individual, and stratifying individuals on their likelihood of being placed in ESL, we next use multilevel propensity score modeling to estimate the effect of ESL placement on high school college preparatory course enrollment and achievement.\nIn the first step, predicting the likelihood of being placed in ESL, we are able to elaborate on the range of factors that predict ESL placement. Not surprisingly, language minority students with higher reading test scores and higher levels of self-reported English ability are less likely than other language minority students to be placed in ESL. In addition, language minority students who report using their native language more frequently, were placed in 6th grade or higher on arrival in the United States, and arrived in the United States 5 or fewer years prior are much more likely than other language minority students to be placed in ESL. Also, language minority students who are Filipino are less likely than their non-Hispanic White counterparts to be placed in ESL, and language minority students with greater socioeconomic status, as measured by income and family resources, are less likely than other language minority students to be placed in ESL in high school. Finally, language minority students placed in Algebra I or higher in 9th grade are less likely to be placed in ESL than their counterparts placed in less than Algebra I (please see Appendix D for a full list of predictors). At the school level, students attending schools with larger proportions of Asians and larger proportions of students placed in special education are more likely to be placed in ESL.\nThe propensity score predicting ESL placement includes a number of significant covariates of ESL placement, at both the individual and school levels. Subsequent analyses using this propensity score allow us to stratify students based on their propensity to be placed in ESL, such that when comparing academic outcomes for students with comparable likelihoods for ESL placement, we are, similar to an experimental design, better able to isolate any effect of ESL placement. Appendix E lists the 11 strata into which we divide our sample and indicates, within each stratum, the mean value of the logit of the propensity score for those placed and not placed in ESL. The mean of the logit of the propensity score for those placed and not placed in ESL is not statistically different within any of the 11 strata, and differences in the logit of the propensity score range from .89 to -.13. Appendix F shows within-stratum differences in our achievement outcomes. For math IRT, the average difference between those placed and not placed in ESL is -6.65, and the within-stratum differences range from 11.60 to -22.26. For cumulative GPA, we see an average treatment effect of -0.19 of a grade point, and the treatment effect within stratum ranges from 0.39 to -0.77. For two average students similar on all other covariates who receive grades in 12 semester courses per year, the student placed in ESL will receive one letter grade lower in 9 of her or his classes compared to her or his counterpart not placed in ESL. Appendix F also shows within-stratum differences for college preparatory math, science, and social science coursework. We next use these propensity strata as well as the logit of the propensity score in two-level hierarchical generalized linear models to estimate the average ESL placement effect on language minority students. Table 4 displays the results of our multilevel propensity score modeling techniques used to estimate the effects of ESL placement. In each model we include, at the individual level, the logit of the propensity score, 10 dichotomous variables representing 10 of the 11 stratification ranks, and a dichotomous indicator of ESL placement. At the school level we control for whether or not the school reports having a program designed for ELLs. For each outcome we report the coefficient, the standard error, and the t-value for the ESL placement effect."}, {"section_title": "Estimated Effects of ESL Placement on Academic Outcomes", "text": "College preparatory course enrollment. The left-hand side of Table 4 shows the estimated effect of ESL placement on students' college preparatory math, science, and social science enrollment, respectively. We find a significant negative estimated effect of the treatment, ESL placement, on college preparatory science enrollment, yet we find no statistically significant effects of ESL placement on college preparatory math or social science course taking. Specifically, language minority students placed in ESL are 42% less likely than language minority students not placed in ESL to enroll in college preparatory science coursework. Given the consistent findings using traditional HGLM and propensity score modeling techniques, it appears that ESL placement may constrain students' enrollment in advanced science coursework and do nothing to improve language minority students' likelihood of enrollment in college preparatory math or social science coursework.\nAcademic achievement. On the right-hand side of Table 4 , we see that there is a statistically significant negative estimated effect of ESL placement on cumulative GPA but not on 12th grade math IRT test scores. Thus, based on results obtained from propensity score modeling techniques, language minority students placed in ESL earn, on average, almost two tenths of a grade point less than language minority students not placed in ESL. The consistent negative estimated effect of ESL placement on grades in both traditional HGLM and propensity score models suggests that ESL placement may have a negative impact on cumulative end of high school GPA among language minority students, an important consideration given the role of grades in both high school graduation and college admission. In addition, findings from both HGLM and propensity score models suggest that ESL placement does not improve language minority students' math skills. 7 However, the within-stratum outcome differences included in Appendix F show that, at times, the effects of ESL are not consistent across strata. Notably, for math IRT scores we observe negative effects of ESL placement in Strata 1 to 3 and positive effects of ESL placement in Strata 8 to 10. In the final models depicted in Table 5 , we tested the interactions between ESL placement and the propensity strata. For these analyses, we included dummy variables for language minority students in the highest (8-10), middle (4-7), and lowest (0-3) propensity strata as well as interactions between the middle and lowest strata variables and ESL placement. Table 5 shows that among language minority students in the highest strata (8-10), who are not only the most likely to be placed in ESL but also the least English proficient, the poorest, and the newest to the country, there is no effect of ESL placement on science or social science coursework or GPA (represented by the ESL coefficient). However, there exists a positive estimated effect of ESL placement on college preparatory math coursework and on math test scores (IRT). Thus, for language minority students most likely to be placed in ESL, and, one might argue, in the greatest need of ESL placement, we do find positive effects of ESL placement on both math outcomes measured. Table 5 also illustrates that among language minority students in these highest strata, we find no effect of ESL placement on the other academic outcomes.\nFor many language minority students (Strata 0-7), our models estimate either a negative or null effect of ESL placement on our five dependent variables. For students in the middle strata (4-7), results in Table 5 demonstrate a significant negative estimated effect of ESL placement for all five academic outcomes. For the few students in the lowest strata (0-3) placed in ESL, we find a negative estimated effect on GPA and no effect on the remaining four outcomes. The results depicted in Table 5 suggest that the effect of ESL placement varies according to the characteristics of the language minority student in question."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Variation in Effects: Recent Arrivals and Long-Term ELLs", "text": "Our analytic approach allows us to stratify our language minority student sample by their propensity to be placed in ESL and thus single out ESL placement as the one key factor on which students will differ. Our results suggest that the effect of ESL placement varies with one's likelihood of placement in ESL. Language minority students within the highest ESL placement strata appear to best \"match\" educators' expectations of the ELL profile: recent immigrants (much more likely to have arrived within the past 5 years and to have been placed in sixth grade or above on arrival) with relatively low self-reported English language proficiency and standardized reading test scores. For these students with a high propensity for ESL placement, we find positive math outcomes.\nConversely, the largely negative effects of ESL placement among language minority students who are less likely to be placed in ESL (those who are more likely to be Generation 1.5 or 2 with greater English proficiency and longer tenure in U.S. schools) point to possible problematic school processes either in placement or in the opportunities afforded to ESL students. Thus, although ESL services may initially ensure that students' linguistic needs are prioritized, if ESL placement is continued over time, it may undermine long-term academic achievement. If language acquisition remains the primary focus of ESL at the expense of academic rigor, our evidence suggests that ELLs will be academically marginalized.\nNationally, a substantial group of language minority adolescents placed in ESL are likely to have been schooled primarily, if not solely, in the United States and to have higher levels of English proficiency and higher reading test scores (Callahan, 2005; Freeman, Freeman, & Mercuri, 2002; Linquanti, 2001; Ruiz-de-Velasco, 1999) . Our findings suggest long-term ELL language minority students-namely, those who are enrolled in ESL beyond an initial period when they are learning English-do not benefit from and may even be hindered by ESL placement."}, {"section_title": "Defining an Academic Trajectory", "text": "Identification for and placement in ESL may result in an academic and linguistic catch-22 for language minority students. Once labeled ELL, a student first must be placed into discrete linguistic services, such as ESL coursework. Later, Coeff."}, {"section_title": "Pedagogy and Practice", "text": "We take care to emphasize that our analyses deal with ESL placement and the processing of students labeled in need of ESL services, not with the pedagogical and instructional practices of the educators who devote time and energy to improving the achievement of the students they serve. Future research might explore how the provision of linguistic support influences the delivery of academic content. In the present study, we do not claim to measure pedagogical practices and/or curricular content; further research is required to address these issues. In fact, literature exploring academically challenging linguistic support services does exist, suggesting exemplary academic models of ESL services may be attainable (Chamot & O'Malley, 1996; Roessingh, 2004) ; however, it is important to keep in mind the myriad challenges facing simultaneous language-based and content-area instruction, especially at the secondary level.\nAlthough prior research suggests that academic and linguistic needs may be simultaneously met (August & Shanahan, 2006; Roessingh, 2004) , the paucity of empirical work evaluating effective content-area instructional strategies for students learning English is daunting (Goldenberg, 2008) . Implementation of exemplar programs remains rare and largely undocumented; successful programs entail a complex balance of the academic and linguistic needs of immigrant students learning English with teacher abilities and school capacities. Further research is necessary to understand how to successfully implement ESL programs that ensure equity in academic access for ELLs.\nResearch and practice indicate that the most efficient delivery of linguistic support services is via content-area curriculum (August & Hakuta, 1997; Chamot & O'Malley, 1996; Crandall, Jaramillo, Olsen, & Peyton, 2002) . At present, little if any regulation exists to ensure that sheltered or SDAIE content is equal in rigor to parallel mainstream coursework. The most effective sheltered and SDAIE pedagogical practices actively engage students with the academic content, fostering critical inquiry and debate at all levels of English language proficiency (August & Shanahan, 2006; Lyster, 2007) . Our findings, combined with prior pedagogical work, suggest that perhaps the path to improving language minority and ESL student achievement is via rigorous, rather than simplified, curriculum and instruction in the lower ESL levels. More rigorous content-area academic exposure earlier on may prevent the issue of long-term ELLs, facilitating their exit into college preparatory curriculum and the academic pipeline. The development and implementation of engaging, challenging SDAIE and sheltered content-area curriculum could help to counter the ESL dilemma, possibly ensuring an academic advantage to placement in and timely exit from ESL services, meeting the spirit as well as the letter of Lau (1974) ."}, {"section_title": "Identification and Placement", "text": "Much as ESL identification criteria vary considerably (Abedi, 2004; Mahoney & MacSwan, 2005; Ragan & Lesaux, 2006) , little research explores whether ESL exit (reclassification) criteria prove optimal measures of student readiness (G\u00e1ndara & Merino, 1993; Linquanti, 2001) . Variation in the effects of ESL placement for high-and low-strata ELLs may be indicative of a backlog of language minority adolescents in the ESL pipeline, unable to exit for either linguistic or academic reasons, or both. Future research exploring the factors preventing exit from ESL placement may contribute to the improvement of ESL programs and policies. Excessively stringent criteria may inadvertently hold some language minority students in ESL coursework to their detriment. Substandard academic achievement would suggest a need to revamp the provision of academic support concurrent with linguistic support. Alternately, insufficient English proficiency after the recommended 5 to 7 years (Collier, 1987) would suggest a need to reconsider the effectiveness of current pedagogical practices in language acquisition and development.\nEducators and policymakers may wish to pay special attention to who is placed in ESL coursework and for how long. Reclassification or movement out of ELL status has long been recognized as contentious at best (Linquanti, 2001) and may contribute to the negative estimated effects. It is critical to address the placement of the language minority students who fit the ELL profile less well with care, considering how placement in language-based ESL as well as sheltered or SDAIE content-area coursework may shape students' academic trajectories.\nFollowing the spirit of Lau (1974), linguistic support services should ensure equity in academic access-students placed in ESL services should experience tangible academic benefits in coursework and in achievement more generally. Our results suggest that this is the case only for students with the greatest propensity to be placed in ESL and that, in fact, ESL placement hinders students' other areas of academic preparation.\nAs a policy, ESL placement so strongly determines the access and therefore the achievement of language minority students that it calls into question the mechanisms with which schools place students in courses as they attempt to comply with the Lau (1974) decree. Although educators may work to ensure that ELLs graduate from high school, the transcripts and grades of these students suggest they are prepared for little more. To ensure equity in academic access, ESL placement should demonstrate benefits in academic outcomes when compared to like students not placed in ESL services. It is vital that students are provided language services and opportunities to learn college preparatory material."}, {"section_title": "Predicting ESL Placement: School Context", "text": "Our propensity score model predicting ESL placement is designed to account for the variation in procedures and processes across schools that may affect ESL placement and academic outcomes while also addressing status group stratification in achievement within schools. This allows us to focus on the estimated effect of ESL placement on students' academic preparation, net of individual and school characteristics. Schools' student body composition plays a role in ESL placement, although not necessarily in the manner we might have imagined. Students in poor, crowded, and urban schools are more likely to be identified for ESL placement. However, indicators of the proportion of immigrant, minority, and LEP students in the school all fail to predict ESL placement; rather, as the proportion of special education students and Asian students increases, so does a language minority student's likelihood of ESL placement.\nThe relationship between special education programs and ESL placement merits further empirical examination. Possibly, schools with well-articulated special education programs may be more likely to comply with federal and state guidelines regarding language services as well. Conversely, the prevalence of special education in a school may correlate with more lowlevel academic curriculum and less college preparatory coursework, facilitating the placement of ESL students in a less than rigorous academic trajectory. Future research might explore whether this is also indicative of a relationship between ELL and special education status at the student level."}, {"section_title": "Policy Implications", "text": "By no means do we deny that language minority ELL students have specific linguistic and academic needs that must be addressed; rather, we suggest that the present high school process may not effectively ensure equity in academic access for these students. Understanding how to best serve ELL students in U.S. schools requires, first, consistency in identification, placement, and exit procedures and, second, an evaluation of the treatment and achievement of students once identified for services. Although ELL students' linguistic needs must be met because of legal precedents (Casta\u00f1eda v. Pickard, 1981; Lau v. Nichols, 1974; No Child Left Behind Act, 2002) and ethical considerations, the current system of delivery of services at the secondary level warrants modification. Our findings show that, overall, language minority students placed in ESL coursework exit high school with significantly less academic content, even when accounting for English proficiency, prior achievement, generational status, ethnicity, parental education, years in U.S. schools, and school-level factors. The variation in the effect of ESL placement is a particular cause for concern with respect to retention in ESL coursework. For language minority students with more developed English language proficiency skills, our findings suggest their placement in ESL services should be conservative and approached with caution. Limited English proficient (LEP) status is a federal (U.S. Department of Education) term used to indicate a non-native English speaker in need of language support services. LEP status is determined largely at the local (school or district) level. Many states and schools use the term English learner (EL) or English language learner (ELL) rather than LEP; to ensure consistency, this study uses the term ELL unless citing a source. 2 With the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (2002) , states began to adopt statewide English proficiency tests for both identification and assessment purposes. The results of the increase in internal consistency will still not be measurable for several years to come.\n3 Approximately 160 individuals with language barriers or severe disabilities, just more than 1% of the base year sample, were deemed unable to complete the survey (Ingels et al., 2007) . 4 We constructed four mutually exclusive dichotomous variables representing (a) placement in traditional language-based ESL only, (b) placement in specially designed academic instruction in English (SDAIE) only or SDAIE in combination with language-based ESL placement, (c) placement in bilingual or bilingual in combination with SDAIE or language-based ESL, and (d) school-reported bilingual or ESL placement, which we are unable to disaggregate. 5 Those born in Puerto Rico are included with the foreign born despite their status as U.S. citizens because of the fact that many schools (and other U.S. citizens) perceive them to be immigrants because of their language minority status and offshore nativity. 6 As a test of robustness, we also employed an alternative propensity score technique, kernel matching ESL Placement and Achievement using STATA software, which allowed us to estimate the average treatment effect of ESL on the treated for our two continuous outcomes, math IRT score and cumulative GPA (for a full review of the STATA p-score and kernel matching procedure, see Becker & Ichino, 2002) . The kernel matching technique does not allow for estimation of dichotomous outcomes, so we were unable to estimate the effect of ESL placement for the college preparatory outcomes."}]
