[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In December 2019 in Wuhan, China started the pandemic of COVID-19, commonly known as Coronavirus, which has caused havoc around the world. World Health organization reported on June 7 [18] , the virus is in 216 Countries, there are 6 750 521 active cases, and it has produced 395 779 deaths. For this reason, scientists around the world have been focused on topics such detect it [2] , prevent it [13] , cure it [3] , and predict it [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 19] . To predict the coronavirus different schemes has been applied, for example in [15] proposes an approach, which is based Composite Monte Carlo enhanced by deep learning and fuzzy rule induction to predict the COVID-19, [20] detailed models for forecasting the course of the pandemic, these models demonstrate the utility of parsimonious models for early-time data. Using the official data forecasting, [21] studied the spread of COVID-19, they realized forward prediction and backward * Figure 1 . Example of the available information on \"Our World in Data\".\nThe proposed approach consists of two stages \"Building the model\" and \"Evaluating the model\". These stages are applied 6 times, one time per region. We use the time series \"Total confirmed COVID-19 cases\". The first stage \"Building the model\" requires the time series per country, which starts on the day when each country presented the first case of COVID-19 and it finishes on April 25. The second stage \"Evaluating the model\" requires the information of COVID-19 on May 28. Then the forecasting between May 12 and May 28 is calculated and compared with the real values. In the following subsections, the proposed approach is explained in a general way and using an example. The example calculates the \"p, D, q\" values of ARIMA to Canada and builds the North America model. "}, {"section_title": "ARIMA Stage", "text": "We use the time series \"Total confirmed COVID-19 cases\" per country. Then, we have a time series presented in the following equations:\nIn the equation 1, y means the total confirmed cases per day presented in a country. In the equation 2, T 1 means the day when each country detected the first COVID-19 patient. Then D 1+n represents the number of days elapsed until April 25. For example, Canada detected the first patient on January 26. Then, we can rewrite the equation 2 as shown the equation 3. The Figure 3 shows the time series of Canada. To compute the best parameters of ARIMA, the time series is separated into training time series and testing time series.\nTo train time series is created using 90% of the data from the original time series. At the same time, test time series is created using 10% of the data from the original time series.\nThe Figure 4 shows the example using time series of Canada. \nIn equation 4, the k value is calculated, this value is the threshold to separate the data between Train and Test. Equations 5 and 7 present the Train and the Test time series, respectively. Then, Algorithm 1 is applied to calculate the best parameters of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA).\nARIMA is a statistical analysis, it uses time series data. The ARIMA predicts future values by examining the differences between values in the time series. An ARIMA model consists of 3 components Auto regression (AR), Integrated (I), and\nMoving average (MA). Each component is a parameter. To represent these parameters, ARIMA models use a standard notation p, D, and q. This standard notation indicates the type of ARIMA model used. Where p means the number of lag observations, D means the degree of difference, and q means the order of the moving average, for further details refer to [10, 20] . In the previous Algorithm, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) [11] measures the stability between the original data and forecast data, RMSE is calculate using the equation 9. This process is applied to each country. Annex \"A\" presents the p, D, q values of the ARIMA model and the RMSE to each analyzed country."}, {"section_title": "Polynomial Functions", "text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f"}, {"section_title": "Journal Pre-proof", "text": "The ARIMA stage calculated the p, D, q values to each country. In this stage, we use these values, the information of cases confirmed COVID-19 per million people on April 25, and the Population per million people (ppMP). Table 1 shows an example of the obtained values in the previous stage, which are used in this stage. \nCk (14) In our example k=1, 2, 3, \u2026, 13. Then we need to apply the Algorithm 2 on \nTo solve the equation 15, we present the problem as shown the equation 16.\nThen, t is used to form Vandermonde matrix [21] V with n+1 columns and m rows.\nWhere m is the length of d. After to solve the equation 16, we find the values of P 1 , P 2 , \u2026, P n+1 . To calculate the best values of P n , we propose the Algorithm 3.

Canada belongs to North America, so we use the functions of North America to calculate the ARIMA parameters.\nTo calculate another country, we must use the functions which belong to the region of the country. "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "This section presents the results for each region analyzed. Table 2 shows the average RMSE per region. In the table, the RMSE is calculated between the forecast and the real values. Figure 8 "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The Annex \"A\" presents the results per country before to create the geographic models.\nThese results belong to each country in the different regions. As we mention in section 3.1.1, the time series are separated into modeling (90% of the signal) and testing (10% of the signal). Below, we will discuss each region in particular.\nNorth America region has 13 countries; this region presents a RMSE average of 640.61. The RMSE average of this region is the most bigger between the regions. Table 3 shows a comparison between [12] and this work before to create the geographic models. As shown Table 3 this approach has better RMSE to forecast the virus in Italy, on the contrary [12] has better RMSE to predict the virus in Turkey and\nSpain. At first, it seems that their proposal is better than ours, but when the RMSE J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof averages are compared, we can see that our proposal has a lower RMSE than them, besides we are analyzing 145 countries while they only analyze 3. Table 3 . Comparison between [12] and this work. When the geographic models are created, these models are used to predict new cases in a country. The results are shown in Table 2 . The forecast is made 17 days after the models are calculated, we take this decision to have a real difference between the cases on April 25 and May 11 as shown the tables in Annex \"A\". As expected, the RMSE error grew because, the prediction is making 17 days after the models were created and we calculate 15 days of prediction cases. In these time interval, the actions as quarantine control, stay at home campaign, social distance taken by governments significantly affect the prediction. If the lector wants current predictions, the information needs to be updated and repeat the building the model stage."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We can conclude that the algorithm to model and evaluate the ARIMA models is able to "}]
