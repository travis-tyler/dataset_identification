[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This study uses latent transition analysis to examine reading development across the kindergarten and 1st-grade year. Data include poverty status and dichotomous measures of reading at 4 time points for a large sample of children within the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study. In each of 4 waves of the study, 5 latent classes were represented in different proportions: low alphabet knowledge, early phonological processing, advanced phonological processing, early word reading, and early reading comprehension. Transition probabilities were calculated for the full sample and for children living above and below poverty. The findings indicate that children living below poverty are less likely to experience successful reading transitions than their above-poverty peers. However, children in the below-poverty group who began kindergarten with at least early phonological processing experienced transition probabilities similar to their above-poverty peers. Researchers should target and test preschool interventions for their potential efficacy to mediate the effects of poverty on early reading.\nThis study addresses old and important questions. Are there discrete stages in reading acquisition? If so, what is the likelihood that young children transition across these stages and into conventional reading by the end of first grade? We address this question first for a large sample of children and then for an important subgroup: children living in poverty. As such, our findings may be of interest to those who study beginning reading from a theoretical perspective, for those who design early reading interventions, for those who establish educational policies designed to prevent reading failure, and for those who develop and apply advanced empirical methodologies to answer questions in the social sciences.\nAn underlying assumption tested in this article is that readers progress through stages of development, and that those stages are qualitatively distinct, theoretically sound, and measurable. Stage theories of reading development posit sequential and progressive movement (Gillon, 2004) . This assumption has a long history. Chall (1983) advanced what she called a \"scheme\" of six stages to organize thinking about literacy development across the life span. Other researchers have focused their attention on stages within the context of reading acquisition (Ehri, 1987; Gibson, 1965; Gough & Hillinger, 1980; Juel, 1991; Mason, 1980) .

In the prealphabetic phase, the connection is a default visual one; the reader does not have the alphabet knowledge to link letters and sounds. In the partial-alphabetic phase (because of some knowledge of letter names and sounds and some measure of phonological awareness), the reader can make a partial connection, usually only for the initial and final letters. The full alphabetic phase includes connections between all letters and the sounds they represent in words and fully amalgamated representations of sound, spelling, and meaning connections in memory; it is dependent on automatic access to letter-sound information. Those connections facilitate transition to the consolidated alphabetic phase, in which readers can make use of patterns larger than the individual letter sound (rimes, syllables, or morphemes); this phase is dependent on access to orthographic information.

For this article, though, we focus on.stages of acquisition of the foundational knowledge that facilitates recognition of unknown words without the benefit of picture cues rather than the specific cognitive strategies novice readers use alone or in combination to read words in authentic running text. This focus is justified in that both stage and nonstage models of literacy acquisition depend on acquisition of specific knowledge about the alphabetic writing system (Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, & Seidenberg, 2001) ; recent work on the development of phonological sensitivity (Anthony, Lonigan, Driscoll, Phillips, & Burgess, 2(03) indicates that there is a clear developmental sequence."}, {"section_title": "Indicators of Early Reading Success", "text": "To examine achievement over time, selection of powerful indicators is important both conceptually and empirically. Many researchers have pursued investigations of contextual influences on reading achievement and of intervention models to investigate the short-and long-term relationships of specific indices of reading achievement amenable to instruction during the first years of school. These studies have produced convergent evidence that attainment of specific subskills and more global language abilities early in school are positively related to various forms of reading achievement later.\nUnlike language acquisition, reading acquisition is not natural-it depends to a large extent on access to appropriate opportunities and instruction in and out of school. Therefore, understanding the effects of context variables is essential. Variables outside the reader are related to various indices of reading achievement or of response to interventions during the first years of school. Potentially powerful moderators of literacy growth have included educational attainments of families or caregivers (e.g., Burchifial, Peisner-Feinberg, Pianta, & Howes, 2002; Catts, Fey, Zhang, & Tomblin, 2001; Lyster, 2002) , socioeconomic status (SES) of families (e.g., Alexander, Entwisle, & Olson, 2001; Dickinson & Snow, 1987) , achievement measured at the school level (e.g., Share, Jorm, MacLean, & Matthews, 1984) , ethnicity (e.g., Alexander & Entwisle, 1988) , and experience with literacy activities at home (e.g., Bus, van Ijzendoorn, & Pellegrini, 1995) .\nAll of the factors identified above are potentially related to the broader issue of poverty, and there is ample evidence that poverty indices are inversely related to literacy achievement. The National Assessment of Educational Progress monitors that relationship for children beginning in Grade 4, and the results are grim. For example, in the year 2003, 55% of fourth-grade students who qualified for federal lunch subsidies scored below the basic level in reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress compared with 24% performance at this level for their more advantaged peers (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2(01). This achievement gap is present from the start of school; kindergarten children's cognitive skills are related to their family's income (Gershoff, 2003) . And unfortunately, persistent poverty, especially during the preschool years, is consistently associated with poor achievement in school later (Duncan & Brooks-Gunn, 2000) . Thus, increasing understanding of successful reading transitions is especially important to efforts to increase achievement of poor children.\nThere is a large literature that focuses on cognitive indicators of early reading success. Specifically, understanding letter names and sounds, development of full phonemic awareness, and the use of this combined knowledge and skill to read and spell unknown words and to facilitate automatic sight word acquisition are doubtless important aspects of reading acquisition. During the first 2 years of school, these subskills include what Whitehurst and Lonigan (2002) have termed \"inside-out\" skills: knowledge of letter names (e.g., Badian, 1995; Morris, Bloodgood, & Pemey, 2003; Scarborough, 1989; Share et al., 1984) ,knowledge of letter sounds (e.g., Scarborough, 1989) ,and phonological awareness (e.g., Share et al., 1984; Stuart & Coltheart, 1988) . Analyses that combine measurement of many of the individual subskills above provide the most robust relationships with later literacy achievement (e.g., Catts et al., 2001; Morris et aI., 2003; Schatschneider, Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, & Foorman, 2004) . Analyses that measure achievement beyond the first-grade year contribute evidence that \"outside-in\" skills (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 2002) , such as vocabulary knowledge and other oral language measures in kindergarten, are predictive of later achievement (Roth, Speece, & Cooper, 2(02) . How, when, and in what conditions these early accomplishments influence the development of even more complex reading skills are questions that have occasioned continuing theoretical, empirical, and practical investigation."}, {"section_title": "Transitions to Proficiency", "text": "Early indicators of literacy achievement are actually more important when they are considered together for their long-term effects on later reading achievement. Juel, Griffith, and Gough (1986) proposed and tested a \"simple\" model of literacy acquisition in which phonemic awareness contributed to development of cipher knowledge (decoding), which in turn contributed to both word recognition and spelling. They examined these variables and others across the first-and second-grade years using the method of path analysis; relationships in the data supported their model. Juel's (1988) longitudinal study of reading achievement for 54 children from a low-SES neighborhood yielded a .88 probability that a child who left kindergarten with weak phonemic awareness was a poor decoder at the end of first grade and would remain a poor decoder at the end of fourth grade. Juel's work turned attention to early intervention, particularly during kindergarten and first grade.\nDocumenting the importance of proficiency in individual reading skills like phonemic awareness is not the same as understanding or predicting achievement for individual learners. In literacy, researchers are attempting to model a process that includes multiple dimensions and is influenced by access to instruction. During reading acquisition, time is a factor that interacts with growth. For example, growth may not be linear and may be related to readers' ages and stages: Alexander and Entwisle (1988) found greater growth during the first-grade year than between the end of first grade and the end of second grade. Initial skills are also a factor to consider. A study of reading development across the first 2 years of schooling in Finland (n = 196) found that although initial achievement levels were powerful predictors of reading at the end of Grade 1, growth in reading skills was not linear. In fact, individuals with higher levels of initial reading experienced more rapid growth in the 1st year of schooling, but individuals with lower initial literacy skills experienced more rapid growth during the 2nd year (Leppanen, Niemi, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2004) . Thus, looking across time, we may be able to anticipate different growth trajectories for children with different initial skills and to provide them with differentiated instructional opportunities to maximize their growth. In fact, observational work indicates that time, explicitness, and teacher directedness interact to predict growth for children with different initial literacy skills at the start of first grade (Connor, Morrison, & Katch, 2004) and that different types and amounts of word-level instruction may be needed to maximize early literacy growth for children with different levels of initial literacy (Juel & Minden-Cupp, 2000; Xue & Meisels, 2004) .\nModeling Stage-Sequential Processes:\nLatent Transition Analysis\nGiven the need to understand the development of salient literacy skills across the first years of school and the rich data available for use in this study, selection of adequate methodology is crucial. Arguably, the most popular method for the analysis of change over time is growth curve modeling (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Willett & Sayer, 1994) .Indeed, the power and popularity of growth curve modeling and recent extensions to growth mixture modeling (Muthen, 2002 ) are now well established in the array of quantitative methodologies in the social and behavioral sciences. Applications of growth curve modeling and growth mixture modeling to the problem of reading development can be found in several recent studies (Francis, Shaywitz, Stuebing, Fletcher, & Shaywitz, 1996; Kaplan, 2003; Muthen, Khoo, Francis, & Kim Boscardin, 2002) .\nThe importance of growth curve modeling notwithstanding, this method addresses only one conceptualization of change-namely the rate of change over the time span of the data collection. Another conceptualization of change that arises in the social and behavioral sciences especially relevant to early reading development concerns change in qualitative status over time. For example, concern may rest on changes in developmental states, such as Piaget's stages of cognitive development or Kohlberg's stages of moral development. In the context of this article, the problem centers on stages of reading achievement during the transition to conventional reading in the first 2 years of school. Recent developments and applications of latent transition analysis, a method that extends latent class analysis to problems of stage-sequential development over time, allow its use to examine these reading transitions.\nThis study applies latent transition analysis to a large longitudinal sample across the period of reading acquisition. Variables include important indices of early reading achievement (alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness and letter sound knowledge, word reading, and early reading comprehension [ERC]) measured repeatedly and reliably at each of four time points. The following research questions are considered:\n1. Given data on important reading indicators for many individuals across the kindergarten and first-grade years, can we form latent classes?\n2. Are these classes represented across the reading acquisition window (kindergarten and first grade)?\n3. Given membership in a given class, what is the probability of movement into a successive class over time?\n4. Is this probability of movement related to poverty status?\nThese questions are addressed by first performing separate latent class analyses for each wave of the study for the entire sample and for each of two poverty levels. This is followed by a latent transition analysis for the entire sample and by poverty level. Details regarding the latent transition analysis are discussed in the Method section."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "This study uses data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Class of 1998 -1999 NCES, 2001 ). The ECLS-K database provides a unique opportunity for us to estimate the prospects of successful reading achievement (which we define as the ability to comprehend text) by the end of first grade for children with different levels of entering skill and different potential barriers to success. The ECLS-K data available to address this question include longitudinal measures of literacy achievement for a large and nationally representative sample;-a sample unprecedented in previous investigations of early reading development.\nThe ECLS-K is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and NCES, and it is a component of the NCES longitudinal studies program. The ECLS-K has several major objectives. First, ECLS-K provides for the study of achievement in the elementary school years. Second, ECLS-K provides an assessment of the developmental status of children in the United States at the start of formal schooling and at various points throughout the elementary school years. Third, ECLS-K allows for a crosssectional study of the nature and quality of kindergarten programs in the United States. Finally, ECLS-K provides the necessary data to study the relationship of family, preschool, and school experiences to developmental status and growth during kindergarten and the elementary school years (NCES, 2001) . It is this latter characteristic of ECLS-K that constitutes the major focus of our investigation.\nThe study design consists of a nationally representative sample of approximately 22,000 children and their families attending more that 1,000 public and private schools.! Data collection took place during the fall of 1998 and spring of 1999 (kindergarten), and fall of 1999 and spring of 2000 (first grade). The survey continued during the spring of 2002 (third grade) and spring of 2004 (fifth grade); however, public use data are, as of this writing, only available for the first four waves of the survey. Data are collected from children, their families, their teachers, and their schools. For this study, only data on children and their families were relevant. Data on children were collected in untimed one-on-one assessments; data on families were collected through questionnaires. Data used for this article consist of the kindergarten base year (fall 1998/spring 1999) and fust-grade follow-up (fall 1999/spring 2000) panels of ECLS-K. Only fust-time public school kindergarten students who were ! A multistage probability sampling design was used to produce a nationally representative sample of the 1998-1999 U.S. kindergarten cohort. The primary sampling units were counties or groups of counties. The second stage of the design consisted of schools sampled within the primary sampling units. The third stage of the design sampled students within schools. Only Asians and Pacific Islanders were oversampled. Two strata were created-one for the Asian and Pacific Islanders, and one for all other children. Each child was sampled with equal probability and with a target sample size of 24 children within each school. See NCES (2001) for more details.\npromoted to and present at the end of first grade were chosen for this study.\nThe sampling design of ECLS-K included a 27% subsample of the total sample at fall of the first grade to reduce the cost burden of following the entire sample for four waves but to allow for the study of summer leaming loss (NCES, 2(01). Although this dramatically reduces the sample size, we nevertheless include fall of fITSt grade in this study to allow four time points for estimation of the transition probabilities. The sample size for this investigation is 3,575."}, {"section_title": "Measures and Instrument Design", "text": "The measures used in this study consist of a series of reading assessments and a measure of poverty status. The measure of poverty is computed by taking income information obtained from the parent survey and comparing it against the 1998 Census poverty thresholds that vary according to household size. A dichotomous variable is provided that indicates whether the child's household is below or above the poverty threshold.2\nThe reading assessments were conducted in an individual, untimed format. The battery consisted of a first-stage routing test used to determine which of three second-stage forms were administered (easy, middle, and high as indicated by difficulty level of the items). Using an item response theory framework, we calculated reading scale scores for children on the basis of their performance on the routing test and specific second-stage form. The reading assessment contains items designed to measure basic skills, those inside-out variables that Whitehurst and Lonigan (2002) have identified as particularly salient in the first 2 years of school. Specifically, the reading assessment yields scores for (a) letter recognition, (b) beginning sounds, (c) ending sounds, (d) sight words, and (e) words in context (WIC). In the letter recognition subtest, four letters of the alphabet were printed on a page and presented using a flipbook. The child named each of the letters. In the beginning sounds subtest, six letters were presented on a page. The assessor said each of four target words out loud, and the child pointed to the letter that made the same sound as at the beginning of each stimulus word. The ending sounds subtest was conducted in the same way, with the child pointing to the letter that made the same sound as occurred at the end of each stimulus word. The sight word subtest included four words presented individually in isolation. The child was asked to read each word. The WIC items included 4 sentence comprehension items. They were presented in a Cloze format. The child read each sentence and chose among four response options for filling in the blank in the sentence.\nIn addition to reading scale scores, ECLS-K provides transformations of these scores into probabilities of proficiency as well as dichotomous proficiency scores, which we use in this study. To calculate dichotomous proficiency scores, the ECLS-K instrument design formed clusters of reading assessment items having similar content and difficulty. A child was assumed to have passed a particular skill level if he or she answered at least three of four items in the skill cluster correctly. A fail score was given if the child incorrectly answered or did not know at least two items within the skill cluster. In the case of exactly two items correct, a pass/fail score was given if the pattern of passes and fails for remaining proficiencies yielded could suggest an unambiguous pass or fail. For example, a fail would be assigned if easier clusters had been failed, and no harder cluster had been passed (NCES, 2(01) Therefore, for each student, there are five dichotomous outcomes measured at four time points. The reading proficiencies were assumed to follow a Guttman simplex model, in which mastery at a specific skill level implies mastery at all previous skill levels. The model we tested is a longitudinal Guttman simplex, examining how the parameters of this model vary across poverty levels."}, {"section_title": "Analysis and Design", "text": "Briefly, latent transition analysis has its origins in the merging of Markovstochasticprocessmodelsand latentclass models.Markovstochastic process models for the analysis of psychological variables were initiated by Anderson (1954; as cited in Collins & Wugalter's, 1992, study) , and most applications at that time focused on single manifest measures. However, as in the early work in factor analysis of intelligence tests, researchers recognized that many important psychological variables are latent-in the sense of not being directly observed but possibly measured by numerous manifest indicators.. The advantages to measuring multiple latent variables via multiple indicators are the well-known benefits with regard to reliability and validity. Therefore, it would be preferable to model latent variables in the context of Markov processes and, in this way, to provide an adequate representation of psychological constructs. The appropriate measurement model for categorical latent variables is the latent class measurement model. Latent class models were introduced by Lazarsfeld and Henry (1968) for the purposes of deriving latent attitude variables from responses to dichotomous survey items. In a traditional latent class analysis, it is assumed that an individual belongs to one and only one latent class, and that given the individual's latent class membership, the observed variables are independent of one another-the so called local independence assumption (see Clogg, 1995) .3 The latent classes are, in essence, categorical factors arising from the pattern of response frequencies to categorical items in which the response frequencies playa role similar to that of the correlation matrix in factor analysis (Collins, Hyatt, & Graham, 2(00) . The analog of factor loadings are parameters that estimate the probability of a particular response to the manifest indicators given membership in the latent class."}, {"section_title": "Unlike continuous latent variables (factors), categorical latent variables (latent classes) divide individuals into mutually independent groups.", "text": "Of relevance to this article is the work of Wiggins (1973) , who merged the latent class measurement model with Markov stochastic process models. Contributions to the problem of estimation were made by van de Pol and de Leeuw (1986) and van de Pol and Langeheine (1989) . The difficulty with these models, as noted in Collins and Wugalter's (1992) study, was that they focused on one single manifest indicator of the latent variable. Such an indicator could be, they argued, unreasonably long and complicated. The alternative would be to come up with simpler multiple manifest categorical indicators of the categorical latent variable and combine them with Markov stochastic process models.\nThe combination of multiple indicator latent class models and Markov stochastic process models provided the foundation for latent transition analysis of stage-sequential dynamic latent variables. According to Collins and Wugalter (1992) , stage-sequential dynamic latent variables are metaconstructs comprised of other latent variables and the relations among them (p. 134). At any given point in time, the array of latent class memberships defines an individual's latent status. The problem then concerns estimation of the transition probabilities from one latent status to another. In other words, the concern is in estimating the transition probabilities of moving across latent statuses over time and how these latent transition probabilities differ as a function of relevant covariates. Latent transition analysis (Collins & Wugalter, 1992 ) is used to estimate these transition probabilities and fit the entire latent transition model to the observed pattern of response frequencies over time. Throughout this article, data were analyzed with the software program WinLTA (Collins, Lanza, Schafer, & Flaherty, 2002) .4 WinL TA is a flexible software program that can be used to fit latent class and latent transition models to data. A more detailed mathematical exposition of latent transition analysis can be found in the Appendix.\n2 In cases in which information on income was not obtained, a hot-deck imputation procedure was used to assign income values (NCES, 2(01).\n3 It may be interesting to note that latent class models are special cases of latent Markov models in which latent class membership is not changing over time (Bijleveld & van der Kamp, 1998 "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The results of the latent transition analysis are presented first for the whole sample and then for the two levels of poverty."}, {"section_title": "Full Sample Results", "text": "Descriptive statistics and split-half reliabilities for the full sample analysis can be found in Table 1 . Of note is that 81% of the sample is reported to be above poverty.5 Moreover, a careful examination of Table 1 reveals that there is considerable missing data on the words in context measure for all time periods except spring of first grade. It is important to note that in cases in which children did not answer enough items to unambiguously assign a pass or a fail, then ECLS-K protocol assigned a pass or fail score if proficiency scores at other levels allowed for an unambiguous assignment. For example, a pass could be inferred if harder clusters of items were passed, and no easier clusters of items were failed. The opposite logic was used to assign fail scores (NCES, 2001) . This fact has bearing on our study insofar as the most difficult cluster of items (comprehension of WIC) had relatively few unambiguous scores of either pass or fail and was left blank in the ECLS-K database. In that case, and in other cases, we scored these items as fai\\.6 We note that the split-half reliabilities for the item clusters are relatively high across the time points of this study.\nThe structure of the reading subtests as well as theoretical considerations about the importance of alphabet knowledge, full phonemic awareness, decoding, and automatic word recognition led us to hypothesize that five latent classes would explain the pattern of response frequencies to the five subtests.\nModels specifying three and four latent classes were also specified. The decision to reject the three and four class models rested on the pattern of response frequencies as well as the overall fit of the model. As noted earlier, the response frequencies playa role similar to that of factor loadings in factor analysis. Thus, the objective is to examine different structures (here 3 vs. 4 vs. 5 latent classes) with regard to ease of interpretation. The model with five latent classes showed better overall fit to the pattern of response frequencies and was substantively easier to explain.\nGiven the pattern of response probabilities (see Table 2 ), labels for the latent classes were generated. The low alphabet knowledge (LAK) class consisted of individuals with very low probability of passing any of the subtests. The early phonological processing (EPP) class consisted of individuals with moderate or high probability of passing the letter recognition subtest, moderate probability of passing the beginning sounds subtest (except in fall of kindergarten), and low probability of passing the other three tests. The advanced phonological processing (APP) class consisted of individuals with high probability of passing the letter recognition subtest, moderate or high probability of passing the beginning sounds subtest, and, with the exception of the fall kindergarten 5 A weighted analysis shows that approximately 76% of the 1998 kindergarten cohort were above poverty, and 24% were below poverty.\n6 The rationale for recoding blanks as fails rested on the computational difficulties with the software in imputing missing data for such a large model. We recognize that our results may be affected by this decision, but in smaller subsets of analyses that used missing data imputation, our results were relatively robust when compared with the results of imputing fails. .Spl it half reliabilities of item-cluster scores based on proficiency levels.\nNote. Response probabilities are for passed items. Response probabilities for failed items can be computed from 1 minus the probability (pass). LR = letter recognition; BS = beginning sounds; ES = ending sounds; SW = sight words; WIC = words in context; LAK = low alphabet knowledge; EPP = early phonemic awareness; APP = advanced phonemic awareness; EWR = early word reading; ERC = early reading comprehension.\na Class proportions within waves may not sum to 1.0 because of rounding error.\nassessment, moderate or high probability of passing the ending sounds subtest. The early word reading (EWR) class consisted of individuals with high probability of passing letter recognition, beginning sounds, and ending sounds, and low or moderate probability of passing the sight word subtest (except in spring of kindergarten). Finally, the ERC class consisted of individuals with high probability of passing letter recognition, beginning sounds, ending sounds, and sight words, and either moderate or high probability of passing the WIC subtest. Table 2 presents the response probabilities measuring the dynamic latent variables conditional on latent status membership. The interpretation of this table is similar to the interpretation of a factor loading matrix. Specifically, we examine the response probabilities for five subtests given the latent class. So, for example, in the fall of kindergarten, given membership in the LAK class, the probability of passing any of the subtests is very low. In contrast, given membership in the ERC class, the response probabilities on all but the WIC subtest are very high. We conclude that the pattern of response probabilities across the subtests and across time corroborate our theoretically predicted latent classes.\nThe last column ofT able 2 presents the latent class membership proportions across the four ECLS-K waves for the full sample. We see that in fall of kindergarten, approximately 18% of the cases fall into the LAK class, whereas only approximately 3% of the cases fall into the ERC class. This breakdown of proportions can be compared with the results for spring of first grade; by that time, only 3% of the sample are in the LAK class, whereas approximately 40% of the sample is in the ERC class.\nThe latent class membership proportions displayed in Table 2 indicate that there is some movement to more advanced classes over time. However, Table 2 does not provide the transition probabilities for individuals given their membership in a specific latent class. The transition probabilities for the full sample can be found in Table 3 . An inspection of Table 3 reveals that for fall of kindergarten, children in the LAK class have a .53 probability of staying in that class in the spring of kindergarten and a .46 probability of moving to the next latent class. The \"stayer\" probabilities can be found in the diagonal elements of the table, whereas the \"mover\" probabilities can be found in the off-diagonal elements. To take another example, children in the APP class in the fall of first grade have a .11 probability of staying in that class but a .64 probability of moving to the EWR class and a .25 probability of moving to ERC in the spring of first grade. The five-class latent transition model for the full 556 KAPLAN AND WALPOLE sample was found to fit the data (LJul/ = = 1,048,440, P > .05).7"}, {"section_title": "2167.073, df Poverty Level Differences", "text": "In this section, we examine differences in the achievement of children living above and below the poverty threshold on aspects of the latent transition analysis-specifically response probabilities, latent class membership proportions, and transition probabilities. Our comparative results are descriptive in nature in that no attempt was made to assess whether differences between poverty groups were statistically significant. Table 4 presents the response probabilities and latent class membership proportions for each poverty status. An inspection of Table 4 reveals that the pattern of response probabilities is roughly the same for each latent class for children living above and below the poverty threshold. Although there are differences, they are relatively minor and lead us to the conclusion that the naming of the latent status variables applies to data for both groups.\nThe static latent class membership proportions for each poverty level can be seen in the 7th and 13th columns of Table 4 . A close inspection of this table indicates that for any given wave of ECLS-K, children living below poverty are more represented in the lower skill level classes than children living above poverty. For example, in the spring of kindergarten, approximately 7% of the children living above poverty are in the LAK class compared with approximately 24% of children living below poverty. By contrast, approximately 24% of the children living above poverty are members of the EWR class, compared with 13% of the children living below poverty. These patterns are roughly the same across the waves of ECLS-K.\nAs noted in the analysis for the full sample, Table 4 does not provide the transition probabilities associated with moving across statuses over time. The results in Table 5 provide the transition probabilities for each poverty status. An inspection of Table 5 reveals interesting and suggestive patterns. First, note that children living above poverty tend to transition into the next status at somewhat higher rates than children living below poverty. For example, in the spring of kindergarten, children living above poverty and in the LAK class have a .60 probability of staying in that class and a .27 probability of moving to the next latent class by the fall of first grade. By comparison, children below poverty have a .81 probability of staying in the LAK class and only a .17 probability of moving to the EPP class by the fall of first grade. At the beginning of kindergarten, the EPP class experiences high transition probabilities for children above and below poverty. That attainment of both alphabet knowledge and the ability to segment initial sounds during the preschool years may be an especially powerful predictor of later reading success. Similar transitions are evident during the first-grade year for the EPP category. However, children from poverty are less likely to move from EPP to EWR than those living above poverty, and arguably few from either poverty group are able to progress from EPP to ERe.\nOther suggestive patterns emerge from an inspection of Table 5 . Specifically,we observe that in the early waves of ECLS-K, movement into the later skillclassesis not appreciablydifferentfor children living above or below poverty. For example, in the fall of kindergarten, children living above poverty and in the EWR class have a .58 probabilityof stayingin that class and a .42 probabilityof moving to the highest level, the ERC class. Comparable probabilities can be found for children living below poverty. This finding suggests that very high skill levels at entry into a grade can mitigatethe effects of poverty. Regardless,we find thatpovertydoes constrainthe transition of children to higher levels of reading, particularlyfor the early set of skills. It should be noted that the model for the above povertysample and below poverty sample show excellent fit to the data [L~ove "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study investigated reading transitions during the first 2 years of school for a large and nationally representative sample of children. Reading achievement was defined in the data set used for this study to include letter recognition, knowledge of initial sounds in words, knowledge of final sounds in words, word reading in isolation, and sentence-level comprehension. Given the literature on reading development, we assumed these accomplishments to be successively more complex; our data supported that assumption. The methodology used in this study, latent transition analysis, allowed us to investigate whether there were similar latent classes for groups of individuals in the study at each of four time points and to estimate the probability that individual members in a latent class would progress to membership in a more advanced latent class between start and end of kindergarten, between end of kindergarten and start of first grade, and between start of first grade and end of first grade. We found five latent classes to exist in different proportions at different times: LAK, EPP, APP, EWR, and ERe. Given these five classes and the analysis available to us, we were able to calculate transition probabilities for the full sample and separately for children living in poverty and for those not living in poverty."}, {"section_title": "Contributions of This Study", "text": "Givenmeasures of alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness, decoding, and sentence-level reading comprehension during kindergarten and first Note. Response probabilities are for passed items. Response probabilities for failed items can be computed from 1 -probability (pass).

Namely, literacy knowledge advances from letter recognition to sensitivity to beginning sounds and their graphemes, to sensitivity to ending sounds and their graphemes, to word reading, and to sentence-level comprehension during the fIrst 2 years of school. The testing protocol allowed for different patterns, namely that individuals could be successful in more diffIcult tasks without success on easier ones, but inspection of Table 2 indicates that there was very little variation in performance. Given four different time points, and fIve different measures, our analysis produced fIve stable latent classes. Within each class, the relationships among the variables of interest were fairly stable; high probability of passing the beginning sounds task was achieved only after mastery of the alphabet knowledge task; high probability of passing the sight word task was achieved only after mastery of ending sounds; high probability of passing the WIC task was achieved only after mastery of all other tasks and only during fust grade. Only in the ERC class did mastery of more complex tasks not appear totally dependent on mastery of less complex ones for a small portion of the sample; however, in this class, mastery scores were nearly perfect for all indicators. This study provides estimates of the proportions of children with particular reading skill profIles at each of four important transition points:\nbeginning and end of kindergarten, and beginning and end of fIrst grade. At the beginning of kindergarten, relatively few individuals had suffIcient alphabet knowledge and phonological awareness to facilitate word reading; at the end of kindergarten and the beginning of fust grade, approximately 70% of these same individuals had attained at least APP; by the end of fIrst grade, 80% of the these individuals had attained at least EWR. In an era of high-stakes, assessment -driven school accountability, these are promising trends. However, a comparison of achievement by poverty level gives a different picture. At the start of kindergarten, more children living in low-SES households began reading instruction with LAK compared with their peers living above poverty; by the spring of kindergarten, 75% of children living above poverty had attained at least APP, whereas only 53% of their peers living below poverty had. In fall of fust grade, 43% of the cohort living above poverty were at EWR or ERC compared with 21% of the cohort living below poverty. By the end of fIrst grade, 87% of the cohort living above poverty were at least early word readers, whereas only 30% of their peers with fewer economic resources had achieved at that same level.\nThe transition probabilities for children above and below poverty are also compelling (see Table 5 ). Between fall and spring of kindergarten, children who enter kindergarten with at least EPP were relatively likely to progress, regardless of their poverty status. Unfortunately, the large number of children living below poverty and in the LAK class tended to make no movement even with a year's instruction. During the summer months, in the absence of instruction, the outlook for those children was also grim; 60% of the children in the low-alphabet-knowledge class who were above poverty maintained their latent class membership (but 40% moved), whereas 81 % of the children living below poverty maintained their latent class membership (with only 19% moving). In the fall of fIrst grade, children above poverty with at least APP were almost certain to progress beyond that level. However, children below poverty, beginning at that same status (APP) were unlikely to progress. In fact, the probability of .86 for the below-poverty cohort not to progress beyond APP by the end of fust grade harkens directly to Juel's (1988) finding that poor readers, especially those who leave kindergarten with weak phonological skills, tend not to experience success later. It appears that children living in poverty who start fIrst grade with APP but not EWR are much less likely to progress during STAGE-SEQUENTIAL READING TRANSITIONS 559 Osmond, and Maynard (2002) found that first graders with below-average reading achievement were equally likely to be either below average or average achievers in sixth grade; their initial low-achievement status was not necessarily maintained. The findings in this study that poverty moderates transition probabilities early in schooling can be used in combination with the large literature on interventions that target early reading achievement (e.g., Bus & van Ijzendoorn, 1999; Morris, Tyner, & Perney, 2000; Rashotte, MacPhee, & Torgesen, 2001; Torgesen, 2000; Torgesen, Morgan, & Davis, 1992; Vellutino et al., 1996; Vellutino & Scanlon, 2(02) and the policy-oriented focus on improving instruction during the primary school years (No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Specifically, schools implementing federally funded reform of instruction during kindergarten and first grade will be improving opportunities for reading acquisition by using instructional strategies and curriculum materials informed by the results of experimental studies of reading instruction. They will also be tracking individual student progress over time. Important questions could be answered within these cohorts. Given access to high-quality curriculum during kindergarten and first grade, what are the transition probabilities for children? Are they different for children living in poverty? To what extent? Latent transition analysis applied to assessment data for these new samples would yield important new information about literacy transitions for children receiving relatively similar instructional opportunities.\nGiven that these reform models typically rely on prevention-based classroom instruction and costly one-on-one tutoring or smaIl-group interventions, accurate identification of only those children whose success depends on this attention early in their schooling is essential from a resource-allocation stance. Our study suggests that timing matters, especially for children living in poverty. Between fall and spring of kindergarten and between spring of kindergarten and fall of first grade, children with LAK are unlikely to progress to more advanced understandings. That time, then, is an especially important one for testing the efficacy of interventions and their effect on these transitions. Similarly, all children are unlikely to make progress in their basic reading skills during the summer months between kindergarten and first grade; given this finding and the work of others on the importance of summer (e.g., Alexander et aI., 2(01), this is another time when the impact of intervention on children's literacy transitions might be explored. Finally, for those children who enter first grade with advanced phonemic awareness, children living in poverty are much less likely than their peers with more economic advantages to move to EWR or ERC; interventions which target the achievement of these children during the first -grade year may have profound effects on their literacy transitions.\nOther avenues for research include examinations of the impact of preschool on future literacy transitions, particularly for children living in poverty. In our study, we provide estimates of the relative size of membership in each of five latent classes for each of four time points (see Table  4 ). At the very outset of formal schooling, 13% of the individuals living in poverty in our cohort had already achieved APP, and these children had a high probability of transition to EWR during kindergarten. Explorations of the experiences of those children who come to school with advanced knowledge could inform interventions for children living in poverty during the preschool years."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "We acknowledge several limitations to this work, both substantive and methodological. In the substantive arena, we have not addressed all possible variables that might influence the characteristics of latent classes or the transition probabilities. Specifically, measures of naming speed have been reliably associated with literacy achievement, both for struggling beginning readers and for poor children (e.g., Hecht, Burgess, Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 2000; Schatschneider et al., 2004; Torgesen & Davis, 1992) ; those data were not available to us. Additionally, we investigate reading development in the first years of school without addressing the instructional context. Although the data set is large and includes individuals from many schools, we do not account for the different instructional opportunities presented to these children in our analyses. In fact, a recent study that used the ECLS data set did find that teacher reports about the content of their instruction during kindergarten were related to differential achievement outcomes, particularly when initial skills were included as variables (Xue & Meisels, 2004) .\nThere are three methodological limitations that we would like to acknowledge. First, we have opted to code missing data, particularly on the word recognition in context task, as failure. We made this decision to count these as failures given our assumption that the accomplishments measured in the ECLS-K data set are successive, and, therefore, an ambiguous score on the most complex items was the same as a failure. Second, this work is descriptive. No statistical significance tests were used to compare differences among the latent transition probabilities. Given the number of possible significance tests that could have been performed, it was felt that the essential points of the this article would have been lost in trying to explain the myriad of significance tests. Instead, we simply reported the tests of overall model fit to the response frequencies. Third, we have assumed that there are no other covariates (observed or unobserved) that can explain differences in transition probabilities across poverty levels. A flexible feature of latent transition analysis is the incorporation of latent class covariates in the model. For example, suppose in addition to the observed poverty indicator, we added indicators of different behavior problems. In line with Equation A2 in the Appendix, these indicators can be used to form latent behavior problem classes. Those classes can be incorporated into the general model as shown in Equation AI. Indeed, our poverty status variable could have been incorporated in a single analysis, but difficulty with the convergence of the software program for such a large model forced us to treat poverty groups separately. This study, therefore, serves a pedagogical function in demonstrating the use of latent transition analysis. We encourage additional studies that draw on the full functionality of the methodology.\nWe estimated the parameters of the model in Equations Al and A2 in the WinLTA program (Collins, 2002) via the expectation maximization algorithm (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977 ) using a full information maximum likelihood approach to handle missing data, under the assumption that the missing data are missing completely at random or missing at random (Little & Rubin, 2002) . Model fit is assessed by comparing the observed response proportions against the response proportions predicted by the model. A likelihood ratio statistic is obtained that is asymptotically 563 distributed as chi-square. The degrees of freedom are calculated by subtracting the number of free parameters to be estimated from the total number of response patterns that are possible. Finally, the WinLTA program provides a likelihood ratio test of the null hypothesis that missing data are missing completely at random."}]
