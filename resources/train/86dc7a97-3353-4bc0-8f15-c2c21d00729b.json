[{"section_title": "| INTRODUC TI ON", "text": "Widespread population declines, range retractions, and extinctions highlight an urgent need to better understand drivers of wildlife population dynamics (Ceballos, Ehrlich, & Dirzo, 2017;Tittensor et al., 2014). Climate variation and trends can play a crucial role in determining population trajectories (Stephens et al., 2016). Most studies that relate climate to populations across large spatial extents are based on occurrence or count data (Dawson, Jackson, House, Prentice, & Mace, 2011;Pacifici et al., 2015). These data types have become relatively common and available across large spatial extents (Sullivan et al., 2009) and can be used to model both population state and demographic rate parameters (Dail & Madsen, 2011;Royle, 2004). However, estimates of demographic rates from such models may not always be reliable (Barker, Schofield, Link, & Sauer, 2018; Dennis, Morgan, & Ridout, 2015;Zipkin et al., 2014). Capturemark-recapture (CMR) data provide additional information for modeling demographic rates, providing a more mechanistic link between population dynamics and climate than models based on occurrence or count data alone (Amburgey et al., 2018;Buckley et al., 2010;McMahon et al., 2011;Selwood, McGeoch, & Mac Nally, 2015). However, CMR data are less available and are relatively costly to obtain across large spatial extents. Analyses that incorporate strengths of different data types and models have the potential to improve the inferences about population dynamics. Integrated population models (IPMs) provide a formal framework for jointly modeling independent count and CMR data (Besbeas, Freeman, Morgan, & Catchpole, 2002;Hostetler, Sillett, & Marra, 2015;Schaub & Abadi, 2011) along with climate predictors of demographic rates (Zipkin & Saunders, 2018). With one recent exception (Zhao, Boomer, & Royle, 2019), IPMs that have included climate covariates of demographic rates have been limited to population studies across relatively small spatial extents (Woodworth, Wheelwright, Newman, Schaub, & Norris, 2017) or have modeled multiple local populations independently (Weegman, Arnold, Dawson, Winkler, & Clark, 2017). Data from long-running national and continental scale avian monitoring programs (Dunn et al., 2005;Gregory et al., 2005;Robinson, Julliard, & Saracco, 2009;) present a unique opportunity for extending IPMs to broad-scale applications. However, development and application of IPMs for broadscale bird-monitoring data are challenging because of a variety of sampling issues, including mismatches in sizes and spatio-temporal distribution of sampling areas between monitoring data sets and properly accounting for observation error associated with multi-site, multi-observer studies (Ahrestani, Saracco, Sauer, Royle, & Pardieck, 2017;Robinson, Morrison, & Baillie, 2014). Additionally, IPMs developed for local scale studies based on binomial and Poisson population processes may not be appropriate at regional scales where population responses represent averages of local studies (Zhao et al., 2019). Analyses of broad-scale IPMs require spatial stratification at ecologically relevant scales. Stratification decisions may involve geopolitical boundaries that are meaningful in conservation applications (e.g., state \u00d7 bird conservation region; . One approach would be to stratify on as fine of a resolution as possible and model spatial structure explicitly (Bled, Sauer, Pardieck, Doherty, & Royle, 2013;Saracco, Royle, DeSante, & Gardner, 2010). This approach offers the advantage of allowing poststratification summaries across any larger spatial resolution of interest but can be computationally expensive. Alternatively, stratification may be based on natural spatial structuring of population dynamics (Rushing, Ryder, Scarpignato, Saracco, & Marra, 2016) or genetics (Ruegg, Harrigan, Saracco, Smith, & Taylor, unpublished data;Ruegg et al., 2014). Spatial structuring of migratory species may be maintained (strong migratory connectivity) or dissolved (weak connectivity) between breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Effectively linking environmental covariates to demography in these species requires understanding of spatial structuring throughout the annual cycle (Cohen et al., 2018;Ruegg et al., 2014) and consideration of potential \"carry-over effects,\" whereby environmental conditions experienced in one season affect demographic rates and population changes in a subsequent season (Norris & Marra, 2007). Here, we develop an IPM for data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS; Pardieck, Ziolkowski, Hudson, & Campbell, 2016)   is a good candidate for development of a climate-informed IPM, as it is well-represented in BBS and MAPS data sets in the western United States; its patterns of migratory connectivity are relatively well understood (Ruegg et al., 2014); its population has declined in recent decades (Sauer et al., 2017); and it has been designated as an \"at-risk\" species due to climate change (http://clima te.audub on.org/birds ). We included remote sensed and modeled climate covariates in models of demographic rates. We hypothesized that F I G U R E 1 Adult male Wilson's warbler in California's Sierra Nevada.

We used transient life table response experiments (LTREs) to decompose variation in population growth rates among vital rate and demographic structure components and to examine how these demographic contributions depended on climate covariates (Koons, Arnold, & Schaub, 2017;Koons, Iles, Schaub, & Caswell, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "| ME THODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Bird-monitoring data and focal species", "text": "Our analysis incorporates annual counts of adult birds from the BBS and capture-recapture data on adult birds and age-specific capture data from the MAPS program.

Although MAPS and BBS data were available from additional genetic breeding regions, we limited our analysis to just these three regions because other breeding populations regularly utilize wintering ranges farther south than our climate covariate data set extended (Wang, Hamann, Spittlehouse, & Carroll, 2016;Wang, Hamann, Spittlehouse, & Murdock, 2012).

We modeled n m,t at each time step as the sum of surviving adults from the previous year, s m,t and the number of recruits (local recruits + immigrants) entering the population between years, g m,t . For the initial time step (t = 1992), numbers of survivors and recruits were determined mainly by the count data and (weakly informative; see below) prior distributions. We modeled s m,t and g m,t at subsequent time steps based on Gaussian approximations of binomial and Poisson distributions, respectively (Zhao et al., 2019): are variance components of route \u00d7 observer and overdispersion effects . We calculated regional population trends as geometric means of the annual realized population growth rates (N m,t+1 N m,t ). For composite abundance and trend estimates, we weighted regional abundances by proportions of area encompassed by regions (Link & Sauer, 2002). The stratum-and year-specific adult survival probabilities, m,t (Equation 1), were informed by individual encounter history data from the MAPS program modeled using a state-space version of the Cormack-Jolly Seber model that accounts for transients (i.e., individuals with zero probability of recapture after the year of marking; Pradel, Hines, Lebreton, & Nichols, 1997) in the data set (Saracco et al., 2010; dashed red box in Figure 3). The model assumes that the \"alive state,\" z, of individual j in stratum m and time t is a Bernoulli process with the probability parameter equal to the product of the individual's residency state, R (0 = transient; 1 = resident), its alive state in time t \u2212 1 (0 = dead or permanently emigrated; 1 = alive and available for capture), and the apparent survival rate: We modeled residency state of newly marked individuals based on a Bernoulli distribution with residency probability parameter, m,t : , where first(j) indicates the year of marking for individual j. We defined a logit-linear model for m,t that allowed survival to vary as a function of a stratum-specific mean on logit scale (logit ( 0[m] )), the winter drought index, cmd m,t , the tailwind covariate, tw m,t , and a zero-mean random stratum-specific year effect, m,t : We defined an analogous logit-linear model for m,t with the exception that we did not include the climate covariates. For the stratum-specific year effects in both models, we allowed precision hyperparameters to be stratum-specific. We also developed models for the observation components of the MAPS CJS model. We modeled captures, c j,k,m,t at k = 1,\u2026, K stations as a function of the true alive state and recapture probability, p k : Specifically, we modeled the number of young (hatching year) birds captured, HY k,m,t , according to HY k,m,t \u223c Binom(pHY k,m,t ,Nind k,m,t ), where pHY k,m,t represents the probability of capturing a young bird and Nind k,m,t represents the total number of individual birds captured at station k in region m and year t.

We implemented the model with JAGS 3.3.0 (Plummer, 2003) using the jags function of the jagsUI package (Kellner, 2015) in the R statistical computing environment (R Core Team, 2018). We assigned vague uniform U(0, 1) prior distributions for inverse-logit transformed intercepts of models for parameters on 0-1 probability scales. Regression coefficients for fixed effects of linear models were modeled with Norm(0, 10 -3 ) priors, and standard deviation hyperparameters were modeled with U(0, 10) priors.

We found relatively little evidence of a relationship between winter drought conditions and population change for the two California populations (Figure 7a,c). Nevertheless, differences in drought conditions between years did appear to be related to differences in population growth between years (Figure 7b,d). For example, transitions between severe drought conditions in winter 1993-1994 to more normal conditions in winter 1994-1995 corresponded to a noticeable increase in survival between the 1993 and 1994 survival intervals for the cca and sne regions and a significant population increase in the sne region during that interval (Figure 4). Return to drought conditions the following year was marked by survival declines in all three genetic groups. Contributions of annual changes in spring temperature to annual changes in population growth rate were relatively large for the sne (Figure 7e "}, {"section_title": "| D ISCUSS I ON", "text": "Integrated population models have gained wide usage in population ecology because they provide a cohesive framework for understanding demographic and environmental drivers of population change (Koons et al., 2017;Schaub & Abadi, 2011). However, these models have received little attention in applications that combine multiple independent surveys across broad spatial and temporal scales (Ahrestani et al., 2017;Robinson et al., 2014;Zhao, Boomer, & Kendall, 2018). The IPM presented here provides a flexible framework for these broad-scale multi-site applications by modeling the survival and recruitment processes as functions of continuous random variables, rather than as functions of binomial and poisson processes typical of most IPM applications. We follow Brintz, Fuentes, and Madsen (2018) and Zhao et al. (2019) by modeling the demographic processes based on a Gaussian approximations of binomial and Poisson models. Another option that we have found yielded similar results was to use gamma distributions with shape parameters determined by population state and rate parameters determined by the demographic rates. These approaches for continuous data provide a natural means of linking count and CMR data collected at different collections of sites at common regional scales. Use of discrete models in these situations (Ahrestani et al., 2017) can be problematic when average population counts are low for a region (e.g., at the periphery of the range as in our cca and sne regions) and susceptible to extinction. In this discrete model scenario, a separate immigration parameter would be needed to allow for regional recovery (Abadi, Gimenez, Ullrich, Arlettaz, & Schaub, 2010;Hostetler & Chandler, 2015;Schaub & Fletcher, 2015;Schaub, Jakober, & Stauber, 2013). However, as in our application, scales of local and external recruitment are not always clear, and introducing this parameter creates additional latency that can complicate or preclude reliable estimation. Given already low precision of estimates for many of the fully time-specific parameters in our model, particularly for the sne and cca populations for which we had relatively few data, it would be difficult to justify this additional complication. Despite low precision of recruitment estimates, our results suggested that greater variation in productivity and recruitment than in adult survival, and that recruitment played a much larger role in explaining annual variation in population change than did adult survival. These findings are likely due, in part, to discrepancies between MAPS and BBS data sets, which differ in sizes and spatio-temporal   (Link & Barker, 2005;Royle & Dorazio, 2008) could be incorporated to inform recruitment directly. However, we have found these models impractical with large data sets due to long computation times, especially whenever capture probabilities are low (as in our example) because of the necessary addition of large numbers of additional all-zero capture histories. Reverse-symmetry models based on site-level data summaries could also be used (Pradel, 1996;Tenan et al., 2014); however, we have encountered long implementation times with these models and difficulty achieving convergence when there are large numbers of missing site \u00d7 year combinations. We linked demographic parameters to climate covariates that will be impacted by climate change. Spring winds have been shown to affect survival in other passerine birds (Drake et al., 2014;Huang et al., 2017); however, we found no evidence of spring wind effects on these three Wilson's warbler groups. It is possible that our wind covariate did not properly capture migration conditions due to how migration regions were delineated or that mean tailwind conditions across the entire migration period was not an appropriate metric. However, similar measures, such as number of days with positive tailwind, were strongly correlated with mean tailwind, suggesting that, if wind were an important predictor of survival, we might have detected it. It should be noted, however, that across our study regions, spring tailwinds tend to be negative (i.e., they are headwinds), particularly along the coast. Because of increased coastal upwelling, these winds are predicted to become more negative (i.e., stronger northerly) under climate change (Sydeman et al., 2014), which will likely exacerbate the potential for a negative effects of headwinds on survival in the coming decades. We did find significant negative effects of winter drought conditions on adult apparent survival for the California populations. It is possible that drought conditions typical of late summers in California (prior to fall migration) could leave these populations more vulnerable to drought on their wintering grounds than populations of the Pacific Northwest that do not normally experience pronounced late summer drought.

The pnw population (left) is represented by blue squares, the sna population (middle) by orange circles, and the cca population (right) by green triangles. Recruitment parameters (RI and ; gray region) contributed substantially more to explaining annual variation than did adult survival ( ; white region) drought conditions are expected to worsen in western Mexico under climate change scenarios, where these genetic groups of Wilson's warbler overwinter (Trenberth et al., 2013). Although our results suggested that adult apparent survival contributed less to overall population trends than recruitment, conserving and managing for drought-resilience habitats will nevertheless likely be an important component of any conservation plan for these populations. Our analysis incorporated age-specific capture data to model postfledging productivity, which allows assessment of relative contributions of reproductive output and first-year survival and immigration to recruitment and population change. Although we found no evidence of winter drought carry-over effects on productivity, we did find population-specific effects of spring temperature on productivity: Productivity of populations in the montane (sne) and northerly (pnw) regions increased with increasing spring temperature. This finding is consistent with results of multi-species productivity models applied to MAPS data within the sne region (Saracco et al., 2019). Productivity was an important contributor to annual variation in population change. For the sne and pnw populations, negative changes in spring temperatures between years tended to result in negative contributions to between-year changes in population growth, while years with increases in temperature over the previous year tended to yield positive contributions of productivity to changes in population growth. It should be noted, however, that there was some indication that positive temperature effects declined at larger between-year spring temperature increases (~>1\u00b0C increases), which may have implications under an increasingly variable and warming environment. Large-scale multi-site surveys have long played an important role in advancing ecology and conservation (Buckland, Magurran, Green, & Fewster, 2005;Magurran et al., 2016).  Tittensor et al., 2014). Although we do not explore predictions of future populations here, by extending the time series of our model into the future, extinction risk for each of the genetic groups could be assessed based on predicted time series of future climate covariate values and estimates of mean demographic rates and demographic stochasticity (our hierarchical region-specific estimates of annual variation). Such analyses could assist in weighing the potential effectiveness of various conservation actions in the context of environmental trends and variation (Boyce, Haridas, Lee, & The NCEAS Stochastic Demography Working Group, 2006;Lawson, Vindenes, Bailey, & van de Pol, 2015) and alternative conservation priorities (e.g., conservation of rare genetic lineages v. conservation of the most individuals; Ruegg et al., unpublished data)."}, {"section_title": "ACK N OWLED G M ENTS", "text": "We thank the many MAPS station operators and BBS volunteers for S.
