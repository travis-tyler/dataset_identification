Temperature and salinity observations are combined into 6 bimonthly time periods to balance both the spatial coverage and temporal resolution of the data during the year. Maps of near-surface and near-bottom property distributions are presented for each bimonthly period, and time series of regional average properties are discussed for 5 geographic regions spanning the shelf: western Gulf of Maine, eastern Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, and northern and southern Mid-Atlantic Bight. Overall, 2016 was characterized by warmer and more saline conditions than average across the region. Deep (slope) waters entering the Gulf of Maine were warmer and saltier than average, and their temperature and salinity suggest a subtropical source. Mixed layer-depths in the western Gulf of Maine were shallow during the winter of 2016, presumably a consequence of anomalously warm air temperatures that persisted over the northeastern United States during winter and suppressed winter convective overturning in the western Gulf of Maine. By contrast, during late summer, observations indicate that Gulf Stream warm core ring water intruded onto the shelf in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and through deep channels into the Gulf of Maine, leading to anomalous warming across the outer shelf off southern New England and in the deep basins of the Gulf of Maine. Such episodic events have the potential to cause significant changes in the ecosystem, including changes in nutrient availability on the shelf, the seasonal elimination of critical habitats such as the cold pool and shelf-slope front, disruption of seasonal migration cues, and an increase in the concentration of offshore larval fish on the shelf."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) conducts multiple surveys on the Northeast US (NEUS) Continental Shelf each year in support of its ongoing mission to monitor the shelf ecosystem and assess how its components influence the distribution, abundance, and productivity of living marine resources. In support of this mission, the NEFSC's Oceans and Climate Branch provides conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) instruments to NEFSC cruises for the measurement of water column profiles of temperature and salinity. In addition to providing oceanographic context to specific field programs, these data contribute to a growing database of historical measurements that are used to monitor seasonal and interannual variability in the water properties on the NEUS Continental Shelf. The NEFSC conducts multiple regionally focused and shelfwide surveys in the NEUS Continental Shelf every year. The shelfwide surveys collect hydrographic measurements at hundreds of randomly stratified stations from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to the Gulf of Maine. The NEFSC aims to achieve 6 full-shelf, hydrographic surveys per year -the minimum required to resolve the dominant seasonal cycle in this region. However, ship maintenance issues and reduced sea-day allocations led to the elimination or truncation of 3 of these 6 surveys in 2016. Roughly half the number of stations needed to achieve full coverage were occupied in 2016, and these were restricted to 3 seasons, leading to a critical loss of seasonal and spatial resolution. Here, we present an annual summary of the 2016 observations, including surface and bottom distributions of temperature and salinity and their anomalies computed relative to a consistent reference period. In addition, regional average values of temperature and salinity and their anomalies are computed for 5 different regions over the 3 bimonthly periods sampled. In the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB), the volume and properties of shelf water are specifically examined. Finally, a summary of basin-scale oceanographic and atmospheric conditions provides context to the in situ hydrographic observations."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": "The Oceans and Climate Branch provides CTD instrumentation and support to NEFSC programs. Training in instrument maintenance and operation, including deployment, data acquisition, recovery, and preliminary processing, is provided as needed prior to sailing. On NEFSC surveys, CTD instruments are typically deployed in 1 of 2 modes: (1) During a bongo net tow, an SBE 19plus SeaCAT Profiler 1 CTD instrument is mounted on the conducting wire above the bongo frame and data are collected as a double oblique profile with the ship steaming at approximately 2 knots. The sensors are not soaked at the surface prior to descent during bongo tows, rendering the upper 30 m or more of the downcast unreliable. For this reason, the upcast profile data are processed as the primary data for each station. (2) During a non-net cast, either an SBE 19plus SeaCAT CTD Profiler is mounted vertically on the wire or an SBE 911plus is deployed with an SBE 32 Carousel Water Sampler and up to 12 Niskin bottles. In the latter configuration, the CTD is oriented so that the intake is exposed to new water as it is lowered and so the downcast profiles are processed as the primary data for each station. The CTD sensors are soaked for 1 min at the surface prior to descent to allow for sensor equilibration and for the circulation pump to turn on. In SBE 911plus/SBE 32 deployments, water samples are often collected at discrete depths with the Niskin bottles. The water samples are captured on the upcast in order to avoid leakage and sample contamination, which can occur as the pressure increases with depth. Following community protocols, the CTD package is stopped for 30 sec at each sample depth before a bottle is closed in order to allow the package wake to dissipate, the bottles to flush and the surrounding water to equilibrate. The CTD remains stopped for another 10-15 sec after the bottle trip is confirmed to allow time for closure and to collect CTD data for comparison with the water sample data. Water samples are processed ashore for nutrients and carbonate chemistry. During 2016, hydrographic data were collected on 7 individual NEFSC cruises aboard the NOAA ships Henry B. Bigelow, Pisces, and Gordon Gunter, and the R/V HR Sharp by using a combination of Sea-Bird Electronics SBE 19plus SeaCAT profilers and SBE 911plus CTD units. All raw CTD profile data were processed and quality controlled ashore by using standard Sea-Bird Electronics protocols to produce 1-decibar averaged profiles. Water samples were collected up to twice daily at sea during vertical casts. Following each cruise, these samples were analyzed with a Guildline Autosal Laboratory Salinometer to calibrate the CTD salinity data. Following manufacturer recommended procedures, a slope correction was calculated based on comparisons between the CTD measured conductivity and salinometer results and were applied to the CTD measured conductivity before conversion back to salinity. Vertical density profiles were examined for inversions caused by bad conductivity or temperature readings and/or sensor misalignment. Egregious cases were replaced with a flag value. The processed hydrographic data were loaded into Oracle database tables and made publicly available via anonymous ftp (ftp://ftp.nefsc.noaa.gov/pub/hydro) and in the World Ocean Database archive managed by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Cruise reports have been prepared for each survey listed in Table  1 and are available online (http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/epd/oceanography/). Readers are referred to the individual cruise reports for notes, property maps, and aggregate data specific to a particular survey. Here, we provide an overview of the hydrographic sampling conducted in 2016 and characterize the oceanographic conditions that were observed. The processed CTD data have been sorted into 2-month time bins to balance both the spatial coverage and temporal resolution of the data. Maps of near-surface and near-bottom temperature and salinity have been produced from profile data falling within each bimonthly period. Surface fields include the shallowest observed temperature/salinity at each station that is also in the upper 5 m of the water column, while bottom maps include the deepest observation at each station that also falls within 10 m of the reported water depth. Average values have been computed from the data within 5 regions spanning the NEUS Continental Shelf to examine the spatial and temporal variability over broader areas of the shelf (Figure 1). Regional averages have been computed for the bimonthly-binned fields (Tables  2 -3) and for individual cruises (Appendix Tables 1-5). Anomalies were calculated at each station relative to a 1977-1987 reference period to characterize variability that is not related to seasonal forcing. During the reference period the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Marine Resources Monitoring and Prediction (MARMAP) program repeatedly occupied stations spanning the entire NEUS Continental Shelf allowing construction of annual cycles for water properties across all regions of the shelf (Mountain et al. 2004;Mountain and Holzwarth-Davis 1989). The anomalies presented here are defined as the difference between the observed 2016 value at individual stations and the expected value for each location and time of year based on this reference period. Regional anomalies are the area-weighted average of these anomalies within a given domain. The methods used and an explanation of uncertainties are presented in Holzwarth-Davis and Mountain (1990). The temperature, salinity, and volume of the shelf water in the MAB during 2016 were calculated and compared to the conditions observed during the MARMAP reference period. According to Mountain (2003), the shelf water mass is defined as water within the upper 100 m having salinity less than 34. For each survey in 2016, the area of a subregion was apportioned among its stations by an inverse distance-squared weighting. The shelf water volume at a given station is the thickness of the shelf water at the station multiplied by its apportioned area, and the total shelf water volume within the subregion is the sum of these products for all stations within the region. Similarly, the average temperature and salinity was calculated in the shelf water layer at each station and multiplied by the total shelf water volume for that station. The sum of these products over all stations within a given subregion divided by the total shelf water volume for the region determines the volume-weighted average temperature and salinity. Anomalies in the property and volume of the shelf water mass are calculated relative to like variables derived from MARMAP hydrographic data, as described above. Hence, here regional anomalies are computed as the mathematical difference between regional averages, not an average of the anomalies computed for a given subregion."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hydrographic Conditions in 2016", "text": "During 2016, hydrographic data were collected on 7 individual NEFSC cruises, amounting to 1382 profiles of temperature and salinity (Table 1). Despite the bimonthly binning of observations, significant gaps remain in several of the bimonthly periods shown in Figure 2a. This reflects an overall reduction in stations occupied in 2016 relative to previous years ( Figure 2b). No sampling occurred in January-February, and only limited sampling occurred in March-April and November-December because of persistent vessel maintenance issues involving multiple vessels and reduced allocation of days at sea. The NOAA Ship Henry B. Bigelow remained in port for extended maintenance resulting in the cancellation of the February Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) Survey and a significant delay in the start of the Spring Bottom Trawl survey. Together, this left a significant gap in sampling coverage during winter this year. The shift in the trawl survey schedule necessitated moving the May/June EcoMon Survey from NOAA Ship Henry B. Bigelow to NOAA Ship Gordon Gunter, resulting in a truncated survey because of limited vessel availability and slower cruising speeds. The October/November EcoMon Survey returned to port after just 1 day of sampling when the NOAA Ship Pisces developed serious problems with its main propulsion generator. Combined, 2016 saw a significant reduction in sampling, with only 3 surveys sampling the entire shelf and a critical loss of seasonal resolution. The large gaps in station coverage preclude the calculation of a true area-weighted regional average surface/bottom temperature and salinity in several regions (Tables 2 -3; Figures 3 -4). Relative to historical values, regional ocean temperatures across the NEUS Continental Shelf were warm during 2016 ( Figure 3). Annually, waters were between 1.0-1.9\u00b0C warmer than normal everywhere, with the largest anomalies occurring in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank (Table 2; Figure 3). Of the seasons sampled, warm anomalies were most pronounced between summer and fall on Georges Bank and in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, where regional temperature anomalies approached 3\u00b0C all the way to the bottom. Notable warm anomalies were also observed during spring in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, where near-bottom temperature anomalies exceeded surface values by close to 1\u00b0C. Annually, surface waters were saltier than normal in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and near normal in the Gulf of Maine and on Georges Bank (Figure 4). Notably large positive anomalies in salinity were observed during spring in the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight and during fall in the northern Mid-Atlantic Bight and on Georges Bank (Table 3; Figure 4). Near the bottom, anomalies were modulated compared to upper layers, with near-normal conditions observed annually. The total volume of shelf water in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, defined as waters having salinity less than 34, was notably reduced during fall in the northern Mid-Atlantic Bight relative to the MARMAP period ( Figure 5). While the shelf water mass was warmer than normal, reflective of broader regional conditions, its salinity remained near normal in the northern Mid-Atlantic Bight ( Figure 5). This pattern suggests that the anomalously salty conditions observed in the northern Mid-Atlantic Bight during fall ( Figure 4) are reflective of a different water mass moving into the region, consistent with a significant shoreward movement of the shelf/slope front. This feature marks the transition between colder/fresher shelf water onshore and warmer/saltier slope water offshore. Bimonthly surface and bottom property-distribution maps reveal details related to the regional averages in Figures 3 and 4, although temporal continuity suffers from reduced sampling ( Figures 6-9). The bimonthly property maps show that regional warm anomalies observed at the surface during September-October ( Figure 3) were concentrated near the shelf edge south of Georges Bank and Cape Cod, MA (Figure 9b). Warm anomalies were observed at the bottom, underlying the surface maximums, and enhanced warmth was also observed along the length of the inner shelf into the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight (Figure 9b). Large regional salinity anomalies observed at the surface in the Mid-Atlantic Bight during spring and fall ( Figure 4) are reflective of enhanced positive anomalies aligned with regions of warmer water along the shelf edge in the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight during March-April ( Figure 6b) and in the northern Mid-Atlantic Bight during September-October (Figure 9b). Synoptically, while the large regional salinity anomalies observed at the surface in the Mid-Atlantic Bight during fall were strongest near the shelf edge ( Figure 9b), a tongue of saline water extended inshore between Georges Bank and the eastern tip of Long Island, NY. The salinity within this shoreward protrusion was > 34, suggesting that the anomaly was caused by an intrusion of slope waters onto the shelf (Figure 9a). Satellite derived observations of sea surface temperature indicate that several large amplitude Gulf Stream meanders and warm core rings impinged on the shelf during this time, with evidence of ring water observed well inshore of the shelf edge ( Figure  10). The intrusion of warm, salty, ring water onto the shelf coincides with a notable decrease in the areal extent and an increase in temperature of the Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool (Figure 9a). The Cold Pool, evident in bottom temperature fields in Figure 8a, is formed seasonally when a remnant of cold, winter-mixed water is trapped near the bottom, capped by the warming of surface waters in spring. The feature is typically eroded through a combination of continued atmospheric heating, progressively penetrating the near shore water column, and with the onset of fall storms in November. However, the intrusion of Gulf Stream ring water appears to have led to an accelerated erosion of this important feature. Deep inflow to the Gulf of Maine through the Northeast Channel continues to be dominated by Warm Slope Water (Figure 11). Correspondingly, observations from the deep basins in the eastern Gulf of Maine are reflective of this pattern, with bottom waters measuring warmer and more saline than normal (Figure 12). The influence of Gulf Stream Warm Core rings was also evident in the Northeast Channel during June, as a tongue of very warm, saline water protruded into the channel at mid-depth ( Figure 12). Springtime temperature-salinity and temperature-depth profiles indicate the presence of a weak Cold Intermediate Layer in the western Gulf of Maine during spring 2016, a mid-depth water mass formed seasonally as a product of convective mixing driven by winter cooling (Figures 13 -14). In fact, the remnant winter water in the Cold Intermediate Layer is over 1.5\u00b0C warmer and slightly fresher than average in 2016, suggesting that convective mixing was suppressed in the preceding winter ( Figure 13). Correspondingly, the bottom water observed in Wilkinson Basin is cooler and fresher than average (Figures 12 and 14). This finding is not surprising considering the fact that air temperatures over the Northeastern United States were more than 2\u00b0C warmer than normal in winter 2016 ( Figure 15). Vertical mixing during winter is an important process in the Western Gulf of Maine. Deeper mixing has greater potential to tap into nutrient-rich slope water at depth, resulting in a thicker intermediate layer during spring, both potentially having an impact on the timing and intensity of spring phytoplankton blooms."}, {"section_title": "Basin-scale Conditions in 2016", "text": "During 2016, surface air temperatures were warmer than average (1981-2010) everywhere but the central basin during winter, summer, and fall ( Figure 15). During spring, an area of colder air temperatures extended from the central basin over northern North America and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Figure 15). Overall, the seasonal range of regional average air temperatures over the northeastern United States and adjoining shelf was near normal. Sea surface temperature mirrored these patterns, with cooler than average sea surface temperature in the central basin and Labrador Sea during winter/spring and persistent warmer than average temperatures over the NEUS Continental Shelf throughout the year (Figure 16). Annually, the magnitude of the warming was comparable to that observed in the 1950s; however, 2016 was characterized by enhanced warming in summer and fall ( Figure 17). It has been suggested that an index measuring the atmospheric sea level pressure difference between Iceland and the Azores is a reliable indicator of atmospheric conditions and oceanic response in the North Atlantic. The so-called North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has been related (with lags) to the intensity, frequency, and pathway of storms crossing the North Atlantic; the intensity of westerly winds; the depth of convection and amount of sea ice in the Labrador Basin; the temperature and salinity of waters on the Canadian and US Continental Shelves; and the position of the north wall of the Gulf Stream (e.g., Visbeck et al. 2003;Petrie 2007). The NAO index was positive for the third consecutive year during the winter of 2016, indicative of a deepening of the Icelandic low and a strengthening of the Azores' high ( Figure 18). A positive NAO is typically associated with stronger northwesterly winds over the shelves, warmer bottom waters in the Gulf of Maine, a northward shift in the Gulf Stream, and a predominance of warm slope water in the Northeast Channel (Petrie 2007;Mountain 2012;Joyce et al. 2000)."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "\u2022 Observations indicate that ocean temperatures on the NEUS shelf continue to increase relative to the 1977-1987 baseline. \u2022 An intrusion of Gulf Stream ring water in the Mid-Atlantic Bight contributed to enhanced warming and salinification in late-summer/early-fall and probably led to erosion of the Cold Pool. \u2022 Anomalously warm winter air temperatures over the Northeastern United States suppressed deep convective mixing in the western Gulf of Maine, resulting in a warmer intermediate water mass. \u2022 Slope waters entering the Gulf of Maine through the Northeast Channel were anomalously warm and salty, consistent with the properties characteristic of Warm Slope Water derived from subtropical origins.
