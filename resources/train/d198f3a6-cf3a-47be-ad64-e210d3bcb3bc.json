It has been estimated that 35.6 million people lived with dementia worldwide in 2010 and that AD accounts for about 60-80% of these cases [1] . Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) have mild but measurable changes in cognitive abilities, especially executive memory, which is considered a prodromal stage of AD [2] when supported by the presence of abnormal biomarkers. The rate of progression from aMCI to AD is up to 10% per year [3] . In an aging society, early detection as well as early therapy is widely considered to be an important goal for researchers. Therefore, aMCI is an important clinical group in which to study longitudinal changes associated with the development of AD.\nThe emerging criteria for diagnosis of AD require the presence of an appropriate clinical AD phenotype together with one or more pathophysiological biomarker(s) consistent with the presence of AD pathology [4] [5] [6] . Biomarkers that can be utilized as surrogate markers of underlying pathological change have become of central importance for detection of early and preclinical AD. Efforts have been made by researchers worldwide to identify and validate different biomarkers for the early diagnosis and/or prediction of progression from MCI to AD, including positron emission tomography (PET) imaging ligands, archetypically Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), which bind to amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424), PET imaging with 18 F-FDG to measure local glucose metabolism [7] [8] [9] [10] , structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical biomarkers, especially A\u2424 , total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau 181 ) either alone, or in combination with imaging and CSF biomarkers [11] [12] [13] [14] . It has been reported that the combination of increased CSF concentrations of t-tau or p-tau 181 and decreased concentration of A\u2424 improves sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of AD, and that these markers are predictive of future conversion from MCI to AD [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, both PET imaging and CSF biomarkers have only had limited use in population-based screening, because they are invasive and relatively expensive. Therefore, blood-based biomarkers are needed to develop more affordable and more widely accessible diagnostic and prognostic tests.\nGenetic markers may facilitate improved methods for early detection and for patient segmentation, as well as illuminating potential therapeutic avenues. Mutations have been identified in genes that encode the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS1), and presenilin-2 (PS2) in familial AD [19] . In sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD), presence of alleles encoding the apolipoprotein E4 isoform (ApoE4) is a strong risk factor associated with AD [20, 21] . Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants in genes PLD3, CD2AP, CD33, MS4A/MS4A6E, and EPHA1 as novel candidates associated with LOAD diagnosis [22, 23] and other GWASs have identified variants in PPP3R1 and MAPT as associated with progression of AD [24] . However, genetic variants discovered by single-locus based GWAS typically identified variants with small effects sizes in their association with the phenotype, here AD or AD progression, and therefore the individual SNPs do not by themselves constitute potent biomarkers for disease diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Multivariate panels of genetic variants may, however, provide more powerful means for diagnostic and prognostic applications. To the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have reported multivariate panels of SNPs for prediction of progression from MCI to AD. Moreover, there is relatively little knowledge about diagnostic accuracy and marker selection in ApoE4-negative patients specifically. A recent study reported that use of CSF biomarkers as a predictor of conversion from MCI to AD performed better in ApoE4-negative subjects than ApoE4-positive subjects [25] . To address these questions, we conducted an integrated analytic approach to search for predictive genetic markers as surrogate markers of CSF biomarkers aimed at improving the possibility to predict progression from MCI to AD alongside APOE 4 status.\nIn our present study, our strategy was to identify significant pathway-related SNPs derived from GWAS findings, and to construct a multivariate predictive model with selected pathway-related SNPs. We initially applied a GWAS approach to identify common genetic polymorphisms with the strongest association with each one of four quantitative traits, t-tau, p-tau 181 levels, and the two ratios t-tau/A\u2424 1-42 and p-tau 181 /A\u2424 , representing progression/conversion from MCI to AD. Due to limited statistical power as well as limitation of a single-locus analysis approach which may lead to false negatives in respect to SNPs contributing to joint genetic effects, we performed pathway enrichment analysis to select significant pathway-related genes/SNPs. Finally, we applied Random Forest (RF) [26] , a machine learning method, to determine a candidate panel of five SNPs with the ability to predict p-tau 181 /A\u2424 1-42 ratio level (high/low) in ApoE4-negative subjects."}, {"section_title": "MATERIAL AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitivity and specificity of markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.

The two major features of this software are assigning gene-based significance by accounting for high linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure and correcting the p-value according to marker density due to the gene size. By consideration of high LD structure (user-specified r 2 ) the software iteratively groups SNPs into clusters. Cluster estimation uses LD information to allow for associated markers beyond gene windows and reduces false positive hits by accounting for interdependence of SNPs. Thus, the most significant marker assigned to a specific gene can in turn reside outside of the specified gene boundaries. Two user-specified parameters in software included gene-boundary windows and the LD threshold, which parameters we defined as 1 kb upstream of transcription initiation sites to the end of the 3 UTR of the longest known splice form and r 2 > 0.8 for LD threshold, respectively.\nIn order to characterize the functional role of top genes in the list, and to identify significant pathwayrelated SNPs for further predictive models, the top three percent genes in each of the four gene lists converted from the four GWAS SNPs lists were used in pathway enrichment analysis with the public database Gene Ontology (GO) and the Ingenuity \u00ae pathway analysis. The hypergeometric test and right-tailed Fisher's Exact test to find over-represented pathways were applied to the output from GO and IPA, respectively. Due to the acyclic GO structure, hypergeometric tests were performed with consideration for the GO structure, such that tests were first performed for those terms with no child terms. Before testing the terms whose children had already been tested, all genes annotated as significant children from the parent's gene list were removed. This was continued until all terms had been tested. The analysis was restricted to gene sets containing 10-200 genes since small pathways can exhibit spurious phenotype associations due to large single locus effects, and large pathways are more likely to exhibit association by chance alone. Significant pathways were selected with p value \u22640.01. We note that ProxyGeneLD as used for conversion of SNPs to genes treated the high LD block as a single signal and chooses the p value of the best single marker (lowest p value in LD block) in that LD block for pre-adjustment significance level, which means that the same marker may be assigned to a number of genes in a high LD block and thus have the potential to inflate pathway enrichment analysis. To avoid this, we manually checked the significant pathway results from the enrichment analysis. If a significant pathway included several genes in a LD block, only one gene was selected at random and the enrichment analysis run again to test if the pathway was still significant.

The SNPs were encoded as 0, 1, and 2, by minor allele count, when used as predictors in the RF model. To jointly evaluate the prediction performance and optimize RF parameters, a nested (double) cross-validation strategy was applied (Fig. 2) ; the samples were randomly divided into one training set (71 samples) used in the innermost cycle for parameter optimization and one test set (10 samples) used in the outermost cycle for prediction performance assessment. This process was repeated for 50 random partitions of the samples into training and test sets. Within the inner cycle, a RF model was trained, consisting of 1000 trees. A variable importance (VI) score), Mean Decrease Accuracy, was calculated for all variables, and variables were ranked in descending order by VI score. Then, new models were constructed sequentially by stepwise addition of variables, one-ata-time, and prediction error rates were evaluated. An RF model was optimized, with minimum number of variables (SNPs) and smallest prediction error rate, using the cross-validation training set in each inner cross-validation round. For each outer cross-validation round the samples in the independent test set were classified into low and high level of p-tau 181 /A\u2424 1-42 ratio to assess prediction performance. The final prediction accuracy was calculated as the percentage of correctly classified samples across the 50 outer cross-validation rounds. The average of VI scores was calculated for each variable across the 50 iterations using training sets.\nFor selection of the most important variables, an overall VI score was calculated using the full set of samples.

It has been shown that DAG1 encoding protein alpha-dystroglycan exhibits higher levels in AD CSF as compared with normal subjects [36] . rs1143960 is representative for PDE1B (phosphodiesterase 1B, Calcium/calmodulindependent). rs1249963 is located in intergenic region of genome, but it is representative for PPP1R1A due to LD structure. rs11975968 is located in the intronic portion of PDE1C (phosphodiesterase 1C, calmodulindependent). rs4836493 is located in the intron region of gene CHSY3 (chondroitin sulfate synthase 3). PDE1B and PDE1C are members of the PDE1 family. PDE1 family is activated by the binding of calmodulin in the presence of Ca 2+ and is capable of acting on both cAMP and cGMP. PDE1 has several isoforms; PDE1B is expressed in brain and mainly in dopaminergic regions [37] . PDE1C is highly expressed in the heart, but also found in the CNS [38, 39] . PPP1R1A is involved in long-term potentiation of synapses (LTP). It has been shown that deficiency of this gene in mouse causes different degrees of impairment of LTP, indicating that these genes play a role in synaptic plasticity [40] . Bossers et al. showed that using Braak staging for neurofibrillary changes as an objective indicator of progression of AD, PPP1R1A expression was decreased in early Braak stages, followed by an increase in expression in later stages [41] . In summary, the genes identified in the model have face validity as potential modulators of calcium regulation and hence control of phosphorylation in neuronal signal transduction, and thus may contribute to the modulation of AD progression by interaction with pathways downstream from A\u2424. This study also suggests that pharmacological intervention at these targets may have future utility. In pathway enrichment analysis, proteoglycan biosynthesis was significantly associated with the ptau 181 and p-tau 181 /A\u2424 1-42 traits. It is known that proteoglycans are associated with amyloid deposition and it has been reported that heparin sulphate proteoglycans are involved in the pathogenesis of AD [42] . Furthermore, it has been shown that chondroitin sulphate-containing proteoglycan is found in senile plaques of human AD tissue [43] . NCAN (neurocan), CHSY3 (chondroitin sulfate synthase 3), and CHST7 (carbohydrate (N-acetylglucosamine 6-O) sulfotransferase 7) were associated with the \"proteoglycan biosynthetic process\" pathway. Interestingly, the pathway of telomere maintenance via semiconservative replication was significantly associated with p-tau 181 /A\u2424 . There is some evidence linking shortened telomeres to AD [44, 45] .\nIn this study, we investigated CSF biomarkers as predictors of conversion from MCI to AD, stratified by the presence of the APOE 4 allele. We observed that CSF biomarkers in ApoE4-negative subjects outperformed ApoE4-positive subjects in discriminating MCI-con and MCI-stable. Our observation is supported by data recently published by Apostolova et al. who showed that using CSF biomarker as a classifier to predict conversion from MCI to AD performed better in ApoE4-negative subjects than ApoE4-positive subjects [25] . One explanation based on our analysis is that there are significant differences in baseline levels of CSF biomarkers between MCI-con and MCI-stable in the ApoE4-negative group, while there is no significant difference between MCIcon and MCI-stable in ApoE4-positive group. We also observed that baseline levels of CSF t-tau, p-tau181, t-tau/A\u2424 , and p-tau 181 /A\u2424 were greater in the ApoE4-positive group as compared with the ApoE4-negative group. High CSF t-tau or p-tau 181 and low CSF A\u2424 are linked to the tau and A\u2424 pathologies of AD and APOE 4 is a strong risk factor for AD development.\nOne of the main aims of this study was to identify candidate genetic markers to predict CSF biomarkers in the context of progression from MCI to AD using an integrated analytics approach rather than single-locus based GWAS approach. Our results provided AUC estimated to 0.74 (p value = 0.01), suggesting that the RF model based on the candidate biomarker panel provides a means to discriminate between high and low ratio of p-tau 181 /A\u2424 1-42 in ApoE4-negative subjects. genes implicated by the identified predictive markers show moderate to strong protein expression in cerebral cortex, lateral ventricle, hippocampus or cerebellum, indicating that these genes might be correlated to CNS function. It is clear that additional work is required to replicate and validate the findings. Replication in additional cohorts and additional analysis to determine likely underlying functional variants to investigate the clinical, histological, and functional cell biological consequences of those changes are all warranted as objectives of further studies.\nA limitation of the current study is the small sample size of MCI subjects for GWAS analysis and present lack of an independent cohort for validation. We were limited to 177 subjects in ADNI1 that had CSF biomarkers data and so could be included into this model approach at the time of our study. Taking into account the known heterogeneity of the aMCI clinical diagnosis and the small effect size the comment genetic variants, we will have low power to detect genome-wide significant associations (p < 5 * 10 \u22127 ) of individual variants in the GWAS analysis using conventional Bonferroni multiple test correction. However, Bonferroni's method is overly conservative because the independence assumption does not hold due to the LD structure among SNPs. Therefore, the top-ranked GWAS SNPs were primarily used to identify significant pathways through pathway analysis. The reported top-ranked SNPs in this study should be considered as potential candidates for replication and validation in future studies. Future studies with potential for replication include ADNI-GO and ADNI-2, where early MCI subjects are being recruited and all patients in ADNI-2 undergo lumbar punctures for CSF data collection, which will increase sample size and statistical power. Moreover, the World Wide ADNI (WW-ADNI) consortium is actively developing broader collaboration efforts to contribute in this community. Large datasets from WW-ADNI are likely to be become available in the future and could provide more replication samples.\nDiagnostic criteria in the field of AD remain in development, and even advanced clinical AD remains a probable diagnosis that is not confirmable antemortem. Emerging guidelines suggest that the addition of one or two biomarkers to the clinical status would add value [4] , however, no genetic markers are yet validated in this context. Moreover, current biomarker methodologies are invasive and expensive (primarily lumbar puncture and PET imaging). Much attention is thus focused on the identification of less invasive alternatives. The identification of genetic signatures that can complement or even ultimately replace biochemical biomarkers in a diagnostic or prognostic scenario is thus a potential future avenue. Despite the limitation of sample size for this study as we discussed, the final SNP model is designed to demonstrate that a genetic signature panel can predict level of baseline biochemical biomarkers, which in turn are predictive of future conversion of MCI to AD. Hence, the marker panel identified in this study may have utility in screening and/or stratification for future treatments.
