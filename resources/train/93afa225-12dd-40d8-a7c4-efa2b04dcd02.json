[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Gender-typical educational choices and the \"glass ceiling\" are widely believed to explain why older women earn far less than observably similar men. Using large panels drawn from the National Science Foundation's (NSF) National Survey of College Graduates and other data representative of U.S. college graduates from the 1990s, the author documents the small role of personal choices and finds evidence contrary to the predictions of both human capital and discrimination models. Rather than the differential wage growth rates predicted by these models, she finds similar average rates of earnings growth for women and men across numerous specifications, which suggests that the gender gap in earnings is determined by factors already present early in the career. Her findings reveal slower earnings growth in only two subsets of women: young mothers, who experience slower earnings growth during the early career relative to men the same age, but then compensate with faster growth later in their careers; and women with exceptionally high earnings levels. The latter are underrepresented among workers winning the largest promotions, when compared to similarly successful men the same age, and face a glass ceiling at the very top of the career ladder."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "* Catherine J.

Other researchers use glass ceiling terminology to refer to barriers that slow the career progress of typical working women throughout their careers (Reskin and Padavic 1994) . All of these models predict that, on average, men experience faster earnings growth than women. A controversial model by Morgan (1998) predicted similar growth rates for women and men. 1 Piecing together evidence from the sparse data available at the time, the author reported that among engineers in the 1980s, women did not fall behind men of their cohort as they aged. Rather, she found that gender differentials in starting salaries were large among older cohorts, but small in later cohorts. The persistence of these cohort effects can fully explain the observed correlation between age and gender gaps in her data, even as gender gaps remain relatively constant within a given cohort of engineers over time (ibid.) . Under this \"cohort model,\" factors already apparent early in the career are an important determinant of later gender gaps in earnings.\nRecent work based on synthetic cohort data reveals that the cohort model describes U.S. labor markets well, not only among engineers, but also within representative samples of all college graduates (Weinberger and Joy 2007) or all full-time workers (Welch 2000; Weinberger and Kuhn 2010) . 2 However, several open questions cannot be answered without panel data following large numbers of individual workers-both young and old-over sufficiently long intervals of time: Are the patterns observed in synthetic cohort data similar to those observed in 1 This paper was published under the provocative topic heading \"Research Disputing Conventional Views on Gender\" and inspired a heated exchange in subsequent issues of the American Sociological Review between Alessio and Andrzejewski (2000) and Morgan (2000) . 2 A \"synthetic cohort\" compares a sample of individuals to a later sample of different individuals with the same range of birthdates. A synthetic cohort restricted to fulltime workers is subject to changes in composition across observations. This is especially true for women, who are less likely than men to work full-time continuously. Panel data allow a researcher to follow a fixed group of individuals over time.\nmatched panels with a fixed group of workers followed over time? How are the earnings growth rates of female college graduates related to contemporaneous family responsibilities over the life cycle? Moreover, are the patterns observed on average similar to those observed at different centiles of the earnings growth rate distribution, or of the earnings distribution? A high level of detail about college majors and higher degree attainment will also help to answer the following question: How much of the between-cohort improvement in women's relative earnings can be attributed to between-cohort changes in educational choices? The contribution of this research is to turn attention away from the size of the gender gap in earnings and toward understanding its evolution within each cohort of women over time.\nI combine information from several sources, including the nationally representative National Science Foundation (NSF) National Survey of College Graduates (with a short panel of annual earnings data from 1989 and 1993) and four panels drawn from the NSF SESTAT Surveys of scientists and engineers (with annual earnings from 1989-1999, or hourly earnings from 1989-1996) . The shortest panel represents U.S. college graduates and includes detailed information on income, college major, and higher degrees for more than 40,000 individuals who completed at least one college degree before the initial observation. The longer panels are selected subsets of the shorter panel, with the advantage of detailed data on contemporaneous family formation and labor force participation. In these panels, I measure earnings growth over a ten-year interval for nearly 2,000 women and 9,000 men, and over a seven-year interval for more than 4,000 women and 13,000 men.\nEarlier research has made it abundantly clear that women are less likely than men to choose the most remunerative technical college majors, a pattern that has persisted over time (Blau and Ferber 1986; Eide 1994; Brown and Corcoran 1997; Weinberger 1998 Weinberger , 1999 Weinberger , 2001 Carrell, Page, and West 2010) . In all previous cross-section studies, gender differences in college major choices explain a substantial portion of the gender gap in earnings among college graduates (Blau and Ferber 1986; Brown and Corcoran 1997; Weinberger 1998 Weinberger , 1999 Weinberger , 2001 Black et al. 2008) . However, little of the narrowing of the gender gap in pay among young college graduates between 1979 and 1986 can be explained by changes in the distribution of college majors (Datcher Loury 1997) . 1985 data reveal a gender gap in hourly earnings even among young full-time workers one to two years after college graduation, conditional on detailed college major, institution attended, and other factors (Weinberger 1998 (Weinberger , 1999 . This gap is present even before gender differences in family responsibilities or labor market experience begin to emerge. An even larger gender gap in earnings, conditional on college major, is evident among older college graduates (Weinberger and Joy 2007; Black et al. 2008) .\nPrevious research based on data from the National Survey of College Graduates utilizes the detailed information available in the base year cross-section to estimate the proportion of the gender wage gap due to usually unobserved dimensions of human capital, particularly actual labor market experience and the choice of college major (Black et al. 2008 ). However, the true impact of a retrospective measure of labor force experience is impossible to estimate in crosssection data. In a final footnote, the authors noted that \"it is possible that women who have high labor force attachment are disproportionately among the most talented women (along dimensions that are not measured in our data), and we may be therefore underestimating wage gaps for women generally when we focus on this group\" (ibid.: p. 656, fn 29). In other words, it is possible that labor force attachment and current earnings potential are jointly determined by factors that were already present when an individual entered the labor force-including both individual characteristics and features of the labor market at the time.\nTo gain a better understanding of the evolution of gender wage gaps, it is necessary to use panel data, following individuals over time. Only panel data permit evaluation of the relationship between each individual's earnings growth path and contemporaneous events affecting that individual, as well as meaningful comparison of a given cohort's gender wage gap at the outset versus the conclusion of a time interval."}, {"section_title": "Data and Measures", "text": "This study utilizes data from the 1993 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the National Science Foundation. The sample for the 1993 survey was drawn from 1990 Census respondents who indicated they were college graduates. 3 Responses to both the 1993 survey questions (including 1993 earnings) and selected 1990 Census questions (including 1989 income) are included in the NSCG panel, which is representative of all U.S.-born, full-time, full-year collegeeducated White workers aged 23-52 in 1989 (27-56 in 1993, 33-62 in 1999) . 4 A subsample of this panel is followed for ten years, 1989 years, -1999 years, . Follow-up surveys conducted in 1995 years, , 1997 years, , and 1999 as part of NSF's SESTAT system provide detailed information on labor force participation and family formation over the ten-year interval. From the group of individuals resurveyed in 1999, two panels are constructed. The smaller ten-year panel (which will be referred to as SESTAT-BA) is a representative sample of individuals with bachelor's degrees in a large number of selected majors. 5 The larger ten-year panel 3 More details are provided in the Data Appendix section. The author thanks Nirmala Kannankutty at the NSF National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics for her comprehensive explanation of the NSCG and SESTAT sampling frames. 4 The study is restricted to White workers born in the U.S. to avoid the confounding factors of betweencohort changes in racial discrimination and selection into immigrant status. Gender differences in college major choices and labor force participation are most pronounced among White graduates (Weinberger 1998; Weinberger and Joy 2007) . The sample is also restricted to individuals who earned a bachelor's degree by age 30, to improve comparability between the older and younger members of the sample. 5 The SESTAT-BA panel includes only individuals with no post-baccalaureate degrees and was sampled by the NSF based on college major (not necessarily occupation) in computer science, engineering, math, science, or social science, and restricted to individuals with no new college degrees after 1988. Everyone in this group was targeted to be included in each NSF resurvey.\n(which will be referred to as SESTAT-BA\u03e9) also includes individuals with higher degrees. These longer SESTAT panels include information on contemporaneous family responsibilities and labor force participation for 5,000 full-time workers with bachelor's degrees, and 10,000 full-time workers with bachelor's, master's, law, or medical degrees over the ten-year period 1989-1999. An even larger pair of panels, hSESTAT-BA and hSESTAT-BA\u03e9, describe 9,000 workers with bachelor's degrees and 17,000 workers with bachelor's, master's, law, or medical degrees over the seven-year period 1989-1996. The short NSCG panel follows 40,000 college graduates with all undergraduate majors, and all combinations of higher degrees, over the period 1989-1993. Because these surveys are not yet ubiquitous in the labor economics literature, some of the regression results are compared to those obtained using familiar Census samples (Ruggles et al. 2004) , and an extensive Data Appendix describes the properties of each of the five panels, both relative to each other and in comparison with better-known samples of college graduates.\nVariables used in this study include sex, age, educational attainment, college major, measures of labor force attachment, parenting status, and indicators of career progress. 6 Educational attainment as of 1988 (one year before the initial earnings observation) is based on complete educational histories collected in the 1993 survey. All panels are restricted to individuals who completed their education by 1988. Estimates of gender gaps in earnings levels include controls for the contemporaneous number of hours worked per week.\nThe measures of annual earnings growth used in the panel analysis are based on 1989 annual income matched with annual salary or income at a later point in time: annual salary of full-time workers as reported in the 1993 or 1999 follow-up surveys, or 1996 annual income of full-time, year-round workers 6 Sample means are reported in Appendix Tables A1  and A2. as reported in the 1997 follow-up survey."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "Hourly earnings growth is based on hourly earnings computed in 1989 and 1996 for all workers who reported working at least half the year either part-time or full-time. 8 To avoid measurement issues, most of the earnings growth analysis includes only individuals employed full-time at the time of observation. 9 Although this is not a representative sample of all employed workers, the full-time worker analysis does not completely miss the role of varying levels of labor force participation. For example, in the SE-STAT panel, 30% of the women employed full-time in both 1989 and 1999 did not work full-time over the entire ten-year period. My analysis can therefore discern differences in full-time earnings growth between those who worked full-time continuously versus those 7 As is true of most data made available to researchers, the exact income of very high earners is topcoded. Topcodes affect less than 1% of women and 4% of men in 1989 and 1993 observations, but they affect 3% of women and 5% of men in the 1999 observation of the SESTAT-BA bachelor's degree panel, and 4% of women and nearly 9% of men in the 1999 observation of the SESTAT-BA\u03e9 panel including master's degrees, doctors, and lawyers. The proportion varies across groups; for example, one-third of male doctors have topcoded 1989 earnings. In a simulation exercise toward the end of the paper, I bound the impact of topcoding on growth estimates. 8 Observations with annual full-time earnings reported to be less than $2,000 (in 1989 dollars), or hourly earnings computed to be less than $1 (in 1989 dollars), were dropped from the analysis. A small number of individuals with very low or very high earnings, about 1% of the sample, had their true 1993 earnings data replaced by $40,000 to protect confidentiality. In these cases, the imputed values convey absolutely no information about true 1993 earnings, so this group of individuals was dropped from the analysis of growth between 1989 and 1993. (Retaining this portion of the sample while assigning high earnings to all men in this category had very little impact on the results). Observable earnings range from $8,840 to $150,000 in 1993, and from $0 to $140,000 (topcoded) in 1989. In the 1989-1993 growth analysis, those with 1989 earnings below the inflationadjusted 1993 floor were dropped to avoid biasing growth estimates upward. Hourly earnings were computed as (annual income)/(hours per week*weeks per year), restricted to those who worked at least 26 weeks. 9 Part-time workers tend to earn less per hour, and the causal relationship between part-time work and earnings is not well understood. who did not. The most important advantage of this approach is that penalties for parttime work are not confounded with true earnings potential.\nExtensive robustness checks compare results based on growth in annual earnings among workers employed full-time in both 1989 and 1999 to those based on hourly earnings growth among workers employed either part-or full-time in both 1989 and 1996."}, {"section_title": "Gender Gaps by Age in a", "text": "Cross-Section Analysis The dependence of earnings on age is allowed the greatest possible flexibility, with a set of dummy variables spanning each of the 30 possible years of age. Therefore, the gender gap estimates (\u03b2 1 ,\u03b2 2 , and \u03b2 3 ) describe the average earnings of women in a given cohort relative to men exactly the same age. The specification of educational attainment varies from column to column of Table 1 as more detailed controls are included in successive regressions. Controls for broad categories of number of hours worked per week are added to account for the level of effort provided, conditional on working full-time. 10 In every Table 1 specification, the estimated values of all three gender coefficients (\u03b21,\u03b2 2 , and \u03b2 3 ) are negative and statistically significant at the .01 level, and the gender differential in the oldest cohort is three to four times larger than in the youngest.\nThe first two columns of Table 1 present estimates of gender wage gaps using representative samples of college graduates from the Census (column (1)) and the National Survey of College Graduates (column (2)). The estimates are very similar, confirming that these samples are truly comparable. 11 This cross-sectional analysis confirms that gender gaps are larger for the older cohorts, within the full representative sample of all White U.S.-born college-educated full-time workers in the 23-52 age range.\nColumns (3) and (4) of Table 1 introduce first broad and then detailed controls for pre-labor market credentials including majors, minors, and fields of graduate degrees. The more detailed controls explain only slightly more of the gender gap than the small number of broad controls, suggesting diminishing returns to incorporating even better controls for unobserved investments. It is worth noting that the coefficient estimates for the middle age-range of columns (2) and (4) estimates based on a nonparametric matching technique (Black et al. 2008) . 12 Specifications in columns (5)- (7) indicate the stability of the estimates to sample restrictions imposed in the 1989-1999 panels. In column (5), the samples are restricted to include only bachelor's level college graduates, and in columns (6) and (7), they are restricted to the SESTAT-BA and SESTAT-BA\u03e9 samples used in the ten-year panel analysis. 13 In all three of the restricted samples, the estimated gender gaps are quite similar to those for the full sample of all college-educated full-time full-year workers.\nIn each of the six specifications, the gender gap within the oldest cohort is at least three times as large as that in the youngest. Given the very limited ability of even highly detailed controls for types and levels of education to attenuate the inter-cohort differences in the gender wage gap, it seems unlikely that differences in the pre-labor market educational choices of women can explain why older cohorts of women face larger gaps. Further evidence that the relationship between age and the gender gap is not driven by changes in the composition of college majors over time is presented in Table 2 . Here, the cross-section regression described in Table 1 , column (5) is performed separately for each broad college major category. The same pattern emerges within nearly all fields. That is, gender gaps are small among young workers (no more than 12%) and larger among older workers (30-45%), with only two exceptions: computer science, in which gender gaps are small (or favor women) for all ages, and the predominantly female health professions, in which gender gaps are not much larger among older than younger women. These two exceptions in-12 Black et al. (2008, Table 5 , Panels A and B) used a proprietary version of the same data set and estimated the gender gap among White college graduates age 25-60 to be \u03ea0.282 with controls for age and level of highest degree (compared to the column (2) estimate \u03ea0.286 for age range 33-42), falling to \u03ea0.184 when controls for detailed field of degree were added (compared to the column (4) estimate \u03ea0.195 for age range 33-42). 13 Sample means for each subsample are presented in Appendix Table A2. volve less than 10% of the full sample. For the vast majority of bachelor's level college graduates, older women are confronted with far larger gender gaps than younger women with the same college major. Women's college major choices cannot explain why older cohorts of women earn so much less than similarly educated men."}, {"section_title": "Evolution of Gender Gaps as a Cohort Ages", "text": "The cross-section regressions of Tables 1  and 2 do not reveal whether the smaller gender gaps among younger workers will tend to grow as the cohort ages. There are two ways to address this issue. The first is to examine a later cross-section of the same group of workers, and the other is to estimate an earnings growth regression. Both of these approaches reveal that, except for the youngest workers, the estimated gender gaps do not grow as a cohort ages. Table 3 describes repeated cross-section regressions that follow the Table 1 , column (6) sample from 1989 to 1999. In this table, cohorts are followed diagonally; for example, the cohort aged 23-32 in 1989 is aged 33-42 in 1999, one row down and one column over. The repeated cross-section regressions of columns (1) and (2) include all full-time workers whereas those of columns (3) and (4) are restricted to the SESTAT-BA matched panel of workers employed fulltime in both 1989 and 1999. The two pairs of regressions can be compared to each other to facilitate understanding of patterns of selection into or out of the labor market over the ten-year interval. For example, the women included in the sample both years had similar 1989 earnings, and slightly higher 1999 earnings, than the full sample of women described in columns (1) and (2). This confirms that the larger gender gaps observed among older women in the cross-section are not due to the selective exit of highinitial-salary women from the full-time labor force. In fact, the opposite appears to be true. The low 1999 earnings levels among persistent older women were already anticipated by low 1989 earnings; faster earnings growth rates actually narrowed the gender gap within the matched panel of older women followed from 1989 to 1999. 14 I offer 14 Following individuals rather than cohorts (from column (3) to (4)) confirms that the career progress of the typical woman employed full-time in both 1989 and 1999 either matched or surpassed that of men, relative to analysis based on repeated cross-section data. However, this observation begs the question of whether this set of women (employed full-time in both 1989 and 1999) accurately represents the set of opportunities faced by the typical woman who might possibly enter the labor force. Of particular concern is the possibility that persistence to the 1999 observation might depend on the initial earnings growth trajectory as well as on the initial earnings level. Regressions presented in an explanation for this narrowing in a later section of the paper entitled \"Contemporaneous Factors and Gender Differences in Earnings Growth.\"\nReturning to the question of the role played by changing educational choices in the between-cohort narrowing of the gender earnings gap, columns (5) and (6) 3 add detailed educational attainment controls to the regressions of columns (3) and (4). Again, the gender gap confronting the oldest women remains two to three times as large as that confronting the youngest cohort of women in each year. Consistent with the evidence presented earlier, differences in educational choices cannot explain why the two older cohorts, aged 33-52 in 1989, faced larger wage gaps than the two younger cohorts, aged 33-52 in 1999. For example, women in the 33-42 age range in 1989 faced a 21% gap while women aged 33-42 in 1999 faced only a 12% gap, relative to men the same age with the same college major. As the 1989 cross-section results of Tables 1 and  2 have already suggested, differences in college major cannot explain why older cohorts of college-educated women faced larger gaps. Another way to illustrate the point that women's earnings grew at least as quickly as men's during this time period is to estimate an earnings growth regression. A simple specification is described here, with extensive robustness checks to follow below. Under the usual Mincer specification, the rate of earnings growth is decreasing in age (or work experience). Many other factors that affect earnings levels will be constant within individuals. Here I test the hypothesis that the rate of earnings growth is lower for women than for men, conditional on age, using the SESTAT-BA panel of bachelor's level college graduates employed full-time in both 1989 and 1999 (but not necessarily working full-time, or at all, in the years in between). This is the same sample used in Table 3 , columns (3)-(6). Measuring earnings growth as the annual average change in log earnings, 15 yields the following estimated relationship: (1) Growth \u03ed 0.001*female \u03ea 0.002 *(age-32) \u03e9 0.024 (0.002) (0.000)** (0.001)**\nThe positive coefficient on female suggests it is unlikely that the true rate of earnings growth is lower for women than men in this sample of college educated workers, employed full-time in both 1989 and 1999. 16 The robustness of the non-negative coefficient on \"female\" in the earnings growth regression is confirmed in numerous alternative specifications reported in Table 4a . In each column, a slightly different sample is used. Column (1) uses the same SESTAT-BA panel of bachelor's level graduates as Equation (1) above, estimating relative growth rates between 1989 and 1999, but with a more flexible specification of the relationship between age and the growth rate. Column (2) restricts to the subset of SESTAT-BA with a 1989-1993 growth measure available. Column (3) expands the sample to all NSCG panel observations eligible for inclusion in the column (2) sample, whether they persisted beyond the 1993 survey or not. Columns (4) -(5) are parallel to columns (1)-(2), but based on the more inclusive SESTAT-BA\u03e9 panel. In each of the first five specifications (1a through 5a), peryear growth in log annual earnings is estimated to be at least as large for women as for men the same age.\nThis result is not specific to the SESTAT samples but holds for representative samples of all U.S. college graduates as well. Column (6) uses the full NSCG panel of White college-educated workers employed full-time in both 1989 and 1993, including college graduates with all undergraduate majors, as well as those with post-baccalaureate degrees. income))/4. (Data are available for neither 1989 salary nor 1993 annual income, but a comparable annual income measure is available in 1996). Except where noted, growth regressions are unweighted.) 16 The rate of growth is actually somewhat higher for women, but the coefficient is very small relative to the constant term and is neither statistically nor economically significant. The gender coefficient is the same (0.001 with standard error 0.001) when age fixed effects are included, rather than a linear age term. See Table 4 . Column (7) removes the restriction to white graduates, and column (8) uses the parallel panel drawn from the PSID. The results in specifications 6a-8a, based on nationally representative samples of college graduates, are similar to those in the earlier specifications.\nSimilar results are evident in specifications 9a-14a of Table 4b , based on per-year growth between 1989 and 1996 in either annual or hourly earnings among either fulltime or both part-time and full-time workers. The gender growth coefficient is close to zero, or slightly positive, in each of these 14 panels. 17 Overall, a conservative interpretation of this robust set of results (1a-14a) is that the average rate of earnings growth was not lower for women than for men among college graduates in the 1990s.\nThe regressions displayed in the second portion of Tables 4a (specifications 1b-8b) and 4b (specifications 9b-14b) corroborate the robustness of another pattern observed in Table 3 . In some specifications, relative growth rates are lower among the youngest women, but older women's growth rates tend to be equal to or higher than men's among full-time workers the same age. 18 This pattern of faster growth among older women is consistent with supply-side human capital models in which women have more energy to devote to work or investment in skills towards the end of their child-rearing years (Becker 1985; Mincer and Polachek 1974; Polachek 1975; Weiss and Gronau 1981) , as well as with demand-based models in which 17 An additional control for \"Consistently Part-Time Worker\" in the column (9) and (12) specifications shows no tendency for this group to fall behind other women in hourly earnings growth. Restricting the remainder of the analysis to the full-time panels is therefore unlikely to overstate women's earnings growth rates. 18 Similar findings of rapid earnings growth among older women have been reported in many previous studies (Mincer and Polachek 1974; Polachek 1975; O'Neill and Polachek 1993; Blau and Kahn 2000; Weinberger and Kuhn 2010) . Note that Light and Ureta's (1995) careful study of earnings growth among very young workers includes only individuals age 24 in the initial observation, followed to their early 30s, and therefore corresponds to only a tiny portion of the youngest group in this study (age range 23-32 in the initial observation, followed to age range 33-42). 1989-1999 1989-1993 1989-1993 1989-1999 1989-1993 1989-1993 1989-1993 1990-1992 Notes: Sample: College graduates aged 23-52 employed full-time at the beginning and end of the indicated interval.

This finding is not consistent with explanations of older workers' gender wage gaps based on lower rates of human capital accumulation among women, nor with those based on the cumulative effects of discrimination leading to ever-widening gaps in earnings over the course of a career."}, {"section_title": "Evolution of Gender Gaps within Sub-sectors of the Labor Force", "text": "The \"glass ceiling\" imagery is so pervasive that it is worth exploring further to see whether it applies within some segments of the college-educated labor force. In this section I discuss numerous checks to explore whether women's earnings growth was equal to (or faster than) men's within different sub-sectors of the college educated labor market during the 1990s.\nRegressions presented in Table 5 confirm that women's earnings growth was at least as high as men's among college-educated workers with both bachelor's and higher degrees, and for women of all ages. The evennumbered columns of Table 5 show that estimated gender differences in earnings growth are not affected by inclusion of controls for field of highest degree. Table 6 further emphasizes the robustness of similar earnings growth rates for women and men, indicating that this is true in nearly all bachelor's degree fields (engineering, math or science, social sciences, business, humanities, education or health), as well as three popular professions (doctor, lawyer, and manager). In fact, the only case in which women's earnings did not keep pace with men's is among those with bachelor's degrees in computer science, a field with high wages and rapid earnings growth for both men and women during the early 1990s. 19 Table 6 shows, surprisingly, that even among lawyers, women in the NSCG sample had faster earnings growth than men. This finding seems to contradict the Wood, Corcoran and Courant (1993) study, which found a large, unexplained gender differential in 19 Earnings growth for both men and women in computer science was so rapid during this time that the youngest women in this group experienced faster growth than women (or men) in any other field. Also, note the very low gender differentials in earnings levels among computer science graduates estimated in Table 2. career progress favoring men among lawyers. However, further analysis with Census data solves the mystery. Table 7 displays crosssection earnings regressions using 1980, 1990, and 2000 Census data with the sample restricted to lawyers only. These reveal very different growth outcomes for the cohort of lawyers followed by Wood, Corcoran and Courant (1993) when compared to the cohort represented in the NSF NSCG data. Within the cohort of lawyers in their thirties during the 1980 Census, the gender gap tripled by the 1990 Census. Within the later cohort, who were in their thirties during the 1990 Census, the gender gap did not grow at all before the 2000 Census. Though the cohort model did not describe the labor mar- ket for lawyers in the 1980s, it seems to do so in the 1990s. The search for evidence of glass-ceiling-related differences in earnings growth will be resumed below, when I focus on differences among those at the very top of the earnings hierarchy."}, {"section_title": "Contemporaneous Factors and Gender Differences in Earnings Growth", "text": "In previous studies, researchers have tried to find reasons for women's lower earnings levels at a given age. My study is different. Here, I am attempting to understand why older women experience faster earnings growth than men or other women, despite their persistently low levels of average earnings. The first explanation that comes to mind is that older women have decreasing levels of parental responsibility and are therefore able to devote more hours and energy to work or to learning new skills (see Mincer and Polachek 1974) . Regressions displayed in Table 8 show that this type of explanation can account for most of older women's faster earnings growth. Table 8 , column (1) illustrates the now familiar pattern: small gender differences in earnings growth among younger workers and larger differentials favoring women among older workers. In column (2), controls are included for changes in hours worked per week between 1989 and 1999. There is virtually no change in the estimated gender coefficients. 20 There is also almost no effect when a control is included for labor force attachment between 1989 and 1999 (column (3)). 21 Stronger labor force 20 Note that whereas increasing hours is associated with a higher rate of earnings growth, decreasing hours by the same proportion appears to be associated with a more dramatically lower rate of earnings growth. This might be due to a kink or to measurement issues. Neither of these coefficients should be interpreted as a causal effect of hours on the rate of earnings growth. 21 This control takes the form of an indicator of whether the worker was employed full-time over the entire new parenting responsibility is statistically unrelated to the falling behind observed among the youngest women when individuals are followed over a ten-year interval. These findings strengthen the argument that differences in gender gaps established in the early part of the career play a dominant role in determining the gender gap in earnings throughout the career. Gender differences in contemporaneous measures of individual behavior absolutely do not predict growth in the average gender earnings gap between 1989 and 1999. 24 Another piece of evidence about the relationship between family responsibilities and the lower earnings of older women is presented in Table 9 , in which earnings growth rates are computed separately for mothers and non-mothers, relative to men the same age. 25 For both samples examined (SES-TAT-BA and hSESTAT-BA\u03e9), columns (1) - (3) show that earnings growth rates are statistically equal for non-mothers and men at every age, but that earnings growth is statistically faster among older mothers. The results for younger mothers are more nuanced. Hourly earnings growth is similar for young mothers, non-mothers, and men. Annual earnings growth is similar for young mothers and other women, but does fall behind that for men to a statistically significant degree. 26 In fact, the rate of earnings growth is fastest within the two groups of women least likely to have worked full-time over the entire 1989-1999 interval: mothers in the age ranges 33-42 or 43-52. Taking the longer view, columns (4) and (5) show that, over the course of a career, annual earnings growth is statistically equal for mothers, nonmothers, and men, whereas hourly earnings 24 The same set of regressions using the SESTAT-BA\u03e9 sample has nearly identical results. These are included in the longer version of the paper online (see footnote 14). 25 Here, mothers are defined as those who have children in any observation during the period 1989-1999. 26 There is not a statistically significant difference between the coefficients on \"mother\" and \"non-mother\" in the column (1) specification for the youngest women. Results are similar for the SESTAT-BA\u03e9 and hSESTAT-BA samples, for these please see the longer version of the paper online, mentioned in footnote 14. attachment has the expected positive correlation with earnings growth, but it cannot explain the observed pattern of gender differentials in earnings growth. In other words, although a correlation between labor force attachment and earnings growth can be detected, this relationship has little impact on the magnitude of the overall gender gap among full-time workers. Column (4) tests the hypothesis, suggested by Light and Ureta (1995) , that labor market interruptions have the greatest impact earlier in the career. The observed relationship suggests similar costs to early and late interruptions in this sample. Notably, the gender coefficients are not sensitive to this set of controls. Only one factor appears to explain a significant portion of the gender differential among older women: women who had children at home in 1989 but not in 1999 experienced particularly fast earnings growth over this period (column (5)). 22 In column (6), a more refined version of the \"empty nest\" specification suggests that, in addition to the fast growth seen when children leave home, a portion of older women's earnings growth can be attributed to children growing older (and presumably requiring less care). 23 After including this more complete set of controls for changes in family structure between 1989 and 1999, older women and men have nearly identical rates of earnings growth. Neither the column (5) nor the column (6) regressions estimate a statistically significant impact of becoming a new mother, conditional on returning to full-time work by 1999.\nDecreasing levels of parenting responsibility seems to contribute to the strong earnings growth among older women; however, 1989-1999 period versus observed working part-time or not at all in some intervening year. An interaction term between gender and \"not full-time all years\" has a coefficient that is not statistically different from zero. 22 Note that the commonly observed drop in earnings following childbirth apparently has only transitory effects, since those women who became mothers within this ten-year interval but then returned to full-time work had nearly the same average rate of earnings growth as non-mothers. 23 Means of the parenting responsibility variables, by cohort, are presented in the longer version of the paper online (see footnote 14).\ngrowth is similar for non-mothers and men but statistically higher for mothers. 27 Becoming a mother might tend to reduce hours or earnings growth temporarily among younger workers, but over time mothers more than catch up in earnings growth rates. Over the course of a career, differences cancel out to 27 Evidence presented in Weinberger and Kuhn (2010) suggests that the slopes of age-relative earnings trajectories are fairly stable across cohorts, even as relative earnings levels shift, so aggregating growth rates across cohorts can produce a meaningful statistic.\nyield growth rates among mothers that are comparable to, or even surpass, men's.\nAverage differentials in both levels and slopes of inflation-adjusted hourly earnings are described graphically in Figure 1 . The visual depiction clarifies that the differences in earnings growth rates between mothers, men, and other women are very small relative to the size of persistent gender gaps in earnings levels. Here, it is also evident that the size of the gender gap is much larger for the older cohorts, and that the rate of falling behind among young women is far too small to evolve into the magnitude of disadvantage faced by the members of the oldest cohort throughout their careers."}, {"section_title": "The Glass Ceiling at Last", "text": "The analysis presented so far provides strong evidence that the earnings potential of the typical woman does not fall farther behind that of the typical man as their careers progress. The glass ceiling metaphor sometimes refers, however, to gender differentials at the top rather than to those among typical workers. Evidence of a glass ceiling blocking women's entry into management is, in fact, evident in specific organizations (Strober and Jackman 1994; Ransom and Oaxaca 2005) . In this section, I describe evidence of gender differences in earnings growth among exceptionally well-paid workers. Even if very small numbers of women are involved, the consequences could be substantial if barriers block women's entry to particularly influential positions.\nIn a related study using panel data following a cohort of MBA graduates from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business (GSB), Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010) found that the average earnings of men grow far more quickly than the average earnings of women during the first ten years after MBA graduation. The detailed survey data set describing this highly selected sample is ideal for the purpose of understanding gender differentials in promotion to influential jobs. (To illustrate how highly selected the sample is relative to typical U.S. MBA graduates, only 5% of the nationally representative sample of MBAs described earlier in this paper earns more than the median salary of GSB MBA graduates, matched for age, gender and experience). 28 A key 28 Compared to the nationally representative samples of MBAs described in Table 6 , columns (9) and (10), both men and women in the GSB MBA sample work about ten hours more per week and earn substantially more money. After inflation-adjusting the GSB median earnings conditional on gender and years since MBA graduation (see Table 2 in Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz 2009), it is possible to estimate that, among those with no more than five years post-MBA experience, only 5% of men and 4% of women in the nationally representative samples of MBAs earn more than the median salary of GSB graduates, conditional on gender and experience. (In the larger sample of all college graduates with no more finding of the Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz study is that the gender differential in average earnings grows much more dramatically than the gender differential in median earnings, bolstering the view that a small subset of jobs at the very top of the earnings distribution plays an important role in women's lower earnings growth among GSB MBAs. The fact that these jobs confer high levels of status, power, and responsibility means that understanding the promotion process is important, even if the number of affected women is very small. than five years' experience beyond the highest degree, only 3% of men and 2% of women earn more than the median salary of GSB graduates, conditional on gender and experience). Interestingly, among MBA graduates with between six and nine years of experience, 4% of men but 13% of women in the nationally representative MBA sample earn more than the median salary of GSB graduates matched for gender and experience. This suggests that the earnings of female GSB graduates grow slowly relative to women with MBAs from less prestigious institutions, as well as relative to their male former classmates.\nThis observation leads to the hypothesis that glass ceiling effects might be observed among workers at the upper end of two different distributions: those simultaneously enjoying high salary levels and a high rate of earnings growth. Figure 2 displays the average 1989-1999 rate of earnings growth at different centiles of the growth rate distribution among women and men at each of the five quintiles of the 1995 salary distribution. 29 In Figure 2 , women's earnings growth rate exceeds men's in 23 of the 25 comparisons; the two exceptions are for the highest centiles of the growth distribution among workers with the highest earnings levels. This figure clearly shows that in the lower four quintiles of salary level, women enjoy higher growth 29 Salary level was measured using the 1995 observation because it is near the midpoint of the 1989-1999 interval. It is important to use an independent observation to determine the salary level, unaffected by any error in the 1989 or 1999 earnings measures used to compute the growth rate measure. upper bound on the average earnings of topcoded men) and using actual rather than topcoded 1989 earnings. 32 The results of this exercise show almost no change in estimated coefficients for the lower salary groups. However, in this thought experiment, both older and younger women at high salary levels are less likely than men with equally high salaries to receive large promotions. The estimated female*high salary interaction terms are statistically significant (and stronger than the corresponding Table 10 estimates) for all four columns among young women. 33 Among older women, this thought experiment produces statistically significant negative coefficients on female*high salary interaction terms at the 75 th , 85 th , and 95 th quantiles. 34 The truth likely lies somewhere in between this simulation and the Table 10 estimates, but this result suggests that estimates based on non-topcoded data would find glass-ceiling effects among older highachieving women. Meanwhile, the low prevalence of topcoded earnings among young workers leaves no question that young women with very high earnings for their age face a measurable disadvantage in future promotions relative to men the same age at the same salary level."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Avenues for Future Research", "text": "The highly visible CONSAD Report (2009) on the status of women in the U.S. labor force attributes the majority of the current gender earnings gap to women's choices, including gender-typical educational choices and the allocation of time between career development and family care. 32 A related simulation for comparison to Table 9 shows similar effects on mothers and non-mothers of all ages, slightly reducing estimates of earnings growth for all groups of women relative to men, with no change in patterns describing mothers relative to other women. 33 The estimated coefficients are \u03ea0.015 (0.005) at the 50th, \u03ea0.043 (0.006) at the 75th, \u03ea0.071 (0.010) at the 85th, and \u03ea0.090 (0.014) at the 95th quantiles. 34 The estimated coefficients are \u03ea0.024 (0.005) at the 75th, \u03ea0.041 (0.005) at the 85th, and \u03ea0.069 (0.016) at the 95 th quantiles.\nrates not just on average, but across the entire growth rate distribution. Among workers at very high salary levels, however, men appear to be disproportionately likely to earn the very largest promotions over a tenyear interval. Regressions displayed in Table  10 confirm the statistical significance of this relationship; at high salary levels, women are underrepresented among those earning the largest promotions. This relationship is statistically significant overall, and also for the subsample of younger workers (Table 10 , column (4), female*high salary interaction terms, specifications a-c). 30 In fact, it appears that the slower rate of growth observed earlier, on average, among young women is entirely confined to a small subset of young women with very high earnings levels. Figure 3 illustrates this result. Specification 4d indicates that older women with very high earnings are also underrepresented among those on the fastest growth paths in this sample of older workers, but this result is not statistically significant. Regardless of the level of statistical significance, the results based on older workers are only suggestive because a large fraction of the older men and women in the group with high 1995 salary have topcoded 1999 earnings. 31 Further investigation of this phenomenon will require large panels with nontopcoded earnings data.\nUntil an appropriate source of nontopcoded data is identified, some insight can be gained from a simple simulation. To bound the impact of topcoding on the Table  10 estimates, specifications (1c)-(4d) were estimated using a counterfactual earnings growth measure replacing topcoded men's 1999 earnings with twice the topcode (an 30 Specifications 1a -4a impose the assumption that the baseline age-earnings-growth profile shifts by a constant amount among workers with high salary, while 1b-4b allow a more flexible relationship between age, 1995 salary and the 1989-1999 growth rate. 31 In the 33-52 age group, about 40% of both men and women earning more than $85,000 per year in 1995 had topcoded earnings in 1999. (In fact, of the 653 individuals with topcoded earnings in the sample of 10,085, 60% were men aged 33-52 who earned more than $85,000 per year in 1995). Among both men and women with lower 1995 salaries, fewer than 2% faced 1999 topcodes. , 1989-1999. The research on which the Report is based, however, relies primarily on data that cannot elucidate the dynamic processes leading to adult earnings outcomes. In the research presented here, my analysis of large, rich panel data sets reveals the small role played by both pre-labor-market educational choices and contemporaneous family responsibilities in the evolution of the persistent, large gender gap among older workers as well as \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 the smaller, but equally persistent, gender gap among younger workers. Recent media reports have raised concerns about highly educated, successful career women who \"opt-out\" of the labor force to spend time caring for children, despite the absence of statistical evidence that this is a widespread phenomenon (Boushey 2005 (Boushey , 2008 . The evidence in this paper suggests that by the time they reach their 40s or 50s, highly educated mothers are as likely as other women the same age to participate in the labor force, to work full-time, and to be persistent labor force participants. In addition, older mothers are progressing in their careers at rates comparable to or even exceeding the career progress of women who have no children. However, this research shows that low relative earnings continue to affect older women, regardless of whether they are mothers. Mulligan and Rubinstein (2008) suggested that the older cohorts of employed women are more negatively selected on unobservable characteristics, resulting in low productivity and pay. It is difficult to reconcile this view with evidence presented here that even within groups quite homogeneous in educational attainment (such as college graduates with business degrees), the gender gap in earnings is at least three times as large when the older cohort is compared to the younger one. It seems unlikely that within nearly every academic field of study the best and brightest of the older cohort withdrew from the labor market. The Mulligan and Rubinstein model does not provide a credible description of changes over time within the labor market for college graduates.\nThis study presents evidence suggesting that women who appear poised to join the ranks of the highest paid workers are less likely than men with comparable early attainments to receive the largest promotions. This pattern seems to apply to all highly successful women, both mothers and non-mothers. However, further research based on large panels of non-topcoded data is required.\nOne overarching policy question is whether the between-cohort reduction in the gender earnings gap might be reversed if government policies are relaxed, or whether supply-side changes in women's choices and behaviors-including college major choices, pursuit of higher degrees, and the allocation of time between career development and and Women, 1989 and Women, -1999 Sample: SESTAT-BA+ Panel, White college graduates aged 23-32 in 1989, 33-42 in 1999, employed full-time in 1989, 1995, and 1999. family care-led to increased productivity and market-driven increases in women's pay. The evidence I have presented here suggests that between-cohort narrowing of the gender gap in pay was driven primarily by factors other than the observable choices or behaviors of individual women. Demandside increases in employers' preference for female workers, conditional on educational credentials, led to higher starting salaries among female recent college graduates. The reasons for this shift-whether the growing demand for women's labor was due to government policies, social change, or technological changes that enhanced the relative value of women's (extracurricular) skillsare not addressed by this research. What is clear is that the benefits associated with improved labor market opportunities persisted throughout the careers of younger cohorts, regardless of later patterns of family formation. An analysis of gender differences in earnings profiles by Weinberger and Kuhn (2010) covers a far longer time frame than the NSCG or SESTAT data used here. Using Census and CPS synthetic cohorts spanning 1960-2004 (and all education levels) , both the between-cohort shifts in the gender gap and a slight within-cohort narrowing of the gap as each cohort ages are shown to be long-standing patterns. The detailed panel data analysis presented in this paper follows individuals over time to rule out selective attrition as an explanation of the synthetic cohort results, and it clarifies that changes in early educational investments cannot explain the between-cohort shifts. These findings, taken together, point toward reevaluating traditional explanations for the existence and persistence of gender gaps in earnings, and for the tendency of gender gaps to be larger among older workers.\nThe finding that earnings growth rates are similar for men and women must be interpreted in the context of persistently lower levels of earnings for women of all cohorts. My study finds that, among college graduates in most fields, women in their 40s earn 30% to 45% less than observably similar men the same age, conditional on educational credentials and number of hours worked per week. As such, the unique contribution of my study is to document that, for the typical woman, this large gender gap in earnings seems to have very little to do with \"falling behind\" over the course of the career. Although there is evidence of some widening of the gender gap among young workers, it seems to be largely confined to the early years of a career. When followed over a longer time span, mothers tend to fall behind when young but experience a compensating burst of faster growth later in life. Non-mothers have earnings growth rates that are very close to men's throughout the career. This results in a lifetime rate of growth that is similar for mothers, women who are not mothers, and men. Therefore, the key issue to pursue is why young women tend to begin their careers earning so much less than men with similar educational credentials. A study of career dynamics among very young workers might be a particularly fruitful avenue for research to understand the underpinnings of persistent gender gaps in outcomes.\nIf the between-cohort shifts in the gender gap are not due to changes in women's college major or family choices, research focus must shift to the demand side. Regardless of whether driven by falling levels of discrimination or by technological change, a fully satisfying answer must explain not only why younger women enjoy higher relative wages but also why older women do not. I propose that one possible model consistent with the observed patterns includes complementarity between youth and entry to certain career paths. A door that was initially closed to women can be opened only to the young; older women can never pass through. If this is the case, then factors such as falling discrimination or growing demand for women's \"soft-skills\" might confer particular advantages to young cohorts of women whereas older women-even those with healthy endowments of currently valuable skills-might never realize their full potential."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusion", "text": "Although gender differences in labor force attachment and educational choices are widely considered to be a leading reason for older women's lower earnings, this empirical analysis of career trajectories suggests that other explanations are far more important. My study of NSCG and SESTAT panel data demonstrates that, during the 1990s, typical college-educated women experienced wage growth that kept pace with, or even exceeded, men's. When compared to men with exactly the same educational credentials, women begin and end the 1990s earning less, but do not fall farther behind as they age. This pattern is surprising because it contradicts the predictions of two schools of thought that are generally considered to represent opposing points of view about the source of the gender gap in earnings. Some scholars believe that the gap results primarily from gender differences in the rate of human capital accumulation, whereas others believe the cumulative effects of labor market discrimination also play a role. In both models, the disadvantage experienced by a typical woman is expected to grow with age; however, the evidence discovered here points to the contrary.\nThese results are very robust. Lower earnings levels, but similar rates of earnings growth, are evident among college graduates in nearly every field. In this sample, women in their 40s earn 30% to 45% less per hour than men while those in their 20s earn 5% to 10% less than men with identical educational credentials. The analysis performed here rules out the possibility that betweencohort changes in women's college major choices are driving the between-cohort reduction in the gender earnings gap. In fact, the same between-cohort patterns can be seen within homogeneous groups of workers with the same college major.\nCarefully specified regressions utilizing the detailed indicators of contemporaneous labor force attachment and changes in childcare responsibilities available in the SESTAT panels reveal that mothers, non-mothers, and men all have similar average rates of earnings growth between 1989 and 1999. Over the life cycle of mothers, this analysis finds that earnings growth rates are relatively lower during the early years but then substantially exceed those of men or women who are not mothers as the children grow older and leave home, yielding an average growth rate similar to that of both childless women and men over the lifetime.\nAn analysis of different centiles of the salary-level and growth rate distributions reveals that many of the patterns observed on average are quite robust. However, among fast-track workers at very high salary levels, women are underrepresented among those with very high growth rates. This evidence suggests a \"glass ceiling\" with direct relevance to the number of women likely to reach the very top echelon of influential positions.\nThis study finds evidence of a glass ceiling that slows the progress of the most successful women relative to observably similar men. At the same time, the typical college-educated woman in the labor market today appears to follow a career track that is parallel to (but below that of) similarly educated men in the same cohort. The combined findings of this analysis and Weinberger and Kuhn (2010) present a picture in which labor market opportunities are improving for successive cohorts of college-educated women, with pre-labor market educational investments and realized labor force attachment explaining very little of the between-cohort change in earnings levels. Cohort effects already evident at an initial observation predict the size of the gender gap in earnings many years later, suggesting that mid-career interruptions are far less important than early career processes that lead to gender gaps in earnings among young workers of each cohort. Factors already present in the early career predict later gender gaps in earnings."}, {"section_title": "Data Appendix", "text": "The 1993 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) is a survey of a representative sample of 1990 Census respondents who indicated that they were college graduates as of the 1990 Census survey date. Information collected in the 1993 survey was merged with selected information from the 1990 Census long form, including 1989 income, hours worked per week, and the number of weeks worked during 1989. Hence, the combination of labor market information as of the 1993 survey date with 1990 Census data from the same individual provides a short panel representative of all U.S. college graduates who earned a degree before the 1990 Census date.\nFrom the set of all 1993 respondents, the NSF selected individuals representing members of the science and engineering workforce for inclusion in the \"SESTAT\" system of data. Two other surveys are combined with the NSCG to create the full SESTAT cross-sectional snapshot of the science and engineering workforce. 35 Follow-up surveys of selected 1993 NSCG respondents in 1995, 1997, and 1999 were used by the NSF to include in successive SESTAT cross-sections, combined with data from the complementary surveys. However, individuals who might have been covered by one of the two other surveys (for example, NSCG respondents who earned a higher degree in a sciencerelated field after 1990) were dropped from the group of NSCG respondents to be resurveyed. The SESTAT panels I constructed include individuals who were surveyed in both 1993 and 1999 and attained no higher degrees between 1988 and 1999. The sample from which the longer panels are drawn is representative of individuals who were deemed to be part of the science and engineering workforce, who had completed their education before the 1990 Census, and were therefore not likely to be excluded from further participation in the longitudinal study. Appendix Table A1 describes the relationship between the NSCG cross-section sample and the set of individuals remaining at each step of selection into each of the two panels covering 1989-1999.\nThe first panel (SESTAT-BA) is representative of White individuals in the 1989 age range 23-52 who earned a bachelor's degree in a field categorized as science, math, com-35 These other surveys capture information on doctorates, and the most recent bachelor's and master's degree graduates.

It is also restricted to White individuals in the 1989 age range 23-52 who attained no higher degrees between 1988 and 1999 and worked full-time in both 1989 and 1999. It includes a broader set of respondents who earned a bachelor's, master's, law, or medical degree (before 1989). It contains not only the first panel but also other individuals who were considered interesting to the NSF either because their bachelor's degree major was in a field related to science (but not among those in the traditional science, math, computer science, engineering or social science categories), or because their 1993 occupation was related to science, or because the field of the master's degree was of interest to the NSF. This panel does not contain PhDs because only a selected few were followed until 1999 (the complementary Survey of Doctorate Recipients is intended to cover PhD scientists). Within the SESTAT-BA\u03e9 panel, more than 80% of the sample, and more than 90% of doctors and lawyers, hold a bachelor's degree in science, math, computer science, engineering, or social science. The disadvantage of this panel is that it is not as clear exactly which subset of the college-educated population it represents because the sampling algorithm is very complex. The advantage for a study of the glass ceiling is that it is larger and contains a higher proportion of workers with very high salaries, followed over a tenyear interval. Relative to the full NSCG or SESTAT-BA, the members of the SESTAT-BA\u03e9 sample have somewhat higher average earnings, but earnings growth rates are similar to those of the SESTAT-BA panel.\nAppendix Table A2 describes means of selected variables in the 1989 base year, comparing the full NSCG sample and its bachelor's-degree-only subset to the SESTAT-BA and SESTAT-BA\u03e9 samples. 36 Given the 36 For more extensive statistics descriptive of the full NSCG, including the distribution of college major strong representation of science and engineering majors, it is not surprising that the SESTAT panels have somewhat higher earnings than the corresponding NSCG samples of all college graduates.\nThe last two columns of Appendix Table  A2 are labeled hSESTAT-BA\u03e9. This is the larger of two panels describing growth in hourly earning between 1989 and 1996. The hSESTAT-BA and hSESTAT-BA\u03e9 panels are drawn in virtually the same fashion as SESTAT-BA and SESTAT-BA\u03e9, the only difference being that the restriction \"full-time or part-time and employed at least half the year with hourly earnings data in 1989 and 1996\" replaces the previously more restrictive rule \"full-time with annual earnings data in 1989 and 1999.\" The resulting samples are larger due to the less selective restriction on work intensity and to the fact that they avoid the attrition that took place between the 1997 and 1999 surveys. Although shorter than the 1989-1999 panels, these panels with hourly earnings measures available provide an opportunity to confirm that results based on annual earnings of full-time workers are similar to results based on hourly earnings of both part-time and full-time workers.\nAppendix Table A3 presents descriptive statistics on average annual income among panel members at the initial and final observations. To understand how annual earnings in the NSCG, SESTAT BA and SESTAT BA\u03e9 cross-section data and panels compare to those in more familiar samples, contemporaneous samples were drawn from Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and U.S. Census data for comparison. The cross-section Census data are sampled to include White, U.S.-born college graduates employed fullchoices among men and women from different cohorts, please see Black et al. (2008). time and full-year. The PSID mini-panel includes all college graduates employed full-time full-year in both 1990 and 1992. These years were chosen not only because they are close to the time frame spanned by the 1989 NSCG panel, but also because 1991 , 1992 are the only years in which measures of the previous year's annual labor income (distinct from asset income) are available in the individual-level public use file. The PSID panel has two advantages in addition to being familiar and nationally representative. First, it is possible in the PSID to construct a clean measure of hourly earnings, and second, earnings are not topcoded. To facilitate comparison to estimates using other data, a comparable topcoding procedure is applied to the PSID in some specifications.\nAppendix Table A3 shows that means of annual earnings among full-time workers in the PSID are similar to those in the NSCG, SESTAT BA, and SESTAT BA\u03e9 samples, and that nominal earnings growth rates are higher for women than for men in every single subsample examined. This table also displays a comparison between earnings among college graduates in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and the corresponding NSCG subsample. Here, the scale of the NSCG becomes apparent, with more than 20 times as many observations within the subset of the age range covered by the NLSY. Though unweighted NLSY earnings are somewhat lower than those in the corresponding NSCG sample, rates of change over time are similar: Men's earnings grow by 29% in the NSCG and 30% in the NLSY, whereas women's earnings grow by 33% in the NSCG and 35% in the NLSY. This exercise demonstrates that there is nothing unusual about the NSCG earnings measures that might be spuriously driving the results about women's faster earnings growth.
