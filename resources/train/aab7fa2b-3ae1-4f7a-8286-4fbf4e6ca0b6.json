[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "[2] While the ability of geophysical currents to form anisotropic features is well acknowledged in theoretical studies [e.g., Rhines, 1975], detection of these features using observation was difficult before the satellite era. Only satellites provide long-term, large-scale coverage at fine enough horizontal resolution necessary to reveal the new multi-scale anisotropic structures [e.g., . Remarkable progress in numerical modeling led, quite independently, to recognition of somewhat similar anisotropic features [e.g., Galperin et al., 2004]. Results based on satellite and model data require a thorough validation against in situ observations before they can be trusted. Here we validate a particular class of new anisotropic features-stationary quasi-zonal jet-like features (or striations)."}, {"section_title": "Stationary Quasi-Zonal Jet-Like Features (Striations) in MDOT", "text": "[3] Striations were detected recently in the data of the 1992 -2003 mean dynamic ocean topography (MDOT; http://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/DOT/). This MDOT of high spatial resolution was calculated by downscaling a NASA Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment satellite mission-based (http://www.csr.utexas.edu/grace/) product using the estimates of the MDOT gradient [Maximenko and Niiler, 2005;Niiler et al., 2003]. The latter estimates were obtained by combining data of drifters, altimetry, and NCEP wind within a simplified equation of momentum near the sea surface. The new MDOT accounts for effects of eddies, heterogeneous distribution of data, and wind-driven currents and provides important information on the complex mesoscale structure and dynamics of major ocean currents [e.g., Hughes, 2005]. It also reveals new features that are discussed in this paper. The features are best seen on the map of mean zonal geostrophic velocity where they appear as jets a few hundred kilometers wide extending over thousands of kilometers. We choose to call them striations rather than jets because their orientation does not always coincide with the streamlines of the mean flow, i.e., water particles move across rather than along the features. Figure 1a illustrates the spatial distribution of striations as seen in the 1992 -2003 mean zonal geostrophic velocity field high-pass-filtered with a two-dimensional Hanning filter of 4\u00b0half-width. The ubiquity of the jets, many of which were not described before, indicates a new texture of the ocean that should be validated with in situ observations and reproduced in numerical models. Figure 1b shows that many of these features are visible even in the raw data of surface velocities measured by drifters. [4] For a detailed analysis two study areas were selected-23-42\u00b0N, 115-150\u00b0W in the eastern North Pacific and 23-47\u00b0S, 70-120\u00b0W in the South Pacific ( Figure 1a). As seen in Figures 2a and 2i, the domains are located at polewardeastern corners of the subtropical gyres. Mean geostrophic velocities are nearly eastward at the western boundaries of both domains and gradually turn equatorward further east. Both domains are bounded in the east by the coastline. Velocities are intensified in the eastern boundary currents (the California Current and the Peru/Humboldt Current, respectively). Both domains contain distinct striations. [5] The range of MDOT exceeds 50 cm in both domains, which will later be shown to be nearly two orders of magnitude larger than MDOT 0 (the MDOT signal associated with the striations). This makes detection of the jets somewhat tricky and probably accounts for their late discovery. A two-dimensional high-pass Hanning filter with a halfwidth of 4\u00b0had to be applied twice to get rid of the largescale signal. (Filter parameters were selected based on spectral analysis described in the following sections.) The resultant mesoscale component of MDOT in the North (South) Pacific is shown in Figure 2e (2m) and reveals at least four (three) distinct pairs of striations nearly parallel to each other. These crests extend almost between the California coast and Hawaii and between Easter Island Figures 2e and 2m, which are also repeated on some of the other panels in Figure 2 for reference purposes. Characteristic values of MDOT 0 , estimated from Figures 2e and 2m, are about 0.5 -1.5 cm."}, {"section_title": "Stationary Quasi-Zonal Jet-Like Features (Striations) in in Situ Data", "text": "[6] The largest historical dataset available for this study is the collection of XBT profiles in the World Ocean Database 2005 [Boyer et al., 2006]. In this study, XBT data were combined with the profiling float data collected in the same dataset. Both data are highly heterogeneous in time and space, have limited accuracy, and are contaminated with a broad range of signals, from internal waves to eddies to seasonal cycle. Northern and southern domains are covered by 116300 and 10160 profiles, respectively, the majority (98 and 85%) of which come from XBTs in 1966-2005. The smaller number of XBT data in the southern domain is compensated by somewhat more robust striations compared to its northern counterpart. Data interpolated onto standard depths were gridded horizontally on a half-degree grid, the same as MDOT. A triangular filter was applied to each grid in each direction to slightly smooth the data. Isolines of mean temperature at depths of 100 m (hereafter, T 100 ; Figures 2b and 2j) agree qualitatively with the isolines of MDOT (Figures 2a and 2i). The range of T 100 exceeds 12\u00b0C (10\u00b0C) in the northern (southern) domain. [7] As in the case of MDOT, the striation signal T 0 100 is well hidden behind the large-scale field T 100 . However, two consecutive applications of the filter described in the previous section reveal striations (Figures 2f and 2n) of characteristic amplitude 0.5\u00b0C, whose locations and orientations correspond well with the ones in MDOT 0 . [8] The striation signal is also distinct in the data of mean depth D 12 of the 12\u00b0C isotherm. This isotherm lies close to the depth of the thermocline and outcrops at the sea surface in the poleward parts of both domains (Figures 2c and 2k). The maximum depth of D 12 reaches 300 m in the North and 375 m in the South Pacific. Figures 2g and 2o illustrate the high-pass filtered D 0 12 having amplitude of about 5 m. Again, locations of the features in D 0 12 are consistent with those of the striations seen in MDOT 0 . [9] To derive the dominant harmonics associated with the striations we performed spectral analysis by applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the 32 \u00c2 32 point subdomains of our half-degree grid. Locations of the subdomains are marked by white rectangles in Figure 2, and the calculated power spectral densities are plotted in Figure 3. Based on observations, each spectrum demonstrates a single, isolated maximum whose position indicates with confidence the deviation of the direction of the dominant wave vector from meridional. Additional estimates of the   preferred directions were obtained with the Radon transform [Deans, 1983] in the same subdomains used for the spectra calculations. For MDOT 0 , T 0 100 , and D 0 12 in the northern domain (Figures 3a -3c), the estimates give the counterclockwise angles of 13, 12 and 18\u00b0, respectively. The southern MDOT 0 (Figure 3e) has a clockwise angle of 9\u00b0. The first zero-crossings of the correlation functions in these preferred directions correspond to the wave lengths of 400, 420, 390, and 400 km, correspondingly, as represented by white dots in Figures 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3e. Given the limited statistics and remarkable noise in the data, the differences between the locations of spectral maxima in Figures 3a -3c are not significant. The differences between the positions of spectral maxima and Radon transform/correlation function estimates in Figures 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3e are also insignificant. [10] To analyze the cross-jet structure of the striations, the fields shown in Figures 2e -2g and 2m -2o were averaged over the 1300 km-wide bands bounded by the black dashed lines in the direction of the jets' axes, indicated by red lines. This procedure helped to greatly reduce the effect of noise on the confidence of our conclusions. Figures 4a and 4c illustrate the high coherence between MDOT 0 , T 0 100 , and D 0 12 in both hemispheres. In good agreement with the calculations discussed earlier in this paper, the characteristic wavelength of the striations is about 400 km. The characteristic amplitude of MDOT 0 is 0.6 cm, T 0 100 0.2\u00b0C, and D 0 12 2-3 m. D 0 12 better correlates with MDOT 0 than T 0 100possibly because the 12\u00b0C isotherm lies close to the thermocline, which deepens equator-ward in both study domains. Curiously, the observed relation between D 0 12 and MDOT 0 can be described with the equivalent barotropic mode in a simple 1 1 = 2 -layer model with Dr = 2.5 kg/m 3 . This relation is illustrated in Figures 4a and 4c by appropriate scaling of D 0 12 . [11] The vertical structure of the temperature anomaly T 0 associated with the striations is shown in Figures 4b and  4d. With a few exceptions, the striations are coherent in the vertical between 100 and 400 m. At particular locations, the largest values of T 0 are mainly found around the thermocline, whose depth varies similarly to D 12 . Averaging along the striation axes smears these maxima in the vertical, so that correspondence with the mean depth of the thermocline (green line) becomes less evident. The more complex structure of T 0 in the mixed layer (above the red lines in Figures 4b and 4d) may be due to the strong seasonal signal."}, {"section_title": "Stationary Quasi-Zonal Jet-Like Features (Striations) in Numerical Models", "text": "[12] Most advanced numerical models [e.g., Richards et al., 2006] appear to be capable of reproducing jet-like features similar to the striations described in previous sections. This study used the data of the OGCM for the Earth Simulator (OFES) [Sasaki et al., 2008] forced by the NCEP reanalysis fluxes from 1950 to 2003. Figures 2d and 2l show mean SSH (MSSH) averaged from 1993 through 2002 (the same period as covered by MDOT), and Figures 2h and 2p illustrate striations observed in the MSSH 0 field extracted using the same technique applied to the observational data. Corresponding spectra are presented in Figures 3d and 3f. While the model striations resemble the observations as a texture of the ocean, there are significant differences in locations and orientations of the features in the North Pacific (Figure 2h) from observations (Figures 2e -2g). There the model striations have a wavelength of about 450 km and are larger than the corresponding wavelengths for MDOT 0 , T 0 100 , and D 0 12 . They are also more zonal tilted at only 5\u00b0to the parallel. [13] By contrast, the structure of the striations in the South Pacific (Figure 2p) is better aligned with that of MDOT 0 (Figure 2m). The features are distinct in the power spectrum ( Figure 3f) and are tilted at 7\u00b0. This tilt and dominant wavelength of 385 km agree well with the values Figure 4. (a-e) Cross-jet structures of various fields along black solid lines of Figure 2 averaged along red lines (striations axes) between two black dashed lines. Units in Figures 4a and 4c are cm for MDOT 0 (red) and MSSH 0 (green), 0.2\u00b0C for T 0 100 (black), and 4 m for D 0 12 (blue; light blue represents standard error). Colors in Figures 4b and 4d display T 0 above 400 m derived from XBT profiles and Figure 4e contains 1993-2002 mean T 0 from OFES. Black contours are isotherms. Green lines in Figures 4b, 4d, and 4e indicate the thermocline, and red lines indicate depth of the winter (March in the North and July in the South Pacific) mixed layer. Arrows mark positions of red lines of Figure 2. The x-axes indicate the latitude along solid black lines of Figure 2. Distance in km is also shown. for MDOT 0 (9\u00b0and 400 km). The cross-jet MSSH 0 also correlates well with MDOT 0 (Figure 4c), although the amplitude of the model signal is only a half of that of MDOT 0 . The structure of the model temperature anomaly on the vertical section ( Figure 4e) resembles that of the observation-derived T 0 ( Figure 4d); but the model signal is 2 -3 times weaker than the observational one. As with the observations, maximum values of T 0 are at the depth of the model thermocline."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Discussion", "text": "[14] Our analysis of historical XBT profiles validates new, robust features detected recently in the 1993 -2002 MDOT. Horizontal filtering and/or the use of MDOT as a guide have proven to be efficient methods for the jet-like signal extraction from the noisy historical data. Striations are distinct in the ensemble-mean drifter velocities (Figure 1b). In both study domains striations are essentially non-zonal. They are tilted southwest-northeast at an angle of about 13\u00b0t o the parallel in the North Pacific and northwest-southeast at an angle of about 9\u00b0in the South Pacific. They seem to retain their coherent vertical structure throughout a wide range of depths. XBT data confirm (not shown in figures) these coherences at least through 700 m; Argo float velocities of Lebedev et al. [2007] at 1000 dbar correlate with the surface geostrophic velocities derived from MDOT 0 at 0.46; the OFES solution remains coherent to the sea floor. [15] The physics of the striations is not yet understood. The striations seen in Figure 2 cross mean geostrophic streamlines. At crossing point, parcels carried by the flow are deflected slightly in the direction of the striations. This eliminates freely evolving geostrophic turbulence and PV staircases as potential sources of these jets [Rhines, 1975;Baldwin et al., 2007]. Mesoscale eddies following preferred paths or propagating eddies of exceptional strength are possible mechanisms that may form striations in both our study domains (D. Chelton, personal communication, 2008). Centurioni et al. [2008] suggest that striations are extensions of stationary meanders of the California Current. [16] In many regions the sign of meridional tilt of striations agrees with the meridional direction of the largescale flow. This agreement fits into a simple model of a linear stationary Rossby wave with nearly meridional orientation of wavevector whose propagation is balanced by advection. For a monochromatic Rossby wave it can be shown that the stronger the flow and the smaller the wave length the larger is the tilt. These waves may be wakes in the PV-field in response to some forcing located at or around the eastern tips of the striations. A mechanism analogous to b-plume [e.g., Pedlosky, 1997] is a possibility with convergences being associated with meanders of the eastern boundary currents [Centurioni et al., 2008]. [17] While the OFES model does produce the striations, exact locations and orientations, scales and strengths of the features differ from observations in one or both domains. This is probably because of inconsistencies remaining in the simulated structures of the subtropical gyres and failure to reproduce the complex near-coastal dynamics. The former are seen in the difference between MDOT and MSSH in Figures 2a and 2d. However, not all such differences appear to be crucial. For example, Figure 4e contains the second model thermocline that does not exist in the real ocean ( Figure 4d); however, model striations look realistic in this domain. The larger width and smaller tilt of the model striations in the North Pacific agree with each other within the suggested Rossby wave concept (longer waves propagate at higher meridional speed and require smaller tilt to withstand the advection by a flow). Therefore the model may be capturing the correct physics. Further study is under way to understand the dynamics of these puzzling jet-like features."}]
