This session is intended for geospatial technicians and GIS managers. The analytical techniques being assessed by the study team make use of existing data and represent a range of rigor for calculating storm surge elevations and wave heights A baseline was established through a robust FIS-type approach using ADCIRC (surge) and WHAFIS (overland wave). This baseline provides a benchmark to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness and accuracy of less rigorous approaches. Alternative approaches being evaluated include: changes in surge calculated by SLOSH or linear superposition; and changes in overland waves calculated by the HAZUS Flood Information Tool (less detailed version of WHAFIS) or geo-processing of the effective DFIRM is superimposed on the updated surge condition. This talk will provide an overview of the study and focus on the relative accuracy of each method in predicting changes to coastal flood hazards for the various methodologies. Challenges, lessons learned, and plans for future activities will also be discussed. Modeling sea-level rise impacts is important to planning adaptation. We assess spatial vulnerability using LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (RMSE(z) at 95% CL = 0.41 m; RMSE (x,y) at 95% CL = 2 m). We assess temporal vulnerability by removing the trend and tidal component of water level history from local tide gauge records (Honolulu, Kahului, Pago Pago). The residual represents historical local sea level variability. This is the basis for predicting future sea level variability on a smoothly accelerating trend to 2100 based on best (0.75 m) and worst (1.9 m) case scenarios (corrected for land movement) after Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009). In the villages of Amouli and Vatia, American Samoa, spot elevations collected using kinematic GPS and Total Station surveys refine and correct existing coarse resolution elevation models and, with community scale GIS layers of infrastructure, are used to create terrain models. In Hawaii, airborne LiDAR terrain data is integrated along the coastal plains of Maui and Oahu to create elevation models. On Maui, for instance, we predict worst case exceedance of the +25 cm contour (MHHW): 1 week per year 2020-2030; 6 weeks per year 2040-2050, and 10 months per year 2060-2070. The resulting impact maps are provided to planners and communities through education-based programs to bring awareness of the potential effects of sea-level rise. As recommended by the NOAA and USGS \"community framework for responding to SLR and inundation\", these results provide the geographic scope and temporal scales of concern for formulating SLR adaptation plans."}, {"section_title": "A02.

Digital maps representing impervious and pervious developed lands derived from Landsat satellite imagery are critical to measuring the urban footprint as an input to watershed models used to estimate nutrient and sediment loads to large aquatic ecosystems such as the Chesapeake Bay. While such datasets often represent the only affordable, available, and spatially-consistent representation of land cover, they can grossly underestimate the extent of developed land uses. This study quantifies and compares impervious and pervious surface estimates for developed lands based on land cover with those derived using a combination of land cover, road, and housing datasets. Rural and suburban areas exhibit the largest differences in the extent of developed land cover compared with land use. Differences between developed land cover and land use are less apparent in dense urban areas. As a result, watershed models calibrated with land cover data may underestimate the contribution of nutrient and sediment loads from developed lands and likely overestimate the contribution of non-point source loads from farmlands and forests."}, {"section_title": "A06.

SAV mapping required imagery to be captured at a negative tide, with tight sun angle and optimal weather parameters. Calculating acceptable tidal control and sun angle scenarios resulted in only 40 possible acquisition days over a two year period. Out of those 40 potential days, humbling weather conditions prohibited acquisition to only two possible days within less than a two hour window. In response to this challenge, Photo Science created a Flight Planning Application for aerial flight operations to compare tide, sun angle, and weather by date. This unique ability to \"calibrate\" local tide gauges based on barometric pressure and wind speed and direction offered unparalleled capabilities for flight planning. Photo Science also collaborated with its stakeholders to create a formal protocol for daily flight operations. This protocol was used successfully to obtain the Humboldt Bay imagery and reflected the true collaborative nature off all project stakeholders.

This presentation will provide an overview of how customized GIS tools and technologies are applied for each study phase, which includes: 1) Digital terrain development, 2) Coastal hazard analysis, and 3) Floodplain mapping. Development of the terrain surface requires the integration of multiple variant topographic and bathymetric data sources. Resolution of issues involving geospatial edge matching, datum conversions, and proper projections is accomplished with AECOM's WISE Terrain Analysis package. Coastal hazard analysis involves the modeling of overland wave propagation using FEMA's Wave Height Analysis for Flood Insurance Studies (WHAFIS). This analysis requires custom GIS tools used to extract ground elevations, land use, and obstruction features used to support the wave modeling process. Obstructions are measured in the field using custom GIS/GPS enabled field data collection systems. In addition, identification of the Primary Frontal Dune (PFD) and the accompanying erosion analysis is semi-automated using Coastal WISE erosion module. WHAFIS modeling input and visualization of computed results provides for rapid assessment and validation of modeled flood hazards of surge and waves in an interactive GIS-based modeling environment called Coastal WISE. Floodplain mapping is conducted within AECOM's Coastal WISE module, which streamlines the interpretation of WHAFIS modeling results along transects to connected flood zone boundaries. Features such as the Primary Frontal Dune (PFD), Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA), coastal A-zones, and V-zones are mapped as well. B02. USING GIS TO QUANTIFY THE RISK IN COASTAL AREAS FROM A 500-YEAR FLOOD EVENT Susan Phelps, AECOM Mark Crowell, Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA has conducted several demographics studies to estimate U. S. population living in coastal areas. In a 2007 study, FEMA presented a method to determine coastal population based on whether a county bordered the coast (or associated sheltered water bodies) or contained velocity zones (V Zones) as defined by FEMA. However, V Zones only account for the subset of coastal flood hazard areas that are impacted by significant wave action or high-velocity waters. Coastal AE Zones, areas subject to coastal flooding but not impacted by the significant wave action/high velocity waters associated with V Zones, must also be considered. In 2010, FEMA completed an update to the original study, developing methods to approximate boundaries defining the landward extent of 100-yr coastal floods. It was concluded that slightly more than 3% of the total U.S. population live in 100-yr coastal flood hazard areas (includes the Great Lakes) as defined by FEMA. However, the 3% figure should not be considered an upper bounds on population exposed to coastal flood hazards, as there are numerous examples where coastal floods more rare than the 1% annual chance coastal flood have occurred and damaged homes. If less-frequent coastal flood events were considered, such as the 500-yr coastal flood, then larger swaths of land and associated population would be affected. Accordingly, this presentation provides an overview of geospatial tools and methods to determine the 500-yr coastal flood hazard boundary, and estimates of population subject to 500-year coastal flooding."}, {"section_title": "B03.

The paper outlines the development and hosting of a number of these workshops designed to engage the local stakeholders in identifying the impacts of climate change. The examples focus on one climate change scenario, namely that of flooding. The study areas, Aberdeen City and Stonehaven in Scotland, are both coastal settlements on the east coast of the UK. The UKCIP report identifies increased rainfall as a significant feature of Scotland's future climate. Already there is some evidence that rainfall has increased in frequency, intensity and duration. The end result has been increased flooding incidents where areas are flooded more frequently, whilst high run-off and high tides often leads to flooding of the areas surrounding rivers and small streams, as well as low-lying coastal areas.

Center of Expertise Transport and deposition of coarse-grained stamp sand material along the shoreline of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula are by-products of an early 20th century copper mining legacy near Gay, MI. Copper and associated metals from remnant stamp sand materials continue to be associated with environmental and economic degradation of this coastal region. Remote sensing techniques are uniquely suited for distinguishing aesthetically and texturally different stamp sand materials from those of native sand. Past investigations utilizing air photo interpretation have identified a decrease in the surface area of a remnant stamp sand deposit at Gay, MI, and in increase in the width of the deposit southwest of Gay between 1938 and 1997. Recent advancements in airborne topographic and bathymetric lidar technology facilitate mapping of stamp sand materials at increased spatial resolutions over large geographic extents. Seafloor reflectance values, which are obtained with sophisticated bathymetric lidar waveform processing algorithms, can be utilized together with lidar-based elevation measurements, limited grab samples, and supervised classification techniques to delineate both the sub-aerial and submerged extent of stamp sand deposits. This presentation will describe and evaluate the application of this innovative, lidar-based approach to obtaining bottom substrate information with a June 2008 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers CHARTS survey along Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula. Derivatives of this application include laser reflectance and seabed classification images.

This ArcGIS Desktop (ArcMap) toolbar allows users to retrieve detailed Sediment Sample properties (e.g., XY locations, harbor bottom elevation, top of rock elevation, or material characteristics) in correlation with any relevant sediment testing (chemical, biological, or physical) results, and link related document such as Core Boring, Gradation Curves, or Sediment Testing reports. Through spatial or user-defined attribute queries sample sites can be located in the mapping display. Users can filter locations based on material characteristics found (e.g., shell hash, marl, or clay) at the boring penetration depth or top of rock depth. Detected chemical reports can also be generated from the site samples. User can locate any sample that contains a defined list of chemicals above or below detection limit values. All results are reported as separate data layer in ArcMap's Table of Contents. The toolbar requires two Spatial Data Standard (SDS) compliant feature classes, Access Database forms, and a number of related business tables to function properly. All required data structure is provided in the tool installation and detailed in the supplied documentation. This presentation will discuss the architecture and use of the Sediment Sampling GIS tool and database. The Digital Coast is a constituent-driven, Web-based enabling platform that provides data, tools, training, and case studies to the coastal community. The website was designed and built with input from the Digital Coast Partnership Group. During this \"ignite\"-style session, you will hear members of this group briefly discuss the benefits that these organizations have realized through participation in building the Digital Coast. Five-minute presentations will be given by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, Coastal States Organization, The Nature Conservancy, National Association of Counties, American Planning Association, and National States Geographic Information Council, highlighting the impacts this resource has made to their memberships and communities. A seventh presentation will highlight the Digital Coast Act. This legislation will provide a program to acquire critical data to help meet the nation's important baseline geospatial data needs for responsibly managing our coastal resources.

The Coastal Resilience project is collaboration between public, private, academic and not-for-profit institutions. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is working locally and globally to develop ecosystem-based management tools for marine systems. The Global Coastal Resilience Tool is one product of these efforts. The tool is a web application that allows for data to be rapidly deployed and available for coastal environments worldwide at multiple scales and geographies. Available sea level rise data can be incorporated with other available data sources to provide users the ability to visualize understand the potential impacts of climate change and other natural disasters on the coastal environment. Detailed geospatial data for study sites are included as site modules. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal Services Center is providing data and technical assistance in decision support tool development at various stages in the project. TNC's Gulf of Mexico Coastal Restoration Tool was originally begun as a spin-off from this global tool. The potential effects of sea level rise (SLR) are of concern to Southeast Florida, due, among other things, to its low topographic relief and its peninsular nature. This region includes approximately 30% of Florida's population and is the home to key financial and cultural resources, as well as unique and sensitive natural resources, such as the Everglades and the Florida Keys. In 2009, four of Florida's southeastern counties (Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Monroe) signed a \"Regional Climate Change Compact\" that is paving the way to improved coordination as the region plans and adapts to the potential effects of climate change. In spring 2010, the NOAA Coastal Services Center and Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) facilitated a workshop to assist the compact and key partners in reaching consensus on methods and criteria for mapping SLR inundation, using a GIS framework and LiDAR data. The approach selected includes using NOAA's VDatum mean higher high water (MHHW) tidal surfaces and calculating Z scores to estimate the probability of inundation. The compact is also working on common approaches for analyzing and communicating SLR vulnerability to aid in the development of a regional climate change action plan. To that end, subsequent workshops have been focusing on other vulnerability analysis challenges, such as criteria for identifying resources at risk and methods for aggregating demographic and economic data. Although reaching technical consensus has been challenging, the spirit of regional collaboration and cooperation has been remarkable and has spurred innovation among the participants. This presentation will highlight the process, challenges, and progress made by this effort."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Hazards: Sea Level Rise Collaborations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "C02.

This presentation will focus on how the Habitat Priority Planner was used to identify coastal habitat essential for key species, such as the Swallow Tail Kite, as a long-term adaptation strategy for rising sea levels in the Winyah Bay Focus Area. The Habitat Priority Planner is a GIS-based tool developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for guiding decisions related to conservation, restoration, and land use. Additionally, predicted sea level rise trends generated from a refined Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model are being considered in decision making. The Habitat Priority Planner is playing an important role in helping the local conservation community identify current habitat areas that are not protected, but which are most suitable -based on predicted changes -for meeting long-term conservation goals of the Winyah Bay Task Force. Land use and land cover play a significant role as drivers of environmental change, as well as in increasing the vulnerability of places to inundation, sea level rise, and other hazards. Information on what land covers are changing and where those changes are occurring is essential to improving our understanding of past management practices and in effectively responding to those environmental and human-induced changes now and in the future. NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) produces nationally standardized land cover and land change information for the coastal regions of the U.S. These products provide inventories of coastal intertidal areas, wetlands, and adjacent uplands (using documented, repeatable procedures) with the goal of monitoring these habitats every five years. This program has been in existence since the mid 90s, and now has three dates of land cover information available (1996, 2001, and 2006) for the coastal areas of the lower 48 states.

St Lucia's economy was once driven by banana production, but the economy shifted to tourism in the 1990s due to changes in European Union importing and competition from the Latin American banana industry. Increased tourism has increased pressure to build along the coast where most of the population already lives. This could significantly impact coastal habitats, which are themselves tourist attractions. To ensure sustainable coastal development and protect natural resources, it was paramount to create a national GIS and populate it with up-to-date and accurate information because most of the existing data are old and inaccurate. First, the Banana Industry Trust contracted us to collect high resolution ADS40-SH52 orthoimagery along portions of the coast and map the coastal and benthic habitats using proven methods developed under previous NOAA-funded projects. Next, the St Lucia Ministry of Physical Development and Environment contracted us to collect additional imagery for the entire island, to create orthoimage base maps and extract planimetric features for the island. Taking advantage of the ADS40's HiRES collection mode, Fugro satisfied multiple imagery scales from a single collection profile.

Ultimately, the new tool is intended be used as the primary public visualization mechanism employed in Oregon's ongoing marine spatial planning process: the amendment of the Oregon Territorial Sea Plan for the inclusion of marine renewable energy. The OMM tool enables the online visualization and analysis of a wide range of coastal and marine data in ways that facilitate the ongoing renewable energy and nearshore resource planning processes in Oregon. The tool showcases a comprehensive database of ocean information collected during earlier phases of Oregon's marine reserves process, and also incorporates a suite of newly collected information on the human use footprint with Oregon's Territorial Sea.

In conjunction with use, we integrated economic models to evaluate the impacts on shipping companies and fishing communities if displacement did occur and to help evaluate trade-offs. Most of the Gulf of Maine has at least one use activity with high use areas focused around bathymetric features that attract fisherman and marine animals. Shipping patterns followed great circle routes and mandated shipping lanes and not bathymetric features. Assessing for current use in the marine spatial planning process can enhance engagement of stakeholders and potentially eliminate conflict.

Marsh vegetation has been shown to have a significant positive effect on processes related to wave attenuation and shoreline stabilization. These ecosystem services help to protect adjacent human populations from coastal hazards such as storm waves and flooding. Under certain circumstances, salt marshes may even be able to maintain the coastline relative to sea level rise by accreting sediment providing a further reduction in vulnerability of human and natural systems to hazards and climate change. Here we report a case study on Long Island, New York in which we used the site selection software Marxan to identify marsh areas that are suitable for conservation action and have the greatest capacity for population protection. Population protection capacity was quantified using geospatial information related to marsh size, proximity to vulnerable human communities, adjacent population densities, and topography. This case study also includes techniques for identifying marsh areas with high quality upland areas, or migration zones, available for marsh migration as sea level rises. The migration zone assessment is based on broad indicators related to migration impediments along the marsh perimeter, sea level rise inundation likelihood, land cover, and the availability of vacant parcels. Although explicit modeling of marsh migration requires site specific information such as local accretion rates, our case study shows that coastal planners can and should begin to account for marsh protective services and sea level rise to ensure viability of marshes in the future and their ability to maintain critical ecosystem services."}, {"section_title": "D02.

The utility of decision support systems for understanding potential effects of these changes is dependent on many factors including the quality of inputs. Our objective is to measure uncertainty of modeled input elevation data for the Sea Level Affecting Marsh Model (SLAMM). Many formulations in SLAMM are based on values referenced from a defined digital elevation model (DEM). The accuracy and precision of the source data used to develop the DEM are important factors to consider when evaluating SLAMM outputs for management decisions. Multiple DEMs developed from LiDAR, airborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR), National Elevation Data (NED), and National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) were developed for a tributary in Yaquina Bay along the central Oregon coast. The DEMs were incorporated with current habitat maps and local parameters into SLAMM simulations to project the future distribution of habitat. DEM values were compared with precise GPS measurements to gauge uncertainty. Comparing simulation results with DEM specification and procurement expense shows there is less elevation uncertainty in intertidal areas with more expensive data. Elevation datasets that specified areas within intertidal regions, resulted in more accurate modeled elevations and increased confidence in projected habitat distribution. Accounting for uncertainty in DEMs for estuarine habitat modeling can aid managers and scientists in their decisions about modeling approaches, limitations and the resources required for desired results."}, {"section_title": "D04.

Emerging technologies in the arena of participatory GIS are providing new ways to tap this critical knowledge and document human uses patterns in a spatial context. The participatory GIS approach helps to bring often inaccessible expertise and knowledge into the spatial arena and yields critical information to support resource planning and decision-making by engaging experts in the delineation of use patterns and providing a forum to gather and refine spatial data. NOAA's Marine Protected Areas Center has been engaged in various participatory mapping efforts to document human uses of the ocean throughout the U.S. in recent years. Through a refined participatory process, we have mapped nearly 30 distinct uses of the ocean at multiple scales, across different domains and for a variety of marine management applications.

One unique aspect of this process is that stakeholder groups of fishermen, conservationists, divers, artists, and primarily non-technical users were tasked with developing these marine protected area networks. This presentation will examine some of the design decisions made when developing MarineMap for a group of users unfamiliar with traditional geospatial software. We will examine what lessons can be learned from consumer mapping software like Google Earth, how decision support tools can serve as an educational tool, and why seemingly trivial concerns like responsiveness and aesthetics can make or break an application.

Department of Ecology The Washington Coastal Atlas (http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/sea/sma/atlas_ home.html) provides geographic information to support informed management of Puget Sound and the outer coast of Washington. This web-based atlas is used by local and Tribal governments, state and federal planners and resource managers, researchers, consultants, and interested citizens. Recently redeveloped to meet additional user needs, it features an improved user interface designed to be easily accessible to a diverse audience. Improvements include the addition of important new data sets such as (1) public beach access locations in Washington State, where much of this land is privately owned, (2) new digital FEMA flood maps, and 3beach closure and water quality information. The mapping technology has been upgraded to use both ESRI ArcGIS Server Silverlight (main map) and JavaScript (supplemental maps) APIs. These new improvements add to the information that has been historically available on the atlas such as: habitat features, physical features, regulated features, shoreline modifications and jurisdictional delineations. The atlas also includes decades of oblique aerial photos which can be used to view current and historic shoreline features, such as level of development and presence of any shoreline modifications. In addition, the atlas provides information on land cover changes over time using NOAA C-CAP data. The atlas is coordinating with other coastal atlas-type applications on the west coast (http://ican.science. oregonstate.edu/westcoast/), as well as participating in the International Coastal Atlas Network (ICAN) to collaborate on data interoperability, tools and resources for improved coastal zone management."}, {"section_title": "D14.

The VDatum software was developed by NOAA to vertically transform geospatial data among a variety of tidal, orthometric and ellipsoidal vertical datums. The goal of the evaluation was the Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) datum model as applied to convert ellipsoid heights to chart datum. With this VDatum model conversion validated, it follows that conversions of chart data to orthometric heights can also be verified. This is of particular importance when assembling multiple data sources on a common datum as uncertainties in the transformations can be established. Using a buoy outfitted with a GPS receiver and tilt sensor, tidal datums were computed at three locations bounding the project area in 2009 and an additional three deployments continue in 2010.

ENHANCED PROCESSING OF BATHYMETRIC LIDAR DATA John Gerhard, Woolpert Carol Lockhart, Geomatics Data Solutions In the summer of 2010, Woolpert acquired bathymetric LiDAR, topographic LiDAR, RGB imagery, and hyperspectral imagery from Rhode Island to southern Maine in support of the National Coastal Mapping Program. This presentation will review the project and provide an analysis of the data and the software integration that enhanced the use of that data to support regional sediment management, construction, operations, and regulatory functions along the coast. During processing, Woolpert used Fledermaus 3D Editor to view point data and GreenC Solutions and AHAB's Coastal Survey Suite to view waveform and image data, allowing the technician to formulate decisions faster and more accurately. The bathymetric LiDAR was then imported from the Fledermaus software directly into an ESRI geodatabase to store and manage the ArcGIS data. The use of Fledermaus allowed users to perform sounding selection and surface modeling on a wide variety of hydrographic formats within ArcGIS. "}, {"section_title": "F14.

Geological Survey", "text": "The importance of littoral elevation to the distribution of intertidal species has long been a cornerstone of estuarine ecology and its historical importance to navigation cannot be understated. However, historically, intertidal elevation measurements have been sparse likely due to the difficulty of collecting data in shallow often broad areas subject to tidal drainage with little vertical control. Modern concerns including the threats of tsunami inundation, the effects of climate change on sea level rise and efforts to integrate terrestrial and bathymetric elevation mapping have spurred new intertidal elevation data collection and compilation. Yet, there remains a lack of bathymetric data in many estuarine systems except for, perhaps, a distinction between subtidal and intertidal areas. Here we present techniques and data sources for estimating intertidal bathymetric depth distributions from readily available data that may be useful in modeling estuarine ecological change under varying sea level rise scenarios. The resulting bathymetric models will vary along a scale of reliability according to the quality of input data."}, {"section_title": "F15. ADVANCES IN COASTAL DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS Barry Eakins, University of Colorado at Boulder", "text": "Lisa Taylor, NOAA National Geophysical Data Center Kelly Carignan, University of Colorado at Boulder Maureen Kenny, NOAA Coast Survey Development Laboratory Coastal DEMs provide the framework for modeling of many natural processes, including: tsunami propagation and coastal inundation, hurricane storm-surge, sea-level rise, ocean circulation, sediment transport, and contaminant dispersal. As such efforts pursue ever greater levels of detail, the effects of inaccuracies in the DEMs can be magnified, especially in the coastal zone, where the vertical datums meet. We present advances in coastal DEM development aimed at minimizing DEM errors that can adversely impact modeling results. The key piece is accurately establishing a common vertical datum, so that shoreline crossing phenomena are accurately replicated during modeling. Land DEMs may be built from a single survey, eliminating the need to resolve inconsistencies between datasets. Coastal DEMS (those that integrate ocean bathymetry and land topography) do not have this luxury, since the data are collected by a variety of different methods and instruments in different terrestrial environments. They have the added challenge of source elevation data being referenced to different vertical datums. Measurements of bathymetry are typically referenced to tidal datums, most commonly mean lower low water (MLLW). Topographic measurements, however, are usually referenced to an ellipsoidal or orthometric datum, such as North American Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). It is often the failure to properly integrate bathymetric and topographic data at the coast that causes modeling results to run astray."}, {"section_title": "F16. MAPPING INUNDATION UNCERTAINTY WITH A STANDARD SCORE (Z-SCORE) TECHNIQUE", "text": "Brian Hadley, I.M. Systems Group at the NOAA Coastal Services Center Vertical error in the topographic data is the most important factor affecting the accuracy of single-value surface model inundation maps (National Research Council, 2009). A single-value surface model, often referred to as a \"bathtub\" model, requires two primary topographic input variables: (1) the water surface (i.e., tidal datum + inundation level) and (2) the ground elevation. Unfortunately, both variables include spatially varying vertical error that introduces uncertainty into the resultant map for a given inundation scenario. More sophisticated hydraulic and geomorphic models have their own error budgets, which can be quite complex depending on model assumptions. Standard scores, or z-scores, measure the number of standard deviations an observation falls above or below the mean. This investigation employs z-scores to map the uncertainty introduced by the propagated error associated with the topographic variables. The technique permits greater flexibility than existing uncertainty methods that map the horizontal extension of the elevation data at the 95% confidence level.

The tools are highly modular and may be linked together in ArcGIS workflows to perform many different spatially-explicit analyses, such as modeling species' habitats, summarizing fishing effort and catch, identifying oceanographic features such as fronts and eddies, and simulating larval dispersal by ocean currents. Since July 2009, MGET has been installed over 1000 times at universities, government agencies, NGOs, and for-profit companies in 56 countries. An important step in marine spatial planning is the acquisition and analysis of biological and oceanographic data. Here, we demonstrate two approaches to this using MGET with publically-available data. In the first scenario, we show how to download point observations of marine animals for a region of interest from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) into ArcGIS and summarize biodiversity by creating fishnet grids and calculating species diversity indices for each cell. In the second scenario, we demonstrate tools that efficiently download popular oceanographic products, including remote sensing datasets from NOAA and NASA and the HYCOM and ROMS-CoSiNE ocean models, and build collections of ArcGIS rasters. We then show how to create climatological summaries (e.g. mean temperature, by month), identify oceanographic features, and illustrate the flow of ocean currents. By complementing these biological and oceanographic summaries with other pertinent data, such as marine boundaries and benthic cover data from NOAA Digital Coast, marine spatial planners can quickly assemble a comprehensive spatial database for their region of interest.

E-Estuary has three elements: an estuarine geo-referenced relational database, watershed GIS coverages, and tools to support decision-making. To facilitate data access for estuaries and associated coastal watersheds around the U.S., we are developing the Estuary Data Mapper (EDM), a stand-alone program requiring only internet access to allow users to identify, visualize, and download multi-media environmental data and geospatial coverages. The downloaded data can be imported into an ArcMap data model for estuaries and watersheds using tools developed for the ArcMap Toolbox, then used to run applications.

This makes CMECS especially valuable for synthesis of data obtained using different methods, scales, and levels of detail, an important part of coastal and marine spatial planning. CMECS is in the later stages of consideration by the Federal Geographic Data Committee as a national standard. As such, federally funded projects will be required to use CMECS or at least need to crosswalk their data into the CMECS structure. Informing various user communities and demonstrating the value of the system are essential to broad application of the standard. Coastal managers, scientists, industry representatives, and spatial analysts who typically attend the GeoTools conference are a key audience of the CMECS standard. The authors will present the CMECS standard, illustrate how various data collection technologies contribute to the CMECS framework, and educate potential users about implementation strategies."}, {"section_title": "| THURSDAY THURSDAY | 87", "text": "Tools for Fisheries Management \u00bb Kensington F"}, {"section_title": "G10. APPGEO'S SECTOR MANAGEMENT APPLICATION ENABLES NEW ENGLAND GROUND FISHERIES TO MANAGE FISHING QUOTAS Andrew Buck, Applied Geographics", "text": "AppGeo developed the Sector Manager application for the Cape Cod Commercial Hook Fisherman's Association. The Sector Manager application is designed to support the change in management of New England fisheries away from a \"days at sea\" model to one based on vessel and species quotas. The Sector Manager allows sector managers to allocate species quotas, set by NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), across vessels within the sector. The system allows for the comparative analysis of Vessel Trip Reports (catch data), dockside monitoring data, and remaining quota limitations. Catch share allocations can be traded among vessels and between sectors. An extensive set of reporting and analysis features provide the tools that are required by sector managers and fishermen to administer the quota management system and satisfy the NMFS reporting and compliance requirements. Effort points (haul locations as latitude /longitude) can be displayed in the integrated geospatial viewer to provide a grid based visual representation of catch data for comparison to overfished and other sensitive areas. The sector manager is a single user desktop application written in C# using .NET, ArcGIS Engine mapping components, and a fully relational database."}, {"section_title": "G11. LOCAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT GOES DIGITAL: IMPROVING MUNICIPAL SHELLFISHERIES MANAGEMENT WITH INTERACTIVE MAPPING TECHNOLOGY Cary Chadwick, Center for Land Use Education and Research, University of Connecticut", "text": "Connecticut's municipal shellfish commissions are responsible for managing shellfisheries within their town waters. Each commission is required to develop a comprehensive management plan that identifies appropriate sites for both recreational and commercial shellfishing activity to avoid potential social (use) conflicts and adverse environmental effects. The use of geospatial information is critical to this decision making process. Previously, data layers including distribution and abundance of marine resources, mooring positions, shellfish classification areas, water quality data and existing harvest areas have been distributed in formats ranging from hand drawn or paper maps to sophisticated GIS datasets. The variety of information and range of technical skill required to utilize these data has been an impediment for municipal managers across the state, most of which are volunteer-based, on a limited budget, and less likely to have training in geospatial technology. With help from the Connecticut Sea Grant Program and the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Aquaculture, the University of Connecticut Center for Land Use Education and Research (CLEAR) has developed an interactive online map viewer to provide the commissions with the tools and information necessary to make informed decision regarding the siting of shellfisheries in their town. The online viewer is built using ESRI's ArcGIS API for Flex which allows for the creation of rich Internet applications on top of ArcGIS Server. This presentation will include a brief description of the project needs and impacts as well as an in-depth look at how the ArcGIS Flex API web map was developed."}, {"section_title": "G12. APPLICATION OF THERMAL INFRARED REMOTE SENSING IN RIVERS AND STREAMS: UNDERSTANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF THERMAL HABITAT FOR COLD WATER FISH SPECIES Russell Faux, Watershed Sciences", "text": "Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has proven an effective method for mapping spatially-explicit surface temperature patterns in rivers and streams. The imagery is typically collected at resolutions of < 1-meter and georectified for display and analysis in a GIS environment. TIR imagery and derived datasets can illustrate the influence of surface and sub-surface inflows on main stream temperatures across multiple spatial scales. This technology has been applied extensively in the Pacific Northwest for determining the availability of thermal refugia for salmonids and other cold water fishes during the summer months. More recently, these techniques have also been applied to small coastal streams in Alaska to provide baseline data for Pacific Salmon habitat, and on tributaries of the Miramishi River, New Brunswick, Canada to study the availability of thermal habitat for Atlantic Salmon and Sea-Run Brook Trout. We will discuss the accuracy and uncertainty of TIR remote sensing for mapping stream temperatures, drawing from examples from these three systems. We will also present findings that are common across stream systems, and discuss the utility of these data towards understanding how climate change can influence the availability of thermal habitat in coastal streams across broad spatial scales. This presentation describes a USACE analysis effort, supported by the North Atlantic Division (NAD), to determine the spatial distribution and magnitude of storm impacts between Ocracoke, NC and Cape Henlopen, DE. NCMP-standard information products including topo/bathymetry digital elevation models (DEMs), bare earth DEMs, and NAVD88 0-m elevation contours are analyzed for change and presented as a suite of advanced information products for the NCMP. These include cross-shore elevation profiles, pre-/post-storm elevation difference and beach volume change images, and transect vectors that are attributed with the magnitude and direction of positional change in the NAVD88 0-m contour. Results of this analysis will lend insight into storm-driven coastal geomorphology change, and provide decision-support tools for storm mitigation at USACE."}, {"section_title": "H02. NEW JERSEY GIS-BASED STATE-WIDE BEACH-DUNE SYSTEM SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT: APPLICATIONS AND VERIFICATION Daniel Barone and Robert Koch, Coastal Research Center, Richard Stockton College of New Jersey", "text": "The State of New Jersey contains areas of eroding bluff coastlines to the north and sand barrier-spit/island complexes to the south. Many of the sand beaches and shorelines along the New Jersey coast are sand starved and have been experiencing erosion for many decades. Much of this beach erosion is due to the effects of coastal storms such as hurricanes, and more commonly, northeast storms. These storms can cause catastrophic damage to the coastal infrastructure and adversely impact the livelihood of residents and tourists in these communities. Because it has a large coastal economy, New Jersey has been the most proactive state in the USA in undertaking shore protection projects to guard against beach erosion and maintain this valuable coastal resource. The Richard Stockton College Coastal Research Center (CRC) has developed a state-wide GIS-based beach-dune system susceptibility assessment. The assessment incorporates multiple geospatial and remote sensing techniques into a knowledge-driven spatial data model. The goal of the assessment is to evaluate the performance of oceanfront beach-dune systems in response to various storm events (i.e. FEMA classified 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 50year storm events). In addition, the beach-dune susceptibility assessment provides federal, state, and local entities a useful tool to better manage a state's valuable coastal economy. Field verifications of the susceptibility model were recently carried out in Long Beach Island, NJ following a northeast storm in November 2009, which resulted in a Presidential Disaster Declaration. The field observations coincide with the susceptibility model output."}, {"section_title": "H03.

NJBPN is focused on longterm trends at sites to develop statistically meaningful information for State and local coastal zone managers. The database covers 23 years at 100 locations between Raritan Bay, the Atlantic Ocean coastline, and Delaware Bay. Each site has been visited annually in the fall since 1986. Semiannual visits, each spring and fall, began in 1994 following the passage of Public Law 155. The program was expanded to take surveys every spring following the winter northeasters and in the fall following the summer beach accretion. The field data is used to generate graphical cross section plots, which compare profiles across the width of the active coastal zone. The cross section is also used to calculate sand volume and shoreline position changes. This data aids NJDEP regulatory and planning personnel in the following ways: Determining areas of potential erosion problems. Implementing policies to protect beaches, dunes, overwash fans and erosion hazard areas (EHA), as well as reducing risks to development in these high hazard areas. Facilitating assessment of disaster impacts following future storm events. Providing useful background information, when evaluating NJDEP permit applications. Providing evidence on dune development at any site. Assisting local municipal governments in developing policies or plans for dealing with coastal erosion or improving storm preparedness. In addition to NJBPN, we will be present findings from a study of Shoreline and Landmass Migration of Little Beach, NJ. Shoreline migration and landmass movement was analyzed over the past 90 years using historical aerials, LIDAR, and 2010 survey data. Coastal Data: Fusion and Integration \u00bb Kensington B H04. THE FOREFRONT OF DATA PRODUCTION: SAVING TIME AND MONEY THROUGH AUTOMATION Aaron Lawrence, Woolpert For years Woolpert has been collecting, testing and experimenting with imagery and LiDAR data, but recent technology advances have allowed for the fusion of multi-spectral/hyper-spectral data to become a cost effective and accurate means of deriving geospatial information. With automated feature extraction, impervious surface delineation, land use classification, change detection datasets are at the fore front of this advance in technology. This presentation will demonstrate how data such as impervious surfaces, buildings, landuse/landcover classifications, etc. can now be produced through automation using multi-spectral imagery and LiDAR data. In the past, feature extraction was labor intensive, time consuming, and costly. This presentation will show how data can now be extracted, classified, and incorporated into a GIS. The presentation will also cover additional benefits of automation such as timeliness and cost-effectiveness."}, {"section_title": "H05.

There are promising data fusion approaches that will automate processes which are currently manually time intensive and subjective. With various approaches it is easy to forget about keeping the products related to a set of standards that are currently used by the public. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey (CHARTS) system with the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) through the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of eXpertise (JALBTCX). The CHARTS system is a multi-sensor platform that collects high-resolution lidar, aerial, and hyperspectral imagery for the USACE National Coastal Mapping Program (NCMP). The imagery datasets from the NCMP provides the USACE with regional scale data that are useful for engineering and environmental monitoring activities. Utilizing these regional datasets, the JALBTCX generated a basic land cover classification strategy that works nationally by combining the lidar elevation data and the hyperspectral imagery. This classification strategy started by using an arbitrary classification hierarchy and has become a highly requested product. This presentation will outline the current classification strategy, examples of uses for hurricane assessment, and the planned path to make this data fusion product compliant with the National Land Cover Database (NLCD)."}, {"section_title": "H06.

High resolution airborne lidar and hyperspectral imagery are collected along U.S. coastlines on a reoccurring basis by an integrated sensor suite, jointly operated and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) products created from these elevation data and imagery, such as 1-meter Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), 1-meter bare earth DEMs, true color orthorectified aerial image mosaics, pre-processed hyperspectral image mosaics, basic land cover classifications, and zero-contour shoreline vectors, are used to support planning, engineering, construction, operation, and maintenance activities in coastal areas. Recently, the EL teamed up with the JALBTCX to expand the use of and maximize the benefits of these data to support environmental activities. The focus of this presentation is to illustrate data fusion techniques, combining hyperspectral and lidar, as well as coastal environmental applications, such as critical coastal habitat mapping, species composition, invasive species identification, wetlands and beach characterization, and ecological modeling. Current collaborations within the USACE will also be highlighted, such as a new project using hyperspectral imagery and bathymetric lidar fusion for the discrimination and mapping of submerged aquatic vegetation. , and swath interferometry datasets from the offshore of the Merrimack River, Massachusetts was used to develop ground-truth procedures that include underwater video and grab sampling from more than 150 stations. The sampling scheme was developed based largely on backscatter and bathymetry maps produced from the acoustic surveys conducted in 2004 and 2005. The sample collection was conducted during the summer of 2009 and 2010. The compilation provides a comprehensive seafloor datasets that includes grain-size analyses, seafloor morphology and vegetation coverage. The results of the sediment analyses will be combined with images from the seafloor video and the existing bathymetry and backscatter data into an ESRI ArcMap project that allows simple archiving and presentation of the project. Data for each ground-truth station includes: the location of the grab sample, underwater video imagery, frame images of from the underwater video, the percent clay-silt-sand-gravel, rockvegetation distributions, in addition to a description determined from the MBES backscatter. Here, we present the results using the ground-truth collection, the collection standards and procedure, data products, and archive structure of the compiled datasets. The seafloor at the mouth of the Merrimack River, Massachusetts, is a complex mosaic of fluvial and coastal sediments that are reworked by currents and the seasonally variable wave conditions in the western Gulf of Maine. This study integrates a series of new closely-spaced sediment samples and acoustic data with existing geophysical data (airborne lidar bathymetry, multibeam echosounder (MBES), swath interferometry, and sidescan-sonar backscatter) to characterize the local seafloor geology, sediment distribution and surficial processes at the mouth of the Merrimack River. Sediment-sample and seafloor-video data were collected in 2009-2010 at more than 150 sites and an additional MBES survey was completed in August 2010. Here we present the preliminary results from the analyses of these datasets with a focus on the spatial distribution of the sediments discharged from the Merrimack River and their assimilation into the coastal environment of the Gulf of Maine. This study builds on existing research from a US Geological Survey regional mapping program (OFR2007-1373 -http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1373/). Using GIS and remote-sensing software, we relate the grain-size results from the new seafloor samples along with the MBES data to the existing backscatter imagery and bathymetry data. The integration of these datasets in the GIS allows us to identify fine-scale patterns of sediment distribution and surficial seafloor features that illustrate the effects that regional tides, currents and strong winter storms have on these fluvial and coastal sediments."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Mapping: Seafloor Characterization", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "H08.

First, the Center has worked to build a detailed inventory of coastal elevation data sets that gives the user an idea of data quality and links the user directly to the data, where possible. Second, FEMA recently completed a broad-brushstroke inventory of topographic data sets for each FEMA region. The Center has worked to incorporate FEMA's national inventory into the NOAA interactive viewer in order to represent elevation data holdings across the nation. Finally, USGS has coordinated further refinements and validation of the inventory through its Geospatial Liaison Network. For each data set, up to 22 attributes are provided, including data quality information, a point of contact, and if available, a direct link to the data.
