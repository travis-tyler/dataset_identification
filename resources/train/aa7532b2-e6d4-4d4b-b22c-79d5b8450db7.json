Today, various computer software is used to assist this process. The public access provided to data from wide-scale tests such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS), along with the rapid increase in the amount of data collected in social sciences have made statistical software an integral part of the quantitative research process. Muenchen (2019) determined the market shares of statistical software, concluding that IBM's SPSS Statistics program was the most preferred software in academic studies as of the end of 2018. Meanwhile, R has been referenced half as much as IBM's SPSS Statistics program in academic articles. The situation may be attributed to the ease of use of SPSS through its graphical user interface, it being used extensively by academics for many years, and SPSS being the primary software used in statistics training and education. Despite lacking the ease of use of SPSS, as the second most popular software in the field, R has gained new functionality through packages published by researchers around the world due to its open source nature. R is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (Formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues CONTACT: Murat Do\u011fan \u015eahin \uf02a mdsahin@anadolu.edu.tr \uf09b Anadolu University, Faculty of Education, Eski\u015fehir, Turkey ISSN-e: 2148-7456 /\u00a9 IJATE 2019 (R Core Team, 2019a) . GNU is an acronym for GNU is Not Unix, and is a free operating system developed by Richard Stallman in 1983 (GNU, 2019 . While R is free software developed based on this operating system, today it is capable of running on common operating systems such as GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X. Developed on the free and open software philosophy of GNU, anyone may download and use R, study its code, modify it and distribute their modifications (R Core Team, 2019a) . Screenshots of IBM SPSS Statistics v.20 and R may be compared in Figure 1 . As can be seen in Figure 1 , while R only provides the user with a console screen, IBM statistics allows users to conduct any analysis they want (albeit any analysis the developers allow) with a few mouse clicks. While R may only have a console, it can download a package developed by a researcher from another part of the world with a simple install.packages() function and conduct any analysis. The analyses users may conduct in R are 'limited' to the more than 15000 packages developed for R (R Core Team, 2019b). Additionally, users can develop their own packages and offer them for use by other researchers around the world. In this regard, while SPSS is a user-friendly program with limited functionality, R appears limitless but cumbersome in comparison. Considering researchers, especially those in social sciences, may not be skilled at coding, it's easy to understand the reasoning behind the proliferation of IBM SPSS Statistics."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Software and Resources", "text": "The prevalent use of SPSS by academics allows them to transfer this use to future generations, namely students. 11 of the results on the first page of an Amazon.com search for books on statistics for social science are for IBM SPSS Statistics, while only two are results pertaining to R (Amazon, 2019) . This situation is indicative of the prevalence of SPSS in statistics education. Teaching the use of proprietary software to undergraduate and graduate students encourages future professionals and researchers to use this proprietary software."}, {"section_title": "R and Its Graphical User Interfaces / Integrated Development Environments", "text": "As can be seen in Figure 1 , the interface of R fundamentally consists merely of a screen terminal. While functions such as package loading, package retrieval, and statistical analysis is possible through the terminal, it is clearly not user-friendly. Therefore, various interfaces and integrated development environments aiming to ease the use of R were developed. RKWard, RStudio, JASP, and Jamovi are a few of them.\nRKWard is a comprehensive interface developed for R (RKWard, 2019) . It provides access to the R terminal and allows for point-and-click analyses through its interface. The Spreadsheet function allows variable definition and data entry, correlation, regression and average comparison along with item response theory analyses. RKWard is free software and a screenshot is presented in Figure 2 . RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that has become synonymous with R (RStudio, 2019). The greatest advantage of RStudio is the easy access it provides to the objects being studied and the graphs created in R. Additionally, it simplifies working with R scripts. Furthermore, RStudio has simplified creating project folders and version tracking through git while providing the possibility of writing cleaner R code through plugins. The basic packages developed for data science in R are gathered under tidyverse in RStudio. The Shiny package, which allows the creation of a web interface for R code, is also developed by RStudio. A screenshot for RStudio is presented in Figure 3 . JASP is a simple interface software developed on R (JASP Team, 2019). JASP stands out with its support for Bayesian methods, allowing the user to conduct Bayesian t-tests and Bayesian ANOVA with a few clicks. Additionally, JASP is capable of conducting tests using a frequentist approach and has gained powerful functions such as network analysis, machine learning algorithms, meta-analysis, and structural equation modeling through current modules. JASP supports many data formats such as cxv, xls, and sav, and allows for data analysis but does not allow for data manipulation. JASP runs on GNU/Linux, Windows, and MacOS, and can also be used online through Rollapp. A screenshot of JASP is provided in Figure 4 . Another free software based on R, and the locus of this article, is Jamovi. Detailed information on Jamovi is provided in the sections below."}, {"section_title": "JAMOVI 2.1. Developers", "text": "Jamovi is being developed by a team who branched off from JASP developers and started running their own project (The Jamovi Project, 2019a). Jonathan Love, Damian Dropmann and Ravi Selker are members of this team. In their own words; \"we found that our goals and ambitions consistently went beyond their scope, and decided the best way to move forward was to found a new project: the jamovi project\" (The jamovi project, 2019b).\nPossibly the most significant point emphasized by the developers is the community-driven aspect. This means that users in the community may add new features to Jamovi by adding modules. Thus, Jamovi does not remain limited to the initiatives taken by the developer team. In this regard, Jamovi adopts a policy highly suited to the free software philosophy."}, {"section_title": "Features", "text": "Jamovi provides core functions such as data entry and manipulation, rule based data filtering and variable transformation, and computing with variables. Compatible with popular data file formats such as csv, RData, dta, and sav, Jamovi is capable of conducting many single and multiple variable analyses. Among these analyses are descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANCOVA, linear and logistic regression, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and nonparametric tests. Additionally, the module support of Jamovi allows developers to add new functionality if the so please. For example, Walrus for robust statistics and MAJOR for meta-analysis are modules developed and added to the Jamovi library. In this regard, Jamovi presents itself as a sufficient, useful, and free tool for academic research in social sciences in addition to undergraduate and graduate level statistics courses."}, {"section_title": "Installation", "text": "Once the download link on the Jamovi web site is clicked, links for two different versions of Jamovi are presented. One of them is solid, while the other is the current release. While the solid version is more stable, the current version includes the latest features of Jamovi. While both versions are available for Windows and macOS, only the current version is provided for GNU/Linux and ChromeOS. All Jamovi releases are designed for 64-bit operating systems.\nThe installation steps for Jamovi on GNU/Linux, Windows, and macOS are provided below.\nAs the steps taken are very similar to GNU/Linux, the instructions for ChromeOS are not included in this report."}, {"section_title": "Installing on GNU/Linux", "text": "Jamovi for GNU/Linux distributions may be installed through Flatpak. Flatpak is a tool for compiling and distributing desktop applications in GNU/Linux distributions. Multiple programs may be installed with a single command through Flatpak. For installation, Flatpak must be installed on GNU/Linux. Flatpak may be installed by following the instructions at https://flatpak.org/setup/. There are instructions for multiple GNU/Linux distributions at this address. Within this article, installation was conducted on Pop_OS! 19.10, a GNU/Linux distribution based on Ubuntu.\nThe following terminal command is entered for the installation of Flatpak:\nsudo apt install flatpak Following this command, the superuser (administrator) password will be requested for the sudo operation. Once the password is entered, installation begins. The Flatpak installation is confirmed through the dialog by pressing Y and the installation of Flatpak is completed. To install Flatpak programs, the Flatpak repositories need to be added. This is achieved with the following terminal command: Once the computer is restarted after this, the Terminal is opened once again and the following command is entered:\nThe dialogs are confirmed by pressing Y, and once the necessary files for Jamovi are downloaded, it is installed on the computer."}, {"section_title": "Installing on Windows", "text": "Once the desired version (solid or current) is downloaded, double clicking on the installation file initiates the installation. Once the Install button is clicked, Jamovi is installed and completed by clicking the Finish button. The three screens that appear during installation are presented in Figure 5 . "}, {"section_title": "Installing on macOS", "text": "Similar to the Windows installation, the desired version is downloaded. Double clicking on the Jamovi image within the downloaded file opens the program in a new window. This process is presented in Figure 6 . "}, {"section_title": "First Look", "text": "Following installation, Jamovi can be run by double clicking the shortcut icon. Additionally, it can be run from the terminal in GNU/Linux with the flatpak run org.jamovi.jamovi command. The first screen to be encountered in Jamovi is presented in Figure 7 . Jamovi has Data and Analyses tabs at the top left corner. The Data tab provides processes regarding variables, while the Analyses tab is used to execute data analysis processes. The window is divided basically into two panels. The data is presented in the left panel, while the analysis results are presented in the right. When data analysis is to be conducted, a menu regarding the analysis is presented instead of the data panel. The options in the data tab are presented in Figure 8 . Within the data tab, data pasting/copying, variable definition, calculation and transformation, variable addition and removal, and rule-based filtering can be conducted. A detailed image of the menus in the Analyses tab are presented in Figure 9 . In this tab, the default analyses available upon the initial installation of Jamovi are listed. New analyses added through modules are added to this section. Additionally, the assumptions of these tests may be tested using Jamovi."}, {"section_title": "Data Setup", "text": "Prior to data entry, the data must be defined. To do this, the Setup button under the Data tab is clicked and the screen presented in Figure 10 appears. In this screen, the name of the variable is defined in the section marked 1, while an explanation regarding this variable may be entered in the field marked 2 if desired. The level of measurement for the variable may be defined in the field marked 3. What is interesting is that in addition to the continuous, ordinal, and nominal options, an option labelled ID is presented. This feature is useful for when participants of a study are assigned ID numbers and greatly eases data entry. The nature of the data to be entered, whether it be integer, decimal, or text, is specified through field 4. The field marked 5 is used to define the levels of nominal variables."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "The statistical analyses that Jamovi is capable of executing by default were presented in section 2.4 First Look. The focus of this section is on how statistical analyses are conducted in Jamovi in detail, along with examples for descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, dependent samples t-tests, one-way ANOVA, correlation, linear regression, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": "To conduct descriptive statistics in Jamovi, the Descriptives option is selected from the Exploration menu. The screen presented in Figure 11 appears following these actions. As can be seen, the variables and analysis options are on the left, while the analysis results are on the right. Additionally, a reference section is presented for researchers to refer to this program in the studies in the APA style. As an example, if one were to require the descriptive statistics of total score based on sex, the sum variable is moved to Variables, while the gender variable is moved to the split by section. This is then followed by selecting the histogram graph and the Shapiro-Wilk test. The results of this analysis are presented in figure 12."}, {"section_title": "Figure 12.

This menu is presented in Figure 13 . The dependent variable is assigned to the dependent variables field, while the independent variable is assigned to the grouping variable field. For examples, to determine if there is any significant difference between the academic achievement of students in groups A and B, the findings of the independent samples t-test results are presented in Figure 14 . As can be seen, the assumption test, test results, and effect size for the independent samples t-test may be requested from the same menu and the outputs may be portrayed in the same section."}, {"section_title": "Paired Samples t Test", "text": "The comparison of the means of two dependent measurements are conducted using a paired samples t-test (Navarro & Foxcroft, 2019) . To this end, under the T-Tests button in Jomavi, the Paired Samples T-Test path is selected. Jamovi's menu for paired samples t-tests is shown in Figure 15 . In this menu, the selection between paired samples t-test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test as a nonparametric test may be done. Additionally, the assumptions to be tested may be determined as either one-way or two-way. Information regarding assumptions such as effect size, descriptive statistics and normality tests may also be requested. The results of a simple paired samples t-test with effect size and normality tests is presented in Figure 16 . As can be seen from the output, the assumption tests and paired samples t-test results are presented in the same section."}, {"section_title": "One Way ANOVA", "text": "When comparing the means of more than two groups, one-way ANOVA is used (Kline, 2009 ). In Jamovi, this is done by selecting the One Way ANOVA path under the ANOVA menu and results in a menu such as the one presented in Figure 17 . Descriptive statistics, assumption tests, and post-hoc tests are accessible through the One Way ANOVA menu in Jamovi. However, as may be noticed, post-hoc tests such as effect size and Bonferroni are not present in this section. Options for these exist under the ANOVA route of the ANOVA menu in Jamovi. This menu tree is presented in Figure 18 . The results of the analysis conducted using the options under the ANOVA menu are presented in Figure 19 . During these tests, the \u03b7 2 and partial \u03b7 2 effect size calculations were also selected, while the Bonferroni post-hoc test was selected to determine variance homogenity and normality."}, {"section_title": "Figure 19. ANOVA Output", "text": "As can be seen, the ANOVA results, effect sizes, assumption tests and post-hoc test results are presented in the same section."}, {"section_title": "Correlation", "text": "When the correlation coefficient is to be calculated to provide information regarding the direction and size of a relationship between two variables (Warner, 2008) , the Regression menu in Jamovi is chosen and the Correlation Matrix is selected. This is followed by a menu presented to users as portrayed in Figure 20 . Using this menu, the variables for which a correlation coefficient is to be calculated are selected, and either one, several, or all of the options for Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, or Kendall's tau-b coefficient are selected. The researcher selects the appropriate options of meaningful coefficients, confidence intervals, graphs for the correlation matrix, and the one-way or two-way nature of the hypotheses being tested. An example for the correlation test output is presented in Figure 21 . As shown, a correlation matrix was created from the correlation coefficients between the three variables. Additionally, two types of correlation coefficients were reported with their p values as both Pearson and Spearman were selected."}, {"section_title": "Linear Regression", "text": "When one or more predictor variable and one dependent variable is to be estimated, linear regression is utilized (Navarro & Foxcroft, 2019) . To execute linear regression in Jamovi, Linear Regression is selected under the Regression menu as shown in Figure 22 . In this menu, predictor and dependent variables may be defined, and from the assumption control section autocorrelation tests, collinearity statistics, normality tests, and residual plots may be requested. In addition to the R, R 2 , and adjusted R 2 values to determine the fit of the regression model, RMSE, F test, AIC and BIC values may also be calculated. Furthermore, standardized coefficients may be retrieved from the Model Coefficients section. The output of a simple multiple regression analysis is provided in Figure 23 . As can be seen from the output, the Durbin-Watson statistic, VIF, and Tolerance values along with the coefficients of the variables in the model are calculated. Additionally, if the F Test is selected in the Model Fit section, the meaningfulness of the model as a whole is tested."}, {"section_title": "Exploratory Factor Analysis", "text": "In order to reveal the findings of the construct validity of a measurement tool, EFA is used when there is no strong a priori regarding the components of the structure intended to measure (Henson & Roberts, 2006) . PCA is also used for similar purposes to EFA when there is no strong a priori regarding the structure and it is thought to be equivalent to EFA; however, the mathematics it uses makes simple mathematical groupings instead of revealing the latent variable in behavioural sciences, and therefore, it is thought to give biased results (Fokkema & Grieff, 2017) . The screen of an EFA in practice is presented in Figure 24 . Firstly, all of the items required to be within the scope of the analysis are entered into the box on the right. From the Method heading in the menu, the Extraction section is used to select Exploratory Factor Analysis. The Rotation section right beneath contains the oblique or orthogonal rotation methods to be used in creating the factor structure. The Number of Factors section refers to the method to be used in determining the number of factors and contains the options for Eigenvalue or Parallel Analysis (Horn, 1965) . Also in this section, the option to limit the number of dimensions based on an a priori is presented. On the top right of the menu, in the section regarding the testing of the assumptions of the analysis, the options for Bartlett's test and KMO which is an analysis regarding the factorizability of items are selectable. In the Factor Loadings section right beneath lies a section in which the lowest factor load to be reported can be determined. In the Additional Output section of the analysis, options such as Scree plot, and Model fit measures to obtain fit indices similar to interdimensional correlation or structural equation modeling applications are presented. An output exemplifiying this practice is shown in Figure 25 . "}, {"section_title": "Confirmatory Factor Analysis", "text": "CFA is used to determine whether or not the predicted structure is present in the dataset at hand in cases where a strong a priori regarding the structure is apparent to the researcher (Brown, 2015) . Therefore, it may be stated that CFA is used when a new or previously developed scale for a structure with theoretically sound dimensions is to be used on a different sample or adapted to a different culture. An example for a 5-item single dimension scale in a CFA application is presented in Figure 26 . In the top of the screen seen in Figure 26 , the section in which the dimensions for the items to be analyzed are defined can be seen. Here, the latent variable is given a name and the items related to it are moved to the box below it. If there is more than one dimension in the scale, the \"Add new factor\" command is clicked and in the new box that opens, the same process for the first latent variable is repeated for the new factor. The Residual Covariances tab is used to define the covariance between the residual variances of the observed variable to improve the model-data fit when necessary. However, to conduct this operation, the Figure 27 . 2.6.9. Reliability Reliability, in a broad sense, refers to the degree to which the measurement tool is free of random faults (Baykul, 2000) . While reliability also has other definitions and meanings, its most frequent use is through the Cronbach Alpha (\u03b1) coefficient as an indicator of internal consistency due to its applicability and interpretability (Padilla & Divers, 2016) . In addition to Cronbach's \u03b1, Jamovi also allows for the reporting of McDonald's Omega (\u03c9) coefficient, which has lately been included in recent research as \"composite reliability\", as an indicator of reliability in the sense of internal consistency. The Reliability tab under the Factor option in Jamovi results in the screen shown in Figure 28 . On the screen portrayed in Figure 28 , first the items to be used in the analysis are selected and moved to the box on the right. In the Scale Statistics section, the options to request Cronbach's \u03b1 and McDonald's \u03c9 coefficients along with the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the scale are presented. Under the Item Statistics section are values regarding items. Here, the change in the reliability coefficient, arithmetic means of the items, and standard deviation in the event that any one item is removed from the scale along with the correlation of each individual item with the test as a whole may be requested. In the Additional Options section, the correlation of items with each other is presented with a heat map. The Reverse Scaled Items tab at the bottom aids in determining items with inverted meanings to speed up processes. The outputs of Reliability analyses are shown in Figure 29 .
