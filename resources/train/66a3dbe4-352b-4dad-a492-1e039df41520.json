[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Recent work looking at any concurrencies between seasonal-mean changes to regional Hadley circulation (HC) and the meridional distribution of tropical cyclones (TCs) revealed an interesting inverse association between the genesis and lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) latitudes of TCs in the eastern North Pacific (Studholme and Gulev, 2018; hereafter SG18) . This result is not only particularly curious because of the high degree of shared detrended covariance between these two phenomena, the coefficient of determination being approximately 1/3 rd of the interannual variability, but also since it is not found in any other TC-spawning ocean basin. While comparable magnitude concurrency was found between HC terminus latitudes (alternatively referred to as HC extent), the actual strength of the overturning itself was found to be relevant only in this specific ocean basin.\nRelatively robust environmental controls on TC distribution have been both quantitively (e.g. Emanuel, 1988 Emanuel, , 1995 Bister and Emanuel, 1998) and qualitatively (e.g. Emanuel and Nolan, 2004; Tippett et al., 2011) well established, although significant issues remain in implementing and interpreting these, particularly with regards to the qualitative indices and how they relate to tropical cyclogenesis (e.g. Tory et al., 2018) . At the same time, over the last decade or so it has been shown that the first-principle theoretical model for an axisymmetric HC at the nearly inviscid limit derived in and around the 1980s (Schneider, 1977; Held and Hou, 1980; Linzen and Hou, 1988) does not agree with eddy resolving numerical model simulations (e.g. Schneider, 2006) . The reason for this may be understood by"}, {"section_title": "\u0412 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u041e\u0431\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430 | In remembrance of Alexander Obukhov", "text": "4 considering the mean zonal momentum balance in the upper troposphere above the Hadley cells with regards to the local Rossby number (Ro = \u2212\u03b6 \u0305 / ; Levine and Schneider, 2011) . Eddy momentum fluxes may only be ignored at the limit Ro \u00ae1.\nIn nature, the Ro in upper branches of the HC is ~0.4 and thus eddy momentum fluxes are non-negligible and we lack an appropriate theoretical model within to understand HC dynamics.\nReconciling these vast open fundamental theoretical questions is well beyond the scope of this short research note. We must also be careful not to project causality upon this curious local association in the eastern North Pacific. The aim therefore of this paper is to present and provide a discussion of the large-scale zonal-mean changes in the atmospheric-oceanic state associated with a weakening of the local HC and an equatorward shift in tropical cyclogenesis and LMI latitudes. Data and methods are given in the subsequent section before the presentation of the results in section 3. The manuscript ends with a summary and terse discussion.\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Data and Methodology", "text": "Here we use data related to TCs and the large-scale ocean-atmospheric state.\nThe TC record is taken from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS), version 03r10 (Knapp et al., 2010) . We use the same data processing procedure as in SG18 which is largely based on the general principles discussed in Schreck et al. (2014) . For brevity here we only reproduce results using The meridional overturning streamfunction, , is derived from the divergent winds computed from the ERA-Interim reanalysis (Dee et al., 2011) . The same reanalysis is used for data on sea surface temperature (SST), tropospheric temperature, relative humidity, vertical shear (200 -850 hPa wind vector difference), and cloud liquid and ice water content. These data were downloaded at \u00be\u00b0 x \u00be\u00b0 spatial resolution and monthly-mean temporal resolution. Zonal averaging is done over the eastern North Pacific region between 105\u00b0W-150\u00b0W. Small (\u00b110\u00b0) deviations either side of these boundaries were found to not alter the results.\nTemporal averaging is done over the July-August-September-October (JASO) period, defined as the boreal TC season. Timeseries for the divergent overturning intensity in the boreal Hadley cell is computed using the method detailed in SG18.\nBriefly, the intensity of the cell is taken as the vertically averaged maximum value of the JASO-mean between 900 and 200 hPa within the cell. The Ni\u00f1o3 index (SST anomaly over 5\u00b0S-5\u00b0N, 150\u00b0W-90\u00b0W) is computed from ERA-Interim. What we refer to here as 'strong El Ni\u00f1o' and 'strong La Ni\u00f1a' years are those that occur when the JASO-mean Ni\u00f1o3 index is within the 90 th and 10 th percentiles respectively. This makes the strong El Ni\u00f1o years 1982 Ni\u00f1o years , 1987 Ni\u00f1o years , 1997 Ni\u00f1o years , and 2015 ."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "The strong La Ni\u00f1a years are 1988, 1999, 2007 and 2010 ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "a.

Local Hadley Circulation characteristics and interseasonal variability", "text": "HC is climatologically very weak and shallow in the eastern North Pacific (figure 2a). It is the region of weakest HC of all ocean basins that experience TCs.\nIn fact, it also experiences no real zonal overturning (i.e. local Walker circulation)\nto speak of either and it is also not exposed to a strong subtropical jet like its counterparts (e.g. Schwendike et al. 2014) . This latter point is worth noting in particular since SG18 hypothesized that the local zonal atmospheric flow and the Walker circulation in the eastern Pacific might be the root cause of this curious association. This suggestion may now be discarded. Although luckily, these issues mostly relate only to the determination of HC terminus latitudes and not to overturning intensity. 1982, 1986, 1987, 1994, 1997, 2002, 2009, 2014, 2015 for P(75) and 1988, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 for P(25) .\nThe years of the most intense HC in the Northern Hemisphere demonstrate a strong association between the strength of the cell and its depth ( figure 3a) .

In the Northern Hemisphere, at TC latitudes these changes are ~2.5 ms "}, {"section_title": "Summary and discussion", "text": "Here we have shown that the curious inverse relationship between HC intensity, and tropical cyclogenesis and LMI latitudes in the eastern North Pacific can be understood to be the result an equatorward shift in the ITCZ and a moderate reduction of tropical vertical shear. The magnitude of the vertical shear changes is low enough to suggest that the primary physical mechanism behind this inverse relationship is the equatorward shift in the ITCZ. Since a significant proportion of tropical cyclone genesis results from convective vortices being shed from the ITCZ this explains the observed association.\nIt follows therefore that a more intense boreal Hadley cell is associated with a more equatorward JASO ITCZ. This warrants brief comment here but it largely beyond the scope of the present objective. In the absence of robust physical theory for the ITCZ proper, typically the observation that the ITCZ latitude ( 3456 ) is proportional to the cross-equatorial atmospheric energy transport (H) is used to understand ITCZ shifts (e.g. Schneider et al., 2014) . This is given by the difference between the two hemispheres' (\u2206) respective atmospheric energy influx by shortwave (S) and longwave (L) radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere, and aggregate surface radiative and turbulent fluxes (O) (Kang et al., 2009 "}]
