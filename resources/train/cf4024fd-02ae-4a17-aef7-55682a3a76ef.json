[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Public schools across the United States are educating an increasing number and diversity of immigrant students. Unfortunately, little is known about their performance relative to native-born students and the extent to which the \"nativity gap\" might be explained by school and demographic characteristics. This article takes a step toward filling that void using data from New York City where 17 percent of elementary and middle school students are immigrants. We explore disparities in performance between foreign-born and native-born students on reading and math tests in three ways-using levels (unadjusted scores), \"value-added\" scores (adjusted for prior performance), and an education production function. While unadjusted levels and value-added measures often indicate superior performance among immigrants, disparities are substantially explained by student and school characteristics. Further, while the nativity gap differs for students from different world regions, disparities are considerably diminished in fully specified models. We conclude with implications for urban schools in the United States."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In 2000 immigrants exceeded 11 percent of the U.S. population, the highest level since 1930 and more than twice the twentieth-century low of 4.7 percent reached in 1970. In large cities, immigrants are particularly important-an astonishing 59.5 percent of the population of Miami was foreign-born in 2000, and a more \"modest\" 35.9 percent of New Yorkers (Singer 2004) . As this wave of immigration adds ethnic and economic diversity to the adult population in the United States, the population of school children is changing as well. Public schools across the nation-and particularly urban public schools-educate an increasing number and diversity of immigrant students speaking a wide array of languages and hailing from a broad spectrum of countries and cultures around the world (Qin-Hilliard, Feinauer, and Quiroz 2001) . At the same time, little is known about their performance relative to native-born students. Are there differences in the performance of immigrant and native-born students beyond what would be predicted by the differences in the sociodemographic and educational characteristics of these groups? What role do schools play? Are public schools failing our immigrant students?\nThere are at least four reasons to be concerned about the academic performance of immigrant students. The first stems from a concern about equity. While there may be little consensus on how best to address the needs of immigrant students, the notion that students' education should not depend upon their country of birth per se seems to have fairly broad appeal. To many, equity would require that two similar students differing only in their birth country should be treated equally by their schools. A second reason stems from a concern about the impact of immigrants on native-born students. Do immigrants serve to enhance or dilute the quality of the peer group for nativeborn students? A third, related concern is that immigrants may increase the pressure on schools already burdened by the challenges of new accountability measures, including, for example, those imposed by the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2002. Whether (or to what extent) schools have the capacity to deal with new or different demands created by inflows of immigrant students is key to understanding the impact of immigration on education. Finally, one might be concerned about the impact immigrants may have on the economy if they do not succeed in American schools. Will an inadequate education cause them to become a drag on the economy upon entering the labor force? Given the large flows of immigrants into U.S. urban areas, the productivity of the U.S. labor force in the twenty-first century will be influenced by how well urban school districts succeed in teaching immigrants. Thus, understanding the success or failure of immigrant children is important, and the dearth of research-due, perhaps, to the scarcity of data on immigrant children-is problematic.\nThe New York City school system provides an excellent opportunity to study the performance of public school immigrant students, defined here as foreign-born. Of the 600,000-plus students in New York's public elementary and middle schools, almost 17 percent are immigrants; they originate in over 200 countries and speak over 160 languages and dialects. Moreover, we were able to obtain detailed administrative data on New York City public school children, including information on their country of birth.\nIn this study, then, we examine and explore the disparity in performance between foreign-born and native-born students, which we term the \"nativity gap,\" for two cohorts of fifth and eighth graders. We explore the nativity gap in performance on both reading and math tests in three ways-using level measures of performance (that is, comparing raw or unadjusted scores), using \"value-added\" measures of performance (adjusting for prior academic performance), and, ultimately, using an education production function (controlling for a range of student and school characteristics). We then explore the extent to which the coefficients of the production function differ between native and foreign-born students. Finally, we analyze differences between immigrants from different regions of origin.\nTo preview the results, we find that the difference in unadjusted test scores varies by grade. While fifth-grade immigrants perform better than the nativeborn, suggesting a positive nativity gap, in the eighth grade, immigrant and native-born students do about equally well. Value-added analyses, however, consistently indicate an immigrant advantage; immigrants gain more over a school year than native-born students do. Controlling for the full range of individual and school characteristics in a fully specified education production function framework, however, reduces the estimated nativity gap. In the end, the results from the fully specified model indicate that the immigrant advantage is positive but smaller in magnitude than the unadjusted test scores. At the same time, our regional analyses suggest that while the unadjusted disparities in test scores between regions can be substantively significant, the magnitudes of these disparities are diminished in the fully specified model.\nThe implication is that much of the difference between the native-born and the foreign-born and between immigrants from different world regions derives from differences in their underlying characteristics, such as poverty and language skills. There is virtually no evidence to suggest that immigrants are treated inequitably or discriminated against, nor is there evidence to indicate that immigrants form a low-performing peer group for the native-born. Further, the relative success of immigrants in their early education may allay concern over their entry into the labor market. To be clear, our analyses are limited to students entering the American educational system at a relatively young age-while still in elementary or middle school-and results for high-school-age entrants may well be different. A study of the experience and education of later cohorts is a critical next step for researchers. And we examine disparities over a period of only one year. Over the longer run, the nativity gap may widen, shrink, or even reverse itself. This, too, is worthy of further study.\nIn the next section we discuss alternative explanations for a nativity gap, and in section 3 we review relevant literature on the size of the nativity gap. We present our model and methods in section 4, the data used in the empirical work in section 5. Results are discussed in section 6, and in section 7 we present conclusions."}, {"section_title": "WHY SHOULD NATIVITY MATTER?", "text": "Prior research on immigrant education has offered a variety of explanations for differences in performance between immigrant and native-born students in the United States. Some explanations explore the implications of differences between immigrants and native-born students, whether driven by selective migration, settlement patterns in the United States, or underlying differences between the United States and their home country. Other explanations look to differences in the experience of immigrants upon arrival in the United States.\nTo begin, immigrant students may differ, on average, from native-born students in their family and home circumstances in ways that influence academic performance. Differences in family income, wealth and/or education, for example, may well translate into differences in academic achievement, following the well-established link between these factors and student performance. Or there may be differences in family composition, such as number and ages of siblings or parental marital status and history. To the extent that family composition matters to achievement, differences in composition may drive differences between immigrant and native-born students. (See Kao [1999] and Glick and White [2003] for typical examples of quantitative studies that control for these kinds of factors.)\nA second set of explanations focuses on differences in school readiness and prior academic experiences. While both immigrant and native-born students may learn a language other than English as a first language, limited English proficiency is undoubtedly more common among immigrants than among native-born students, and this difference may well lead to differences in academic performance, not only in literacy and language arts but also in other areas, such as mathematics, in which progress may be impeded by limited English skills. (See Gandara et al. [2003] and Bleakley and Chin [2004] for evidence of the relationship between English language proficiency and school or market outcomes.) Equally important, immigrants enter U.S. schools having had a wide range of prior academic experience in their home country; some will be well prepared and others disadvantaged. For example, Russians and other Eastern Europeans emigrate from countries with highly developed comprehensive educational systems, including rigorous math education; and these students may be better prepared in some areas than their native-born peers. In other cases, immigrant students such as Mexicans or Dominicans hale from countries with less rigorous and comprehensive educational systems and are less well prepared than their native-born peers. Of course, selective migration may well mean that the preparation of immigrant students differs markedly from the typical experience in their birth country. That said, the important insight is that differences in prior academic experience means the nativity gap may be positive or negative, favoring immigrants or the native-born.\nA third explanation offered for differences between immigrants and nativeborn students looks to attitudinal differences between these populations. To put it simply, some researchers have cited the positive attitude of immigrants toward education as well as the support and encouragement that immigrant parents provide their children as reasons that immigrant children may succeed particularly well in the United States (Waters 1999) .\nIn a somewhat different vein, a fourth set of explanations looks to differences in school and classroom experiences between immigrants and nativeborn students. Residential location patterns may lead immigrants to attend different schools than native-born students; and whether driven by teacher location preferences, the idiosyncrasies of resource allocation formulas, the schooling preferences of parents, differences in political power, or discrimination per se, the implication is that immigrants' schools may have different resources and teachers. (Note, however, that Schwartz and Stiefel [2004] find few differences in resources between the schools attended by immigrant and native-born students in New York City elementary schools beyond those predicted by differences in student educational traits.) Differences in schools attended may mean that immigrants are exposed to different peers than nativeborn students, perhaps to more immigrants or more students with limited English proficiency. (See Ellen et al. [2002] for some evidence that immigrants are only slightly segregated in New York City schools.) Of course, there may be differences within schools and even within classrooms as well-due to ability grouping, differences in preferences, or language skills, say, or even driven by the teachers' and other school personnel's attitudes toward and expectations of immigrants. As before, whether these favor or harm immigrant students cannot be predicted theoretically but must be determined empirically.\nFinally, differences may be driven by the legal status of immigrants and their parents. While foreign-born students may be citizens and children of U.S. citizens, they (and/or their parents) may be green card holders, temporary residents, or of uncertain legal status. While the impact of these legal status differences may not be direct, they may indirectly influence performance through mobility, incomes, access to supplementary services, or other pathways.\nNotice that all of these pathways suggest that the immigrant experience is unlikely to be singular. Instead, there will be considerable variation across immigrants. Indeed, sociological research suggests that the experience of immigrants and their assimilation over time can follow very different paths depending on their own characteristics and their reception in this country, among others factors.\n1 As an example, some have argued that political refugees from Cuba (pre-1980) To summarize, there are many reasons that the academic performance of immigrant and native-born students may differ. Some involve differences in the students and/or their family and neighborhood context; some involve differences in schools; some vary with time and age while others are timeinvariant. These explanations for differences may imply differences in the mean level of performance of immigrants, ceteris paribus, or in their responsiveness to school inputs, family background, and so on. As described below, we operationalize this notion in our empirical work by examining the extent to which disparities persist, even after controlling for differences in student 1. Sociologists identify three assimilation paths distinguished both by their trajectories toward or away from native-born performance and their application to first, second (native-born child with at least one foreign-born parent), and third (or native-born with native-born parents) generations. In straight-line assimilation, the first generation performs worse than the native-born, but subsequent generations do as well or better. In optimistic assimilation, the first generation performs better due to parental determination or optimism. Segmented assimilation describes the differences in paths that reflect the context in which the immigrant group is received. (For more information see Suarez-Orozco and Suarez-Orozco [1995] or Hirschman [2001] .) variables, and exploring whether the coefficients in the regression equations differ between the native and the foreign-born.\nTo be more specific, we include measures of student prior academic performance, poverty, race, gender, age, time in system, language ability, and learning disabilities, and control for school characteristics using school fixed effects. We are not, however, able to include measures of family context, such as parental education, number of parents or others in household, or attitudes toward school, which have been found to be important in much previous research, suggesting that even our fullest specifications are incomplete, and, to the extent that the omitted factors vary with nativity, some nativity gap should emerge. Further, these limitations in the data mean that we are not able to disentangle the specific importance of each of these explanations. Instead, this work takes a step toward that goal, laying the foundation for further work on this subject."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "In sharp contrast to the large volume of research examining the gap in performance between racial/ethnic groups in the United States, there is scant quantitative research examining disparities between immigrants and nativeborn students to complement the rich qualitative, ethnographic studies of immigrants from specific regions or countries, a small number of which are cited above. Thus, in addition to looking at the literature on immigrants per se, our work has also been informed by the far larger research literature that has examined the gap in performance between racial/ethnic groups using the type of data that are available for this study.\nAs shown in Table 1 , there are seven recent studies of immigrant student academic performance that use individual-level data to examine the performance of immigrant students at the K-12 level.\n2 All use samples of adequate to large size (ranging from 1,225 to 207,609 individual students). They mostly focus on the late elementary and early high school grades (fourth to eighth); only two (4, 6) use students as old as tenth and twelfth graders. All but two studies (4, 5) analyze the determinants of scores themselves rather than added value in scores (or how those scores change over time). Additionally, all control in some way for race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and language background, while some add more variables on schools or, in the case of one (5), include district or school fixed effects. The findings are mixed. Among those examining scores in levels, firstgeneration (foreign-born) students often outperform native-born students 2. These seven studies are all we have located that use individual data and focus specifically on the differences between immigrants and native-born K-12 students. In levels, 1980s immigrants perform worse than native-born (0 to-.56 sd); in 1990s, they perform better (0 to 0.31 sd).\nIn changes, immigrants about on par with native-born. Dropout rates same for immigrants and native-born. (1, 2, 3), although distinguishing students by country of origin (1, 6, 7) yields mixed results-immigrants from only some regions or countries show superior performance. The authors attribute these mixed results to reception of immigrants in their destination country-welcomed due to political asylum versus tolerated in order to fill low-skilled jobs, for example (the latter perform less well). In some studies, race plays a critical role: black students, in particular, are more likely to show no difference from native-born black students, at least in the second generation. The two studies that take a value-added perspective by controlling for previous test scores (4, 5) show either no difference in performance between foreign-born and native-born or superior performance of foreign-born for only one race (Hispanic, 5) .\nIn summary, the evidence across studies on the whether immigrants perform better or worse than native-born students mostly finds superior performance by immigrants in the first generation. Analyses distinguishing the origin country or region of the world yield mixed results and thus a more nuanced version of immigrant performance. Few studies use value-added measures of performance (changes in scores), but when they do, the positive effect of immigrant status is often eliminated. Taken together, these studies complement the large body of qualitative research, but their data sets are typically limited in size and in the range of origin countries and regions represented, often only a small number. Further, the treatment of previous academic performance is typically limited.\nWhile the quantitative research on the nativity gap is small, the large literature on the racial gap in test scores provides valuable insights and a useful perspective. In recent years, a significant body of work has examined the extent to which differences in socioeconomic background and school characteristics explain the magnitudes and trajectories of gaps in performance between racial/ethnic groups in the United States; studies in this area typically focus on the black-white test score gap. As an example, Nowell (1998, 1999) , using data from six large nationally representative surveys conducted between 1965 and 1992, find that the .7 to 1.0 standard deviation black-white twelfth-grade test score gap is reduced by less than half when adjustments are made for socioeconomic factors. Cook and Evans (2000) , using National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data on thirteen-year-olds between 1970 and 1988, explore the reduction in the black-white test score gap (i.e., the difference in the percentage correct dropped from 17.0 to 9.6 in reading and 17.6 to 11.6 in math) due to family and school factors.\n3 They find that 25 percent of these changes can be attributed to shifts in family and school characteristics, 3. To give a sense of magnitudes, the average percentage correct for whites was 63.7 in reading in 1988.\nwhile 75 percent can be attributed to reductions within schools. Finally, in a more recent paper, using the kindergarten through first grade cohort from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS), Fryer and Levitt (2004) find that the black-white test score gap disappears for children entering kindergarten when socioeconomic status and several other background factors are controlled. 4 Between the beginning of kindergarten and the end of first grade, however, the adjusted gap increases to 0.2 standard deviations. Moreover, in an extension using additional years of ECLS, Fryer and Levitt (2005) find that the black-white gap increases by 0.1 standard deviations each year between the beginning of kindergarten and the end of third grade. These studies of racial test score gaps are similar in spirit to the ones on the nativity gap in that they attempt to explain the disparity in performance by compositional differences in student socioeconomic or educational characteristics or by differences in schools. They differ in that they generally find that large gaps persist even though controls for student and school differences are systematically used. Our study builds on these two literatures, applying the tools developed to explore the race gap to study the nativity gap. We begin with an analysis of raw scores for orientation. We then turn to value-added analyses, since ascertaining how student and school resources affect the flow of achievement is most relevant for education policy. Thus our study contributes to the literature by exploring value-added models of academic performance, analyzing the extent to which models vary between immigrants and nativeborn students by examining the interaction between immigrant status and other individual characteristics and by exploring the performance of students from twelve world regions, spanning the globe."}, {"section_title": "MODEL AND METHODS", "text": "We estimate three sets of regression models. The first set estimates the nativity gap between foreign-born and native-born students; the second explores differences in the coefficients of the production function between foreign and native-born students; and the third examines differences in the nativity gap across immigrants from different world regions.

Alternative specifications estimated using instrumental variables to control for the potential endogeneity of school resources yielded similar results and are available from the authors.\nlearning disabilities, time of arrival into the school system, and prior test score as a proxy for all prior education performance; and school fixed effects to capture school differences in resources or peers or any other school specific variables. Finally, we include a dummy variable that captures differences in performance between the foreign-born and the native-born, whether due to unmeasured characteristics such as parents' education and attitudes, within school differences in treatment by teachers or others, or the context of reception, etc., as described above. To be specific, the resulting education production function model is:\nwhere i, j, and t index student, school, and year, respectively; italics represent vectors; Test is the student's normalized score on a citywide math or reading test (and its lagged value Test i, j,t-1 ); Foreign is an indicator that takes a value of one if the student is born in a country outside the United States; Sociodem is a vector of variables capturing the student's poverty status (measured by eligibility for free or reduced price lunch), gender, age, and race; Education is a vector of variables capturing the student's educational characteristics, including English language abilities and participation in part-time special education programs; Cohort represents a set of dummy variables indicating the year of admission to the New York City public schools (with \"Admission Cohort 1993\" indicating first admission five or more years ago); and School is a set of school fixed effects."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Our education variables include an unusually rich specification of variables relating to experience with and proficiency in the English language. One dummy variable indicates whether a language other than English is the primary language spoken at home. A second variable captures whether the student was given the Language Assessment Battery (LAB), a test for English language proficiency (Took LAB). A third variable is the score the student earned on the LAB, if taken, and a final variable indicates whether the student scored at or below the fortieth percentile, the cutoff score determining eligibility for services to address limited English proficiency (LEP). Taken together, these provide a more nuanced view of the relationship between performance and language than the more usual specifications in the literature, which include only a LEP indicator. Thus, the coefficient on home language, for example, captures the 6. For more on education production functions see Hanushek (1986) , or more recently McEwan (2003) or Todd and Wolpin (2003) for a good presentation of the theory of education production functions.\ndifference in performance between children from English-speaking homes and non-English-speaking homes, controlling for the child's measured English proficiency. Some caution is warranted, however, in interpreting these coefficients because of the correlation between language skills and unobserved background and family characteristics. Notice that the three testing variables offer a particularly interesting interpretation: the coefficient on Took LAB indicates the difference between students who do and do not take the LAB; the LAB score coefficient indicates the way in which performance on the standardized test varies with English language proficiency; and the coefficient on LEP (LAB less than 40) indicates how much performance is higher (or lower) for students who are LEP-eligible, compared to otherwise similar students. To put it differently, Took LAB indicates whether there is a discontinuity in the relationship between performance in reading and the LAB score at the point of LEP eligibility. Thus, it provides a regression discontinuity estimate of the impact of LEP eligibility on performance. 7 Finally, the inclusion of the admission cohort variables is unusual but important in this context for three reasons: (1) there may be unobserved differences in cohorts, for example, due to differences in U.S. immigration policies or international conditions; 8 (2) performance may be influenced by the amount of time a student has had to acclimate or adjust to new conditions; and (3) performance may be shaped by the grade of entry. 9 Since these factors may also be important for native-born children, we include them as a control variable for all students."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "Before estimating equation (1), we present results of a parsimonious test score regression including only the foreign-born dummy as a regressor. Here, \u03b2 1 measures the mean difference in performance between foreign-born and native-born students. Our seond specification introduces two controls for prior performance: a dummy variable indicating whether a lagged test score was available and the lagged test score (which takes a value of zero if there is no prior test score). In this model, \u03b2 1 captures the disparity between immigrant and native-born students in the value added to their scores between years.\n7. See Jacob (2004) for more on regression discontinuity designs and an application to special educational programs or Matsudaira (2004) for an analysis of bilingual education and ESL programs. 8. For example, U.S. immigration policy may be focused on refugees from particular countries (e.g., Vietnamese or Haitians) or on family unification. 9. As an example, a student entering in second grade is virtually certain to be a \"new kid\" among peers, most of whom entered at a common articulation grade, typically kindergarten. 10. Of course the native-born prior educational experiences were most likely obtained in U.S. schools, while the foreign-born may have prior education elsewhere in the United States or in their birth country or other locations. These dummies capture the impacts of any differences in cohorts unmeasured by other model variables.\nNotice that this specification is nonstandard. While many studies use samples limited to students with prior test score data, this seems inappropriate here because recent immigrants would be disproportionately represented among those excluded on this basis. 11 Our final specification follows equation (1), adding student characteristics and school fixed effects to the independent variables. Our second set of analyses considers whether the production function differs for foreign-born and native-born students. Do the coefficients suggest differences in the impact of language proficiency, say, or poverty? To do so, we estimate equation (1) with a complete set of interactions between the regressors and the foreign-born dummy:\nHere, then, the \u03b3 's capture the differences between the two groups. Our third set of analyses investigates differences in the performance of immigrants from different world regions, replacing the single foreign-born dummy in equation (1) with a series of region dummies (Region) indicating the student's birth region.\nWe follow the same procedure as outlined earlier: first, estimating a parsimonious model, resulting in mean differences in performance across regions; second, controlling for prior performance, yielding estimates of the differences 11. We include only students with a current-year test scores. In the 1997-98 fifth grade, we exclude roughly 2 percent of the native-born and one quarter of the foreign-born, virtually all of whom have a home language other than English, roughly 80 percent are LEP and recent immigrants, pointing to the importance of controlling for language proficiency and recentness of immigration, as we have done. The excluded foreign-born may well be higher performing-they are better-off, younger, and more likely to be Asian and white than the excluded native-born. These variables are included in our regressions. Alternatively, the potential selection bias could have been addressed by a Heckman-style selection correction, if we were able to identify variables that predict participation but not the test score, which we were unable to do. Finally, estimating a specification with the interaction of the missing flag and foreign-born yielded insignificant coefficients. 12. The appendix provides countries by region. Schwartz, Stiefel, and Conger (2002) Table 2 , samples are large, ranging from 57,152 to 72,509, and immigrants often outperform the native-born-consistently in the fifth grade and never lower in the eighth grade. The value-added analyses are even more consistent: in all cases, immigrants earn higher scores, roughly on the order of one-tenth of a standard deviation and ranging from a low of .037 to a high of .148 standard deviations. While these differences are modest, if continued over many grades, substantial gaps would accumulate, favoring immigrants.\nNotice, however, that there are many differences between the native-and the foreign-born students. As shown in Table 3 , approximately 14 percent of the roughly 65,000 fifth graders and one-fifth of the nearly 57,500 eighth graders in our 1997-98 samples are foreign-born. 15 Immigrants are more likely to be poor. They are disproportionately Asian and are less likely to be black or Hispanic; however, there is little difference in the percentage of whites. Not surprisingly, immigrants are far more likely to come from homes in which the language spoken is other than English; more likely to take the LAB; more likely to score lower on the LAB if they take it; and more likely to score below the LEP cutoff point. As a result, while nearly all native-born students have taken reading and math tests in the previous academic year (roughly 95 percent), a smaller percentage of the foreign-born have taken these standardized tests 13. Data were generously provided by the New York City Department of Education. 14. To calculate z-scores, one subtracts the mean for the grade and year and divides by the standard deviation. Using z-scores facilitates comparisons across tests and years; equations are estimated separately. 15. Any student reporting a country of birth other than the United States or its territories is considered foreign-born. Thus, some (exceedingly small) number of students termed foreign-born here may have been born abroad to U.S. citizens. Further, native-born students include those born in Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories or in the United States to foreign-born parents. Contact authors for information on the 2000-1 sample.

Native-born students on average have attended New York City schools for a longer period. By the fifth grade, native-born students average nearly five years in the public schools, which is consistent with kindergarten entry. The average for foreignborn students, on the other hand, is less than four years, consistent with entry in the first grade. By the eighth grade, the difference has widened: native-born students average 7.7 years in the New York City public schools, again suggesting the dominance of kindergarten entry; while foreign-born students have an average tenure of only 5.2 years, reflecting entry throughout the elementary and middle school years.\nInterestingly, there are differences in the schools attended by foreignborn and native-born students (not shown), which will be captured in our 16 .

How much of a gap exists, and how much is explained by these factors, are empirical questions to which we now turn."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Fifth Grade", "text": "As shown in Table 4 , the 1997-98 fifth-grade reading and math results point consistently to an immigrant advantage. In reading, the foreign-born 17. Information on the differences in schools is available from the authors. See also Ellen et al. (2002) . score an average 0.122 standard deviations higher than native-born students (see column 1). Controlling for prior performance has little impact on the estimate of the nativity gap; the value-added estimate of the disparity is 0.126 (see column 2). And while production function estimates reduce the magnitude of the advantage by almost half, the 0.066 advantage is statistically significant. Results in mathematics are similar, pointing, again, to an immigrant advantage.\nWhen we turn to the other variables, the results are largely consistent with expectations and the findings of prior research. To begin, prior-year test scores are strong predictors of current-year performance: 0.770 and 0.802 in the value-added models in (2) and (5) and somewhat lower in the education production function models in (3) and (6). Further, students with prior-year test scores earn higher scores than students without such data, perhaps reflecting the recent entrance of the latter into the New York City public schools, whether from other U.S. schools or schools in other countries, or perhaps, their exit from an exempt status-limited English proficiency or special education. As is typical in education production function models, students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch earn lower scores than ineligible students; performance is lower among black and Hispanic students than white and Asian students; and performance declines with age, which may be capturing grade retention. Here, girls do worse on both reading and math tests.\nThere are also few surprises in the education variables. Students who take the LAB do worse on reading tests (as indicated by the \u22120.921 coefficient on Took LAB), but reading test scores increase with the score earned on the test (as indicated by the 0.014 coefficient on LAB Percentile). Finally, controlling for performance on the LAB, LEP-eligible students do somewhat better than the ineligible (the coefficient is 0.180). Taken together, these provide a nuanced view of the importance of language proficiency on academic performance. Students considered at risk for LEP (measured by being tested for eligibility for services) do worse than those not considered at risk, but within that population, higher scores on the LAB suggest higher scores on reading tests, with a positive discontinuity at a score of 40-the score that indicates eligibility for LEP services. While our analysis does not include information on whether students received services to improve their English language skills and, if so, what type of service was received, the results indicate that students who are LEP-eligible do better than otherwise similar students who are not eligible.\nA particularly interesting finding is that the coefficient on the Language Other Than English variable is positive. That is, students who live in a home where a language other than English is spoken earn higher reading scores than those living in homes where English is spoken, once we control for the direct b Models 3 and 6 use school-level fixed effects. Cohort dummies are defined by the number of years in NYC public schools as of October 31. As an example, Admission Cohort 1997 indicates the student entered between November 1, 1996, and October 31, 1997. Other cohort variables are defined conformably.

Understanding the relationship between academic performance, home language, and LEP services is interesting and important and we plan to explore this in future research."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "Turning to the Admission Cohort variables, the results are consistent and intriguing. Performance is lowest for the earliest cohort-entering in 1993 and for the most part monotonically increasing for both reading and math. That is, the most recent entrants perform the highest. Of course, these findings must be interpreted with care because of the significant correlations between cohort and other regressors. While the cohorts include both native and foreignborn students, the more recent ones are disproportionately foreign-born. Cohorts entering in kindergarten or before were less than a tenth foreign-born. Cohorts entering in first grade were closer to one-quarter foreign-born, while cohorts entering after first grade were between one-and two-thirds foreignborn. Further, more recent entrants may not have prior-year test scores, so the pure advantage conferred by recent entrance may apply to relatively few students. Fifth and Eighth Grade, Reading and Math, 1997-98 and 2000-1 As described earlier, we perform similar analyses in eighth grade and for two different academic years. Table 5 displays only the coefficients on the foreignborn dummies, in the interest of simplicity. Columns 1 and 2 show mean difference in levels and value added (VA) in reading, and column 3 shows 18. The total effect of LEP status can be found by combining the coefficients on LAB score and LAB less than or equal to 40.

Columns 4, 5, and 6 present comparable results for math performance. Interestingly, while the results in columns 1 and 4 provide mixed evidence on the sign and magnitudes of the nativity gap-favoring the foreign-born in the fifth grade, but showing largely insignificant results in the eighth-the value-added results indicate consistently higher value added among immigrants. There is a considerable variation in the size of the advantage, ranging from 0.037 standard deviations in the eighth grade reading to .148 in eighth-grade math (2000-1) . Finally, the estimates from the fully specified production functions are similarly consistent-immigrants outperform native-born students, ceteris paribus-and the range of estimates is narrower. The estimate of the nativity gap ranges from a low of 0.030 in eighth-grade reading in 2000-1 to a high of 0.068 in math in that same grade and year.\nInterestingly, in the fifth grade, the size of the unadjusted gap is reduced by as much as one-half as adjustments are made for differences in students and schools. In the eighth grade, the disparity emerges with control variables, having been obscured by compositional differences and other differences driving disparities in performance."}, {"section_title": "Is the Production Function Different for Foreign-Born Students?", "text": "Our analyses thus far have constrained the coefficients (or marginal effects) of variables in the production function to be the same for native-born and foreign-born students. There are, however, many reasons to suspect that there are productivity differences across groups: immigrants might well respond differently than native-born students to demographic or educational characteristics or school resources. In particular, given the significance of the language variables in the production function results and the correlation between immigrant status and these variables, immigrants might respond differently to English language programs.\nAs described above, we estimated a set of models in which we allowed the coefficients to differ between the native-and foreign-born students. To preserve space, Table 6 shows key coefficients for fifth and eighth grade reading in 1997-98. 19 The coefficients on the foreign-born interactions capture the difference in responsiveness between native-born and foreign-born students. The complete set of interactions on all variables in the production function, as well as several selected sets, is statistically significant, as shown by the F statistics at the bottom of the table. Also while the coefficients of the foreign-born in the production function differ statistically from those of the native-born, most differences between groups are substantively small. Thus, for example, the results indicate that the prior-year test score is a somewhat less important predictor for the foreign-born than for the native-born-the coefficient for native-born fifth-grade students is 0.676, and the foreign-born coefficient is 0.028 lower.\n19. Complete results are available from the authors. Language and race/ethnicity are two particularly interesting groups of variables. Recall that students who experience a language other than English at home are eligible for the LAB, and if they score lower than 40 percent on the LAB, they are eligible for services to address limited English proficiency. For all tests and grades shown, foreign-born students exposed to a language other than English at home do better than comparable native-born students, but those foreign-born students who take the LAB do worse than native-born students who take the LAB. Each additional percentage score on the LAB test adds more to the test score for foreign-born than for native-born students. Interestingly, in the presence of these controls, the impact of LEP eligibility is not significantly different for the foreign-born than the native-born; that is, foreign-born students who are eligible for LEP services do no better or worse than their native-born peers. The results for language effects are consistent across tests and grades, although the coefficients are not always statistically significant at the 5 percent or better level.\nEqually interesting are the race and ethnicity results. Foreign-born Asian students do worse than their native-born ethnic peers, while no significant difference emerges between the foreign-and native-born blacks. Results are inconsistent for Hispanics. Finally, the coefficient on the foreign-born dummy variable becomes insignificant in these specifications, indicating that nativity by itself no longer matters.\nIn summary, some differences in marginal effects emerge between nativeand foreign-born students, suggesting that some of the disparities in performance reflect differences in the impact of underlying factors. That said, the magnitudes of the differences in the coefficients are by and large relatively small, except for the language variables. In this case, the results suggest that additional work exploring the acquisition of English language skills among immigrants and its implications for their academic performance is warranted."}, {"section_title": "Regional Analyses", "text": "As is well known, the large size of the immigrant population in New York City is matched with an astonishing diversity. Thus, the summary foreign-born statistic may mask important disparities within the immigrant community. For example, students from the Dominican Republic are quite different than students from the former Soviet Union, and pooling them as we have done may mask important differences in their academic performance. Table 7 shows that disparities in performance (both unadjusted and valueadded performance) in 1997-98 across region groups vary widely in both b Models include regional dummy variables.

Value-added scores diminish the differences, although 20 . Results for math and for 2000-1 in both subjects are qualitatively similar and available from the authors.\nRussians still score approximately 0.31 standard deviations higher than nativeborn students, while students from the Dominican Republic show \u22120.1 to no significant differences. Notice, however, that there are also considerable differences in the characteristics of students across regions, as shown in Table 8 . While only 56.8 percent of fifth grade Russian immigrants are free-lunch-eligible, compared to 94.7 percent of Dominican students. Similarly, only 2 percent of Russians are LEP-classified, while one-quarter of all Dominican fifth graders were LEPclassified in 1997-98. There are also substantial differences in tenure in New York City public schools. The average African immigrant has attended New York's public schools for less than three years, but the average West Asian student attended for more than four years. Results are similar in the eighth grade and in other years."}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "To what extent do these underlying differences explain the regional disparities in performance? Table 9 shows the results of our regression analyses for fifth and eighth grade reading in 1997-98 and 2000-1. 22 As before, the disparities among immigrants from different regions, and for each region compared to native-born students, are considerably dampened by regression analysis. Clearly many of the interregional disparities are driven by sociodemographic, educational, and cohort characteristics captured in the regressions. To be specific, more than three-quarters of the 0.679 gap in level of fifth-grade reading performance in 1997-98 between Russians and native-born students seems to be explained by differences captured elsewhere in the regression. Similarly dramatic declines obtain for several other regions-Eastern Europe drops from 0.379 to 0.097; Western Europe from 0.377 to 0.121; China from 0.641 to 0.150; and East Asia, South Asia, and West Asia show the same pattern. Interestingly, while the unadjusted results show immigrants from some regions earning high scores and others falling below the native-born, the education production function disparities are positive, with Guyana the only consistent exception. Thus, the results make clear that the earlier result pointing to a nativity gap that favors the foreign-born is not driven merely by the performance of a single group, as some might have expected. Instead, students from several world regions outperform their native-born peers, spanning countries with exceptional educational systems and highly educated populations as well as countries with inadequate educational systems and low literacy rates. At the same time, there is no single immigrant experience, and future work is warranted that examines the causes of these divergent educational experiences.

These results, estimated for a representative elementary school grade and a representative middle school grade, are remarkably robust. In addition, while foreign-born students have different production functions than do native-born students, the differences are substantively small, except perhaps for the impacts of language-skill-related variables, where the foreign-born do seem to be affected differently. The implications of our results for school policy are intriguing. How different are immigrants from native-born students? Not as much, perhaps, as raw score differentials suggest. And to the extent that there are differences, immigrant students typically perform better. Thus immigrants may not pose problems for the four areas of concern-equity, peers, accountability, or future labor market success. In fact, our results suggest that differences between immigrants and foreign-born are driven by the same factors that drive differences among native-born students, although responsiveness may be somewhat different. As an example, immigrants who live in homes where languages other than English are spoken do better than similarly situated native-born students, while immigrants who are assessed for English language proficiency do worse, ceteris paribus.\nTo some degree, these results are good news for New York City public schools. Immigrants make up over 17 percent of elementary and middle school children, and New York City's role as a port of entry seems likely to continue. The city has trouble helping many of its students reach adequate educational levels, and the job would be even more difficult if immigrant children needed help beyond what the native-born children need. But this study indicates that this may not be the case. Perhaps this is because the city already supplies immigrants with sufficient resources where they are needed. In fact, provide evidence that resources are distributed on the basis of educational characteristics of students and neutrally with respect to immigrant status. Perhaps immigrants perform better because immigrant families are particularly motivated to \"make it\" in America and, to do so, they place a premium on education. Alternatively, immigrant students may, on average, come to the United States with better schooling backgrounds than their native-born peers. To the extent that prior-test performance inadequately captures academic preparation in the regression equation, our foreign-born variables may reflect those differences. Whatever the reasons, there is little evidence here that immigrant students are faring particularly poorly in city schools.\nSome will wonder whether these results merely reflect the overall poor performance of New York City public school children. Perhaps the foreign-born advantage is not hard-won at all but, rather, the result of low performance by the native-born students. So how well do New York City students perform compared to other U.S. students? Recent NAEP results from five large urban districts (Lutkus et al. 2003) reveal that New York City (and Houston) scored higher in fourth-grade reading than the three other urban districts, comparable to all \"central cities,\" although lower than the national average. 23 Thus, while urban students do not perform as well as students in suburban districts, New York City students do not do poorly compared to other urban districts. Perhaps our immigrants are part of the reason. In sum, our results suggest that nativity itself explains little of the disparities in performance across students. Instead, much of the disparity is explained by the same set of variables that explain differences in performance of nativeborn students-English language proficiency, prior performance, gender, and the characteristics of their schooling. This means that it may be best to channel new resources toward \"old\" persistent problems of socioeconomic and racial disparities in performance, which do continue to disadvantage poor, black, and Hispanic students, whether immigrant or native-born.
