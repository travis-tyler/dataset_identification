Findings suggested children who experienced poverty and had mothers without a high school diploma or who gave birth as teenagers demonstrated lower social competence and approaches to learning and higher externalizing behaviors. Interestingly, findings also revealed children of single mothers who experience poverty scored higher on approaches to learning and lower on externalizing behaviors than viii children with married/cohabitating parents experiencing poverty. Given the salience of specific combinations of poverty and maternal characteristics for AIAN children, implications for twogeneration programming is discussed along with the potential value of extended family networks. In light of the findings regarding single mothers, more research is needed to explore the unique experiences of AIAN families in the context of their cultural networks to better understand the strengths and protective factors supporting these families en route to resilient outcomes."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) children experience some of the worst educational and wellbeing outcomes of any group of school children in the United States. Research suggests AIAN children struggle to meet reading and math proficiency standards during formal schooling (Moran et al., 2008;National Center for Education Statistics, 2016;Perie, Grigg, & Donahue, 2005), and report higher rates of school absences, dropping out, and identification in special education than other students (DeVoe, Darling-Churchill & Snyder, 2008;Hibel et al., 2008;National Center for Education Statistics, 2016). These educational and wellbeing disparities are manifested as early as kindergarten entry (Frankel et al., 2014;Marks & Garcia Coll, 2007;Mitchell et al., 2011;Sarche et al., 2009) and often persist into adulthood. For instance, AIAN adults are more likely to exhibit problem drinking behaviors, commit suicide, become teen parents and experience negative labor market outcomes such as unemployment and reduced labor force participation rates (Espey et al., 2014;National vital statistics, 2003;Ogunwole, 2006;Olson & Wahab, 2006). While the impetus for these disparities is not fully understood, research underscores the significance of historical policies that have contributed to persistent isolation as well as social and economic disadvantage experienced by AIAN families. In particular, colonialist expansionary policies dictated locations in which AIAN families would settle (Heart & DeBruyn, 1998) resulting in AIAN families inhabiting their own isolated, sovereign nations. For most AIAN families, these policies translated into restricted access to resources and opportunities (e.g., health care and education) as well as perpetual poverty exposure (Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011). As a result, AIAN families today may experience physical and social risks (e.g., poverty, low maternal education, maternal depression, birth-related risks) that are associated with geographic isolation, social disadvantage and economic disadvantage (Baldwin et al., 2002;DeNavas-Walt et al., 2012;Martins & Gaffan, 2000;Ogunwole, 2006;Ventura, Mathews, & Hamilton, 2001;Schell, 1997;Vital Statistics of the United States, 2016). Research suggests these risks influence school readiness and may help explain why AIAN children underperform relative to their peers at the start of school and develop at a slower rate academically throughout school (Golding & Fitzgerald, 2017;Lickers, 2007;Marks & Garcia Coll, 2007;Sarche, Tafoya, Croy, & Hill, 2017). However, to better understand the influence of these risk factors scholarship would benefit from a more nuanced view that considers the unique effects of risks such as teen motherhood, single motherhood, and low maternal education and poverty on child outcomes for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The current corpus of research is insufficient to inform a national approach to address the persistent gaps in school readiness among AIAN children because it does not establish representative estimates of exposure to policy-relevant types of risks of AIAN children and their families. In addition, it does not examine these types of risks concurrently to observe which risks emerge as the strongest influencers of school readiness thus allowing for targeted interventions, nor does it examine how school readiness is impacted as exposure to risk factors accumulate over time. One challenge is that much of the body of research on AIAN children has long been constrained to studies employing cross-sectional designs Sarche et al., 2009) or ones that do not contain comprehensive sets of risk factors (Marks & Garcia Coll, 2007). Cross-sectional designs are limited by the fact that they are carried out at one time point (Levin, 2006) and provide snapshots which cannot capture entire histories of experiences (i.e., the breadth of risk experiences between ages 0-5), or the density of risk experiences over time (i.e., the depth of risk experiences between ages 0-5). Further, when cross-sectional designs are employed, it is impossible to determine whether risk exposure occurs before or during the period being examined, and if risk exposure will occur in subsequent periods. In addition, research with AIAN children has most often employed designs (e.g., descriptive designs, ethnographic designs, case studies) and small sample sizes that preclude generalizable findings (see Demmert, 2001;Marks, Moyer, Roche, & Graham, 2003). Further, studies with small samples may be underpowered (Cohen, 1992); and, therefore, researchers may be unable to detect statistical differences among low prevalence events (e.g., maternal depression, or low birth weight) as they may not include sufficient numbers of children who experience the events. As such, risk research on AIAN families would be improved by using representative data with sample sizes that enable researchers to detect statistically significant differences and reach population-level conclusions. Finally, the limited research on development among AIAN children has focused on school-aged children. The disparities AIAN families may experience in educational and wellbeing outcomes are evident as early as kindergarten entry (Marks & Garcia Coll, 2007;Mitchell et al., 2011;Sarche et al., 2009), and some visible gaps are evident as early as the first year of life (Mitchell et al., 2011). Unfortunately, there is not sufficient information about what factors relate to these gaps, and research is needed to better understand these early origins of developmental disparities (Canivez & Bohan, 2006;Pewewardy, 2002). Focusing on early childhood presents a unique opportunity to uncover and address the origins of educational and wellbeing disparities within AIAN families, which can frame how evidence-based interventions can be utilized more effectively. This early period provides an opportunity for interventionists to uncover and address the causes of disparities and act before gaps in achievement and wellbeing can mature. Furthermore, early development is of importance as research suggests a critical period during early childhood in which children experience heightened levels of brain plasticity (i.e., the brains ability to change; Hensch, 2004). During early childhood, neuronal circuits are shaped by interactions with the external environment, and the critical period presents an optimal time to nurture the brain of the developing child. This period in early childhood facilitates the child's development of skills that prepares the child for success in school. For example, preacademic and behavioral skills cultivated during early childhood are important in setting the foundation for later school success (Ackerman et al., 2007;Duncan et al., 2007;Hair et al., 2006;Hohm, Jennen-Steinmetz, Schmidt, & Laucht, 2007;Morgan et al., 2008;Wise et al., 2007). Thus, researchers and interventionists examining development during early childhood may reap the greatest returns. AIAN children remain among the most understudied and under-served children in the United States despite persistent achievement gaps and a historical context of forced isolation (Mueller et al.,1999). As a result, more research is needed on AIAN children that can inform critical issues of policy and practice, better reflect the nature and extent of current risks, and uncover opportunities for early identification and strategic intervention in support of closing persistent achievement gaps. This research requires a theoretical framework capable of understanding the complexities of context and development over time. An ecological-cumulative disadvantage framework is a well-suited framework for such a study because the framework accounts for complex transactions of person and context resulting in the acquisition of developmentally appropriate competencies (Bronfenbrenner, 1986). In addition, the framework can be used to explain how risks may accumulate in meaningful ways to produce persistent achievement gaps among AIAN children (DiPrete & Eirich, 2006). Examining school readiness through this framework, it is important to study the impact of both individual and cumulative risks. In order to capture multiple risks, low prevalence events, and cumulative exposure over time, comprehensive datasets with longitudinal information on children and families is needed. "}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Children that have not mastered critical academic and behavioral competencies prior to kindergarten entry are more likely to have educational, societal, and economical challenges across the life span (Duncan et al., 2007). This suboptimal start not only affects school performance but remains consequential throughout development as these children are more likely to abuse substances, exhibit delinquent and/or violent behavior, dropout, become teen parents, engage in criminal activities, suffer from unemployment, and become clinically depressed as adults (Haskins & Rouse, 2005;Fergusson et al., 2005;Fitzpatrick et al., 2015;Webster-Stratton & Taylor, 2001). Because of this compelling evidence, early childhood researchers agree on the important role of school readiness skills (i.e., pre-academic and behavioral competencies) in improving later outcomes. School readiness is composed of a set of interdependent developmental dimensions that encompass a collection of behaviors and skills that can increase the likelihood of proficiency when children enter school. This literature review provides an overview of the major constructs that comprise the school readiness literature to date. Most often, researchers examine the interrelated school readiness dimensions in two distinct categories: pre-academic skills (e.g., cognition and reasoning, early literacy, pre-reading cognition and language/literacy) and behavioral skills (e.g., social, emotional, and approaches to learning)."}, {"section_title": "Pre-Academic Skills", "text": "Researchers consistently point to the important role of pre-academic skills in setting the foundation for later school success (Duncan et al., 2007;Hohm, Jennen-Steinmetz, Schmidt, & Laucht, 2007;Wise et al., 2007). This category includes multiple dimensions of pre-academic skills such as language and literacy skills which underpin early reading skills, and cognition and reasoning which set the foundation for early math skills."}, {"section_title": "Early Reading Skills", "text": "Language development is the process by which children learn, understand and communicate during early childhood (The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015). In the study of contemporary literature on language, two dimensions are primarily studied: receptive language and expressive language (Hess et al., 2014;Laake, & Bridgett, 2014;Yoder, Watson, & Lambert, 2015). Receptive language refers to the emerging ability to listen and understand the concepts that are communicated by others; expressive language is defined as the communication of concepts through language (The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015). Early childhood education researchers suggest receptive language (Ryan, Fauth, & Brooks-Gunn, 2013) and expressive language (Duncan et al., 2007;Hohm, Jennen-Steinmetz, Schmidt, & Laucht, 2007;Wise et al., 2007) are both meaningful proxies of school readiness. An associated yet distinct construct is emerging literacy which refers to the knowledge and skills that lay the foundation for reading and writing (The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015). Emerging literacy includes phonological awareness, print awareness, and comprehension (The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015). Phonological awareness is the aptitude to perceive and manipulate the sounds of spoken words (Melby-Lerv\u00e5g, Lyster, & Hulme, 2012), such as producing the sound that the first letter of a word makes (The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015). Print awareness is loosely defined as knowledge of the forms and functions of written language (e.g., knowing the left page of a book is read first; Pullen & Justice, 2003). The last component of emerging literacy is comprehension, which is defined as the ability to understand sentences or passages (see Woodcock, 1997). An example of comprehension is a child recounting the sequence of events from a story that was read to them (The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015). These foundational pre-literacy skills are each uniquely related to later reading success (Badian, 2001;Catts, Fey, Zhang, & Tomblin, 1999;Kjeldsen et al., 2014;Melby-Lerv\u00e5g, Lyster, & Hulme, 2012;Raikes et al., 2006;Sparks, Patton, & Murdoch, 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Early Math Skills", "text": "Cognitive skills are the result of exposure to rich learning opportunities which allow individuals to accumulate and organize information (Emig, 2000;National Education Goals Panel, 1999;The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015). Cognitive development includes working memory, reasoning/problem-solving, and mathematical thinking (The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015). Working memory, which is defined as one's ability to conserve and manipulate information over a short period, is a vital element of cognition that uniquely impacts school success in academic and behavioral domains (Constantinidis & Klingberg, 2016;Ziermans et al., 2012;Fitzpatrick & Pagani, 2012;Gathercole et al., 2004). In addition to being one of the strongest predictors of later school achievement (Ziermans et al., 2012;Gathercole et al., 2004), working memory is predictive of positive behavioral skills (e.g., engagement; Fitzpatrick & Pagani, 2012) that are tied to school readiness. The benefits of early working memory skills persist over developmental periods, for example, working memory skills have been shown to reduce the likelihood of school dropout (Fitzpatrick et al., 2015). Early problem-solving skills and reasoning skills are foundational cognitive skills that are associated with school achievement (Clements & Sarama, 2011;The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000), and complex human reasoning later in development (Phillips & Shonkoff, 2000). Reasoning and problem-solving skills are defined as the act of thinking about complex problems in a logical way to derive a sensible solution (Greeno, 1978). An example of reasoning and problem solving is a child employing a variety of strategies to sort objects by size and color (The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015). Another related construct associated with school readiness is mathematical thinking, which is the process of constructing methods of communicating with peers about mathematical content (Van Oers, 2010). Examples of mathematical thinking include counting numbers of objects or identifying groups with greater or fewer units without counting (The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Behavioral Skills", "text": "Early behavioral skills provide a critical foundation for learning and development throughout the lifespan. In fact, these early behavioral skills are predictive of positive outcomes (Ackerman et al., 2007;Hair et al., 2006;Morgan et al., 2008). This category includes multiple dimensions of behavior such as social competence, approaches to learning and externalizing behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Social Competence", "text": "Social competence may be the most broadly defined school readiness dimension. Some expressions of this construct include inviting other children to play, volunteering to help others, and using words to describe feelings (e.g., Mashburn et al., 2008Rispoli et al., 2013. Social competence helps facilitate interactions and communication between individuals (Riggio, 1986). In practice, socially competent children contribute to a supportive learning environment. For example, children may elect to help their peers that are struggling to master course content, and this pattern of helping may improve learning outcomes for a number of children. The importance of social competence is well documented as well. In kindergarten, social competence enhances a child's academic development by setting a foundation that allows for future educational attainment (LoCasale-Crouch et al., 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Approaches to Learning", "text": "Another foundational skill connecting children to the academic learning context is a child's approaches to learning behaviors. Approaches to learning help children acquire knowledge, learn new skills, and set and achieve goals (The Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, 2015), and include dimensions such as attentiveness, independent learning, task completion, concentration, and imagination. Approaches to learning have been shown to profoundly impact academic achievement and school readiness (Meng, 2015;Razza, Martin, & Brooks-Gunn, 2015;Fantuzzo, McWayne, Perry, & Childs, 2004). For example, children with positive approaches to learning are more likely to engage in constructive, in-class activities such as book reading experimentation, drawing, playing number games, and building (Chen & McNamee, 2011). Approaches to learning are comprised of multiple constructs including emotional selfregulation and cognitive self-regulation. Emotional self-regulation is defined as a child's development of coping strategies that allow for the effective management of feelings and actions (Batum & Yagmurlu, 2007). Cognitive self-regulation is defined as the control processes responsible for planning and monitoring other cognitive operations (see Salthouse, Atkinson, & Berish, 2003). Cognitive self-regulation includes sustained attention, impulse control and cognitive flexibility. Attention and impulse control are dimensions of cognitive self-regulation generally related to focusing, inhibiting dominant responses in favor of a subdominant response, and in service of future goals rather than instant gratification (see Duncan & Magnuson, 2011). Early attention-related competencies have been found associated with both short-term academic achievement (Duncan et al., 2007) and long-term outcomes including higher SAT scores, graduation from prestigious postsecondary institutions, and better adult outcomes (Mischel, Shoda, and Rodriguez, 1989). Furthermore, research highlights an association between cognitive flexibility, which is defined as the ability to quickly switch between several tasks (Monsell, 2003), and school success. Evidence from meta-analysis of 20 studies documents substantial relationships exist between cognitive flexibility and school readiness (Yeniad et al., 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Externalizing Behaviors", "text": "Externalizing behavior is a problem behavior that is manifested in children's observable actions and interactions with peers and teachers (Campbell, Shaw, & Gilliom, 2000;Eisenberg et al., 2001). In the literature, researchers may use overactivity and externalizing behaviors interchangeably (e.g., Bulotsky-Shearer et al., 2010). A few examples of externalizing behaviors include aggression, hyperactivity, and disruptiveness (see Hinshaw, 1987). Children with consistently high levels of aggression (i.e., hostile or violent behavior or attitudes toward individuals or property) are found at increased risk of experiencing achievement problems in grade school (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2004). In a meta-analysis, Duncan and colleagues (2007) found modest relationships between externalizing behaviors at school entry and teacher-reported mathematics and reading achievement in 5 th grade."}, {"section_title": "Multidimensional School Readiness", "text": "While research documents the importance of both pre-academic and behavioral skills, it is also relevant to understand how these dimensions interact and are uniquely related when  "}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Framework", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ecological-Cumulative Disadvantage Framework", "text": "The complexity of the multidimensional context in which children develop and the display of persistent achievement gaps for AIAN children requires an equally comprehensive theoretical approach. An earlier iteration of the ecological framework is a well-suited framework through which one can examine school readiness in context. In this conceptual framework, complex transactions of person and context result in the acquisition of developmentally appropriate competencies (Bronfenbrenner, 1986). The ecological framework suggests that children exist within nested contexts in their environment and suggests that the most proximal contexts have stronger impacts on the developing child by either creating rich opportunities for early skill development or threatening early skill development. For young children, the most influential context is the home (Huston & Bentley, 2010). As children repeatedly interact with primary caregivers in the home, they either attain developmentally appropriate skills, which can be bolstered by a supportive environment, or they fail to acquire the skills necessary to be proficient because these environments act as mediums through which children are exposed to risks (Bronfenbrenner, 1986). For example, studies assessing parent participation in early home literacy activities reveal a particularly strong link between parent involvement and early student success (Englund, Luckner, Whaley & Egeland, 2004;S\u00e9n\u00e9chal & LeFevre, 2002). This line of research suggests maternal participation in home literacy activities improves reading outcomes, mathematics outcomes, and both socioemotional and language development (Baker, 2013;Englund, Luckner, Whaley & Egeland, 2004). However, in homes where mothers experience depression, parent-child literacy activities are less likely to occur (Paulson, Keefe, & Leiferman, 2009). Because primary caregivers in the United States are most often mothers, this study focuses on maternal characteristics. Within the ecological framework, there is recognition that the people, objects, and contexts surrounding a developing child may also introduce risks; and these proximal transmitters of risks may disrupt growth by reducing the stability of transactions that are necessary for the child to cultivate certain skills (Swick & Williams, 2006). When children are exposed to multiple risk factors their impact may be more devastating on long-term development Kraemer, Lowe, & Kupfer, 2005). Accordingly, it is important to examine both the individual and cumulative risks to which the developing child is exposed. To supplement the ecological perspective, a cumulative disadvantage framework is employed; cumulative disadvantage is often used to explain inequality in time-based processes (DiPrete & Eirich, 2006). While the ecological framework provides the rationale for examining certain proximal risk factors that can disrupt development, cumulative disadvantage provides the necessary logic to address how multiple proximal risks accumulate over time to produce a unique and combined effect on development. This framework has utility in describing how school readiness outcomes diverge as risk factors accumulate. Cumulative disadvantage suggests that children exposed to zero risks are at the greatest advantage (i.e., will have the most optimal school readiness outcomes). Children experiencing one risk are less advantaged than children experiencing zero risks, and children experiencing two risks are less advantaged than children experiencing one risk. This trend continues for each additional risk to which a child is exposed. The effect of cumulative exposure to risks over time results in compounding disadvantage and this disadvantage can be evident across school readiness domains. As children develop, multiple risk exposure can explain increased heterogeneity and inequality in school readiness outcomes. Because progression in education requires satisfactory performance in prior steps, children who experience early and cumulative disadvantage in school readiness can threaten later educational outcomes (Bast & Reitsma 1998;Daneman, 1991;DiPrete & Eirich, 2006). Over time, this disadvantage compounds with additional risk exposure and intensifies inequality in later outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Early Risks and School Readiness", "text": "From an ecological-cumulative disadvantage perspective, there are sets of risks situated in proximal contexts, such as biological birth risk, inadequate prenatal care, and maternal depression that may accumulate over time producing both an individual and cumulative impact on school readiness--putting a child at risk of being unprepared for school."}, {"section_title": "Child-Level Risk Factors", "text": "Proximal contexts have an important role in encouraging child development. Early developmental context is of particular import as research suggests at near-term a child's brain undergoes a period of rapid development (Nossin-Manor et al., 2013;Oishi et al., 2011). Changes in the early environment in which this rapid development occurs may alter developmental processes. Research sampling pre-term children (i.e., children with less than 37 weeks completed gestation), for example, suggests irregularities may emerge during this early period, and they are proposed as potential predictors of later neurodevelopment (Aeby et al., 2013;Thompson et al., 2012;Woodward et al., 2012). Because of the significant influence of this early developmental context, it is important to examine risk factors that emerge during this critical period. Two such early risk factors are pre-term and very pre-term birth. Pre-term and very pre-term birth are defined as births of less than 37 weeks completed gestation or births of less than 32 weeks completed gestation, respectively (Vital Statistics of the United States, 2016). Employing these definitions, national estimates suggest prevalence rates of 9.6% for preterm births and 1.6% for very pre-term births (Vital Statistics of the United States, 2016). Research suggests children born pre-term are more likely to experience unsatisfactory academic and behavioral outcomes (Bhutta et al., 2002;De Schuymer et al., 2011). Likewise, very preterm children experience similar academic and behavioral outcomes (Cheng et al., 2016;Foster-Cohen et al., 2007;Jansson-Verkasalo et al., 2004). Another child-level risk factor closely related to pre-term birth is low birth weight (LBW) and very low birth weight (VLBW) which are defined as a child weighing less than 2,500 (5 lb. 8 oz.) and a child weighing less than 1500 grams (3 lb. 4 oz.), respectively (Vital Statistics of the United States, 2016). By these definitions, national estimates suggest prevalence rates of 8.0% for LBW and 1.4% for VLBW (Vital Statistics of the United States, 2016). Consistent research with diverse samples has documented relationships between LBW and VLBW experiences and suboptimal cognitive and language development (Aarnoudse-Moens et al. 2009;Boardman et al., 2002;Hack et al. 2002;Jansson-Verkasalo et al., 2004;Taylor, Klein, & Hack, 2000). In addition to the academic outcomes, researchers find negative relationships between LBW and VLBW and behavioral outcomes including externalizing behaviors and problem behaviors (Hayes & Sharif, 2009;Hack et al., 2004;McCormick, Workman-Daniels, & Brooks-Gunn, 1996) Kotelchuck, 1994;Hamilton., Osterman, Driscoll, & Rossen, 2018). National estimates of the prevalence of inadequate prenatal care yield rates between 7.1 and 11.2% (National Vital Statistics, 2010;Partridge et al., 2012). The prevalence of inadequate prenatal care is of note as it verifiably impacts a myriad of health outcomes-some of which are strongly associated with school readiness. For example, inadequate prenatal care is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight and infant mortality regardless population sample (Cox et al., 2011;Partridge et al., 2012). And, preterm birth and low birth weight are associated with suboptimal cognitive and behavioral development (Aarnoudse-Moens et al., 2009;Cheng et al., 2016;De Schuymer et al., 2011;Hayes & Sharif, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Family-Level Risk Factors", "text": "For young children, one of the most influential contexts is the home context (Huston & Bentley, 2010). As children repeatedly interact with primary caregivers in their home, transactions can either help or hinder the acquisition of developmentally appropriate skills (Bronfenbrenner, 1986). Poverty is a critical family-level risk factor that has been found to be strongly associated with school readiness outcomes. While the definition of poverty varies across studies, the U.S. Census Bureau determines poverty status by comparing pre-tax income to a threshold that is set at three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963 (see Duncan, Magnuson, & Votruba-Drzal, 2015); the metric is adjusted yearly for inflation and accounts for household size and composition. Employing this definition of poverty, national reports suggest 23.0% of United States children under the age of six live in poverty (Jiang, Granja, & Koball, 2017). Contemporary studies on the effects of poverty on brain structure reveal poverty alters several areas of the brain associated with school readiness competencies that may negatively impact school success (Hair et al., 2015;Luby et al., 2013). In addition to modification of brain architecture, researchers point to other factors associated with poverty as the determinants of school readiness outcomes-not simply poverty exposure (i.e., being poor). For example, children living in poverty have higher rates of low birth weight, preterm birth, low maternal education, and mothers experiencing depression (National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2009;Haworth et al., 2010). As stated earlier, low birth weight, preterm birth, low maternal education, and maternal depression are negatively associated with school readiness outcomes (Foster-Cohen et al., 2007, Datar & Jacknowitz, 2009Hayes & Sharif, 2009;Bennett, Bendersky, & Lewis, 2002). In addition, the influence of maternal educational attainment is important to consider when examining child development. Specifically, the negative relationship between maternal educational attainment and the education of the child is worthy of examination as maternal educational attainment is one of the strongest predictors of child educational attainment (Reardon, 2011;Sirin, 2005). In fact, children ages birth to five of mothers with less than a high school education, which is approximately 12.3% of children (Child Trends Databank, 2015), evidence cognitive delays in early childhood and throughout primary school (Harding, Morris, & Hughes, 2015;Perry & Fantuzzo, 2010). Some research suggests the link exists because maternal education shapes parenting behaviors and increases opportunities for stimulating activities (Kalil, Ryan, & Corey, 2012). The absence of positive parenting behaviors and stimulating activities, resulting from low maternal education, may result in suboptimal child outcomes. In the first few years of life, maternal depression is also strongly related to child development (see Martins & Gaffan, 2000). Researchers measure depression using dimensional scales such as the Centers for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Typically, higher scores on scales such as the CES-D indicate a general distress that serves as a proxy for depression. The rate of maternal depression varies across age, the socioeconomic distribution, educational levels, and family structures, but recent estimates suggest maternal depression has a lifetime prevalence rate between 7.0 and 13.0% (Andrade et al., 2008;Cooper et al., 2007). Despite the difficulties estimating the prevalence of maternal depression, its effects on behavioral and cognitive development are pronounced in the literature (Connell and Goodman 2002;Goodman, 2006;National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2009). One mechanism through which maternal depression may affect behavioral and cognitive development is parent-child reading. Researchers assert depressed mothers are less likely to engage in parentchild reading activities (Paulson, Keefe, & Leiferman, 2009). Some additional mechanisms through which depressed mothers may negatively impact child development are harsh disciplining methods, lack of affection, lack of provision of safety and care, and lack of regulatory control over the child's sleeping patterns (Lovejoy, Graczyk, O'Hare, & Neuman, 2000;McLearn, Minkovitz, Strobino, Marks, & Hou, 2006;Minkovitz et al., 2005;Sills, Shetterly, Xu, Magid, & Kempe, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Cumulative Risk", "text": "Some existing studies in the educational literature examine the associations between indexed risks, which are computed by summing the number of risk conditions present, and school readiness (Burchinal et al. 2000(Burchinal et al. , 2006. This indexing approach to cumulative risks treats combined risk factors as one continuous, linear variable rather than a set of dummy coded variables. This treatment of cumulative risks suggests the direction of the relationship between the amalgamated risk factors and school readiness, but this approach falls short of capturing how each additional risk exposure acts to significantly disadvantage the child and leave the child ill prepared to begin school. Other studies dichotomize individual risk factors and score each risk factor if the risk is present and examine associations between increased exposure to risks and outcomes (see Evans & Kim, 2007, for example). Employing this cumulative risk perspective, findings suggest that while some individual risk factors may not significantly relate to negative outcomes, children exposed to a certain number of risks are more likely to evidence psychological distress (Evans, 2003;Sameroff, Seifer, Zax, & Barocas, 1987) and perform worse on achievement tests (Luster & McAdoo, 1994;Pratt, McClelland, Swanson, & Lipscomb, 2016). Further, this literature suggests accumulating risks are associated with negative school readiness outcomes . Across cumulative risk studies, researchers assess anywhere from two to 43 risk factors . Sociodemographic variables such as income, parental education, single parenthood, and teenage parenthood are among the most commonly assessed risk factors across cumulative risk studies. Research finds maternal depression is highly correlated with these sociodemographic factors and is also strongly related to child development (see DeNavas-Walt et al., 2012;Martins & Gaffan, 2000). These physical and social risk factors are often concentrated among the poor and ethnic minority populations (Schell, 1997). In addition to these risks, the geographic isolation experienced by AIAN mothers introduce birth-related risks (e.g., preterm/low birthweight, inadequate prenatal care) to the ecologies of young AIAN children. As such, to tailor models to the ecologies of young AIAN children, these risk factors were included in cumulative risk models."}, {"section_title": "American Indians and Alaska Native Children and Families", "text": "Because of historical policies that restricted access to resources and opportunities, AIAN families may experience an increased likelihood of exposure to child-level risk factors such as low birth weight and preterm birth. Further, AIAN children and families may have access to fewer resources and opportunities resulting in disproportionate exposure to family-level risk factors such as teen motherhood, single motherhood, and low maternal education (Baldwin et al., 2002). But research should disentangle the impact of having fewer resources (i.e., measure by poverty exposure) from the unique impact of factors such as teen motherhood, single motherhood, and low maternal education on school readiness outcomes. Employing an ecological framework, it is vital to examine such risk factors independently as the framework suggests each respective risk may uniquely impact school readiness outcomes. In concert, it is important to use a cumulative disadvantage framework to investigate aggregated risks, irrespective of type, as cumulative disadvantage suggests the collection of risks may produce a unique, combined effect on school readiness outcomes. A significant literature documents that AIAN families are disproportionately exposed to several of the risk factors discussed above, each of which may impact school readiness. Data from the National Center for Health Statistics, for example, documents rates of inadequate prenatal care among AIAN infants that are two to three times those of white infants (Baldwin et al., 2002). This trend of disproportioned exposure to risk factors holds at the family-level. For instance, 37.0% of AIAN children under the age of six are living in poverty which is 14.0% greater than the general population rate (Jiang, Granja, & Koball, 2017); in addition, 65.0% of AIAN children under six live in families that are near poverty compared to 45.0% of their peers in the general population. And fewer AIAN adults possess high school diplomas or GEDs (71.0% versus 80.0%) or bachelor's degrees (11.5% versus 24.4%) than their white peers (Ogunwole, 2006 Cooper et al., 2007). While these estimates suggest disproportionate exposure to risk factors, they are insufficient to inform a school readiness approach designed to mitigate gaps for AIAN children, largely because the studies from which they are derived do not make use of nationally-representative, longitudinal data with the goal of studying the cooccurrence of risk factors or the unique impact of individual and cumulative risks on school readiness."}, {"section_title": "The Present Investigation", "text": "To best explore how the ongoing exposure to individual and cumulative risk factors may impede AIAN children's success in school, research is needed which considers the following: First, the research should be conducted using population-based, representative data that allows researchers to study low prevalence events and derive generalizable information on AIAN children and families. In the past, national early childhood studies, such as studies funded by the Administration on Children and Families, have excluded AIAN communities (Willis & Spicer, 2013), and quality data on AIAN children and families are often difficult to obtain given the isolated, diverse, and distinct nature of tribal communities (Beals, Manson, Mitchell, Spicer, & The AI-SUPERPFP Team, 2003;Grossman, 2003). Thus, extant research on AIAN children has most often used descriptive designs, ethnographic designs, case studies, and capitalized on small sample sizes (Demmert, 2001;Marks, Moyer, Roche, & Graham, 2003). And, the studies have often relied on samples of convenience (Beals et al., 2003;2005;Mitchell et al., 2011;Sarche et al., 2009;Whitesell, Mitchell, & Spicer, 2009). Though descriptive, ethnographic, and case study designs drawn from samples of convenience are helpful in that they provide preliminary data in unchartered topic areas, they are limited because they preclude generalizable findings. An additional limitation of these studies is they may be underpowered (Cohen, 1992); therefore, researchers may be unable to detect differences in low prevalence events (e.g., low birth weight) as their data may not include sufficient numbers of children who experience the events. As such, risk research should be conducted using representative data with samples that enable researchers to detect differences and reach population-level conclusions about AIAN children and families. The few studies on AIAN children taking advantage of representative samples (e.g., Hibel, Faircloth, & Farkas, 2008;Marks & Garcia Coll, 2007) focus on school aged children and miss the critical period from birth to kindergarten. Second, this research should be conducted using longitudinal data. Much of research on AIAN children is not conducted using longitudinal data or comprehensive sets of risk factors that allow researchers to thoroughly investigate contextual factors influencing development (see Marks et al., 2003). Some studies have emerged to fill the gaps, but the studies focus primarily on African American and Hispanic children. As such, research on AIAN children is limited to studies using cross-sectional designs Sarche et al., 2009). Cross-sectional designs are only carried out at one time point (Levin, 2006). Therefore, cross-sectional designs cannot account for the breadth of risk exposure (e.g., any risk experience between ages 0-5), or the depth of risk experiences (e.g., children experiencing risks once or multiple times over time). In addition, when cross-sectional designs are employed, it is difficult to determine whether risk exposure occurs before or during the period being examined, and if risk exposure will occur in subsequent periods. To address this gap, Marks & Garcia Coll (2007)  one in every four AIAN students are proficient in mathematics (Moran et al., 2008;Perie, Grigg, & Donahue, 2005). Further, the literature posits AIAN students rank below their White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islanders peers in math and reading (Nelson, Greenough, & Sage, 2009). These differences in achievement are often disseminated in products such as national reports, but there is little research investigating when and why these achievement disparities emerge for AIAN children. Therefore, research is needed to address the gap in examining the development of AIAN children younger than 5 years old to uncover the early origins of developmental disparities (Canivez & Bohan, 2006;Pewewardy, 2002). While evidence suggests disparities among AIAN children in educational and wellbeing outcomes are evident as early as kindergarten entry (Marks & Garcia Coll, 2007;Mitchell et al., 2011;Sarche et al., 2009), the research is not conducted using nationally representative data. This early childhood period presents a unique opportunity to uncover and address the individual origins of educational and wellbeing disparities, so early childhood researchers and practitioners can design and implement evidence-based interventions to improve child outcomes. and address the dearth of research with young AIAN children and families. ECLS-B data were collected when the children were approximately 9 months, 2 years, 4.5 years (preschool year), and 5.5 years old (kindergarten year). Data collectors used multiple approaches including parent (i.e., mothers, resident fathers, and non-resident fathers) interviews and questionnaires, birth certificate records, home visits, teacher interviews and questionnaires, classroom observations, and direct child assessments. The ECLS-B provides extensive information on child and family characteristics, early care experiences, and child outcomes relating to their health, development and education (see Snow et al., 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Dataset Design", "text": "The ECLS-B sample was selected by using a clustered, list frame sampling design, based on registered births records in the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) vital statistics system (Najarian et al., 2010). Births were sampled within a set of 96 primary sampling units (PSUs) to control data collection costs. Collectively, the 96 PSUs represent all children born in the U.S. in 2001 (Nord et al., 2004). PSU membership was either based on the location of birth or the residence of the child's mother reported on the birth certificate. The ECLS-B's target population comprised all children born in 2001 excluding children born to mothers younger than 15 years old and children who died or were adopted before the 9-month wave of data collection. The three general specifications for the AIAN supplemental sample include: (1) there had to be an initial sample of approximately 1,250 total AIAN births, (2) the within-PSU selected sample had to contain at least 50 AIAN births, and (3) they could include no more than 20 PSUs (Bethel et al. 2005 (Snow et al., 2009). This combination provides full coverage of the AIAN population (Bethel et al. 2005).

Therefore, there are variables for the math, reading, and behavioral scale scores from both kindergarten waves, though most children only have scores for one wave or the other. Scores were selected based upon the wave of data collection in which the child first entered kindergarten (see measures for further explication)."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Sample", "text": "The analytic sample started with all children who were identified as AIAN on their birth certificate or in a series of variables from the 9-month parent interview (multiple races could be indicated along with AIAN; n=850).

This was a kindergarten weight, so excluded children without information for the final wave of data collection. Next, the sample was limited to those with complete information on the five kindergarten outcomes (i.e., reading; math; parent-reported social competence; externalizing behaviors; approaches to learning; n=600). Finally, after conducting a battery of diagnostic tests on key study variables, less than one percent of remaining observations were excluded with unusual and influential data (e.g., extreme outliers) exerting undue effects on regression coefficients. To do so, DFBETA estimates derived from residual analyses of regression models were used (Fox, 1991).

The overall missingness rate was 19.0%. Following best practices for dealing with missing data , missingness was addressed among independent variables using chained equations multiple imputation procedures in Stata 15, generating 20 imputed data sets (M=20) that were used to fit all analytic models. procedures. IRT estimates the probability of correct response as a function of an individual's ability level for a measured construct as well as the item on which the individual is being tested (Snow et al., 2009). To reduce burden, children were not administered the full assessments. Rather, they were given a written adaptive measure on which they first answered a series of routine items. Based on performance on these initial items, children were assigned either the low difficulty, medium difficulty, or high difficulty set of assessment items. The IRT scale scores approximate the number of items a child would likely have answered correctly if the child was assessed on all the scored questions in a given domain. In other words, IRT scale scores are on a metric that translates to the summed number of correct items. The scores for different content areas are not comparable because they are based on different numbers of questions. In the present study, the pre-academic outcomes were taken from the appropriate wave for each child, which was either wave 4 2006 Early Math Skills. Children's kindergarten math skills were measured as a part of an ECLS-B mathematics test that was designed to assess constructs related to working memory, reasoning/problem-solving, and mathematical thinking such as number sense, patterns, properties, and operations skills (Najarian et al., 2010). The 71 items were taken from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) as well as validated, standardized instruments such as the Test of Early Mathematics Ability-3 (TEMA-3; Ginsburg & Baroody, 2003). Cronbach's reliability coefficient of the IRT-based math skills scale score for kindergarten 2006 (X4MSCR2; n = 6,850) and 2007 (X5MSCR2; n = 1,850) were both .92, respectively (Najarian et al., 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Parent-Reported Behavioral Skills", "text": "Children's social competence, approaches to learning, and externalizing behavior were Following the same method as previously published work that explored and used this measure to study children's behavioral outcomes in kindergarten (Rispoli et al., 2013), the present study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine construct validity and derive empirically supported measures based on the parent ratings. The CFA model included the three factors assessed by Rispoli and colleagues (2013): Social competence, externalizing behaviors, and approaches to learning. Two items (i.e., \"worries\" and \"unhappy\") were excluded as they focused on internalizing behaviors and researchers have expressed concerns over the interrater agreement of these items (see Roisman & Fraley, 2012). The a priori factor structure proposed by the researchers was based on knowledge regarding previous classifications of the items on the respective measures from which they were derived as well as previous psychometric use of the items (see Rispoli et al., 2013). Employing Hu and Bentler's empirically derived joint criteria, RMSEA values between .05 and .08 and SRMR values less than .08 suggest an acceptable fit (Browne & Cudeck, 1993;Hu & Bentler, 1999). Fit indices for the three-factor CFA model (allowing factors to correlate) suggested an acceptable fit, RMSEA = .047 (90% CI = .042-.052) and SRMR = .078. Two pairs of items were allowed to covary based on conceptual commonalities and moderate correlations (i.e., r = .49 and .58, respectively).

Each variable was recoded as a dichotomous indicator of either \"1\" (presence of risk) or \"0\" (no risk factor present). Preterm or low birth weight. Data on children's preterm birth status or low birth weight (LBW) status were obtained using information from child birth certificate records. Children were identified as preterm/LBW if they were born prior to 37 weeks gestation or they weighed less than 2,500 grams at birth (Vital Statistics of the United States, 2016). Inadequate prenatal care. Data on inadequate prenatal care was obtained from child birth certificate records. Mothers who either did not receive prenatal care during their first trimester or had fewer than four prenatal visits throughout the pregnancy were identified to have received inadequate prenatal care (Hamilton, Osterman, Driscoll, & Rossen, 2018). Poverty. Household poverty status was identified based on parent report of household income at each wave of data collection. Poverty was indicated for children in a household with an income below 100% of the federal poverty threshold at any wave of data collection prior to kindergarten (i.e., poverty indicated at 9 months, 2 years, or preschool waves). Single mother. Data on mother's marital status were obtained from child birth records and resident father questionnaires. First, mothers who were unmarried on the birth records were identified. Next, the resident father interview questionnaire was used to determine cases in which mothers were unmarried and lived with or without a birth father, stepfather, foster father or male guardian. Unmarried mothers living without birth fathers, stepfathers, foster fathers or other male guardians in the home were categorized as single mothers. Teen mother. Data on teen mother status were obtained from child birth records. Mothers who were between 15 and 19 years old at time of the child's birth were identified as teen mothers (Martin, Hamilton, & Osterman, 2017). Low maternal education. Data on mothers' years of education at child birth were obtained from child birth records. Mothers were identified to have low education if they were 20 years old or older (range: 20 to 45) at the time of the target child's birth and had completed less than a high school education. The consideration of mothers' age was to accommodate mothers who may have been retained in school but still graduated at a later age, who were enrolled in special education and graduated later, and to differentiate mothers' education with another risk examining \"teen mother\" status (above). This approach has been used in prior literature (e.g., Brumley, Fantuzzo, Perlman, & Zager, 2015). Severe maternal depression. Maternal depression was assessed via parent questionnaire when children were approximately 9 months and in preschool using an abbreviated version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977 interpersonal activity. Items were rated using a 4-point Likert-type scale indicating the frequency of depressive symptoms ranging from 0 \"rarely or never\" to 3 \"most or all.\" Total scores at each wave range from 0 to 36 with higher scores indicating more severe depression. Based on prior studies (e.g., Choi, Bishai, & Minkovitz, 2009), mothers rated 15 points or higher on the CES-D were identified as at risk for suspected severe depression (Paulson, Dauber, & Leiferman, 2006).

To fit more complex statistical models, multiple imputation was used to address missingness and because of the complex, multistage cluster survey design (see Snow et al., 2007), the selection of one participant is related to the selection of another participant; thus, the sample selection is non-random and the oversampling of certain subgroups of the population may result in underestimated standard errors. Therefore, following the guidelines outlined by National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the ECLS-B Data File User's Manual (Snow et al., 2009), standard errors were adjusted with jackknifing procedures and the WK1R0 sampling weight was employed, so that findings can be generalized to the U.S. population of AIAN children born in 2001. The first aim was to document the prevalence and co-occurrence of relevant child and family risk experiences among AIAN children. To address this first aim, the percentage of cases in which exposure to specific individual risks and cumulative risks occurred were examined. Then, the percentage of cases in which exposure to two risks occurred concurrently were examined. To do this, a series of weighted proportions were computed, and a series of crosstabulations were run to determine the extent to which individual risks co-occurred (i.e., percentage of cases with overlapping risk exposure). Each set of risks (i.e., two risks in each cross-tabulation) were examined independently until all permutations were exhausted. The prevalence and co-occurrence of individual risk factors are presented in Table 2. The second aim was to investigate relationships between individual risks and preacademic and behavioral competencies at kindergarten entry among AIAN children. For behavioral outcomes, individual relationships were explored, and where indicated, significant interactions were tested. To address this aim, the relationships between individual risk experiences and kindergarten reading, math, social competence, approaches to learning skills, and externalizing behaviors were examined. For the first step of the hierarchical linear regression model, kindergarten math, reading, social competence, externalizing behaviors, and approaches to learning skills were regressed onto control variables. Next, each of the individual risks were added to the models. In the second step, poverty was not meaningfully related to behavioral outcomes as theorized, so these relationships were further explored by testing for interaction effects. For cumulative models, interactions were not appropriate as poverty was a component of the cumulative risk index. The final math and reading models include all risks, and the final social competence, externalizing behavior, and approaches to learning models include all risks and interaction terms. For Aim 3, the relationship between cumulative risk experiences and kindergarten reading, math, social competence, approaches to learning skills, and externalizing behaviors was examined. As in previous analyses, using hierarchical linear regression, kindergarten math, reading, social competence, externalizing behaviors, and approaches to learning were regressed onto covariates. Then, the cumulative risk dummy variables were added to the model. the \"0 risks\" group was used as a reference group, and post-hoc analyses were conducted varying the reference groups so that all groups were compared.

The robustness of the core findings from regression models were judiciously inspected; however, this study has several methodological limitations. First, a secondary dataset was used to investigate primary research questions. As such, results are correlational, and therefore all threats to conclusions cannot be ruled out. In addition, this study has limitations with respect to the measurement of key study variables. Behavioral measures in this study were derived solely from parent-reports, and thus these measures may suggest differences founded on parents' unique outlooks concerning the behavioral competencies of their children. Therefore, findings derived from other sources, such as teachers or non-parental care providers, may differ in meaningful ways when compared to findings from the present study. Further, restricted range (preference for positive ratings) was evident for these parent-reported behavioral outcomes and these measures were less reliable than pre-academic measures. Finally, key predictors were derived from parent reports and this introduced common-method error variance into regression models focused on behavioral outcomes. Taken together, these limitations may help explain some of the unique relationships found between risk factors and behavioral outcomes. Finally, five outcomes were examined and, in an effort to keep predictors consistent across models, parsimony was a key concern. Also, data/sample constraints emerge during the investigative process. A set of variables were theorized to be meaningful predictors of the observed outcomes; however, because of high levels of missingness/non-response, the variables were not viable. These limitations may have led to underfit models. For example, diagnostic tests revealed mixed support for model specification error in the reading model--though no misspecification errors were found across the other 4 outcomes. As a consequence of misspecification, some findings may be the spurious result of unmeasured differences that are correlated with both the predictors and outcomes in analytic models."}, {"section_title": "Power Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Aim 2", "text": "The model includes 3 covariates, which are estimated to yield a conservative R-squared of .00.

Results indicated poverty uniquely predicted kindergarten academic competencies net of child characteristics (i.e., child sex, age, and baseline cognition at 9 months) and other risk factors, but poverty was not predictive of any of the behavioral outcomes that were examined. In the academic models, poverty exposure was associated with lower skills in reading (B = -8.77, t = -3.42, p < .05) among AIAN children. The negative association indicated children exposed to poverty received about 9 fewer points on tests of reading skills when compared to the most advantaged children in the sample (i.e., the reference string of average-aged children with average cognitive ability not exposed to risk factors). Similarly, poverty exposure was correlated with lower skills in math (B = -6.76, t = -3.40, p < .05) among AIAN children. The negative association suggests children exposed to poverty received circa 7 fewer points on test of mathematics skills when compared to the most advantaged children in the sample.

When poverty emerged as a non-significant predictor of behavioral dimensions, these findings were further explored. In light of the results from descriptive analyses (see Table 2; i.e., the co-occurrence of maternal risk factors with poverty), the relationships between three maternal risk factors (i.e., low maternal education, single motherhood, and teen motherhood) and poverty were investigated. Specifically, the nature of the associations between maternal risk factors and behavioral outcomes were theorized to be different for poor and non-poor children and families. To test for moderation, hierarchical regression models were re-estimated adding three interaction terms to each model (using risk factors that were found to co-occur with poverty while addressing research question 1), which were calculated as the product of low maternal education, single motherhood, or teen motherhood and poverty status (poor = 1; non-poor = 0). In this analysis, 8 of the 9 interactions were statistically significant (see Table 4). When the risk model with interaction terms was regressed on social competence, low The interactions were further explored by testing conditional effects of low maternal education, single motherhood, and teen motherhood on behavioral outcomes for children considered poor and non-poor.

Among children that also experienced poverty, results showed low maternal education was associated with .73-point lower scores on social competence (see Figure 1, C to D slope; t = -4.46, p = .05). Teen motherhood was correlated with .61-point lower scores on social competence (See Figure 2, C to D slope; t = -3.66, p = .05). In addition, low maternal education was associated with .67-point lower approaches to learning (See Figure 3, C to D slope; t = -3.59, p = .05), single motherhood predicted .39-point higher approaches to learning (See Figure   4, C to D slope; t = 2.65, p = .05), and teen motherhood was related to .46-point lower approaches to learning for children exposed to poverty (See Figure 5, C to D slope; t = -4.08, p = .05). Further, low maternal education predicted .61-point higher externalizing behaviors (See Figure 6, C to D slope; t = 3.85, p = .05), single motherhood was associated .64-point lower externalizing behaviors (See Figure 7, C to D slope; t = -4.50, p = .05), and teen motherhood was related to .68-point higher externalizing behaviors amid children exposed to poverty (See Figure   8,C to D slope; t = 3.98, p = .05). When interaction terms were added to the models, an additional 5.0% of the variance in social competence, approaches to learning, and externalizing behaviors was explained. The model with child-level covariates, individual risks, and interaction terms explained 10.0% of the variance in social competence, 10.0% of the variance in approaches to learning, and 15.0% of the variance in externalizing behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Cumulative risk experiences and kindergarten academic and behavioral outcomes", "text": "Kindergarten reading, mathematics, social competence, approaches to learning, and externalizing behaviors were compared among children exposed to different quantities of risks (i.e., 0, 1 risk, 2 risks, and 3 or more risks). As before, the cumulative risk models were useful in predicting academic outcomes, but the models were of limited benefit in estimating behavioral outcomes (see Table 5). Focusing on academic outcomes, results demonstrated when compared to children exposed to 0 risks (reference group), children experiencing 2 risks demonstrated significantly lower skills in reading (B = -9.90, t = -2.88, p < .05) and math (B = -7.64, t = -3.04, p < .05). Further, children experiencing 3 risks demonstrated significantly lower skills in reading (B = -8.11, t = -2.38, p < .05) and math (B = -6.86, t = -2.70, p < .05) than children exposed to 0 risks. In contrast, there were no statistically significant relationships between the number of risks to which a child was exposed and their social competence, approaches to learning, or externalizing behaviors. For the academic outcomes that yielded significant associations, a series of post-hoc analyses were conducted varying reference groups to examine differences among children with 1, 2, and 3 or more risk experiences. Results demonstrated no statistically significant incremental effects. That is to say: reading and math outcomes for children exposed to two risks were not meaningfully different than outcomes of children exposed to 1 risk. Likewise, reading and math outcomes for children exposed to 3 or more risks were not meaningfully different than the outcomes of children exposed to 2 risks. Significant differences were found between children with zero risks and those experiencing 2 or more; but, no differences were found between the other levels of risk. Overall, when compared to cumulative risk models, the individual risk models better explained school readiness outcomes. Though generally the cumulative models did not fit the data as well as individual risk models, when regressed on academic outcomes, the cumulative models explained a substantive proportion of variance (8.0% in reading and 9.0% in math). On the other hand, the cumulative risk models explained less than 3.0% of variance in social competence, approaches to learning, and externalizing behaviors, respectively (Range: 1.0-3.0%)."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 5. DISCUSSION", "text": "The present investigation applied an ecological-cumulative disadvantage framework to examine how individual and cumulative risks affect school readiness among young AIAN children. A nationally representative sample was used to ensure results were generalizable, and several important background characteristics were held constant, so findings would be robust. Further, the present study highlights the importance of longitudinal data that allow better measurement of key study variables over time."}, {"section_title": "Poverty and Kindergarten Academic Outcomes", "text": "One noteworthy finding in this study is that exposure to poverty at any point prior to kindergarten entry uniquely and materially impacts AIAN children's academic outcomes. Though research consistently finds point-in-time assessments of poverty are associated with early academic skill gaps (e.g., Dahl & Lochner, 2012;Magnuson, Waldfogel, & Washbrook, 2012;Milligan & Stabile, 2011), these results are extended to a national sample of AIAN children, exposure to poverty at any point prior to kindergarten entry is captured, and the comorbidity of poverty and other risk factors (e.g., low maternal education, teen motherhood) that purportedly influence academic outcomes is examined. Findings underscore the importance of capturing children's complete histories of poverty exposure prior to kindergarten entry (and therefore longitudinal data) when estimating the effect of economic disadvantage on reading and math outcomes. 59.0% of AIAN children were found to be exposed to poverty at some point prior to kindergarten entry. This rate is 22.0% higher than prior national prevalence rates derived from cross-sectional data that document 37.0% of AIAN children under the age of six are living in poverty at any given time (see Jiang, Granja, & Koball, 2017). This between-study gap in poverty rates arises because the measure used in the present study broadens the definition of poverty to include any child whose family income fell below 100% of the federal poverty line at any time prior to kindergarten. This approach to measuring poverty was informed by literature that suggests family income levels fluctuate across early childhood (see Duncan, Yeung, Brooks-Gunn, & Smith, 1998;Wagmiller, Lennon, Kuang, Alberti, & Aber, 2006, for example). In fact, longitudinal data have shown household income volatility is common among Americans with incomes near the poverty line (Morduch, & Siwicki, 2017). These individuals may experience episodic poverty spells lasting anywhere from a month to multiple years (Bane & Ellwood, 1986;Morduch, & Siwicki, 2017;Stevens, 1999). When studies measure family income level using aggregate or average income, they risk concealing this meaningful variation in income which can lead scholars to underestimate the proportion of children exposed to poverty (Hill et al., 2013). Given the well-established effect of poverty exposure on academic outcomes (e.g., Duncan, Morris, & Rodrigues, 2011;Maynard & Munane, 1979;Morris, Duncan, & Clark-Kauffman, 2005), underestimating the rate of poverty may mislead programs and policies designed to serve children at risk for early academic disparities. Because of an inability to detect true poverty exposure rates, programs and policies serving the poor may exclude children recently classified as poor or children that may be classified as poor in the near future-serving only children classified as poor at the time of measurement. In such cases, changes in family income can affect eligibility for social programs and exacerbate academic disparities. Another key contribution of this study is the examination of the comorbidity of poverty and other risk factors to parse out their effects on academic outcomes. Prior research suggests poverty tends to cluster together with other risk factors (Baldwin et al., 2002;Jiang, Granja, & Koball, 2017;Ogunwole, 2006;Ventura, Mathews, & Hamilton, 2001; Vital Statistics of the United States, 2016), which makes it difficult to isolate the unique effect of poverty on academic outcomes. And, to accurately attribute a significant effect to poverty, one should rule out other explanations for the relationships between poverty and child outcomes. In the literature, researchers argue that poverty effects are simply the spurious result of unmeasured difference correlated with both poverty and child outcomes (Mayer, 1997). Other researchers claim any attempts to measure the effects of poverty can be distorted because risk factors correlated with poverty may themselves be predicted by poverty (Gershoff, Aber, & Raver, 2003). There is evidence supporting this hypothesis as children from low income households are more likely to experience a number of major psychosocial risk factors (Evans, & Kantrowitz, 2002;McLoyd, 1998). In fact, assessing cumulative physical and psychosocial environmental risks, Evans 2004found approximately 20.0% of poor families experience three or more risk factors. While the present study finds evidence that co-morbid risks with poverty occur, the negative relationship between early poverty exposure and reading and mathematics outcomes still remains after controlling for the effects of child characteristics and co-morbid risk factors. In fact, early poverty exposure emerges as the only unique predictor of kindergarten reading and math skills with this nationally representative AIAN population, and the magnitude of the effect is between small and medium (see Cohen, 1992). This suggests above and beyond all co-morbid risks included in the analytic model, poverty has a unique, direct effect on academic outcomes. The co-morbid risks included in the analytic models (e.g., maternal depression, low maternal education, single motherhood, and preterm/low birthweight) are physical and social risk factors that are often concentrated among the poor and ethnic minority populations (Schell, 1997). Research has consistently linked these risk factors to academic school readiness outcomes (Aarnoudse-Moens et al. 2009;Aeby et al., 2013;Hair et al., 2015;Harding, Morris, & Hughes, 2015;Martins & Gaffan, 2000;McLanahan, Tach, & Schneider, 2013) and has found they are prevalent among AIAN children and families (Baldwin et al., 2002;Jiang, Granja, & Koball, 2017;Ogunwole, 2006DeNavas-Walt et al., 2012Martins & Gaffan, 2000). As such, these risks that were tailored to the developmental ecologies of young AIAN children were studied and postulated to impact AIAN children's outcomes. Because most risks were not statistically significant, results suggest a need to take a closer look at how poverty affects resource allocation within families to uncover the mechanism through which income affects academic outcomes among AIAN children."}, {"section_title": "Amount of Risks and Kindergarten Academic Outcomes", "text": "Findings on the relationship between cumulative risk and academic outcomes are consistent with the cumulative disadvantage framework and prior literature. This prior work suggests the amount of risks, regardless of type, significantly relates to children's performance across school readiness outcomes (e.g., Luster & McAdoo, 1994;Pratt, McClelland, Swanson, & Lipscomb, 2016;Rouse et al., 2018). Despite the explanatory power of cumulative risk across multiple school readiness domains, academic/cognitive domains are of particular import. Developmental neuroscience demonstrates compounding risk exposure within children's early ecologies alters timing and arrangement of genetic manifestation, which results in changes in brain architecture and function (Vegas, & Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez, 2009). Cumulative risk associated with poverty, such as stress-inducing risks or risks thwarting stimulation, affect brain regions associated with cognitive efficiency and processing (Nores, & Barnett, 2010). These early disruptions to brain architecture and function take place during a period when children experience heightened levels of brain plasticity (Hensch, 2004). As  Felitti et al., 1998). ACES researchers often emphasize the importance of including risk factors such as physical abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, and sexual abuse in cumulative models (see Finkelhor et al., 2015;Reuben et al., 2016;Sol\u00eds et al., 2015, for example). However, recent ACES research emphasizes the need to expand this paradigm of adversity to better understand challenges faced by socioeconomically and racially diverse subgroups (Cronholm et al., 2015). Recognizing the need for a tailored approach for newly explored subgroups, the literature was surveyed and risks unique to the ecologies of young AIAN children were identified. While researchers assess several risks , poverty, parental education, single parenthood, and teenage parenthood are among the most commonly assessed risk factors across cumulative risk studies, and these physical and social risk factors are often concentrated among the poor and ethnic minority populations (Schell, 1997). Given the prevalence of poverty, low maternal education, single motherhood, and teenage motherhood among AIAN families (Baldwin et al., 2002;Jiang, Granja, & Koball, 2017;Ogunwole, 2006), cumulative risk models including these factors were postulated to partially explain achievement disparities faced by AIAN children. Since maternal depression is highly correlated with these sociodemographic factors and is also strongly related to child development (see DeNavas-Walt et al., 2012;Martins & Gaffan, 2000), there was sufficient evidence to warrant its inclusion with the other risks in the cumulative model. Because AIAN communities experience geographic isolation, restricted access to resources (e.g., health care) were posited to introduce birth-related risks (e.g., preterm/low birthweight, inadequate prenatal care) to the ecologies of young AIAN children. As such, the effect of cumulative risk exposure on AIAN children's academic outcomes was theorized to be pronounced after accounting for exposure to these risk factors. As cumulative disadvantage theory suggests, multiple proximal risks exposure produces a unique and combined effect on both reading and math outcomes. In this sample, tailored sets of risks were used and findings revealed children experiencing two or more risks are less academically competent than children experiencing zero risks. This finding suggests cumulative risk exposure results in compounding disadvantage across academic domains for AIAN children. Further, this result underscores the value of identifying risk factors unique to the ecologies of understudied subpopulations of young children. Because academic outcomes appear to diverge as these particular risks accumulate, the amount of risk (not simply the types) to which an AIAN child is exposed warrants significant attention."}, {"section_title": "Risk Patterns and Kindergarten Behavioral Outcomes", "text": "Another salient finding in this study was that the relationships between risks and behavioral outcomes followed a different pattern than academic outcomes. Whereas individual risks were uniquely related to academic outcomes, with behavior the significant results were about combinations of specific risks that, in isolation, did not demonstrate unique relationships. Children experiencing poverty in isolation did not evidence lower levels of behavioral competence. Rather, this study suggests behavioral outcomes are influenced by concurrent exposure to maternal risk factors (e.g., teen motherhood, low maternal education) and poverty, as discussed more below. In contrast to prior literature that demonstrates direct relationships between poverty and associated risks with children's behavioral outcomes (Duncan, Brooks-Gunn, & Klebanov, 1994;Knapp et al., 2007), results from the present study suggest that it is the interaction between maternal risk characteristics and poverty that influences child behavior. Children of mothers with less than a high school education or children of teen mothers demonstrate lower behavioral competencies when exposed to episodic poverty spells during the first five years of their lives. However, in the absence of poverty, children of mothers with less than a high school education or children of teen mothers do not uniquely display lower behavioral competencies. Prior studies provide support for the proposition that these combinations of maternal risks and poverty are important (DeNavas-Walt et al., 2012;Mollborn & Dennis, 2012;Mollborn et al., 2014). In this sample of AIAN children, empirical support was found that poverty and maternal risk factors may each be necessary, but not sufficient, conditions that interact to influence children's behavioral competencies. The interactive effects produce modest, but consistent, associations with behavioral outcomes. Interestingly, the importance of this nuanced relationship between maternal risks and poverty was highlighted in the one explanatory variable that emerged as a significant predictor in the behavioral models. Inadequate prenatal care was a meaningful influencer of AIAN children's externalizing behavior. This predictor captures maternal characteristics and economic disadvantage as women receiving inadequate prenatal care are more likely to be less educated, uninsured, impoverished, and single (Braveman et al., 2000;Gonthier et al., 2017;Maupin et al., 2004;Mazul, Ward, & Ngui, 2017). As such, Inadequate Parental Care may serve as a fairly comprehensive proxy risk factor that captures economic and social disadvantage among AIAN mothers. One interesting finding that might appear contrary to hypothesized relationships was that children of single mothers exposed to poverty score higher on approaches to learning and lower on externalizing behaviors than children with married/cohabiting parents exposed to poverty. These findings challenge the notion that children of single mothers do not do as well across developmental outcomes as their counterparts with married/cohabiting parents (see DeNavas-Walt et al., 2012;McLanahan, Tach, & Schneider, 2013;Mollborn & Dennis, 2012;Mollborn et al., 2014). Given certain conditions, children of single mothers may thrive developmentally. Particularly, when children and their mothers receive support from other sources, children may display positive behavioral development regardless of their nuclear family structure. One unique characteristic of AIAN familial context that may explain this finding is the strength and importance of extended familial networks, though the present study did not examine this directly; such networks may offer support to single moms that optimizes AIAN children's outcomes in this context (LaFromboise, Hoyt, Oliver, & Whitbeck, 2006;LaFromboise & Medoff, 2004;Light & Martin, 1986). Research identifies such extended familial networks that provide AIAN children rich and diverse opportunities for skill development that promote positive outcomes in the face of hardship and/or the absence of one parent (LaFromboise, Hoyt, Oliver, & Whitbeck, 2006;Moore et al. 2002). A further plausible explanation is that AIAN children that are economically disadvantaged and grow up with single parents may experience greater emotional stability than their disadvantaged counterparts with married/cohabiting parents. Past research suggests married couples that are economically disadvantaged experience increased marital discord and disruption as well as stress (Fein, & Fein, 2004). Marriages characterized by this sort of family stress may be worse for children than living in a single parent household from birth as this marital stress may lead to inconsistent and/or harsh parenting, the eventual dissolution of marriage as well as other suboptimal outcomes (Amato, & Booth, 2001;Amato, & Cheadle, 2008;Conger, Conger, & Martin, 2010;Troxel, & Matthews, 2004). As children experience household stress associated with marital/cohabitation discord, disruption, and stress, their developmental outcomes may be adversely impacted (see Conger, Conger, & Martin, 2010;Heckman, 2011;Fomby, & Cherlin, 2007). For AIAN children living in single mother headed households, the absence of marital/cohabitation discord, disruption, and stress may allow for enhanced behavioral development. As such, children growing up in stable households with extended familial support, notwithstanding specific family structure, may experience improved outcomes (Battle, 1998;Kamp Dush, 2009;LaFromboise, Hoyt, Oliver, & Whitbeck, 2006;LaFromboise & Medoff, 2004;Light & Martin, 1986)."}, {"section_title": "Future Research", "text": "Findings point to meaningful avenues for future research beyond the scope of this initial investigation, including the need to consider culturally-informed protective factors, develop and evaluate behavioral measures, and target the most vulnerable AIAN children and families. and under what conditions?). In the last 50 years, the research community has placed a greater emphasis on a need to uncover properties of resilience evidenced by some of the youngest and most vulnerable children and families (Luthar, & Cicchetti, 2000;Luthar, 2015;Masten, & Reed, 2002). This resilience work targets populations with a greater probability of experiencing unfavorable outcomes and identifies factors that enable children to thrive despite adverse conditions (Benard, 1991;Garmezy, 1993;Resnick, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Need for Culturally-informed protective factors", "text": "What is currently established in the literature is that AIAN children experience an array of poor educational and well-being outcomes (DeVoe, Darling-Churchill & Snyder, 2008;Hibel et al., 2008;Moran et al., 2008;National Center for Education Statistics, 2016;Perie, Grigg, & Donahue, 2005). However, more work is needed that investigates protective factors that enable children to thrive across both academic and behavioral domains despite adverse conditions. Protective factors such as family, community, culture, enculturation and maternal support and warmth are among those purported as meaningful in the literature (LaFromboise, Hoyt, Oliver, & Whitbeck, 2006;Sarche et al., 2009). Findings from the current study suggest there may be protective factors in extended familial networks that need to be articulated and studied in early childhood school readiness research; particularly, for children in families experiencing poverty and children in single parent households, extended family networks may support AIAN children's behavioral development (see LaFromboise, Hoyt, Oliver, & Whitbeck, 2006;LaFromboise & Medoff, 2004;Light & Martin, 1986). These extended familial networks may provide AIAN children with rich and diverse opportunities for behavioral skill development that allow for positive outcomes in the face of economic hardship and/or parental absence. Further, factors such as oral traditions and storytelling are rich cultural assets of AIAN communities that may serve as promotive factors capable of improving academic outcomes (Becker, 2002;Claudia & Curry, 1998;Hodge, Pasqua, Marquez, & Geishirt-Cantrell, 2002;Moses, 2004;Verbos & Humphries, 2014;Warner & Grint, 2006). Both oral traditions and storytelling allow orators to transmit complex ideas simply, so young children can understand. Using these tools, parents can express complex ideas that are educational as well as culturallyinformed and thus better help children develop academic competencies."}, {"section_title": "Need for developing and evaluating behavioral competence measures of AIAN children", "text": "Among AIAN children, it is possible that the parent-reported behavioral dimensions do not precisely assess culturally-salient competencies. Within the field, researchers still fail to reach consensus on what domains comprise behavioral development and struggle to develop psychometrically reliable and valid measures of these behavioral constructs with young children (Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2005, Raver, 2002. And, this measurement problem is exacerbated when capturing the unique behavioral competencies of diverse populations (Jones, Zaslow, Darling-Churchill, & Halle, 2016). In fact, research demonstrates AIAN children's behavioral constructs may be fundamentally different than their peers from other cultural groups (Worthly, 1987). Differences on these constructs may arise as a result of collectivist cultural preferences and a myriad of tribal differences. Research failing to account for these preferences and neglecting to use measures designed with AIAN children and families may yield inaccurate results. Surveying the AIAN behavioral literature, several examples are found of how behavioral development may be different for AIAN children resulting from AIAN collectivism (Weenie, 2000). As a logical outcome of their emersion in a collectivist culture, AIAN children may prefer collaborative learning environments, and the literature suggests AIAN students thrive in such environments (Cajete, 1999;Ward, 1993). This strong cultural preference for collaborative learning may result in a predisposition toward individual competition aversion--particularly if onlookers are present. AIAN children's competition aversion may be more evident if the ultimate result (i.e., winning or losing) places one student ahead of another (Swisher and Deyhle, 1989). In such cases, cultural preferences (and incongruences) may result in a cross-cultural distortion of what it means for AIAN parents to endorse behavior indicators from global measures such as those used in the ECLS-B. As a result, AIAN cultural preferences may muddle cross-cultural assessments of AIAN parent's ratings of social competence that were derived from traditional definitions of \"optimal behavior\" based on white, middle class values. Children raised in a collectivist culture also tend to be holistic or global learners (Nuby, Ehle, & Thrower, 2001). Typically, global learners are highly visual, contextual, relational, and families (Bernard, 2017). Allowing AIAN informants to define behavioral domains is one way to ensure the construct accurately reflects AIAN interpretations (see Bernard, 2017;Borgatti,1994). Further, ethnographic techniques (i.e., scientific description of cultural customs) can provide meaningful information that informs the survey questions researchers ask once the content domain is specified. These procedures can lead to a culturally-valid behavioral competence questionnaire that is sensitive and capable of capturing within-group variability."}, {"section_title": "Need for targeting the most vulnerable AIAN children and families", "text": "While results in the present study are derived from nationally representative data, results may not reflect important diversity among AIAN children and families. While commonalities do exist between children classified as American Indian and Alaska Natives, meaningful variation remains between AIAN communities (see Sarche et al., 2009). In an effort to uncover if results from the present study accurately represent how diverse, vulnerable AIAN children living in the most isolated communities are developing, future research should comprehensively examine such samples of AIAN children and families; this research can triangulate results from the present study within specific communities to ensure these findings are sensitive across specific cultural contexts (Hitchcock et al., 2005;Nastasi et al., 2007). seem to be a hidden population in American society (Wilson, 1998). This relative geographic isolation exposes reservation communities to poverty, limited educational attainment and underfunded health services (Dixon & Roubideaux, 2001;Spicer & Sarche, 2012;Willis & Bigfoot, 2003;Zuckerman, Haley, Roubideaux, & Lillie-Blanton, 2004).  (Bania, 2014;Camilli et al., 2010;Leak et al., 2012;Yoshikawa et al., 2013). And, the effect of high-quality preschool on academic outcomes is stronger for children that are economically disadvantaged (Gormley Jr, Gayer, Phillips, & Dawson, 2005;. Furthermore, the general public as well as political pundits recognize the value of highquality preschool programing. At the present moment, about 70.0% of the general public support legislation augmenting high-quality preschool programs, and in Washington D.C., high-quality preschool expansion receives bipartisan political support (Jones, 2014). However, despite evidence of positive effects as well as public and political support, still very few public dollars are allocated to ensuring economically disadvantaged children, and AIAN children in particular, gain access to high quality preschool (Barnett et al., 2015;Chaudry, Morrissey, Weiland, & Yoshikawa, 2017;Mashburn et al., 2008). As a result, AIAN children do not have the same access to high-quality preschool programs and services as more affluent families (Chaudry, Morrissey, Weiland, & Yoshikawa, 2017). Thus, rather than closing income-based achievement gaps, preschool programs tend to widen gaps. The United States is at a favorable moment, both publicly and politically, to reverse this trend of preschool programs widening academic achievement gaps rather than closing them. In the long run, solutions aiming to provide universal access to preschool such as those recommended by Chaudry and Colleagues (2017) should be considered. In an effort to ensure universal access to high-quality preschool, the researchers recommended that states fund, develop, and implement universal preschool programs. In the authors' proposal, the federal government acts in a supplementary role: providing ramp-up matching funds to states, ensuring economically and socially disadvantaged children gain access to preschool programs, and sharing evidence on what works best. While this proposal is promising, it is unclear when, or if, such a proposal will be adopted. As such, policymakers, practitioners, and AIAN child advocates laboring to improve child development now, should work with preschool programs as presently constructed. In the 42 states (and District of Columbia) with universal preschool programs (Barnett et al., 2015), policymakers can work to hold preschool programs accountable to high standards of quality and pledge that a proportion of preschool slots be reserved for AIAN children as well as children that are economically disadvantaged. Access to such programs will provide AIAN children and families with resources and expertise that will help them overcome the negative effects of poverty and multiple risk exposure. In the remaining eight states without universal preschool programs, policymakers, practitioners, and AIAN child advocates should labor until high-quality preschool programs and services are made available."}, {"section_title": "Strengthening behavioral competence", "text": "Targeted, high-quality early child care programs can be useful in improving behavioral competencies among AIAN children. However, because precise combinations of risks (i.e., maternal risk factors and poverty) matter for behavioral outcomes, in addition to increasing access to high-quality child care, programs should also focus on developing parental capacities. To this end, targeted high-quality child care programs together with a multi-generational approach that supports both children and their parents will yield the greatest advances in children's behavioral competencies. The federally funded Head Start program is a good example of a model program that could be expanded to prioritize AIAN families, as it includes comprehensive supports for education, health, nutrition, social development, and other services for both parents and children enrolled (Malone, Bernstein, Atkins-Burnett, & Xue, 2018). Since the launch of Head Start, the program has aimed to serve AIAN children. During the first summer of Head Start's implementation, 34 tribal Head Start programs were opened, and today there are about 150 tribally run Head Start programs that serve nearly 20,000 AIAN children (Malone, Bernstein, Atkins-Burnett, & Xue, 2018). Several studies suggest these children enrolled in Head Start programs display considerable gains in developmental competencies while in the program (Bitler, Domina, Penner, & Hoynes, 2016;Miller, Farkas, Vandell, & Duncan, 2014;Miller, Farkas, & Duncan, 2016); however, pundits debate whether there are positive, long-term effects of Head Start matriculation (Jenkins et al., 2018;Puma et al., 2010). The current body of evidence on the effectiveness of Head Start is, at best, mixed. The program seems to have positive effects, but this evidence is inconclusive. As such, in a more comprehensive and coordinated model, targeted high-quality early childcare programs should be combined with services that improve young AIAN children's home environments (e.g., providing parent workforce training, education advancement; Chaudry, Morrissey, Weiland, & Yoshikawa, 2017;Haskins, Garfinkel, & McLanahan, 2014). This approach to serving families assumes that serving children and families concurrently with high-quality programs is better than serving them respectively. The term used to describe this approach is multi-generational or twogenerational approach. MIECHV builds upon years of scientific evidence that demonstrates professionals working inhome with families improve critical outcomes for children and families (Bilukha et al., 2005;Kendrick et al., 2000;Sweet, & Appelbaum, 2004). The program accomplishes this by supporting positive parenting and promoting optimal development as well as school readiness competencies. Currently, MIECHV allocates 3 percent of its budget to the Tribal MIECHV Program which exists to serve AIAN children and families (Adirim, & Supplee, 2013). Though Tribal Administration for Children and Families, 2015). The primary goals of this consortium were to support tribes and coordinate early learning programs, support high-quality childcare programming, provide families with high-quality services from birth to kindergarten, and increase inter-system collaboration. To this end, the collaborators identified early childhood programmatic strengths, weakness, gaps in services, and existing areas where collaboration and integration of information were feasible. One consistent finding across all four sites was that cross-system collaboration could be improved. The TELI was successful in breaking down crosssystem silos in these four tribal communities, and in response to this success, the consortium is expanding to additional sites. This approach is in line with what this study outlined above, and this collaboration is promising for young AIAN children's development."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Results support three principal conclusions for developmental research with American Indian and Alaska Native children.
