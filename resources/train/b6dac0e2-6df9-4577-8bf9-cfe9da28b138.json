[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Advocates of school choice often accuse public schools of delivering a \"one size fits all\" education. What these critics are suggesting is that the typical K-12 experience, like a promotional T-shirt, doesn't really look good on anyone -small, medium or large. But give parents the ability to choose a school, so the argument goes, and competition will produce more variety, parents will find a better match for their child's unique needs, and better results will follow. The truth is, public education is not the monolith its critics make it out to be. Far from it. Magnet schools are offered by school districts as options to the traditional public school. The number of public charter schools, more than half of which are authorized by local school boards, continues to grow (NACSA, 2015). In most states, students further have the ability to transfer out of their attendance zone to another school in the district or outside of it (ECS, 2016). But interestingly enough, the broadest range of educational choices for students is found inside traditional public schools. These vary from academic concentrations in specific areas such as the arts or STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math); different career pathways; Advanced Placement courses and more. Neighborhood schools also give students the chance to engage in an array of extracurricular activities. These opt-in opportunities make a lot of kids excited to show up at school every day. As an added benefit, the effect of special programs and extracurriculars has been shown to spill over onto students' academic performance more generally (Kronholz, 2012). At the Center for Public Education, we have been examining the research and data related to school choice in hopes of informing the conversation about effective policies. Earlier this year, we updated our 2015 overview of the impact of school choice in all its forms -public, private, virtual and home school. Two years and several rigorous studies later did not change our earlier conclusion: school choice works for some students sometimes, is worse for some students sometimes, and is usually no better or worse than traditional public schools. Among our recommendations to school districts was that they establish opportunities for sharing successes between their traditional, magnet and charter schools in order to support improvements across the board. In this report, we turn from looking at the impact of school choice to examining access to options within the public education system. We first estimate how many students are able to choose which public school to attend, regardless of whether or not they take advantage of the opportunity. Using data from the federal Schools and Staffing Survey, we then document the prevalence of various program choices inside public schools and, where possible, compare these to private schools. We conclude with a discussion of growing efforts by public schools to personalize learning, which show a lot of promise for aligning students' different interests and needs with effective pathways toward success. Our report is not comprehensive. Data on program choice within schools was limited. Data was also lacking for several enrichment and extracurricular programs, such as team sports and clubs. We know such programs are common in public schools. Unfortunately, we can't say how common. Nonetheless, we believe the findings we report here can contribute to the public debate about school choice by presenting a fuller picture of the many options already available in the neighborhood school and local district. We would be remiss, however, if we did not acknowledge the one area where public education is truly \"one size fits all.\" Every child who enters the public school door, whatever their background, interests or needs, will be taught to the same high standards in math, reading and science as defined by their state, even if the path they take to get there may look different. Moreover, public school districts are accountable to their communities for making sure that all students are on track toward meeting these standards and are fully transparent about how their tax dollars are spent. There are many ingredients that go into a high-quality education: good teachers, effective principals, highlevel curriculum and extra support for struggling students top the list. Offering students different program options is yet another strategy schools can use to make sure young people develop the knowledge and skills they will need to succeed, regardless of what their personal choices are for after high school."}, {"section_title": "The National School Boards Association on School Choice", "text": "The Center for Public Education is an initiative of the National School Boards Association (NSBA). While we seek to be as objective as possible in our work, we have one clear bias: CPE is for public education. Readers should also be aware that NSBA has official positions on school choice, as follows: \u2022 Public education choice: NSBA supports \"locally elected school boards in expanding public school choices to meet the needs of students in a rapidly changing world.\" This support extends to charter schools as long as the local school board \"retains sole authority\" to grant and revoke charters. NSBA opposes charter schools \"not subject to oversight of the local school board.\" \u2022 Non-public education choice: NSBA \"recognizes and upholds the right of any group to establish and maintain schools so long as such schools are fully financed by their own supporters. \" At the same time, NSBA believes public tax dollars should \"only support public schools\" and opposes \"vouchers, tax credits, and tax subsidies for use at non-public K-12 schools. \" NSBA further believes that \"private and home schools should be subject to governmental regulation that assures a minimum standard of instruction under state law and adherence to the Constitution and laws of the United States. \""}, {"section_title": "CHOICES BETWEEN AND CHOICES WITHIN PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS", "text": "The current dialogue about school choice is generally focused on charter schools, private school vouchers, tax credits, and Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) which can be used to pay for a range of non-public school tuitions or services. But it misses a fundamental reality: most public school districts already offer a wide range of choices to their students. Because of their economies of scale, school districts can cater to the needs of many children with diverse needs. In addition, unlike many private school options, the civil rights of children with disabilities, English language learners, children from low-income families, children from all religions, and LGBT students are all protected within the public system. Additionally, public schools are held accountable for their academic success and financial responsibility, both to parents and taxpayers. In this report, we examine the extent to which public schools offer parent options for their children's education, whether through the choice of a public school building or an educational program within a traditional public school. Learn more: Why parents choose the schools they do for their child (https://www.nsba.org/ newsroom/american-school-board-journal/asbj-april-2017/database-giving-parents-what-they-want) Many school districts offer magnet or charter schools to students, which provide additional opportunities for parents to select the school building that they think will best suit their child's needs. \u2022 43 states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing the formation of charter schools (ECS 2016). \u2022 38 states and DC have magnet schools; the most common themes are STEM, arts, and health (Brookings, 2017). \u2022 33 states have mandatory or voluntary intra-or within-district transfer policies (ECS 2016). \u2022 43 states have provisions for inter-district, or between-district transfer, with 17 states requiring districts to allow some form of transfers, depending on building capacity, geography, and other factors (ECS 2016). \u2022 Altogether 65 percent of public school students have the option to transfer to schools within their districts or neighboring districts (SASS 2012). Not surprisingly, the option for intra-district transfer is more available to students in larger districts. Some districts even require parents to choose a school for their child. Learn more: The Education Commission of States has information on inter-and intra-district transfers (http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/mbquest4e?rep=OE1605) by state that includes applicable provisions, as well as charter school policies (https://www.ecs.org/charter-school-policies/)."}, {"section_title": "CHOICE OF SCHOOL BUILDING CHOICE OF IN-SCHOOL PROGRAM", "text": "School buildings are not the only avenue for choice. Many public schools, especially high schools, offer a wide variety of academic and extracurricular options for students to explore. Some states, such as Texas, even offer a choice of diploma. In many cases, we found that public schools offer more variety than private schools. Weighting of the sample units was carried out to produce national, regional, and state estimates for public schools, districts, principals, teachers, and school libraries. Private schools, principals, and teachers were weighted to produce national, regional, and affiliation strata estimates. The weighting procedures used in SASS had three purposes: to take into account the school's selection probability; to reduce biases that may result from unit nonresponse; and to make use of available information from external sources to improve the precision of sample estimates.\" (NCES 2011-2012 SASS Methods and Procedures) The U.S. Census Bureau carried out the surveys. The definition of school type (Primary, Middle, High, or Combined) is an NCES classification. The 9 th -12 th grade statistics were calculated for High Schools or Combined Schools that served at least one 9 th -12 th grade student. All public Combined Schools served at least one 9 th -12 th grade student; the private Combined Schools were only included in the 9 th -12 th grade analysis or the K-8 analysis, depending on if they served 9 th -12 th grade students. The public primary and middle schools included only those classified as such in NCES data. The private K-8 schools included schools classified as primary or middle schools by NCES, as well as combined schools that did not serve 9 th -12 th grade students. For our analysis of program choice, the category \"public schools\" does not include charter schools. Our purpose in this section was to identify the amount of access to program choices inside traditional public school buildings. However, charter school access is addressed under \"Choice of School Building\" (page 5) as well as in CPE's earlier report, \"School Choice: What the research says.\" Special education schools (by NCES classification) and alternative schools (either through their NCES classification or identified as entire schools that serve students who have been referred for behavioral or adjustment problems) were also excluded from analysis. Private schools were excluded if they operated in a private home or were classified as special education or alternative schools. All calculations are estimates based on the weights included in the SASS database to adjust for sampling bias.

In addition, the vast majority of public high schools offer access to hands-on college and career experiences. \u2022 Students in 86 percent of public high schools are able to earn dual credits (high school and college) and explore various career pathways; about half of these programs are funded by the school or district. \u2022 Almost all public high schools (98 percent) offer some form of career preparation through dual credit opportunities, Career Technical Education, internships, or a career academy.

Public schools in general are more likely to offer AP courses than private schools Program choice by school size, 9th-12th grade schools, 2012 \u2022 The smallest (under-350) public high schools have GT/honors programs at about the same rate as private schools. \u2022 Smaller public high schools are more likely to offer distance learning than larger public high schools and private schools: 67 percent of public schools with fewer than 350 students compared to 55 percent of all public high schools and only 28 percent of private schools overall. As with other educational resources, there are inequities in access to program choices between highpoverty schools and their wealthier counterparts. Even so, more high-poverty public high schools offer more program choices than private schools overall. For our purposes, school poverty is defined by the proportion of students eligible for Free and Reduced Price lunch. \u2022 The difference in AP access between low (< 20 percent) and high (80 percent +) poverty schools is 10 percentage points: 70 to 60 percent respectively. There are similar differences with GT/honors programs. Program choice by school poverty, 9th-12th grade schools, 2012 \u2022 Inequitable access between high-and low-poverty public schools is much narrower when looking at access to dual credit and career pathways, although high-poverty schools still have fewer program offerings. \u2022 High-poverty public schools are more likely than private schools to offer GT/Honors, AP, IB or distance learning programs. Middle and elementary schools also offer program choices to their students, although the data we examined did not include as many programs that might be more popular for younger students. We do see, however, that public schools still offer greater opportunities for students in GT/Honors courses than private schools. The variation across various sizes and types of schools was small, although large schools are more likely to offer foreign language immersion and GT/Honors courses than smaller campuses. Very few private schools are classified as middle schools, so private school data had to be combined into one category for elementary and middle school. Program choice in middle and elementary schools, 2012 \u2022 Eighth-graders in public schools are more likely to have access to extracurricular activities in the arts than their private school peers. Nearly nine in ten (86 percent) public middle schools offer afterschool programs in music and 69 percent provide them in visual arts, according to the National Assessment of Education Progress (2017). In comparison, 76 percent of private middle schools have these programs in music and just 49 percent offer them in visual arts. \u2022 Public schools are also more likely to provide afterschool daycare, tutoring or enrichment than privates schools. \u2022 While data is not available for how many schools offer athletic programs, about 60 percent of 8 th , 10 th , and 12 th grade students report participating in a school-sponsored sport (Child Trends, 2014).  At this writing, 20 states have drafted plans that include strategies to better meet individual student needs, such as personal learning plans, multiple pathways to graduation, and attention to socialemotional learning. At least four are proposing to advance students on the basis of mastery or proficiency of state standards rather than seat time as schools typically do now (KnowledgeWorks, 2017). Such policies will allow students to progress through school at their own pace, through pathways of their choosing, while assuring every one of them has developed the academic foundation they need for life after high school."}, {"section_title": "Personalized learning in the Green Mountain state", "text": "Vermont was an early adopter of personalized learning statewide. In 2013, the legislature passed Act 77, which among other things, requires middle and high schools to develop \"flexible and multiple pathways\" that lead to a diploma and postsecondary readiness. The pathways are to include work-based learning opportunities, such as apprenticeships and internships; virtual and blended learning; dual enrollment in college courses while in high school; and an early college program that allows 12 th -graders the option to complete the first year of college at a Vermont campus. Progress along the way will be based on students' demonstration of proficiency. The engine driving students through these pathways is the personalized leaning plan. Beginning in 7 th grade, each student will develop a plan towards becoming collegeand career-ready that reflects his or her \"emerging abilities, aspirations, interests and dispositions.\" Parents and guardians will be closely involved in drafting the plan. Students will also be helped by a school representative to ensure its viability. The plan will be reviewed annually as an added assurance it remains both realistic and responsive to students' evolving interests and goals. But a plan is only as good as its follow-through, and Vermont has anticipated what students will need for success. In addition to offering multiple, rigorous learning opportunities, the state calls on public schools to \"ensure that students receive appropriate career counseling and program information.\" In order to handle the extra workload, public schools are to employ guidance counselors at a ratio of one to every 200 students at the secondary level, and one to 300 at the elementary. As a point of comparison, the current national average is one counselor to 500 students (ASCA, 2014). School nurses will also be available on a one to 500 student basis. The Vermont School Boards Association is a champion for Act 77. VSBA has joined with Up for Learning, a small nonprofit dedicated to developing youth-adult partnerships, and the state Agency of Education, on a statewide communications initiative to engage public support for the act's reforms. So far, the effort seems to be paying off. According to Harry Frank, VSBA director of education services: \"While there is some constructive caution, there is a groundswell of support for the work.\" He noted that the business community, in particular, has been very supportive, and is doing its part by providing apprenticeships and other workbased experiences. The first cohort of students to have the full benefit of personalized learning plans from grade 7 on will be seniors this coming academic year, 2018-19. Over this time, Vermont's already high on-time graduation rates have bumped up to 88 percent -well above the nation's average. However, the real proof will be in the post-secondary outcomes as the Act 77 students enter college and work. \"This is a huge change, and there is a lot of work to do,\" Frank observed, adding, \"It's only gaining momentum.\" Today's graduates face an ever-changing workplace and society. Preparing our youth for this world demands more from public schools than the delivery of subject matter alone. Students must also develop the capacity for using this knowledge in new, yet to be imagined situations. Educators call this capacity \"deeper learning,\" which the Alliance for Excellent Education defines as \"the delivery of rich core content to students in innovative ways that allow them to learn and then apply what they have learned\" (AEE, 2011). As such, deeper learning goes hand-in-hand with the goal to personalize learning through multiple pathways and turn every student into a college-and career-ready graduate. Deeper learning comprises six competencies: Learn more: Since 2010, the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation has awarded over $100 million in grants to help public schools make the shift to deeper learning.

These trained professionals communicate what the options are to parents and students and how they can meet students' interests and needs. Moreover, counselors can help monitor students' learning plans to make sure they are getting the right courses and experiences to meet their goals, as well as keep an eye on their progress so they stay on track. The American School Counselor Association recommends that schools should provide one counselor for every 250 students. In 2014, the national average ratio was one to 500. Clearly, our public schools could use more. Even so, according to our analysis of SASS data, they still have a clear advantage over private schools in their capacity to provide these services to students.

LEAs, for example, comprise the vast majority of charter school authorizers (National Association of Public Charter School Authorizers, 2017). Magnet schools are likewise under local control. But as we've shown here, districts offer choices to students that don't involve going to another school building. Schools across the country provide a range of program options that appeal to different students' interests and needs, and still lead to a diploma that prepares graduates for success whatever their next steps. They are also making use of new data systems to personalize learning and monitor student progress towards proficiency, allowing them to proceed at their own pace. School leaders who want to expand options for students, or improve on what they already have, should consider the following questions: \u2022 What choices do you offer students now? Are there enough openings to meet demand? Or conversely, are students taking advantage of them? How do you know if what you are offering appeals to the interests and needs of your students, parents and community? Is there equitable access to all programs? \u2022 Do you have a communications plan in place to inform students and parents about the choices you offer? Do students and parents know what options are available and how to access them? \u2022 Are there local colleges and businesses with whom you can partner to provide collegeand career-related learning opportunities? Can you expand program choices to offer dual enrollments, internships or apprenticeships? \u2022 Do you have sufficient resources-including teachers, counselors and technology-to expand program choices? Are you able to hire and retain qualified teachers for specialized courses and subject areas? Do you have enough school counselors to help students develop personal learning plans and monitor their progress to make sure they are on track toward meeting their goals? Do you have the technology for delivering online courses and lessons? \u2022 Do you have a data system that enables teachers, counselors, parents and students to personalize learning experiences and monitor individual progress? Do you provide professional development so they can use data systems effectively as well as personalize learning experiences? \u2022 How will you hold yourselves accountable for providing choices that serve students' interests and needs while assuring every student is meeting state academic standards? What data will you monitor to evaluate whether the options you provide are having the desired effect? Do you have a process in place to make needed adjustments?

CPE provides up-to-date research, data, and analysis on current education issues and explores ways to improve student achievement and engage public support for public schools. CPE is an initiative of the National School Boards Association. www.centerforpubliceducation.org Founded in 1940, the National School Boards Association (NSBA) is a not-for-profit organization representing state associations of school boards and their more than 90,000 local school board members throughout the U.S. Working with and through our state associations, NSBA advocates for equity and excellence in public education through school board leadership. www.nsba.org These estimates are based on the respondents of schools from each state. For states with fewer respondents, it is more difficult to make a precise estimate. The confidence intervals show where the true population mean should lie, with 95% certainty, based on the data available. These estimates are also weighted, which means that NCES used the Common Core of Data on every school to determine if schools were over-or under-sampled based on size, urbanity, poverty, etc. Then, the estimates take into account the true school population and the responses of the schools that were surveyed. Smaller states or those with low survey response rates have very wide ranges of where the true mean may lie, and should not be used. States with wide variation will also have larger confidence intervals than those that are more homogeneous. States where all respondents replied \"yes,\" which appears in several tables, but most predominantly in the \"Any of the 4 Career Options\" table, show up as a single dot at the 100% mark. This does not mean that every school in the state has these programs; only that every school in the state that responded to the survey had the program, thus making it impossible to estimate the true population mean. For free/reduced lunch status, keep in mind that this is the average of school poverty for high schools, not the average of how many students qualify for free/reduced lunches. Also, high school students are less likely to receive free/reduced lunch than their elementary and primary counterparts (Education Week, 2014 "}, {"section_title": "APPENDICES", "text": ""}]
