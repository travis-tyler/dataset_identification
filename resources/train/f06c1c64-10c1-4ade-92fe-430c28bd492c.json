In some areas, mean fetch and SCRs exhibit the general relationship of low mean fetch on shorelines with little to no erosion (A) and higher mean fetch on shorelines having higher erosion (B). However, these relationships were not observed throughout the study area. For example, moderate-to-high mean fetch values occur on shorelines that are accreting (C)    et al. 2004). In addition to enduring human impacts, coastal areas are highly vulnerable to climate change and its effects on storms and sea-level rise (Nicholls et al. 2007). As dynamic systems, coastal areas respond to geomorphological (antecendent physiography) and environmental (waves, sea level) factors (Crowell et al. 2003a,b). Inundation of low-lying, coastal areas will displace residents. Rowley et al. (2007) estimate that a 1 m increase in sea level will inundate 62.28 x 10 3 km 2 of land in the southeastern U.

Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (2009) has identified population growth, coastal development, loss of sensitive coastal habitat, and increased risks to life and property from coastal hazards as challenges facing NC's coastal zone. Through the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shoreline data, Titus and Richman (2001) estimate 5.8 x 10 3 km 2 is below 1.5 m elevation within NC. The ecological and economic importance of estuaries has increased awareness emphasizing further understanding and management of estuaries and, more specifically, of estuarine shoreline change (Benoit et al. 2007). Within NC, multiple studies have analyzed estuarine shoreline change in the 70's and 80's (Stirewalt and Ingram 1974;SCS 1975;Bellis et al. 1975;Riggs et. al 1978;Hardaway 1980) and within the past decade (Riggs 2001;Riggs and Ames 2003). These previous studies suggest factors responsible for shoreline erosion, including bathymetry, shoreline composition and geometry, vegetation type and abundance, and storm intensity and frequency (SCS 1975;Riggs et. al. 1978;Hardaway 1980;Riggs 2001;Riggs and Ames 2003). In addition to developing a new point-based approach to calculate shoreline-change rates, some of the parameters associated with estuarine shoreline change (i.e., wave energy and shoreline composition) were determined within Chapter 2 utilizing available datasets. A newly developed point-based approach is evaluated in comparison to the commonly used transect-based approach. The control of shoreline composition and wave energy on shoreline change is statistically analyzed along Cedar Island, NC. From the analysis performed in Chapter 2, it is determined that the mean shoreline-change rate of this island is -0.24 m yr -1 , with 88% of the shoreline within the study area eroding. Of the parameters analyzed, shoreline composition appears to have an important control on shoreline erosion; however, wave energy is not significantly correlated with shoreline-change rates. Additionally, the point-based approach is determined to be a simple, accurate, and efficient way to determine shoreline change over a large area at a high resolution. Estuarine shorelines are further analyzed within the Neuse River Estuary, NC in Chapter 3. The point-based approach and methodology used in Chapter 2 is utilized within Chapter 3 to calculate shoreline change over the same time period  and analyze the influence of elevation, vegetation, fetch, and wave exposure at two spatial scales, referred to as Regional and Local, using the same resolution. The Regional Scale analyzes shoreline change within the entire study area with data points spaced every 50 m, while the Local Scale groups the data into eight sections, based on orientation and exposure, where the data is averaged and compared. The Local Scale analysis is an attempt to decrease the variability in the data and account for spatial autocorrelation, which is known to be an issue. The mean shoreline-change rate of the Neuse River Estuary is -0.58 m yr -1 and the majority (93%) of the study area is eroding. Linear regression analysis at the Regional Scale did not find significant correlations between shoreline change and the parameters analyzed; however, general trends were observed in the Local-Scale analysis, which determined higher erosion rates, higher elevation, and lower wave exposure and fetch up-estuary. Erosion rates, fetch, and wave exposure increase, while elevation decreases moving eastward, down-estuary. In order to further understand these relationships, linear regression analysis between mean fetch and mean shoreline-change rates at the Local Scale was performed within Chapter 3; this yielded an equation to predict shoreline-change rates based on mean fetch values. This equation was applied at the Regional Scale using the calculated mean fetch values.

Excluding Alaska, coastal counties comprise 17 % of the nation's land, yet they contain over 50 % of the United States population (based on 2003 data, Crossett et al. 2004). Therefore, these areas have much higher population densities. Crossett et al. (2004) determined that the national average density (excluding Alaska) is 254 people per square kilometer for non-coastal counties, which is about one third of the average density for coastal counties (777 people per square kilometer). For these reasons, the management and development of coastal areas is of large concern, and information of shoreline change (e.g., erosion) is tremendously important. Coastal erosion has been analyzed extensively along ocean shorelines, but more recent attention has focused on the movements and mechanisms of estuarine shoreline change (Benoit et al. 2007). Although sheltered from energetic open-ocean processes, estuaries are complex systems, enduring storms and offering a place of refuge for many organisms. Estuaries are biologically rich, productive ecosystems that are important for fish and shellfish growth and associated fisheries; approximately 75% of fish caught in the United States use estuaries during at least one stage in their lifetime (Martin et al. 1996). Estuarine shorelines also act as natural buffers, diminishing the physical energy from waves and currents. Shorelines show great variability in behavior, accreting and eroding at different rates; this is evident in research performed by Riggs and Ames (2003), who calculated erosion rates for various shoreline types in eastern North Carolina. \nDue to the significance of estuaries as fish nurseries (Martin et al. 1996) and with a higher density of people residing in coastal counties (Crossett et al. 2004), considerable interest surrounds the health of the estuarine shoreline (Benoit et al. 2007). Previous research has focused extensively on oceanfront, sandy beach shorelines, including analysis of the influence of offshore shoals (McNinch 2004), longshore sediment transport (Miller, 1999), and erosion (Zhang et al. 2004). Although the estuarine environment is located within the coastal area, in close proximity to oceanfront beaches, estuarine shorelines are generally more protected, not exposed to the vast ocean fetches and large tidal fluctuations. However, these protected estuarine shorelines are impacted by a variety of factors, including high energy events, such as storms and wind waves. The estuarine environment is complex and an important refuge for juvenile fish and filtering waste, pollution, and excess nutrients from water (Martin et al. 1996;Day et al. 1989). Estuarine shoreline change has been calculated in previous studies (Gibson 2006;Hennessee and Halka 2005;Phillips 1985;Price 2006;Riggs 2001;Riggs and Ames 2003;Schwimmer 2001;Swisher 1982;Thieler et al. 2001); however, only a few studies have quantitatively analyzed the influence of various parameters on estuarine shoreline change (Gibson 2006;Phillips 1985;Schwimmer 2001). The objective of this study is to further understand the influence of parameters (elevation, vegetation, fetch, wave exposure) associated with estuarine shoreline change over a large scale using readily available datasets and techniques. Shoreline change analysis has been conducted utilizing different approaches, including field observation, transect-based, and point-based approaches (Dolan et al. 1991;Douglas et al. 1998;Fenster et al. 2001;Forbes et al. 2004;Gibson 2006;Morton et al. 2005;Phillips 1985;Price 2005;Rozynski 2005;Schwimmer 2001;Thieler and Danforth 1994a;Thieler et al. 2001). Field-based methods are costly, requiring manpower and resources. Additionally, historical or long-term shoreline-change analysis is not attainable solely through field observations unless monitoring programs began previously. The transect-based and point-based approaches can both be used with remotely sensed data to calculate short-and long-term shoreline change. The transect-based approach has been implemented since its inception with attempts to automate the process dating back to Dolan et al. (1978). Extraction and application of the transect-based approach became more easily executable with the Digital Shoreline Analysis System, created by the USGS (Danforth and Thieler 1992). However, recent research has unveiled the ease and application of a point-based approach in estuarine shoreline change analysis (Cowart et al. in review). In addition to calculating shoreline change, Cowart et al. (in review) describes how the point-based approach allows the user to easily associate parameters or variables (e.g. vegetation, elevation, and fetch) to the shoreline change occurring at each point along the shoreline. This study applies the point-based approach of Cowart et al. (in review) to analyze shoreline change at a large-scale (fine-resolution) along the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina (Figure 3.1). In addition to shoreline change, parameters previously associated with shoreline erosion (elevation, fetch, wave exposure, shoreline vegetation) are determined and statistically analyzed. The estuary is analyzed at two scales: Regional (the estuary as a whole) and Local (the estuary partitioned into eight sections, based on orientation and exposure)."}, {"section_title": "Background Study Area", "text": "CI is located in Carteret County (34\u00b0 57'N, 76\u00b0 22'W), approximately 64 km (40 miles) northeast of Beaufort, NC (Figure 2.1). It is part of the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES), the second largest estuary in the United States, and is considered one of 28 \"nationally significant\" estuaries (Martin et al. 1996). CI encompasses 58.6 km 2 with 44.5 km 2 consisting of flooded brackish marsh (Freske 2007). Brinson et al. (1991) describe three vegetation zones on CI where at the shoreline is zone 1, which is comprised primarily of Juncus roemerianus and Distichlis spicata, with the latter being less abundant. In terms of physical energy, the shoreline of CI varies dramatically, from protected areas within the Thoroughfare, a canal separating the island from the mainland, to areas exposed to the vast fetches of Pamlico Sound and thus, vulnerable to wave attack. CI is protected from ocean swells by the Outer Banks chain of barrier islands and thus is dominated by wind waves and tide due to the restricted flow of open-ocean waves and water into the estuarine system."}, {"section_title": "Processes Impacting Shoreline Change", "text": "Recent media focus on climate change has drawn attention to sea-level rise and its potentially adverse affects on coastal systems. The physical effects of sea-level rise can include shoreline erosion, marine submergence, inundation of low-lying coastal areas, and these effects may be magnified by increased storm events (Barth and Titus 1984;Titus 1990). Rising sea level is expected to widen and deepen estuaries as they are submerged and eroded (Bird 1995). These changes are evident in Jamaica Bay, NY where Hartig et al. (2002) document a 12% loss in marsh area over a 39-year period (1959 to 1998) in which local sea level rose 10.5 cm. Although sea-level rise is one important factor impacting coastal erosion, other processes are also expected to contribute, such as winds, waves, currents, bioerosion, and anthropogenic influences (Davis and Fitzgerald 2004). Waves impacting the shoreline can suspend sediment while currents can transport these materials elsewhere, causing erosion. Wave energy is a product of the wind, bathymetry, and fetch. Erosion potential is higher in areas with larger fetches due to greater anticipated wave build up (Phillips 1985). Waves impacting the shoreline are influenced by many factors including shoreline elevation and vegetation. For example, Moller (2006) determined that the density and type of marsh vegetation was significantly related to wave height dissipation. While marshes are able to vertically accrete when flooded through sediment deposition, shorelines with elevations above sea level are expected to accrete more slowly, and depending on their size and lithology, these areas may experience mass wasting when acted upon by high energy waves. For example, Phillips (1999) found that repeated storm events caused slope failure and recession on unconsolidated shoreline bluffs with relief greater than or equal to 1.5 m, while less shoreline retreat occurred on areas of lower elevation (e.g. marsh, cypress fringe, and low relief banks)."}, {"section_title": "Calculating Shoreline Change", "text": "Shoreline change can be calculated through the time-series comparison of various data, including ground surveys, NOS T-Sheets, aerial photography, satellite imagery, synthetic aperture radar, light detecting and ranging (LIDAR), and regional positioning system. Although new satellite and other remotely sensed approaches are becoming feasible (e.g., LIDAR, see Li et al. 2001), aerial photography analysis remains the most commonly used method to calculate shoreline change (Boak and Turner 2005). Due to the complex physical processes eroding and moving sediments within the shore zone, spatial and temporal errors are potentially created when using aerial photography to calculate shoreline change. Spatial distortion is present in aerial photographs in the form of tilt, radial distortion, and relief displacement (see Crowell et al. 1991; Moore 2000 and references therein). However, these distortions are generally corrected when the image is rectified. Rectification gives the image a spatial reference and is necessary before shoreline delineation. Temporal shoreline error exists because an aerial photograph is a snapshot in time of a dynamic system. For example, an image taken after a storm may display a shoreline that has retreated, but has not yet recovered, and large storms can rapidly erode the shoreline, taking more than a year to recover (Douglas et al. 1998). However, through analyzing shoreline change in excess of a century, Fenster et al. (2001) determine that storm-influenced data values are not outliers. In spite of these inherent errors, Crowell et al. (1991) calculated a \"worst-case error estimate\" of 7.7 m using non-tide-coordinated aerial photography and geomorphic control, which exceeds the National Map Accuracy Standards (\u00b112.2 m; USGS 1999). Shoreline change can be calculated through various methods, including the end-point rate (EPR), average of rates, linear regression, and jackknifing, as discussed by Dolan et al. (1991). The EPR is the most commonly used method due to its computational ease and because only two shorelines are required (Dolan et al. 1991). The EPR is calculated by measuring the distance between the shorelines and dividing by the time difference between the shorelines. Analysis of shoreline change has often been conducted using an automated transect-based approach. In this approach, transects are created perpendicular to a baseline that is positioned landward or seaward of the shorelines being analyzed (Thieler and Danforth 1994a;Thieler et al. 2001;Morton et al. 2005;Forbes et al. 2004). An EPR is calculated from the distance between shorelines along these fixed transects. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), created by and available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (see Thieler and Danforth 1994b), is a commonly used tool for transect-based shoreline change analysis."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Shoreline-Change Rates", "text": "To calculate SCRs in this study, 1998 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQs) and 1958 black and white aerial photographs were used; the methodological steps are illustrated in contact prints of the1958 photographs were scanned using a Microtek ScanMaker 9800XL at 8-bit pixel resolution with a 600-dpi image resolution and were saved in tiff format. Once in digital form, the 1958 photographs were rectified using the 1998 DOQQs and the georeferencing tools within ArcGIS \u00ae . Using a second-order polynomial transformation, the photographs were rectified with a minimum of 8 ground control points. For the CI study area, twenty-six 1958 aerial photographs were rectified with an average root-mean-square error of 1.68 m. Once aerial photographs were rectified, the wet/dry line was delineated on sediment shorelines (see Boak and Turner 2005 and sources therein), and the apparent shoreline was digitized on vegetated shorelines (i.e., the vegetation boundary; see Ellis 1978). The shorelines were on-screen digitized as a polyline using a zoom tolerance of 1:500 to 1:3000 (Poulter 2005). After digitization, a point was created every 50 meters along the 1998 shoreline using the ArcGIS \u00ae DIVIDE function (within the editor toolbar), and the points were saved as a point shapefile. A polygon shapefile was generated from the 1958 shoreline polyline to define the initial land area. By intersecting the 1998 shoreline points with the 1958 polygon land area, the shoreline points that had moved landward were identified, i.e., indicating erosion or negative shoreline change. Then, the EPR method was used to calculate the SCR at each point. The distances from the 1998 shoreline points to the 1958 shoreline were determined using the NEAR tool in ArcGIS \u00ae . The distance value was then divided by 40 years, to calculate the SCR over the four decade time period between photographs. Because the nearest distance is used to calculate SCRs, the point-based approach determines conservative shoreline change values. An example of the SCR methodology is shown for a subset area from the CI study area in Figure 2.3. In this example area, shoreline recession occurred on the headland shorelines, whereas the embayed shoreline, between the headlands, accreted. The total positional uncertainty (U T ) of the shorelines and SCRs determined within this study was calculated based on work performed by Genz et al. (2007) and Fletcher et al. (2003). Of the error variables used by Genz et al. (2007) and Fletcher et al. (2003), three were utilized to calculate U T for this study, including digitization error of the 1998 shoreline (E d1 ), digitization error of the 1958 shoreline (E d2 ), and rectification error (E r ; Equation 2.1). Equation 2.1For shoreline change analysis using aerial photography the tidal fluctuation error can be incorporated; however, since the tidal fluctuation within the study area is minimal (\u2264 10 cm; Benninger and Wells 1993), this variable was not included in the positional uncertainty analysis. Through multiple digitization of the same area, a digitization error of 0.55 m was calculated for the 1998 and 1958 shorelines. As stated previously, the 1958 rectified aerials had an RMSE of 1.68 m; therefore, the U T of the shorelines and SCR data is \u00b1 1.85 m, which is 0.05 m yr -1 over the 40 year period. SCRs calculated with the more common transect-based approach, using DSAS, were compared to the point-based approach, . Within DSAS, SCRs were calculated along transects extending from baselines at multiple distances from the 1998 shoreline. Baselines were created by buffering the 1998 shoreline and then converting the polygon buffer to a polyline, as explained in the DSAS manual. The polyline was then clipped and the landward portion of the line was used as the baseline.\nUsing the point-based approach, the SCR of the study area ranged from -1.89 to 1.74 m yr -1 and had an average of -0.24 m yr -1 with 88% eroding, 2% showing no change, and 10% accreting (Table 2.1, Figure 2.5A). As shown in the histogram within Figure 2.6, the SCR distribution was negatively skewed (Skewness = -0.96) with 78% of the points clustering between zero and -0.5 m yr -1 . Lower SCRs (more erosion) occurred in the higher fetch areas on headland areas of northern CI whereas higher SCRs (less erosion) were located in embayed, protected areas ( Figure 2.5A and 2.5D). Using the transect-based approach (version 3.0; Thieler et al. 2005), SCRs were calculated and varied depending on the baseline distance used (Table 2.2). For a 50-m baseline, the SCRs ranged from -6.9 m yr -1 to 1.2 m yr -1 with an average of -0.4 m yr -1 . The average SCR using a 200-m-baseline distance was similar (-0.4 m yr -1 ), but the range was larger (39.5 m yr -1 ) than that determined using a 50-m baseline distance (8.1 m yr -1 )."}, {"section_title": "Controlling Parameters", "text": "Several parameters identified in previous studies that have been considered to affect estuarine erosion were determined at the 1998 shoreline points, including those reflecting wave energy and shoreline composition. Fetch and relative exposure index (REI), a proxy for wave energy, were calculated using a Wave Exposure Model (WEMo). WEMo is an ArcGIS \u00ae tool developed by and available from NOAA and has been used as a measure of wave exposure in submerged aquatic vegetation research (Fonseca et al. 2002). In WEMo, fetch is determined by radiating 32 lines at 11.25\u00b0 angle increments from the point of interest. The fetch lines are then clipped to the area occupied by the bathymetric dataset to obtain the fetch length. To create a single representative metric of fetch, the 32 fetch lengths were averaged, producing the \"mean fetch\" value at each shoreline point.  (Hess et al. 2004). The NOAA TDEM has a 6-m horizontal resolution and 20-cm vertical accuracy (NAVD 88 datum). Values less than zero were masked, using the ArcGIS \u00ae spatial analyst extension, to create a raster dataset of values below sea level. Hourly wind data was obtained from the KHSE weather station, located in Hatteras, NC (35\u00b014'N 75\u00b037'W, see Figure 2.1), for the four-decade period . From the wind data, average wind speeds and durations were calculated for the 8 major compass heading directions ( Figure 2.4). Shoreline composition was evaluated by determining the elevation and vegetation at the shoreline points. Shoreline elevation in this study is the elevation of the area surrounding each shoreline point and was determined using the topographic data within the NOAA TDEM. Elevation values greater than zero were masked, using the ArcGIS \u00ae spatial analyst extension, to generate a raster dataset of land elevation values. The elevation at each point was assigned by determining the average value within a 25-m buffered area using zonal statistics within Hawth's Tools \u00a9 (Beyer 2007). Vegetation is a categorical variable that was determined using the 1997 NOAA Land-Use Land-Cover (LULC) dataset (Dobson et al. 1995). Because shoreline points did not perfectly overlie the LULC data, the nearest LULC value was determined for each shoreline point. This was accomplished by converting the LULC raster dataset to a point shapefile and then using the NEAR tool to determine the LULC type for each shoreline point."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Wave Energy", "text": "Comparing the fetch values of the shoreline points for the eight major compass heading directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW), the mean northeastern and northern fetches were the largest while the mean western fetch was the lowest (Table 2.1).

The majority (95%) of the shoreline points with a mean fetch value greater than 1.5 km were eroding. REI values ranged from 0 to 8387 with an average of 318 (Table   2.1, Figure 2.5C).

Half of the shoreline analyzed was at or below 0.5 m elevation (Figure 2.5B) and the majority (90%) of the shoreline points were less than 1 m in elevation. Because the vertical accuracy of the elevation data is 20 cm, the elevation values were binned into 30-cm intervals and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine if the mean SCRs located at higher elevation intervals were significantly different than the mean SCRs at lower elevation intervals (Figure 2.7). A Tukey test performed with 95% confidence in the ANOVA concluded that mean SCRs of elevation intervals greater than 1.2 m (mean SCRs < -0.60 m yr -1 ) were significantly different from mean SCRs of elevation intervals lower than 1.2 m (mean SCRs from -0.18 to -0.26 m yr -1 ).

Transects intersecting the same shoreline more than once is an issue discussed in previous work (Moran 2003); however, this research found transects generated using DSAS are also problematic when calculating SCRs along highly sinuous and headland shorelines (Figure 2.9). For example, Figure 2.9A displays a morphologically complex area which experienced both spitgrowth accretion and shoreline erosion. In this area, the cuspate formation precludes the creation of the necessary transects to calculate shoreline movement. Highly sinuous areas are problematic using the transect method because transects are generated at varying angles, from which highly oblique (i.e., too large) SCRs are calculated. Other options are available when using DSAS to calculate SCRs, which include using an offshore or a straight baseline and creating smoothed transects. Creating an offshore or straight baseline may calculate accurate shoreline change calculations on straight coastlines, but would have similar problems to those previously discussed. The option of using smoothed transects was not utilized within this study due to problems with software operation. Experienced users of DSAS may successfully employ this transect-based approach to calculate SCRs in complex areas; however, the trial-and-error process of determining the best application of the transectbased approach is time consuming and somewhat arbitrary. Therefore, the repeatability of the results may be limited, whereas the point-based approach used within this study is a simple, accurate, and efficient way to determine shoreline change over a large area at a high resolution."}, {"section_title": "Shoreline-Change Rates of Cedar Island, NC", "text": "Previous work conducted on CI determined SCRs at 21 sites located 1 km apart from 1986 to 1987 and at 20 sites from 1987 through 1988 (Brinson et al. 1991). In this work, the average SCR from 1986 to 1987 was -0.47 m yr -1 , which is almost double the SCR determined in this study (-0.24 m yr -1 ). However, the average SCR in this study was close to the SCR calculated by Brinson et al. (1991) during the second year of analysis (-0.27 m yr -1 ). Although these data have different spatial extent and resolution, the general agreement between the datasets is encouraging. The variation in the Brinson et al. (1991) datasets may reflect short-term variability in SCRs. The similarity to the long-term rates calculated within this study suggest consistency at different time scales. Through the analysis of 21 sites within the APES, SCRs were calculated by Riggs and Ames (2003); these sites were categorized into various shoreline types, including mainland marsh and low sediment bank. The mainland marsh was comprised of seven sites and had an average SCR of -0.91 m yr -1 , a considerably higher erosion rate than that determined for the estuarine emergent wetland shoreline (-0.22 m yr -1 ) in this study. However, there was considerable inter-site variability in the average SCR within their study. For example, the northern side of Swan Quarter, which is described as more protected, i.e., having low fetch, has a average SCR of (-0.37 m yr -1 ), which is more comparable to results of this work. The higher rates observed in the APES study by Riggs and Ames (2003) were largely from sites that had been anthropogenically modified or experienced more exposed conditions; only a few sites were located in low fetch areas, which may explain the dramatic difference in mean rates. In comparison, similar average SCRs have been calculated on marshes in Rehoboth Bay, Delaware. Swisher (1982) determined an average SCR of -0.23 m yr -1 from aerial photography analysis from 1938 to 1981 on the southern shoreline of Horse Island, consisting of mainland marsh. On a shorter time scale (1995 to 1998), Schwimmer (2001) calculated an average SCR of -0.23 m yr -1 for the same area. Both short and long-term SCR calculations are comparable to the average SCR for estuarine emergent wetland (-0.24 m yr -1 ) calculated in this study."}, {"section_title": "The Control of Wave Energy on Shoreline Change Rates", "text": "Wave energy is widely considered to be an important control on shoreline erosion rates. In previous work in Delaware Bay, wave energy flux, calculated from fetch, bathymetry, and wind data, was correlated with shoreline change (Schwimmer 2001). To test the relationship between wave energy and SCR along the CI shoreline, fetch and REI were measured to compare with SCRs. Qualitatively, in certain areas fetch and REI appear to have an obvious control. For example, headlands on the northern shore of the study area are found to have higher erosion than the embayed areas, lying between the headlands (Figure 2.5A). This pattern coincides with the general concept of wave refraction where oncoming wave energy is focused on the headland area and the embayed area between headlands receives a reduced amount of wave energy in comparison. It is common that lower average fetch areas have higher SCRs (less erosive, Figure 2.10A), whereas higher average fetch values have higher erosion (more negative SCRs, Figure 2.10B). However, these patterns are not continuous throughout CI, as shown in Figure 2.10C, where an area of higher SCRs (little to no erosion) has high average fetch. When the collective dataset is analyzed, no statistical relationship is present between SCR and fetch and REI. Similar results were found by Brinson et al. (1991) where fetch values, calculated from USGS topographic maps, are regressed with total erosion from 1986 through 1988. Therefore, within the CI study area it appears wave energy does not have a dominant control on the SCR."}, {"section_title": "Shoreline Composition Effects on the Shoreline Change Rates", "text": "Data in this study indicate SCR varies with elevation of the coastline and between vegetation types, suggesting the importance of shoreline composition. Elevation intervals greater than 1.2 m have more negative average SCRs and are significantly different than average SCRs from areas with elevation intervals less than 1.2 m. Between the three dominant LULC types (scrub/shrub, evergreen forest, estuarine emergent wetland), the distribution of elevation shows a similar trend, where the lower elevation LULC type (estuarine emergent wetland, 0.51 m) is significantly different from the higher elevation LULC types (evergreen forest and scrub/shrub, each ~ 1 m) (Table 2.3; Figure 2.11). These data suggest elevation and/or shoreline type can be used to predict SCRs at these shoreline types. The observed relationship between shoreline composition and SCRs are not surprising. It is known that marshes are difficult to erode due to their cohesive sediments, binding roots, and the baffling nature of marsh grasses (Goodbred and Hine 1995), aiding their ability to vertically accrete through sediment and organic matter accumulation (Nyman et al. 1990;Nyman et al. 2006;Craft et al. 1993). Riggs and Ames (2003) also determine a higher SCR (less erosive) for marsh shorelines relative to low sediment bank shorelines, which are non-marsh areas with elevations < 1.5 m. Similarly, Riggs and Ames (2003) find low sediment bank shorelines to have a relatively low SCR, comparable to the observations reported here for evergreen forest and scrub/shrub. To summarize, the evergreen forest and scrub/shrub mean SCRs are more negative (more erosional) than the estuarine emergent wetland LULC type along CI (Table 2.3). This relationship is similar to the SCRs exhibited by the mainland marsh and low bank shorelines in Riggs and Ames (2003). Note, however, the evergreen forest (-0.40 m yr -1 ) and scrub/shrub (-0.39 m yr -1 ) mean SCRs on CI (Table 3) are less negative (less erosional) compared to the low sediment bank shorelines (-0.98 m yr -1 ) analyzed by Riggs and Ames (2003). This may be related to different conditions (water, nutrients) and/or shoreline characteristics (e.g., lithology or land use). Through the present and previous studies, it is evident that a multiple parameter approach is necessary to determine how estuarine shorelines change."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Shoreline-change analysis is an important concern with growing coastal populations, real estate, and infrastructure investment. The development and management of these areas can benefit from the analysis of shoreline movement with time, including morphologically complex shorelines. A new point-based approach to calculate shoreline change at high resolution in sinuous and dynamic areas is presented and proven to be effective. Using this methodology, the CI study area is shown to have an average SCR of -0.24 m yr -1 for the 40-year period analyzed (1958 to 1998). Based on the parameters analyzed, it is evident that shoreline composition (reflected by elevation and vegetation) appear to have an important control on SCRs; however, wave energy (represented by fetch and a wave exposure index) does not appear to be as influential. Tables  Table 2. Figure 2.1 for location). The plot is created from hourly wind data collected from 1958 to 1998. The mean wind speed for each of the eight compass heading directions is dominantly less than 10 m s -1 ; however, the wind duration and strongest winds are dominantly from the north, northeastern, and southwestern directions.     The shoreline area that has eroded, accreted, or not changed is represented as blue, red, and taupe, respectively. Shoreline-change rates (SCRs) are represented by transects and points using the same color scheme; therefore, areas where transects and points do not have the same color, a different range of SCR is calculated. Note, the transect-based approach does not calculate shoreline change that occurred on the migrating spit (A). Transects created perpendicular to the sinuous shoreline (B) are at dramatic angles therefore calculating SCRs larger than observed. Baseline distance clearly affects the SCRs calculated using the transect-based approach (C). As the baseline distance increases, the SCRs calculated decrease due to the decreased number of transects created. Figure 2.10: Location map and three sub-area maps of mean fetch (triangles) and shoreline-change rate (SCR) values (circles). In some areas, mean fetch and SCRs exhibit the general relationship of low mean fetch on shorelines with little to no erosion (A) and higher mean fetch on shorelines having higher erosion (B). However, these relationships were not observed throughout the study area. For example, moderate-to-high mean fetch values occur on shorelines that are accreting (C). CHAPTER 3: Shoreline Change in the Neuse River Estuary, NC\nUsing the point-base approach and a sampling interval of 50 m, the shoreline of the NRE was analyzed at two spatial scales (Regional and Local). The Regional Scale was the largest, encompassing the main trunk of the NRE shoreline. The majority of the NRE trunk shoreline is eroding (93%) and the mean SCR of the study area is -0.58 m yr -1 . No significant linear correlations were distinguishable between shoreline-change rates and the parameters analyzed (elevation, fetch, and REI) at the Regional Scale. Based on orientation and exposure, the NRE shoreline was partitioned into eight Local Sections. At the Local Scale, a trend was evident with erosion rates increasing down-estuary with increasing mean fetch and decreasing mean elevation. However, the mean SCR and parameter values were not significantly different between  Tables   Table 3.

The Ablemarle, Currituck, Croatan, Pamlico, Bogue, Core and Roanoke sounds, in addition to the Tar-Pamlico and the Neuse River estuaries compose the APES. The Neuse River Estuary (NRE) is the southernmost sub-estuary contained within the APES and is fed by the Neuse River on the western end. The NRE is shaped like a bent arm with the elbow approximately 30 km from the mouth of the river (Benninger and Wells 1993). It connects the NRE with the Pamlico Sound on the eastern end (Figure 3.1). The APES is separated from the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern side by the Outer Banks, a series of barrier islands. The tidal influence of the Atlantic Ocean is restricted by four inlets resulting in an astronomical tidal variation of \u2264 10 cm (Benninger and Wells 1993). Due to the low tidal influence, the major force driving water flow is the wind (Luettich et al. 2000), and the large fetches of Pamlico Sound make the NRE susceptible to large wind waves (> 1 km) during strong winds (e.g. storms). The NRE is 70 km long, 6.5 km wide, and has an average depth of 3.5 m (Luettich et al. 2002). It is described as a \"trunk estuary\" and is a drowned river valley, flooded after the last glacial maximum (20,000 ybp), when sea-level rose to its current position (Riggs 2001 resolution with a 600-dpi image resolution and were saved in tiff format. Once in digital form, the 1958 photographs were rectified using the 1998 DOQQs and the georeferencing tools within ArcGIS \u00ae . Ninety 1958 aerial photographs were rectified using a minimum of 4 ground control points. The mean number of ground control points used in rectification was 9.5, and depending on the number of ground control points, the aerial photographs were rectified with a first-or second-order polynomial transformation. In areas where less than six ground control points were identified, the first-order polynomial transformation was needed; otherwise, the second-order polynomial transformation was used. The rectification process had a root-mean-square error of 1.51 m. Once the aerial photographs were rectified, the wet/dry line was delineated on sediment shorelines (see Boak and Turner 2005 and sources therein), whereas the apparent shoreline was digitized on vegetated shorelines, i.e., the vegetation boundary (see Ellis 1978). The shorelines were on-screen digitized as a series of polylines using a zoom tolerance of 1:500 to 1:3000 (Poulter, 2005). The polyline segments were then routed, using the CREATE ROUTES linear referencing tool within ArcGIS \u00ae . After the shorelines were digitized and routed, points were created every 50 meters along the 1998 shoreline using the ArcGIS \u00ae DIVIDE function and saved as a point shapefile. A polygon shapefile was generated from the 1958 shoreline polyline to define the initial land area. By intersecting the 1998 shoreline points with the 1958 polygon land area, the shoreline points that had moved landward were identified, i.e., indicating erosion or negative shoreline change. Then, the end-point rate method was used to calculate the SCR at each point (Cowart et al. in review;Dolan et al. 1991). Distances from the 1998 shoreline points to the 1958 shoreline were determined using the NEAR tool in ArcGIS \u00ae . The distance value was then divided by 40 years, to calculate the SCR over the four decade time period between photographs. The total positional uncertainty (U T ) of the shorelines and SCRs determined within this study was calculated based on the work performed by Genz et al. (2007) andFletcher et al. (2003). Of the error variables used by Genz et al. (2007) andFletcher et al. (2003), three were utilized to calculate U T for this study, including digitization error of the 1998 shoreline (E d1 ), digitization error of the 1958 shoreline (E d2 ), and rectification error (E r )."}, {"section_title": "Equation 3.2", "text": "For shoreline change analysis using aerial photography the tidal fluctuation error can be incorporated; however, since the tidal fluctuation within the study area is minimal (\u2264 10 cm; Benninger and Wells 1993), this variable was not included in the positional uncertainty analysis. Through multiple digitization of the same area, a digitization error of 0.55 m was calculated for the 1998 and 1958 shorelines. As stated previously, the 1958 rectified aerials had an RMSE of 1.51 m; therefore, the U T of the shorelines and SCR data is \u00b1 1.70 m, which is 0.04 m yr -1 over the 40 year period."}, {"section_title": "Evaluating Parameters that Influence Shoreline-Change Rates", "text": "To evaluate controls of SCR, some of the parameters identified in previous studies that have been considered relevant to estuarine erosion were determined at the 1998 shoreline points, including fetch, wave exposure, elevation, and shoreline vegetation. Fetch is the unobstructed distance over open water. Relative Exposure Index (REI) was used as a proxy for wave exposure. The fetch and REI values were calculated using a Wave Exposure Model (WEMo). WEMo is an ArcGIS \u00ae tool developed by and available from the NOAA and has been used as a measure of wave exposure in submerged-aquatic-vegetation research (Fonseca et al. 2002). In WEMo, fetch was determined by radiating 32 lines at 11.25\u00b0 angle increments from the point of interest. The fetch lines were clipped to the area occupied by the bathymetric dataset. To create a single representative value of fetch, the 32 fetch lengths were averaged to calculate the \"mean fetch\" value at each shoreline point. The fetch, bathymetry, and wind data were used to calculate REI within WEMo. The bathymetry data, used to calculate REI, was extracted from the NOAA  (Hess et al. 2004). The NOAA TDEM has a 6-m horizontal resolution and 20-cm vertical accuracy on land and lower resolution for bathymetric data due to varying age and acquisition of data (NAVD 88 datum). To create the bathymetry dataset, values less than zero were extracted (i.e., below sea level), using the ArcGIS \u00ae spatial analyst extension. Hourly wind data were obtained from the KHSE weather station, located in Hatteras, NC (35\u00b014'N 75\u00b037'W, see Figure   3.1), for the four-decade period (1958 to 1998). Additionally, elevation and shoreline vegetation were determined at the shoreline points. Shoreline elevation is the elevation of the area surrounding each shoreline point and was determined using the topographic data within the NOAA TDEM. Values greater than zero (land) were extracted within the NOAA TDEM, using the ArcGIS \u00ae spatial analyst extension. The elevation at each point was assigned by determining the average elevation value within a 25-m buffered area using the ZONAL STATISTICS function within Hawth's Tools \u00a9 (Beyer 2007). Shoreline vegetation is a categorical variable that was determined using the 1997 NOAA landuse land-cover (LULC) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) dataset (Dobson et al. 1995). Because shoreline points did not perfectly overlie the LULC data, the nearest value was assigned to each shoreline point. This was accomplished by converting the LULC raster dataset to a point shapefile and then using the NEAR tool."}, {"section_title": "Regional Scale", "text": "Of the 156 km of shoreline analyzed, 93.0% eroded, 6.6% accreted, and 0.4% did not change over the 40-year period. The average SCR of the NRE was -0.58 m yr -1 for the 40-year time period and ranged from -3.48 to 2.89 m yr -1 (Table 3.1). Higher erosion rates (lower SCRs) were determined down-estuary where the NRE opens to Pamlico Sound, whereas up-estuary, where the Neuse River enters the system, had lower erosion rates (higher SCRs), as shown in Figure   3.3. The mean shoreline elevation of the study area was 0.96 m with a range of 7.20 m (Table 3.1). The majority (70%) of the shoreline had a mean elevation value less than 1 m. Because the vertical accuracy of the DEM used to derive the mean elevation values is 20-cm, the mean shoreline elevation values were binned into 30-cm intervals (Figure 3.4). An ANOVA was performed to determine if the average SCR was significantly different between the elevation intervals. A Tukey test, performed within the ANOVA, determined that there was no significant difference between mean SCR values of the 30-cm elevation intervals. Of the dominant eight compass heading directions (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and southwest), the lowest average fetch direction within the NRE was southwest (1.8 km) and the highest average fetch direction was east (8.8 km, Table 3.1). The mean fetch value of the study area was 4.6 km with a range of 18.8 km. Generally, larger mean fetch values were located down-estuary and in the middle of the NRE on the southern shoreline, where long northeastern fetches occur. Smaller mean fetches were located in embayed areas and on the shorelines up-estuary of the NRE (Figure 3.5). Similar to fetch values, REI values had a large range (11.6 x 10 3 ), while the mean REI value for the entire study area was relatively low (1.82 x 10 3 ; Table 3.1). Linear regression analysis indicated elevation, fetch, and REI were not correlated with SCRs; mean elevation, fetch, and REI values only explained 1.5% of the variation in the SCR values. A significant relationship was calculated between the parameters and SCR values (p= 0.000), largely due to the large number of values in the dataset, but this does not explain much of the variation in SCRs (e.g., low correlation coefficient). The majority of SCRs were located on mean elevation less than or equal to 1.00 m (70%), with approximately one quarter of the shoreline within the study area being less than or equal to 0.50 m (24%, Figure 3.6A). The SCRs within the 0 to 1.00 m mean elevation had a wide distribution, ranging from 2.89 to -3.48 m yr -1 . SCRs had a broad distribution throughout the study area, independent of mean fetch ( Figure   3.6B). Although the distribution of SCRs decrease at higher REI values, there was no direct correlation between the exposure at the shoreline and SCRs using a 50-m sampling interval at the regional scale (Figure 3.6C). Of the 16 LULC types within the C-CAP dataset, 14 are located on the shoreline of the NRE study area, including bare land, cultivated land, deciduous forest, estuarine emergent wetland, evergreen forest, grassland, high intensity developed, low intensity developed, mixed forest, palustrine emergent wetland, palustrine forested wetland, palustrine scrub/shrub wetland, scrub/shrub, and unconsolidated shore. Of these LULC types, estuarine emergent wetland are the most dominant, composing 46% of the shoreline. Deciduous forest is the least abundant (<1%) of the 14 LULC types present. To further evaluate the affect of shoreline composition on SCRs, the LULC types were grouped into 4 categories: Wetland (palustrine emergent wetland, palustrine forested wetland, palustrine scrub/shrub wetland, estuarine emergent wetland), Sediment Bank (unconsolidated shore, bare land, grassland, scrub/shrub), Forest (deciduous forest, mixed forest, evergreen forest), and Other (high intensity developed, low intensity developed, cultivated land). When the 4 LULC categories are compared, the mean SCR of the Sediment Bank shoreline (-0.70 m yr -1 ) is the lowest (most erosive) and is significantly different from the Wetland, Forest, and Other LULC categories (Table 3. Bank shorelines compared to Forest and Other LULC categories. Although the Wetland areas had the highest mean fetch value, these areas had the lowest mean elevation and least amount of erosion (highest SCR)."}, {"section_title": "Local Scale", "text": "The Local Scale is performed by binning the shoreline points into 8 Sections based on orientation and exposure. Section 1 is the northwesternmost shoreline, with section numbers increasing eastward. Odd sections are along the north shoreline and even sections are along the southern shoreline (Figure 3.7). The highest mean erosion rates (lowest SCRs) are calculated for Sections and 8 (-0.73 and -0.70 m yr -1 ) and Section 2 has the lowest erosion rate (-0.33 m yr -1 ; Table 3.3). The mean SCR decreases (became more erosive) on the northern and southern shoreline moving from west to east. The inverse relationship is present for mean fetch values, with the lowest mean fetch calculated for Section 1 (1.80 km) and Section 7 having the highest mean fetch (7.48 km). Excluding Section 1, the mean elevation values decreases moving from west to east, with Section 2 having the highest mean elevation (1.63 m) and the lowest mean elevation calculated for Section 8 (0.58 m).

Within the sub-estuaries of the APES, the highest SCRs (least erosional) calculated for wetland shorelines are determined along Cedar Island (-0.24 m yr -1 ; Cowart et al. in review) and the lowest wetland SCRs (most erosive) along the shoreline of Swan Quarter (-0.91 m yr -1 ; Riggs and Ames 2003). Considering the variability of shoreline vegetation composition and fetch, it is not surprising that the mean SCR of the NRE trunk is within the range of wetland SCRs calculated in the APES. Similar to the findings in Cowart et al. (in review), the Wetland areas are shown to be eroding less, compared to the other shoreline LULC types; however, the mean SCR of Wetland shoreline data within the NRE (-0.53 m yr -1 ) is eroding at more than double the rate of the wetland shoreline points analyzed along Cedar Island, NC (-0.22 m yr -1 ). A higher mean erosion rate is likely due to the wave energy and shoreline composition (e.g., elevation) within the NRE compared to Cedar Island, NC. There is no linear correlation between the parameters analyzed (elevation, fetch, and REI) and SCRs along the main trunk of the NRE. Similar conclusions were found along the shoreline of Cedar Island, NC (Cowart et al. in review). However, Cowart et al. (in review) determined significant difference between mean SCRs of different vegetation types, and this is not evident in the NRE shoreline data. Similar to the findings in Cowart et al. (in review), the highest mean SCRs (lowest erosion rate) occur at Wetland shorelines and the lowest mean SCRs (highest erosion rate) occur at Sediment Bank shorelines along the NRE shoreline; however, unlike the Cedar Island study, the mean SCRs are not significantly different between each of the LULC types. Discrepancies between the findings of the two studies may be due to the spatial distribution of the LULC types within the NRE trunk. For example, the majority (42%) of the Wetland is located down-estuary in the NRE, which experiences the largest fetch and is at a lower mean elevation. Although 63% of the shoreline up-estuary is Wetland, it represents only 23% of the Wetland shoreline within the NRE and is almost half the amount located further down-estuary. Conflicting results between the Cedar Island study and the findings within the NRE may also be due to spatial autocorrelation. Spatial autocorrelation occurs when values located near eachother are similar compared to those farther apart. When values located close together are similar, they are considered spatially dependent (see Dolan et al. 1992;Phillips 1985). For example, shoreline change is expected to be consistent in areas with less geomorphological complexity compared to a more geomorphologically complex area. This is illustrated in previous research on linear oceanfront shorelines which determined that SCRs can be averaged over 6 to 10 km along the Atlantic coast of North Carolina (Dolan et al. 1992) whereas the more geomorphologically complex Delaware Bay, NJ shoreline must be sampled at 3-km stretches to avoid spatial autocorrelation (Phillips 1985). To avoid the impact of spatial autocorrelation with the NRE, shoreline change was further analyzed at the Local Scale. Phillips (1985) analyzed up-bay and down-bay sites within the Delaware Bay, NJ at three scales (6.5, 10.4, and 17.4 km). Up-bay sites were more protected and were located further from the open water of the Atlantic Ocean, similar to Sections 1 and 2 within the NRE. The down-bay area was more exposed and comparative to Sections 7 and 8 within the NRE. Similar to the general trends determined at the Local Scale within the NRE, Phillips (1986) found lower erosion rates up-bay and higher erosion rate down-bay. The trends may emphasize the influence of shoreline vegetation type and exposure on shoreline change."}, {"section_title": "Local Scale Trends", "text": "The general trend of increasing erosion moving from more protected areas, (up-estuary, Sections 1 and 2) to more exposed areas (down-estuary, Sections 7 and 8) is also shown in the vegetation data at the Local Scale. The Forest, Sediment Bank, and Other vegetation categories all show a general trend of increasing erosion down-estuary. However, the Wetland plot (Figure 3.8D) displays only a subtle, if any, increasing erosion trend down-estuary (with increasing Section number). Suggesting this shoreline type may be more independent of fetch compared to the other vegetation types. Large fetches may create wind waves that overtop the shoreline. As the water floods onto the wetland vegetation, the wetland marsh grass may vertically accrete sediments due their ability to baffle waves (Goodbred and Hine 1995). Previous research has suggested the influence of storms on estuarine forest and sediment bluff recession (Kirwin et al. 2007;Phillips 1999). In this work, higher erosion rates down-estuary in the Forest and Sediment Bank shorelines may be due to the orientation of the NRE and storm events. Nor'eaters occur along the Atlantic coast from October to April and can generate large waves causing considerable erosion and property damage (Davis and Dolan 1993). At the Local Scale, the lowest mean SCRs (highest erosion) are calculated for Sections 7 and 8, which are more susceptible to the influence of wind waves generated from the nor'easters. Because the imagery utilized within this study spanned a 40-year time period, the impacts of storm events cannot be elucidated."}, {"section_title": "Predicting Erosion Rates", "text": "The mean SCRs at the Local Scale of the three parameter analyzed were all negative . Therefore, none of the equations derived from the regression analysis will predict positive SCRs (accretion).

However, the higher residuals on large fetch shorelines are predominantly Wetland, suggesting there may be a compositional effect. Additionally, large residual values were determined on the western part of Section 7, where the shoreline is predominantly Sediment Bank. It appears shoreline change may be underestimated for this LULC type. A similar approach was conducted for marsh shorelines in Rehoboth Bay, Delaware with erosion rates and wave power (Schwimmer 2001). By log transforming erosion rates and estimated wave power calculated for nine sites, Schwimmer (2001) determined a positive correlation (R 2 = 0.80). As wave power increased, erosion rate also increased; however, like the mean SCRs of the eight Sections used to determine  "}, {"section_title": "Additional Influences on Shoreline Change", "text": "There are additional parameters that were not addressed within this study that may affect shoreline change. One possible affect on shoreline change that was not analyzed within this study is shoreline modification. A field excursion performed in the winter of 2007 revealed large portions up-estuary and within the middle of the NRE that have some type of shoreline modification structure, i.e. bulkhead, riprap, groin, or a combination. However, installation dates of these modification structures are unknown; therefore, the influence of these modification structures on the shoreline change rates could not be determined. Previous research has concluded that shoreline modification structures along the Texas Gulf of Mexico coast altered the sediment budget and caused the largest amount of long-term shoreline change (Gibeaut et al. 2000). The spatial distribution of shoreline modification structures may explain the discrepancies between the Cedar Island study (Cowart et al. in review) and the NRE related to vegetation type and SCRs discussed above. Cedar Island is part of the National Wildlife refuge and there are no shoreline modification structures within the study area. The SCRs of the NRE are influenced by the implementation of shoreline modification structures."}]
