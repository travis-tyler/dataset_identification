[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Mild cognitive impairment Alzheimer disease Fludeoxyglucose PET Brain functional MRI Intrinsic functional connectivity Default mode network\nSimultaneously evaluating resting-state brain glucose metabolism and intrinsic functional activity has potential to impact the clinical neurosciences of Alzheimer Disease (AD). Indeed, integrating such combined information obtained in the same physiological setting may clarify how impairments in neuroenergetic and neuronal function interact and contribute to the mechanisms underlying AD. The present study used this multimodality approach to investigate, by means of a hybrid PET/MR scanner, the coupling between glucose consumption and intrinsic functional activity in 23 patients with AD-related cognitive impairment ranging from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to mild-moderate AD (aMCI/AD), in comparison with a group of 23 healthy elderly controls. Between-group (Controls > Patients) comparisons were conducted on data from both imaging modalities using voxelwise 2-sample t-tests, corrected for partial-volume effects, head motion, age, gender and multiple tests. FDG-PET/fMRI relationships were assessed within and across subjects using Spearman partial correlations for three different resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) metrics sensitive to AD: fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and group independent component analysis with dual regression (gICA-DR). FDG and rs-fMRI metrics distinguished aMCI/AD from controls according to spatial patterns analogous to those found in stand-alone studies. Within-subject correlations were comparable across the three rs-fMRI metrics. Correlations were overall high in healthy controls (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.80 AE 0.04), but showed a significant 17% reduction (p < 0.05) in aMCI/AD patients (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.67 AE 0.05). Positive across-subject correlations were overall moderate (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.33 AE 0.07) and consistent across rs-fMRI metrics. These were confined around AD-target posterior regions for metrics of functional connectivity (ReHo and gICA-DR). In contrast, FDG/fALFF correlations were distributed in the frontal gyrus, thalami and caudate nuclei. Taken together, these results support the presence of bioenergetic coupling between glucose utilization and rapid transmission of neural information in healthy ageing, which is substantially reduced in aMCI/AD, suggesting that abnormal glucose utilization is in some way linked to communication breakdown among brain regions impacted by the underlying pathological process."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately 9 million people in Europe (Diaz-Ponce et al., 2016) . This disease is characterized by asymptomatic onset (Dubois et al., 2014) followed by cognitive decline that worsens with disease progression (Bouwman et al., 2010; McKhann et al., 2011) . AD affects memory and the ability to carry out voluntary and purposeful actions, inducing difficulties in language production and comprehension as well as disorientation in time and space.\nNovel biomarkers have been developed to support the diagnosis of AD (Dubois et al., 2014) . These are primarily derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hippocampus (Sarazin et al., 2010) and from analysis of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) or tau protein concentrations (Nisbet et al., 2015; Nordberg, 2010) . In addition, molecular neuroimaging biomarkers by means of positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET), which reflects glucose metabolism mainly from neurons (Dennis and Thompson , 2014) , provides an accurate predictor of AD progression in the form of temporo-parietal, posterior Cingulate and Precuneus hypometabolism (Ch etelat et al., 2003; Ito et al., 2015; Minoshima et al., 1997; Mosconi, 2005; Scheltens et al., 2016) .\nIn these regions, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), which exploits the blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) endogenous contrast (Buckner et al., 2008; Dennis and Thompson , 2014; Greicius et al., 2004; Supekar et al., 2008) , has disclosed the physiological presence of intrinsic functional architectural patterns in the low-frequency (0.01-0.1 Hz) oscillations, including the default mode network (DMN) (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001) , which are sensitive to the AD process (Greicius et al., 2004; Hafkemeijer et al., 2012; Klaassens et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2010) . rs-fMRI therefore has potential clinical relevance, especially as it is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive and easy to acquire in comparison to PET-FDG.\nThe recently developed hybrid PET/MRI scanners now allow one to simultaneously acquire glucose metabolism and rs-fMRI under the same physiological condition (Wehrl et al., 2015) . This constitutes an exciting opportunity to investigate the relationships between intrinsic metabolic and functional brain changes (Aiello et al., 2016; Cecchin et al., 2017; Tahmasian et al., 2015) . To date, published studies that have integrated these two imaging modalities in a simultaneous acquisition setup have involved healthy adults using seed-based methods for rs-fMRI network analysis (Riedl et al., 2014) , or healthy elderlies using local intrinsic functional activity metrics (Aiello et al., 2015) . However, to date the intimate coupling between FDG-PET hypometabolic pattern and rs-fMRI network disruption in AD-related brain damage has been little addressed.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no simultaneous PET/fMRI study published to date has investigated how early AD-related local changes in resting-state glucose consumption relate to the changes in functional activity observed in stand-alone rs-fMRI studies. Such knowledge is likely to provide novel insights towards the development of clinically relevant tools Tahmasian et al., 2015) . In the present simultaneous resting-state FDG-PET/fMRI study we investigated the relationships between glucose consumption and intrinsic functional activity in healthy aged individuals and patients with mild AD on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Intrinsic functional activity was assessed by means of three metrics that differ in spatial-extent definition and relevance to AD process (Aiello et al., 2016; Cha et al., 2015; Damoiseaux et al., 2012) , namely i) fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), a single-voxel indicator of BOLD signal frequency power independent from brain connectivity thereof (Zou et al., 2008; Zuo et al., 2010) ; ii) regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of local functional connectivity (Zang et al., 2004) ; and iii) group-independent component analysis with dual regression (gICA-DR), which identifies common spatiotemporal patterns and project them back to each individual (Beckmann et al., 2009; Beckmann and Smith, 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Materials & methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patient population", "text": "A total of twenty-three patients (Table 1) were recruited at the Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) SDN in Naples, Italy. Among them, seventeen were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate probable AD according to the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) workgroup (McKhann et al., 2011) and six fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of amnestic MCI (Petersen et al., 2009 Folstein et al., 1975) and the evaluation of memory, language, executive function/attention, and visuo-construction abilities. Exclusion criteria included a history of other neurologic or major psychiatric disorders and systemic diseases that may affect cognitive functions (e.g. uncontrolled endocrine disorder) and the presence of any significant cerebral focal lesion on brain MRI apart from mild age-related leukoaraiosis (Fazekas score <2) (Fazekas et al., 1987) . Anti-cholinesterase (AChEI) and antidepressant drug therapies were not a cause for exclusion. In the whole group, 26% of the patients were treated with AChEI, 17% with antidepressant and 17% with both (Table 1) .\nTwenty-three healthy elderly already presented in our previous work (Aiello et al., 2015) were used as the control group and will herein be referred to as healthy elderly controls (Table 1) .

Attenuation correction was performed using MR-based attenuation maps derived from a dual echo (TE \u00bc 1.23-2.46 ms) Dixon-based sequence (TR \u00bc 3.60 ms), allowing for reconstruction of fat-only, water-only and of fat-water images (Aiello et al., 2015) .\nAs FDG-PET acquisition started, clinical MRI sequences including three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo sequence (MPRAGE, 176 sagittal planes, 256 \u00c2 240 mm2 field of view, voxel-size 1 \u00c2 1 \u00c2 1 mm3, TR/TE/TI 2300/2.96/ 900 ms, flip angle 9 , TA \u00bc 5 0 14 00 ) and T2*-weighted single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence (voxel-size 4 \u00c2 4 \u00c2 4 mm3, TR/ TE \u00bc 1920/32 ms, flip angle \u00bc 90 , 240 time points, field of view (FOV) read \u00bc 256, distance factor \u00bc 0, TA \u00bc 7 0 40 00 ) were run consecutively.\nIn line with the procedure guidelines for PET brain imaging provided by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) (Varrone et al., 2009) , patients were asked to fast for at least 6 h prior to FDG injection: approximately 250 MBq of 18F-FDG were intravenously injected only if glycaemia was below 120 mg/dl. Patients were positioned in a quiet and warm dark room 15 min before FDG administration and during the uptake phase. Simultaneous resting-state FDG-PET/MRI data acquisition started 30 min following the injection of FDG. PET data were acquired in 15 min. While in the scanner, subjects were asked to relax, not to be engaged in structured thoughts and keep their eyes open to avoid falling asleep."}, {"section_title": "Data preprocessing", "text": "Imaging data were analyzed using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) 17.1.01 (Cox, 1996 (Cox, , 2012 and FSL 5.0.4 (Jenkinson et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2004) 64-bit software on a Mac-OS 10.7 computer. BOLD-weighted, anatomical MRI and FDG-PET images were preprocessed in each single-subject space (Fig. 1) . All Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images were anonymized and converted to compressed Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format using the DCM2NII tool (https://www.nitrc.org/ projects/dcm2nii).\nT1-weighted images were skull-stripped using the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) with the robust brain centre estimation option, aligned to corresponding BOLD-weighted and FDG-PET images (3dAllineate, AFNI), resampled to 2 mm isotropic (3dresample, AFNI) to accommodate for EPI and FDG-PET resolution differences, and segmented into probabilistic grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and CSF compartments (FAST, FSL). Individual GM binary masks were thus derived from 50% GM suprathresholded voxels plus those whose GM probability exceeded those of WM and CSF, respectively (3dcalc, AFNI). Probabilistic weighted GM density maps were then coregistered to the MNI-ICBM-152 stereotaxic template using 12 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) affine transformations (flirt, FSL). The affine transformation matrix was used to conduct a nonlinear spatial normalization of the T1-weighted image (fnirt, FSL), and weighted GM density maps were finally warped to the MNI template using non-linear registration parameters (applywarp, FSL). The cerebellum was excluded from any GM density maps due to its partial coverage in BOLD-EPI sequences.\nFDG-PET images were skull-stripped using BET with bias-field and neck cleaned-up (Jenkinson et al., 2005; Smith, 2002) . Images were masked within the corresponding individual GM binary mask in the single-subject space (3dcalc, AFNI) and then spatially normalized to the MNI stereotaxic template (Grabner et al., 2006) using the non-linear transformation parameters (applywarp, FSL), resampled at 2-mm isotropic (3dResample, AFNI) voxels and standardized to z-scores with respect to FDG mean and standard deviation across GM voxels (3dcalc, AFNI). Moreover, the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was also calculated by global mean normalization, as commonly evaluated in 18 F-FDG PET studies of aMCI/AD.\nPreprocessing of BOLD-weighted images included the removal of first 10 vol to avoid non-equilibrium magnetization effects (fslroi, FSL), head (BET, FSL) . Multiple linear regressions of the 6 head motion displacements plus their derivatives and mean WM and CSF timeseries were applied to remove additional sources of spurious physiological noise (3dDeconvolve, AFNI). Linear and quadratic trends were also removed at this stage. Then, the temporal mean image was re-added to the residual volumes in a voxel-wise fashion."}, {"section_title": "rs-fMRI metrics", "text": "Neural activity is associated with low-frequency spontaneous BOLD oscillations. For this reason, each subject's BOLD-EPI image ratio from within the low-frequency range (0.01-0.1 Hz) out of the total power spectrum, referred to as fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), was calculated within each individual GM binary mask on a voxel-by-voxel basis (3dRSFC, AFNI). Afterwards, each subject's BOLD-EPI image was temporally filtered (0.01-0.1 Hz) using a bandpass filter (fslmaths, FSL) to allow the estimation of rs-fMRI connectivity metrics. Then, ReHo maps were defined as metrics of local functional connectivity. These were estimated calculating the Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall and Gibbons, 1990) in clusters of 27 nearest-neighborhood voxels across the entire brain (3dReHo, AFNI) within each individual GM binary mask.\nThereafter, individual BOLD-EPI images, fALFF and ReHo maps were spatially smoothed using a 6-mm FWHM gaussian kernel (3dFWHMx, AFNI) that emulates the resulting smoothing applied to FDG-PET maps, spatially normalized to stereotaxic space using the non-linear transformation parameters (applywarp, FSL), resampled at 2-mm isotropic voxels and standardized to z-scores with respect to each metric's GM mean and standard deviation, respectively (3dcalc, AFNI).\nIn addition to local intrinsic brain functional metrics, large-scale intrinsic functional connectivity was calculated using gICA-DR across all individuals (N \u00bc 46) using the temporal-concatenation procedure implemented in the Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) from the FSL library (Jenkinson et al., 2012) . The concatenated BOLD-weighted data were variance-normalized to account for temporal dynamics in each voxel timeseries and decomposed into 15 independent components. This dimensionality allowed optimal IC estimation and minimized splitting effects (Abou Elseoud et al., 2011; Marchitelli et al., 2017) .\nAmong these 15 components, we identified the component corresponding to the DMN using an in-house automated spatial overlapping procedure (3dcalc, AFNI) between each component and a DMN template (Yeo et al., 2011) . The suprathresholded (z > 3.2) component with the highest number of overlapping voxels and the lowest of non-overlapping voxels related to the template was selected and projected back onto each preprocessed individual BOLD-weighted image using the dual-regression methodology as implemented in FSL and finally standardized to z-scores as the other rs-fMRI metrics (3dcalc, AFNI)."}, {"section_title": "Head movement", "text": "Metrics of intrinsic functional activity are known to be highly sensitive to head movements (Power et al., 2012) . In particular, healthy elders and patients typically show higher and more heterogeneous head motion profiles than healthy young adults. We have therefore measured the amount of head movements from the six timeseries of head motion displacement obtained after head motion correction of rs-fMRI data to rule out the possibility that motion could compromise metrics of intrinsic brain activity for a particular subject and hamper the comparison between the two samples.\nIn particular, timeseries indicating rotations were converted to millimeters, considering a sphere of radius 50 mm as the best estimate of the mean distance from the cerebral cortex to the centre of the head. The derivative of each motion displacement timeseries was then calculated. The straight sum across the absolute derivative timeseries was calculated to yield a single framewise displacement (FD) timeseries (n \u00bc 230) that summarized instantaneous movements in each subject (Power et al., 2012) . Furthermore, the temporal median of FD timeseries was calculated to summarize motion per each subject. This choice depended upon the greater robustness of median values against outliers, and to account for non-normally distributed FD timeseries samples."}, {"section_title": "Between-group comparisons", "text": "In this study, statistical analyses of scalar quantities were assessed using IBM SPSS Statistics v22, whereas voxel-based statistical evaluations were conducted in AFNI.

Independent 2-sample t-tests were also conducted on full individual datasets on a voxel-by-voxel basis (3dttest\u00fe\u00fe, AFNI) across the two groups (healthy > AD) for each imaging modality and metric (FDG-PET, fALFF, ReHo, gICA-DR). Since head movements (Power et al., 2012) and GM atrophy (Xie et al., 2015) likely bias these comparisons, median individual FD values were included together with age and gender as group scalar covariates. Furthermore, probabilistic GM maps were also included as voxel-based covariates to deal with the variability in GM density across groups. Statistical t-maps were standardized to z-scores and further corrected for false positive clusters (3dClustSim, AFNI), applying the alphasim method option (3dttest\u00fe\u00fe, AFNI). This option computes sign-randomization and permutation (N \u00bc 10000) of the t-test statistic residuals to generate null-hypothesis datasets. Then, significant clusters were defined considering a 1-sided threshold and first-nearest neighbor clustering methods. The per-cluster statistical significance level was set to p < 0.05 and false positive rate significance threshold to \u03b1 < 0.05.

For each subject (N \u00bc 46), Spearman rank correlations between FDG-PET and each separate fMRI-based metric dataset were conducted, partialling out GM probability values to minimize unwanted structural atrophy-induced biases. Corrections for multiple comparisons were conducted using the Bonferroni method (p < 0.02).\nA Friedman test was conducted to either assess differences among PET/fMRI metrics or evaluate group effects. Multiple comparisons were conducted using Bonferroni's correction in the former case only, as the latter involved less than three tests. For each FDG/fMRI metric correlation, the effect sizes were reported with respect to the two groups. These were calculated using the Cohen's d formula (Cohen, 1988) and corrected for bias using Bessels' correction (McGrath and Meyer, 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Across-subject PET/fMRI correlations", "text": "Across-subject correlations were calculated in AFNI. For each imaging modality and metric, volumes were concatenated across all subjects and patients (N \u00bc 46) (3dTcat, AFNI). The choice of concatenating all subjects from both groups relies on the assumption that neural specificity increases when considering both groups together, besides the advantage of the larger sample size (Aiello et al., 2015) . To reduce across-subject GM variability biases, those voxels present in less than 45/46 subjects were excluded. Afterwards, Spearman's rank across-subject correlations were calculated between FDG-PET and each rs-fMRI metric, within each GM voxel (3dTcorrelate, AFNI) adjusting for partial volume effects (Altman, 1991) . Scalar covariates were not included in this analysis given that they showed no significant effect in any voxel between the two groups.\nIn order to evaluate the presence of differences in across-subject FDG/ fMRI correlational patterns according to the rs-fMRI metric considered, the procedure above was repeated using a bootstrap resampling strategy for each single subject (N \u00bc 46) for a total sample of N \u00bc 47. The paired voxelwise Friedman test was then conducted to identify the three highest-ranked regions associated with each FDG/fMRI correlational metric on the whole brain (3dFriedman, AFNI). In each region identified, multiple comparisons were conducted using paired post-hoc 2-sample ttests on the entire sample (N \u00bc 47) between the highest-ranked FDG/ fMRI correlation metric for that region versus the other correlation metrics. Results were Bonferroni corrected.\nVoxelwise resting-state FDG-PET/fMRI Spearman correlations across subjects are shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 3 . FDG/fALFF correlations were on average moderate (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.34 AE 0.08), involving only 9% of total GM voxels after partial volume correction. Clusters of significant positive correlations were overall modest in size and symmetrically distributed across hemispheres. The spatial overlap between these clusters and group hypo-metabolic areas present in aMCI/AD was 56.5%, within which the magnitude of correlations was similar to the mean (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.33 AE 0.07). The strongest correlations centered in the Caudate nucleus, Thalamus and mid-cingulate gyrus. Other prominent clusters involved parts of the MFG and SFG, while a small cluster involved the IPL. No correlations involved the Precuneus and PCC.\nFDG/ReHo correlations were also moderate (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.33 AE 0.07) covering 7% of total GM. Major clusters involved the PCC, the midcingulate, Precuneus and temporo-parietal areas. These spatial patterns were symmetrical across hemispheres and yielded an overall 65.3% overlap with hypometabolic aMCI/AD regions, with similar average correlation coefficients (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.34 AE 0.07).\nFDG/gICA-DR correlations were similarly moderate (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.33 AE 0.07), covering 8% of total GM volume. The largest cluster centered on the PCC and Precuneus, followed by other posterior association regions including the Supramarginal, Angular and Superior Temporal gyri. Clusters were also found in anterior cortical areas within the MFG. They were of similar magnitude inside the 71% overlap with the hypometabolic aMCI/AD regions (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.33 AE 0.07).\nMultiple comparisons across PET/fMRI metrics corroborated the above findings and are reported in Table 4 . Paired t-tests involving FDG/ fALFF revealed statistically significant increased correlations in both Middle Frontal gyri and the left Superior Medial Frontal gyrus when compared with FDG/ReHo and FDG/gICA-DR alike.\nThose involving FDG/ReHo revealed statistically significant increased coupling in the Angular gyri and right Inferior Frontal gyrus when compared with both FDG/fALFF and FDG/gICA-DR. Furthermore, no statistically significant increased correlations were detected between FDG/ReHo and FDG/gICA-DR in the PCC, although such an increase was observed for FDG/gICA-DR when compared to FDG/fALFF correlations only.

The strength of correlations is shown on the y-axis while correlations with FDG are shown on the x-axis, for each rs-fMRI metric such as fALFF, ReHo, gICA-DR (from-left-to-right).

Black whiskers extend to the most extreme non-outlier datapoints.\nIn summary, across-subject resting-state FDG-PET/fMRI correlations in this cohort of healthy elderly controls and aMCI/AD patients were consistently moderately strong for all three rs-fMRI metrics. These were located around the DMN regions for the two functional connectivity metrics, namely ReHo and gICA-DR, whereas regarding the signal amplitude metric fALFF, they were distributed anteriorly in frontal gyri, and involved the thalamus and caudate nucleus as well."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Between-group analyses", "text": "There was a significant difference in mean age (dof \u00bc 38, t \u00bc \u00c03.04, p \u00bc 0.004 by independent two-sample t-test, adjusted for unequal variance), and gender distributions (z \u00bc 4.73, p < 0.01, CI \u00bc 0.07-0.63) between neurologically healthy controls and aMCI/AD patients. There was also a statistical difference in mean MMSE (dof \u00bc 24.6, t \u00bc \u00c07.3, p < 0.001 by independent two-sample t-test, adjusted for unequal variance) between the two samples in question (Table 1) . We found low estimates of head movements across healthy subjects and patients, without significant between-group difference (0.06 AE 0.08 mm and 0.09 AE 0.24 mm, respectively; dof \u00bc 29.3, t \u00bc \u00c01.5, p \u00bc 0.15 by independent two-sample t-test, adjusted for unequal variance). Nonsignificant correlations were found between median FD timeseries and the median intrinsic brain activity metrics from both PET and fMRI modalities across all subjects.\nResults from the voxelwise independent t-test between healthy elderly controls and aMCI/AD are shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 2 for each metabolic and functional variable. Results are herein reported for z-scores standardized FDG-PET data only, since the FDG-PET SUVR data yielded similar results. In patients, significant FDG hypometabolism was found in posterior and anterior cortical regions, with a symmetric pattern across hemispheres. Three major clusters were found in posterior regions, centered on the Precuneus and right and left Superior Temporal gyri (STG). The Precuneus cluster encompassed portions of the Cuneus and the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) in both hemispheres. The clusters centered on the STG extended into the Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL), the Angular and Supramarginal gyri, and into the Middle Temporal gyrus (MTG) up to the Fusiform gyrus in both hemispheres. One cluster was found in the medial prefrontal cortex, centered on the medial part of the Superior Frontal gyrus (SFG), extending into superior frontal areas, neighboring the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC). These clusters all survived a more stringent cutoff (p < 0.01), with only the Precuneus cluster surviving the p < 0.001 thresholding. A hypometabolic cluster also involved the thalami and lentiform and caudate nuclei, although it did not survive the p < 0.01 cutoff. Regarding covariates, no significant cluster associated with age, gender, head motion or GM atrophy exceeded the false positive clustering threshold (\u03b1 > 0.05).\nIn aMCI/AD, rs-fMRI metrics all showed significant changes in signal amplitude and disruption of intrinsic functional connectivity. In general, they consisted in symmetric clusters across both hemispheres and all involved the PCC and Precuneus (Fig. 2, Table 2 ). Besides these regions, significant fALFF alterations mostly involved the SFG, contrasting with ReHo, which did not affect anterior brain regions. Two additional posterior ReHo clusters centered on the right Supramarginal and left Angular gyri, the latter encompassing also the Supramarginal gyri, the IPL and portions of the STG. Finally, gICA-DR did not involve any other region over and above the Precuneus/PCC. The fALFF and gICA-DR clusters did not survive the p < 0.01 thresholding, while the ReHo right Supramarginal gyrus did, but not to more stringent ones. Regarding covariates, no cluster associated with age, gender, head motion or GM atrophy exceeded the AlphaSim threshold differentiating healthy aged controls from aMCI/AD patients, for any rs-fMRI metric.\nTo summarize the above findings, hypometabolic regions were largest and as expected located mainly in posterior brain regions. rs-fMRI changes consistently involved the PCC/Precuneus across all three metrics, with gICA-DR showing the least number of clusters. Over and above this consistent finding across metrics, fALFF and ReHo showed additional dysfunctional areas with opposite anterior/posterior patterns, namely ReHo displayed posterior association cortex involvement close to that observed with FDG, and fALFF anterior frontal involvement.\nWithin-subject PET/fMRI correlations Fig. 3 depicts the FDG-rs-fMRI correlations for each subject. Significant Spearman correlations were found in all subjects. The correlations ranged from moderate to high and were statistically consistent across rsfMRI metrics (FDG/fALFF: 0.59-0.88; FDG/ReHo: 0.59-0.86; FDG/gICA-DR: 0.60-0.87). In fact, there were no statistically significant differences among resting-state FDG-PET/fMRI correlations according to the fMRI metric considered (\u03c7 2 (2) \u00bc 3.7; p \u00bc 0.16).\nIn contrast, there were statistically significant differences in correlational values between the two groups of healthy old individuals and aMCI/AD patients (\u03c7 2 (1) \u00bc 69; p < 0.001). Regarding the FDG/fALFF relationship, the mean correlation coefficient was significantly lower in patients versus healthy controls (\u03c1e 0.67 AE 0.04 and 0.80 AE 0.04, respectively; dof \u00bc 44, t \u00bc 9.9, p < 0.001 by independent two-sample ttest), for an absolute percent change of 17.4%.

These are separately presented for each imaging modality and metric evaluated, showing: topleft: AD-related glucose hypo-metabolic regions; top right: reduced fALFF; bottom left: reduced ReHo; bottom right: reduced functional DMN connectivity from gICA-DR. Glucose hypo-metabolism shows the most extensive spatial distribution whereas gICA-DR exhibits the smallest one. All measures overlap in the precuneus. The three fMRI parameters diverge with respect to frontal and temporo-parietal regions. These results are expressed as Z-scores (p < 0.05) and are corrected for false-positive clusters using alphasym (alpha<0.05). Results from the opposite contrast (AD > CTRL) did not survive alphasym correction. would score higher than neurologically healthy individuals. Similar findings applied to the FDG/ReHo (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.66 AE 0.05 and 0.79 AE 0.04, respectively; dof \u00bc 44, t \u00bc 10, p < 0.001), showing a 18.1% reduction in aMCI/AD patients. The effect size score was identical to that found for FDG/fALFF. Lastly, the FDG/gICA-DR relationships (\u03c1 \u00bc 0.68 AE 0.04 and 0.79 AE 0.04, respectively; dof \u00bc 44, t \u00bc 9.1, p < 0.001) were similarly reduced by 15.1%. The effect size scored 2.68, which indicates that individual FDG/gICA-DR correlations allow identification of aMCI/AD patients at nearly 89% (range: 89-93%) probability, with a 7% chance that a random aMCI/AD patient would score higher than neurologically healthy individuals.\nIn summary, significant and positive FDG-rs-fMRI correlations were present in every single subject, control or patient, examined, and for all three rs-fMRI metrics. The coupling strength was also consistent across rs-fMRI metrics, and consistently lower by approximately 17% in aMCI/ AD relative to controls."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we have evaluated the relationships between the brain's glucose consumption and metrics of intrinsic neural activity in healthy elderly subjects and aMCI/AD patients thanks to simultaneously acquired resting-state FDG-PET/fMRI data. Our main findings can be summarized as follows:\n1. Metrics from both imaging modalities are sensitive to process and reveal a predominant posterior cortical involvement typical of aMCI/ AD. While FDG-PET differentiated aMCI/AD patients from healthy controls in most of the DMN, rs-fMRI metrics were able to identify patients in fewer DMN cortical regions. Notwithstanding, all metrics converged in the PCC. 2. The resting-state FDG-PET/fMRI correlation examined within each subject is high in the healthy elderly (\u03c1 % 0.8) and reduced by about 17% in aMCI/AD, an effect consistent in the correlation with the three rs-fMRI metrics. 3. The resting-state FDG-PET/fMRI correlations examined across subjects revealed overall few moderately strong positive correlations, spatially distributed mostly around the DMN or hypometabolic areas. FDG/gICA-DR showed highest overlap around posterior DMN nodes, whereas FDG/fALFF showed lowest overlap, with anterior distribution and involving additional non-DMN regions such as the thalamus and caudate nucleus.\nIn agreement with stand-alone studies, both resting-state FDG-PET and rs-fMRI metrics were able to distinguish a group of amnestic MCI and mild-to-moderate AD patients from healthy similarly aged controls on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Consistent with the literature, these findings from both imaging modalities reflect a failure in neuronal integration and signaling in these patients, particularly converging around the Precuneus and PCC (Badhwar et al., 2017; Cha et al., 2015; Klaassens et al., 2017) . Fig. 4 . Across-subject correlations between FDG-PET and RS-fMRI metrics. The left part of the figure shows MNI surface rendering with both lateral and sagittal views, overlaid with the voxelwise correlations, corrected for GM density, across all individuals between FDG-PET and fALFF(top panel), ReHo (middle) and gICA-DR (bottom). These variables were positively correlated in regions typically affected by the disease process, particularly with respect to ReHo and gICA-DR. No correlations were found in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex for fALFF. Negativ correlations were not statistically significant and mostly located at the grey/white matter borders. For each correlation sub-type, the mean Z-scores averaged from highlighted regions are reported for each subject in the right panels.\nFDG hypometabolism in aMCI/AD was prevalent in DMN regions (Brown et al., 2014) and larger in spatial extent as compared to patterns of altered functional activity and hypo-connectivity derived from rs-fMRI. This could reflect basic physiological differences between FDG and BOLD signal: the former capitalizes on high stable signal reflecting regionally variable levels of resting-state glucose utilization (Fox et al., 1986) experiencing little or no physiological artifacts, whereas the latter has low intrinsic signal that arises from hemodynamic mechanisms in relation to oxygen consumption (Hyder et al., 2016) , which can be affected by in-scanner drowsiness or physiologically altered conditions Algarin et al., 2017 Zhou et al., 2017 . The differences could also arise from BOLD-related confounding factors such as head movements, cardiac/respiration cycles, and unstable arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) and blood pressure. These factors, albeit mitigated by data preprocessing, can bias metrics of BOLD signal amplitude and functional network connectivity. However, it should be noted that regional patterns of alterations such as those found in our patient group are unlikely to be generated by these confounding factors, which are more likely to induce distributed effects across the whole brain.\nAcross metrics, rs-fMRI was able to differentiate aMCI/AD from healthy controls in DMN regions. This finding is in agreement with the literature reporting accelerated reduction of intrinsic DMN activity in early AD (Dennis and Thompson, 2014) . Interestingly, rs-fMRI metrics only partially agreed with respect to the regional characterization of aMCI/AD. Although all metrics identified aMCI/AD in the PCC node, only fALFF differentiated aMCI/AD patients in the medial prefrontal cortex, whereas only ReHo did so in the temporo-parietal regions of the DMN. This suggests that the three fMRI-based metrics of intrinsic activity and connectivity assessed here have differential sensitivity to the functional isolation of the DMN subsystems, which itself may result from non-local structural disconnection or from differential degrees of regional amyloid deposition (Ch etelat et al., 2009; Montembeault et al., 2016) .\nOur findings also support the gICA-DR method and associated largescale brain networks. This approach enabled us to identify neuronal DMN patterns in each subject from a unique ICA procedure, facilitating the comparison of the two populations (Calhoun and Adali, 2012) . Our gICA-DR findings are in line with previous work showing that the PCC and Precuneus are directly involved in AD-related neurodegeneration (Binnewijzend et al., 2012; Greicius et al., 2004) . Compared with ReHo, gICA-DR did not reveal the involvement of temporo-parietal DMN regions in aMCI/AD. This discrepancy might be associated to different computational procedures across rs-fMRI methods. In the particular case of gICA-DR, the method provides for a single spatial group DMN component which represents common spatiotemporal traits across all Table 3 Summary for across-subject clusters of correlations. This table shows size and location of main clusters derived from significant positive partial correlations between FDG-PET and RS-fMRI measures. Only correlations > \u00fe0.2 forming clusters larger than 300 voxels are here considered. From left-to-right, columns show the RS-fMRI measure considered, the location of COM on the TalairachTournoux atlas, the cluster-size in terms of number of voxels and COM coordinates. Coordinates are defined on the MNI template and follow the RAI order. RS-fMRI measures did not perfectly agree in terms of their spatial distribution when correlated to metabolic glucose consumption. The largest cluster was observed in the Precuneus for gICA-DR. ReHo and gICA-DR were correlated to glucose distribution mostly in posterior regions and overlap more with the DMN. fALFF showed the smallest number of clusters, with the most of them located in frontal regions.

DMN \u00bc default mode network. subjects involved in this study (Calhoun and Adali, 2012; Liu et al., 2008; Smitha et al., 2017) . It might also be that this discrepancy across the two functional connectivity methods relates to the greater specificity of DMN maps defined via gICA-DR methods. In fact, while DMN regions are characterized by greater signal intensity, non-DMN regions are dominated by noise (Beckmann et al., 2009) . Some have recently questioned the effectiveness of partial volume correction in healthy aging and aMCI/AD patients due to lack of sufficient evidence of an association between functional connectivity and GM volume density (Damoiseaux, 2017) . Even though a structure/function association has yet to be determined in fMRI connectivity studies, partial volume correction remains an important statistical choice for both FDG-PET and rs-fMRI metrics in geriatric populations. The effectiveness of partial volume correction using structural information derived from high-resolution T1-MPRAGE sequences has been demonstrated on FDG-PET (Ch etelat et al., 2008; Quarantelli et al., 2004; Shidahara et al., 2009) and is systematically adopted in resting-state FDG/fMRI studies of aMCI/AD patients (Kazemifar et al., 2017) .\nWe found high within-subject correlations between FDG-PET and all three rs-fMRI metrics in healthy aged individuals. This suggests finetuning of cortical glucose utilization with neurovascular mechanisms physiologically related to neural activity (Mergenthaler et al., 2013) . This finding is in agreement with, and generalizes previous resting-state FDG-PET/fMRI correlational studies of neurologically normal aged subjects (Aiello et al., 2015; Kazemifar et al., 2017; Bernier et al., 2017) .\nWe also found significantly reduced within-subject correlations in aMCI/AD. This finding agrees with a recent non-simultaneous restingstate FDG-PET/fMRI study of probable AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (Kazemifar et al., 2017) . Compared to this earlier report, the present study revealed overall lower correlations. This might reflect differences in disease stage between the two studies, i.e., more advanced in ours, suggesting worsening of the glucose/oxygen molecular coupling or inadequate glucose-mediated regulation of cerebral blood flow with disease progression (Mergenthaler et al., 2013) .\nReduced within-subject FDG-PET/fMRI correlations in aMCI/AD might represent a chronic inability of perfusion to adjust to glucose metabolism, which has been speculated by some to lead to brain hypoperfusion and from there to neurodegeneration (Nicolakakis and Hamel, 2011) . Besides, oxidative and bioenergetic stress alter neurovascular processes, which may also lead to neurodegeneration (Harris et al., 2012; Kapogiannis and Mattson, 2011; Nicolakakis and Hamel, 2011) . These include alterations in the glucose-selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier or malfunctioning of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), in turn affecting delivery of energetic fuels to neurons, especially when distant from capillaries (Simpson et al., 2007) .\nIn bioenergetic terms, our results suggest that glucose metabolic impairments in mild AD might lead to insufficient resources to cover the nerve cells' needs for chemical syntheses, transport and signaling. This imbalance might in turn reduce the efficiency and economy of neural information processing, affecting even more complex intrinsic brain functional systems, from regional microcircuits to large-scale networks (Kapogiannis and Mattson, 2011) .\nThe findings from the across-subject correlational analysis support the bioenergetic hypothesis. Indeed, local functional connectivity (i.e. ReHo) correlated to FDG in the DMN, a finding further supported by the large-scale functional connectivity (i.e. gICA-DR) analysis. In fact, ReHo presented a significantly increased FDG-coupling in temporo-parietal regions of the DMN, while gICA-DR revealed a significant increase in FDG-coupling in posterior DMN nodes. This network is characterized by exacerbated changes in aMCI/AD compared to healthy aged subjects (Jones et al., 2011) . It is worth noting that in our previous investigation involving healthy aged individuals (Aiello et al., 2015) , correlations were weaker and not distributed around DMN regions. It is likely that adding amnestic MCI and mild-moderate AD subjects in the correlational analysis increased the variance in multimodal imaging metrics and in turn the strength of the FDG-PET/fMRI correlations, given the systematic DMN hypometabolism and hypo-activation present in the clinical cohort. Overall, therefore, our present findings speak in favor of the development of PET-informed rs-fMRI classification of dementia (Rahim et al., 2015) , including the adoption of data-based functional connectivity methods and definition of priors from simultaneously acquired data.\nThe spatial distributions of across-subject FDG/fALFF correlations highlighted the prefrontal cortex and the Supramarginal gyrus, but did not include the PCC and Precuneus where the coupling was significantly reduced compared to FDG/gICA-DR. Compared with other rs-fMRI metrics, significant increases in coupling were observed in both Middle Frontal gyri and left Superior Medial Frontal gyrus. The interpretation of this finding is difficult and speculative only. Compensatory mechanisms, in particular in the prefrontal cortex, might underlie increased glucose/ oxygen coupling to protect memory function in aMCI/AD (Yap et al., 2017; Vemuri et al., 2012; Damoiseaux et al., 2012) . Since perfusion impairment is unrelated to GM atrophy, whose effect was here removed using GM local volumes as covariates (Bozzao et al., 2001) , the absence of correlation in the PCC and Precuneus as observed in FDG/fALFF across subjects might reflect increased oxygen demands in regions with severe hypo-perfusion possibly due to concomitant alterations of microvasculature as suggested by mild oxygen extraction fraction increase in temporo-parietal cortex in AD (Nagata et al., 2000) . In future simultaneous PET/MRI studies, the acquisition of quantitative PET information from vascular transit time, vascular reactivity, and oxygen extraction fraction will better clarify the role of the FDG/fALFF relationship and its potential to monitor those compensatory mechanisms that characterize only those amnestic MCI individuals who are converting to AD (Nagata et al., 2002) .\nAcross-subject resting-state FDG-PET/fMRI correlations might therefore suggest differential sensitivity among rs-fMRI metrics to pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. These metrics would rely to some degree on different hemodynamic components of the BOLD signal, which in turn determines slightly different spatial distributional FDG-PET/fMRI patterns. In the context of aMCI/AD individuals, fALFF might to some extent rely on perfusional mechanisms (Austin et al., 2011) , whereas ReHo and gICA-DR would mostly rely on aerobic glycolysis (Bullmore and Sporns, 2012; Vaishnavi et al., 2010) . Molecular approaches measuring the rates of cerebral oxygen and glucose metabolic consumption plus quantification of cerebral blood flow in AD patients would be useful to address these issues. An interesting issue that should be addressed in future studies using larger and homogeneous patient samples would be the relevance of fMRI/FDG coupling strength for the clinical/cognitive aspects of the disease.\nThis study has some limitations. First, we did not use cerebellar regions to normalize individual FDG and rs-fMRI metrics because of reduced FOV in BOLD-EPI sequences, and we normalized the data using mean individual GM as a reference region. While this choice might not be optimal, we did not however normalize the imaging data for the global cerebral mean, which has been shown to underestimate direct effects of aMCI/AD pathology in critical regions involved in the disease (Yakushev et al., 2007 (Yakushev et al., , 2008 .\nSecond, neurologically healthy old controls and aMCI/AD patients differed in both age and gender. We added these as covariates to minimize any potential effects and explored voxelwise the location and extent of their effects across the two groups. Although no statistically significant effect was observed in the covariates, these imbalances may still have influenced the observed results owing to the previously reported effects of ageing on rs-fMRI connectivity (Goldstone et al., 2016) . Notably, we conducted data preprocessing in individual native space and examined within-subject correlations, which should have overcome any such untoward effect. Also, we used data-driven methods to estimate global functional connectivity patterns and avoided the challenge of evaluating individual seed location shifts resulting from network reorganization (Goldstone et al., 2016) . Our inability to select an a-priori seed prevented us from using a graph-theory approach. Furthermore, because gender exerts global effects on the functional and structural connectome (Goldstone et al., 2016) , we limited our investigations to reduced connectivity in the DMN even though compensatory mechanisms may also affect other rs-fMRI networks in early aMCI/AD (Agosta et al., 2012) . The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms require further investigation from a simultaneous molecular/functional imaging perspective.\nThirdly, in this study a number of scanned patients were treated with antidepressants. Specific chronic effects of these agents on regional FDG uptake or BOLD signal have not been clearly documented in healthy subjects and/or AD to our knowledge. Most part of available data is on acute challenge or short-term treatment in healthy subjects (Goldberg et al., 2004; McCabe and Mishor, 2011) and/or chronic therapy in patients with major depressive syndrome (Drevets et al., 2002) . Also several patients were under AChEI, which have been shown to have different effects on cerebral glucose consumption and blood flow in young normals, aged normals, and Alzheimer's disease patients. Glucose metabolism was similarly reduced in almost all brain regions with a larger decrease in frontal cortex and in AD patients (Blin et al., 1997) . Given treatment with these agents is commonplace in AD, it was considered unrealistic to exclude such patients if a sufficiently large sample was to be recruited for meaningful interpretation. On the other hand, our sample represents the usual AD population seen in memory clinics.\nAnother clinical limitation is the heterogeneity of the patient sample in disease severity and staging. However, our findings should mostly reflect mild AD since this category was predominant in the sample (15/ 23) although biomarkers of the pathophysiological process of AD (i.e. CSF and/or PET biomarkers of brain amyloid-beta (A\u03b2 deposition) were not included in the diagnostic criteria. Moreover the main aim of the present study was to assess the correlation between resting-state FDG-PET and BOLD-fMRI metrics at an individual level. Studies in larger samples of patients in whom the clinical diagnosis will be integrated with AD-biomarkers are required to assess the sensitivity of both modalities in detecting changes in AD at different stages of the disease and in particular in prodromal AD."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Effective neuroenergetic coupling of glucose/oxygen molecular utilization under homeostatic auto-regulated perfusional conditions is fundamental for neural signaling and interneuronal communication. This relationship is variable across subjects but well preserved in neurologically healthy ageing under physiological resting conditions. In contrast, it loosens with glucose hypometabolism consequent to aMCI/AD. Neuroenergetic disruption appears to impact different levels of brain functional organization, as observed by rs-fMRI, from BOLD signal amplitude in single voxels to regional microcircuits and large-scale functional networks in GM. By integrating FDG-PET and fMRI, this study documents differences in correlational patterns across rs-fMRI metrics ascribable to their degree of dependency on different BOLD hemodynamic components and their involvement, as well as allows for new insights into the pathophysiology of aMCI/AD."}]
