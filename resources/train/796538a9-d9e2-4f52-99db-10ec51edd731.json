[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Modern neuroimaging technologies, combined with state-of-the-art data processing pipelines, have made it possible to collect longitudinal observations of an individual's brain connectome at different ages. It is of substantial scientific interest to study how brain connectivity varies over time in relation to human cognitive traits. In brain connectomics, the structural brain network for an individual corresponds to a set of interconnections among brain regions. We propose a symmetric bilinear logistic regression to learn a set of small subgraphs relevant to a binary outcome from longitudinal brain networks as well as estimating the time effects of the subgraphs. We enforce the extracted signal subgraphs to have clique structure which has appealing interpretations as they can be related to neurological circuits. The time effect of each signal subgraph reflects how its predictive effect on the outcome varies over time, which may improve our understanding of interactions between the aging of brain structure and neurological disorders. Application of this method on longitudinal brain connectomics and cognitive capacity data shows interesting discovery of relevant interconnections among a small set of brain regions in frontal and temporal lobes with better predictive performance than competitors.\nKeywords: signal subgraph learning, longitudinal structural brain networks, symmetric bilinear logistic regression, age effect 1 arXiv:1908.05627v1 [stat.AP]"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In this article, we study the methods for predicting a binary outcome y i from a sequence of longitudinal network-valued variables {W (s) i : s = 1, . . . , T i } for n subjects, where each observed network is undirected without self loops and hence each W (s) i is a V \u00d7 V symmetric matrix with zero diagonal. The motivation of this study is from the increasing interest of understanding brain connectomics and its relation to brain functions. With advanced neuroimaging technologies, more and more large neuroscience studies start collecting longitudinal brain scans, e.g., the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Jack Jr et al., 2008) and the recent Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development project (Casey et al., 2018) . We extracted a subset of subjects in ADNI according to Lin et al.' s study ) of successful cognitive aging, consisting of longitudinal structural brain networks over a 5-year span for 40 supernormals and 45 cognitively normal controls with matched age, gender and education. Supernormals refer to the older adults who do not exhibit the expected reduction in cognition, but have superior cognitive performance during aging .\nUsing state-of-the-art connectome extraction pipeline (Zhang et al., 2018) , we can extract structural brain networks from diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. The structural brain network for an individual corresponds to a set of white matter connections among predefined brain regions. In our data, the number of observed brain networks for each individual ranges from 1 to 5 since not all the participants visited every year during the 5-year program. Each brain network is characterized by a weighted adjacency matrix where each element denotes the connectivity strength of neural fibers between a pair of brain regions. Our scientific goal is to study the relationship between successful cognitive aging and structural brain networks in hope of finding neurologically interpretable structural markers in brain connectome predictive of supernormals. By neurologically interpretable markers we mean a set of small outcome-relevant subgraphs with certain structure in the brain network. For example the connections within each subgraph should share some common shows the profile of longitudinal brain networks for each individual in the dataset.\nnodes (brain regions) or form certain anatomical circuits. With age information of the subjects, we also aim to estimate the age effect of each identified signal subgraph, that is the dynamic importance of each subgraph in preserving cognition, which may improve cognition diagnosis and help understand the role of aging in normal and diseased brains.\nThe signal subgraph learning is basically a variable selection problem where the number of predictors -corresponding to the number of connections in the longitudinal brain networks -could easily exceed the number of observations (subjects). One typical approach to this large p small n problem would be some generalized linear model with certain regularization, such as LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996) , Elastic-Net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) and SCAD (Fan and Li, 2001) . But these methods do not guarantee any structure among the selected connections in the brain network, making the results hard to interpret neurologically. In addition, these approaches require first transforming each adjacency matrix into a long vector, which could induce ultra high dimensionality for big networks and ignore non-Eucliean structure of networks.\nThe longitudinal networks can be easily formed into tensors and thus tensor regression models (Zhou et al., 2013; Zhou and Li, 2014) provide an effective tool for our problem. But the weighted adjacency matrices of structural brain networks are symmetric, so additional symmetry constraints are required on the coefficient vectors in tensor regression. Wang et al. (2019) propose a symmetric bilinear regression for estimating a set of small clique signal subgraphs from a network predictor. But they focus on a continuous response and do not consider the case of longitudinal network observations. In addition, the censoring of longitudinal networks prevents the direct application of existing tensor regression models.\nWe propose to use a symmetric bilinear logistic regression (SBLR) model with partial time-varying coefficients and elastic-net penalty to learn a set of small clique subgraphs and estimate their age effects. The clique signal subgraphs selected by SBLR have more appealing interpretations than the results of unstructured variable selection tools especially in neurological studies, as many complex cognitive processes are often the product of coordinated activities among several brain regions. The estimated age effects demonstrate the dynamic impact on the outcome of the selected signal subgraphs, which may improve cognition diagnosis and development of treatment strategies for neurological disorders. SBLR is also very flexible in dealing with longitudinal network data, where each subject can have different number of observations at different time points. To adapt to the brain network data, the model puts symmetry constraints on the coefficient vectors of a tensor regression, which makes the block relaxation algorithm (Zhou et al., 2013 ) not applicable. We therefore develop a coordinate descent algorithm for model estimation based on the success of R package glmnet (Friedman et al., 2010) , which involves solving a sequence of conditional convex optimizations.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The SBLR model with elastic-net penalty is proposed in Section 2. Section 3 describes the coordinate descent algorithm for model estimation and discusses model selection issues. Section 4 presents simulation studies demonstrating the advantages of our method over competitors. We apply SBLR model on the longitudinal brain network data in Section 5.

The binary response y i = 1 denotes that subject i is a supernormal and y i = 0 for a normal control. T i represents the number of network observations for subject i. W (s) i denotes the structural brain network measured for subject i at the s-th visit (s = 1, . . . , T i ), which is a V \u00d7 V symmetric matrix with zero diagonal entries. g is is the age of subject i when the network W (s) i is observed. Our goal is to learn a set of small clique subgraphs from the brain network that are relevant to the outcome and estimate their age effects.\nWe borrow ideas from the symmetric bilinear model (Wang et al., 2019) to adapt to a binary response with longitudinal network predictors by adding a logit link and making some of the coefficients time-varying. This leads to the following symmetric bilinear logistic regression (SBLR):\nwhere\nto a scalar. Model (1) assumes that the binary outcome y i of each individual follows an independent Bernoulli distribution given her longitudinal network observations and the\nThe coefficients in model (1) are assumed to have K components, where each component \u03b2 h \u03b2 T h selects a signal subgraph. For ease of interpretation, the logit link of (1) can be written in matrix dot product form:\nwhere B, W = trace(B W ) = vec(B) vec(W ). From (2), we can see that the nonzero entries in each component matrix \u03b2 h \u03b2 h locate an outcome-relevant clique subgraph in the network predictor. We do not let \u03b2 h vary with age in (1) for two reasons. First, we assume the subgraphs and the related brain regions associated with y are stable across time for healthy adults (without cognitive impairment). The connection strengths among these brain regions could change over time, and their dynamic contribution to the outcome is captured by \u03bb h (g). Note that \u03bb h (\u00b7) is also necessary to avoid constraining the coefficient matrix in (2) to be positive semi-definite (p.s.d). Second, we fix each \u03b2 h over time for model simplicity. Otherwise a random function for each element of \u03b2 h (h = 1, . . . , K) will lead to intractable model estimation and overfitting issues.\nAlthough individuals have repeated measures of her structural brain network at different time points in the dataset, we focus on estimating the common signal subgraphs predictive of y as well as the age effects in model (1) instead of their individual-specific counterparts due to the limited number of observations over time for each individual. In terms of the number of time points, longitudinal structural neuroimaging data are relatively rare, with most studies having less than three time points (King et al., 2018) . In our motivating data, each subject has no more than 5 brain scans and around 87% of the subjects only have one or two network observations. Therefore there are insufficient data to reliably estimate the intra-individual signal subgraphs or individual trajectories of age effects. However, the longitudinal network observations {W\nsubject, though temporally correlated, could still contribute to inference of the common signal subgraphs {\u03b2 h \u03b2 h } and the population-level age effects {\u03bb h (g)}. So we utilize all the observed longitudinal network information for each individual in model (1). And since not all the subjects have the same number of network observations in the data, we divide the bilinear part by T i in the logit of (1).\nSuppose that y i is related to some subgraph corresponding to \u03b2 h \u03b2 h , within which the connection strengths of older adults with normal aging tend to decrease with age, while those of supernormals tend to maintain unchanged as they grow older. Then higher weight should be put on the term \u03b2 h W (s) i \u03b2 h observed at an older age in predicting y. In this case, \u03bb h (g) would be expected to increase with age and thus we could let \u03bb h (g) = \u03c1 h g + \u03b1 h . \u03bb h (g) could also be assumed as a higher order polynomial function to enhance flexibility. In simulations and applications, we let \u03bb h (g) be up to second order, i.e. \u03bb h (g) = \u03b3 h g 2 +\u03c1 h g+\u03b1 h , for interpretation consideration and model simplicity, since higher order terms of age add difficulty to interpretation and are prone to overfitting. In addition, we rarely observed nonzero coefficient estimates for the quadratic terms of age in real applications with elasticnet penalty as shown in Section 4.\nPlug in the quadratic function \u03bb h (g) = \u03b3 h g 2 + \u03c1 h g + \u03b1 h into the logit link of (1). We\nEquation (3) implies that under the quadratic assumption for \u03bb h (g), the true covariates for each subject i in model (1) are not the raw longitudinal network observations, but the average of her networks, the weighted average of the networks by her age and squared age separately.

The entrywise regularization (4) ensures the identifiability of the coefficient matrices\n, which cannot be achieved by simply penalizing the L 1 norms or L 2 norms of the parameters {(\u03b1 h , \u03c1 h , \u03b3 h , \u03b2 h ) : h = 1, . . . , K}.\nRefer to Wang et al.

In practice, we always report the estimated age effect \u03bb h (g) after scaling \u03b2 h \u03b2 h so that the off-diagonal element with the largest magnitude is 1 for each nonempty component. This rule explicitly displays the age effect of the connection with the strongest predictive effect on the response in each signal subgraph.\nFrom (1) we know that logit(p i ) is a quadratic function of each \u03b2 h , and\nwhich may not be negative semi-definite. Therefore ll i is not a concave function of \u03b2 h when fixing the other parameters and the block relaxation algorithm for tensor regression (Zhou et al., 2013) is not applicable.

Then the loss function (5) is actually a convex function of each entry \u03b2 hu in \u03b2 h when fixing the others, which makes the coordinate descent algorithm very appealing.

According to Zhou et al. (2013) , we add the following elastic-net penalty on component vectors in (29) to encourage sparsity:\nWe simulate a synthetic dataset of 100 subjects. To mimic the real data, the number of network observations for each subject ranges from 1 to 5 randomly and the age varies over a 5-year span accordingly with g i1 \u223c U (60, 90), i = 1, . . . , 100. Each network has 20 nodes and the corresponding adjacency matrices {W (s)\ni } are generated as follows. The first network observation W (1) i for each subject is generated from a set of basis subgraphs to induce correlations among edges with an individual loading vector as\nwhere q h \u2208 {0, 1} 20 is a random binary vector with q h 0 = h + 1, h = 1, . . . , 10 and q 11 0 = 4.

Figure 5 visualizes the 11 basis subgraphs superimposed together, showing that the generating process (32) produces networks with complex correlation structure. The follow-up network observation\nfor each subject is generated by adding N (0, 1) percent of relative change to each connection strength in The binary response y i is generated from Bernoulli(p i ) independently with where \u03b2 1 = q 3 , \u03b2 2 = q 11 in (32), and the functions {\u03bb h (g) : h = 1, 2} are set as the right column in Figure 6 .

SBLR also correctly estimates that the effect of this subgraph on the outcome is increasing with age, though starts from a negative value. The profiles of the estimated entries in coefficient matrices analyze their age effects edge by edge. As shown in Figure 10 , the selected edge (9, 14) has fake quadratic age effect and there is a falsely identified edge (3, 4). Figure 11 displays the estimated results of NSTR model (29) - (31) under K = 5 at the optimal penalty factors selected by the \"one-standard-error\" rule. As can be seen, NSTR partially identifies the first true signal subgraph in Figure 6 while selecting 3 false edges.\nThe corresponding estimated age effect looks similar to that of SBLR, comparing Figure   11 to Figure 8 .\nThe performance of SBLR could be improved by increasing the number of observations in the data.

We also record the true positive rate (TPR) for each method, representing the proportion of true signal edges that are correctly identified, and the false positive rate (FPR), representing the proportion of non-signal edges that are falsely identified. Table 1 displays the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the mean CV deviance, TPR and FPR for SBLR, LR and NSTR under different problem sizes.\nThe upper panel of Table 1 corresponding to n = 100 displays the results where each dataset consists of 100 subjects. As can be seen, the average of the mean CV deviance, TPR and FPR from SBLR under K = 10 are very similar to those under K = 5, implying that the performance of SBLR is robust to the chosen upper bound for the number of components. In this case, SBLR models achieve competitive predictive performance with LR and better performance than NSTR in terms of out-of-sample deviance. Although SBLR has smaller average TPR than LR or NSTR, it has the lowest average FPR.\nThe lower panel of Table 1 shows that increasing the number of observations could improve the performance of SBLR and LR, though may not be the case for NSTR since its mean FPR increases considerably with n. When we increase the number of subjects in each dataset from n = 100 to n = 1000, the average CV deviance and FPR decrease significantly for SBLR and LR, while their average TPRs increase significantly; the standard deviation of each measure also decreases for SBLR and LR. In the case of n = 1000, Table 1 shows that both average FPR and mean CV deviance of SBLR are smaller than those of LR.\nTherefore we consider SBLR as a conservative method that tends to be more sparse in selecting signal subgraphs than these competitors."}, {"section_title": "Application", "text": "Cognitive aging is typically characterized by declines with age in processing speed and memory domains (Park and Reuter-Lorenz, 2009 ).

With the parcellation of an individual brain, we extracted two white matter integrity measures -fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), along each fiber tract, and then use the average value to describe connection strength between two ROIs.\nBoth FA and MD are diffusion-related features that characterize water diffusivity along white matter streamlines, and have been widely used in the literature for white matter structure analysis (Kraus et al., 2007; Jin et al., 2017) ."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of FA connectivity matrices", "text": "In this case, the weighted adjacency matrix W The selected connections predictive of supernormals from LR and the corresponding estimated coefficients in B 1 , B 2 and B 3 of (28) are displayed in Figure 13 . As can be seen, these connections are scattered in the brain network with no meaningful structure and we have to analyze their age effects edge by edge. where the matrix\u03b2 2\u03b2 2 is normalized such that the off-diagonal element with the largest magnitude is 1. We notice that the subnetwork SBLR identified consists a hub node, labeled 31r, in Figure 14 . In the Desikan-Killiany atlas, 31r is the frontal pole area, which is also considered as the Brodmann area 10 (BA 10). The other nodes in this subnetwork include 27l, superior frontal region, and 32r, temporal pole. Superior frontal region usually controls the sensory system and temporal pole relates to episodic memories, emotion and socially relevant memory. This subnetwork with BA 10 as a hub is super important, playing an important role in high level information integration from visual, auditory, and somatic sensory systems to achieve conceptual interpretation of the environment, which is critical to maintain cognition. The right plot of Figure 14 shows that the effect of the connection strengths within this subgraph on the outcome is constant across age. The red edges and the positive function\u03bb 2 (g) in Figure 14 indicate that the effects on the outcome of the connection strengths in the signal subgraph are all positive, implying that older adults with stronger neural connections among these brain regions are more likely to be supernormals. to the magnitude of their estimated coefficients in\u03b2 2\u03b2 2 , and the color goes from blue to red as the coefficient goes from negative to positive.

Right: the corresponding estimated age effect\u03bb 3 (g).\nThe involved regions identified in Figure 14 and Figure 15 are also in accordance with the age-related studies in neuroscience. The frontal poles (31r, 31l) and the superior frontal gyrus (27l) are among the regions with the greatest age-related reduction in volume and surface area; the right temporal pole (32r) has significantly greater-than-average reduction in volume (Lemaitre et al., 2012) . In addition, lesions in the entorhinal cortex (5r) is associated with impairment of episodic memory and the decline in the volume of this cortex predicts progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia (Rodrigue and Raz, 2004) .\nThe constant age effect of the selected subgraph from SBLR under both measures implies that there is no specific age between 60 and 95 that has particularly large predictive effect on the outcome (supernormal or normal aging)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, the symmetric bilinear logistic regression (SBLR) is a useful tool in analyzing the relationship between a binary outcome and a sequence of longitudinal network observations. SBLR contributes to an insightful understanding of the sub-structure of a network relevant to a binary outcome, as it produces much more interpretable results and lower FPR than unstructured variable selection methods do, while maintaining competitive predictive performance. A coordinate descent algorithm is developed for estimating SBLR with elastic-net penalty, which outputs reliable outcome-relevant subgraphs and their time effects. Simulation studies show that the accuracy of SBLR estimates could be improved by increasing the number of subjects in the data. With larger number of longitudinal network observations for each subject (e.g. \u2265 5), individual variability around the population-level signal subgraphs or age effects could be described in the model and we choose to save it for future work. The method is also straightforward to adapt to regression problems or count responses by a simple modification of the likelihood component in the loss function."}]
