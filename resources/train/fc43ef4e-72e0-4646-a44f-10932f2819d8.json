[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Using the latest international educational database, TIMSS, this study investigates and compares the occurrences of 11 student problem behaviors as reported by middle school principals in ten countries. For each country, the study reveals the relationships of these problem behaviors with teachers' attitudes and parental involvement, and discusses the influences of the problem behaviors on students' academic achievement. Finally, a longitudinal study analyses the development and changes of student problem behaviors in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007 using the data from TIMSS four regular cycles. The results find that the student problem behaviors, especially those problem behaviors related to lessons or conflicting with others, in the Western country schools, have strong relationships with students' performances. The findings provide worldwide perspectives and meaningful references for intensive research of school psychology, reduction of student problem behaviors in middle schools, and improvement of students' academic performance."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "It is important to examine what problems exist in schools today, not only the perceptions of teachers, but also those of members of the general public who are often in the position of passing judgement on the health of the education system and who are instrumental in the policy making process (Salkind et al., 2000) . Student behavior management is one of the greatest challenges that teachers encounter every day, and misbehaving students have to be dealt with immediately, because problem behaviors often have a negative effect upon outcomes in the school environment (Hung & Lockard, 2007) . The co-occurrence between poor academic performance and behavior problems is a significant predictor of schoolrelated adjustment problems, which continue to hold as children age (Gilbertson, Duhon, Witt, & Dufrene, 2008; Morgan & Merier, 2008) . Educational and psychological researchers have made great efforts on a variety of programs to solve or reduce student problem behaviors in schools. A program conducted by Holsen, Smith, and Frey (2008) had significant positive effects on externalizing, but not internalizing problem behaviors, and the results varied between genders and classrooms; Scarpaci (2007) used a rational method to analyse student problem behaviors and proposed a practical approach to assist teachers in managing and solving most behavior problems; Bond's article (2008) highlighted 12 questioning techniques and offered additional strategies to minimize students' problem behaviors; and Peterson (2007) provided ten books and a range of materials with strategies to manage student problem behaviors. However, a major US national concern is that student problem behaviors are both ongoing and growing, and similar concerns are apparent in other countries (De Jong, 2005) . It is necessary to investigate, analyse, and understand the levels of students' problem behaviors, factors that influence the development of problem behaviors, and their impacts on multiple aspects. Student problem behaviors are relevant to school environment and culture, which have tremendous influences on student values, beliefs, motivations, and attitudes. School climate has been widely perceived as a critical factor in successful schools and a litmus test for student academic achievement. Whenever educators spend excessive time managing student inappropriate behaviors, it is harmful both for students with and without behavioral problems because it forces teachers to devote valuable instructional time to address those misbehavers and decreases the number of learning opportunities for other students. Thus, educational environments have become complicated and difficult (Shin & Koh, 2008) . Parental involvement serves as an important factor that relates to the number of student problem behaviors in schools, but current levels of parental involvement in most schools are meager and infrequent (Koutrouba, Antonopoulou, Tsitsas, & Zenakou, 2009 ). Poor parent-child relationships and low parental monitoring are also important reasons for students' problem behaviors (Malete, 2007) . Teachers' responses and actions impact students' behaviors in the classrooms more than school policy (Marachi, Astor, & Benbenishty, 2007) . Teachers' behaviors contribute to classroom disruptive behaviors, and students' performance is also feedback to teachers' implementation of management strategies (Reinke, Lewis-Palmer, & Merrell, 2008) .\nSchool psychologists should have an understanding of a critical aspect of behavior change 'treatment integrity', to plan implementation of an intervention (Wilkinson, 2006) . They also need to design and develop behaviors assessment scales for comparisons and gather information regarding the range of problem behaviors (Gladman & Lancaster, 2003) . The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is a valuable tool for measuring and comparing student behaviors across nations. TIMSS is a very ambitious series of international assessments used to measure mathematics and science learning at fourth and eighth grades. TIMSS was conducted first in 1995, and then again in 1999, 2003, and 2007 . Fifty-nine countries participated in TIMSS 2007. The TIMSS School Questionnaire focuses on a set of indicators of school quality that research has shown to characterize schools that function as well-managed integrated systems supportive of teaching and learning. The participating countries have reacted in a variety of ways to the comparative performance of their students, and studies have examined how these reactions have played out in terms of changes to curriculum, instruction methods, and schooling effectiveness. The educational policy makers and school administrators have used TIMSS results to help plan or implement changes designed to improve educational systems (Tatsuoka, Corter, & Tatsuoka, 2004) .\nAlthough a number of studies expounded student problem behaviors in schools from different respects in the United States, the relationships between the behavior problems and other learning factors in middle schools, and our knowledge of student behavior management practices in other countries is minimal and not clear (Akin-little, Little, & Laniti, 2007; Thuen & Bru, 2009 ). Therefore, this study investigates 11 student problem behaviors at middle schools in ten countries."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Results from TIMSS provide an opportunity to assess the generalization of previous findings for a large international sample of schools and students from a cross-cultural context (Roth & Givvin, 2008) , help educators and teachers design interventions to prevent and/or reduce student problem behaviors, and improve school and classroom environments."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The primary data source of this investigation was the School database of TIMSS 2007 group B (the eighth grade) reported by principals. Major variables were the number of occurrences of 11 student problem behaviors in schools, and the scale range was from 1-Never to 5-Daily. The independent variables also included the items related to the student problem behaviors: teachers' attitudes (their job satisfaction and expectations for achievement), parental support for student achievement and involvement in school activities (see Appendix 1 for details), and student academic achievement. Students' academic achievement was worked out by using a mean combining ten mathematics and science standard testing scores from the Student Database, and the range was 1.0-5.0. The school sampling weights (SCHWGT) were used in the statistic procedure based on the TIMSS 2007 User Guide. Thus, the results may present occurrences of the problem behaviors and correlation/regression analyses more comprehensively and accurately. Descriptive statistics was employed to compare occurrences of the student problem behaviors between the countries. Pearson correlation was applied to reveal the relationships of the student problem behaviors with teachers' attitudes and parental involvement. After merging school data with student data by school number (IDSCHOOL), multiple linear regressions were conducted to predict students' academic achievements by the 11 student problem behaviors. The figures were used to present the changes and trends of student problem behaviors during four cycles of TIMSS by country."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Comparison of student problem behaviors in middle schools among the countries", "text": "Overall, the occurrences of the student problem behaviors in middle schools were not very high. With a Likert-type scale, including five levels (from 1-never to 5-daily), none of the means was larger than 4.0 level (see Table 1 ). By the comparisons of 11 problem behaviors, four were higher: arriving late at school, classroom disturbance, absenteeism, and violating dress code, which mostly were around the 3.0 level; and four were rather low: physical injury to other students, theft, cheating, and vandalism, which were below the 2.0 level. The arriving late at school behavior had the highest means in eight countries (excluding Australia and Korea), and school principals in six countries reported that this problem behavior was often at more than a monthly (>3.0) level. The classroom disturbance behavior was also frequent, and its occurrences were higher than monthly (>3.0) level in Australia, Canada, England, and the US, but it was very low in Japanese schools. The principals in Japan reported very low occurrences of theft, cheating, classroom disturbance, profanity, and skipping class behaviors, but there were very high rates of absenteeism and arriving late at school behaviors. In Russia, all student problem behaviors were lower than those in other countries, and their rates of vandalism and theft were extremely low. Korean students' rate of classroom disturbance was fairly high as compared to other problem behaviors.\nAn interesting finding was that there were evident differences between four Western countries: Australia, Canada, England, and the US and three countries with the least problem behaviors: Korea, Russia, and Japan. In the latter three countries, student problem behaviors were below monthly (mostly <2.0) level, which illustrated that in these three countries, students had very good school environments. Because of the small means of the occurrences, the differences of the occurrences [Standard Deviations (SD)] among the schools were small, and this meant there were no large differences between all schools in each country. In Japan, about 50% of the schools never had student classroom disturbance behaviors, but in the four Western countries, nearly 30% of schools reported that this problem behavior occurred daily. The occurrences of student problem behaviors in Australian middle schools were very high (six problem behaviors >3.0), and eight problem behaviors had the largest frequency values among all participating countries with very large SD, which illustrates that these problem behaviors varied immensely even within Australian schools. Almost all student problem behaviors in Canada, England, and US also have high frequencies, and more than 20% of school principals reported student absenteeism behavior daily, but in Korea, about 23% of schools never had this problem behavior. By comparisons, those occurrences of problem behaviors in Singapore, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong were mostly at medium levels. The range of 11 student problem behaviors is from (1 \u00bc Never) to (5 \u00bc Daily).\nStudent problem behaviors related to teachers' attitudes and parental involvement Student problem behaviors and teachers' attitudes. Teachers' attitudes in this study included their job satisfaction and expectations for student achievement. Almost all correlations between teachers' attitudes and student problem behaviors were negative, and most of them were significant, especially in four countries: Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and Canada (see Table 2 ). In middle schools, there were negative interactions between student problem behaviors and teachers' attitudes. In all these relationships, student absenteeism, classroom disturbance, and skipping class behaviors had very high negative correlation with teachers' expectations for student achievement. High occurrences of these problem behaviors, which directly take place in classrooms and influence instruction procedures certainly affected teachers' emotions and prospects for student achievement. Students' intimidation or verbal abuse of other students, and physical injury to other student behaviors seriously deteriorated school environment and safety, and they also significantly negatively correlated with teachers' attitudes towards students and job. Nevertheless, theft, vandalism, and cheating were weakly related with teachers' attitudes, because teachers were less involved in these student behaviors directly. The relationships of teachers' attitudes with violating dress code and arriving late at school problem behaviors were distributed over medium levels and varied among the countries.\nStudent problem behaviors and parental involvement. The negative relationships between student problem behaviors and parental involvement were more significant than those between the behaviors and teachers' attitudes. The more parental supports for student achievement and involvements in school activities, the fewer occurrences of the student problem behaviors in schools (see Table 3 ). Although a few correlations were weak in Chinese Taipei and Singapore, almost all the results of correlations between parental involvement and the student problem behaviors were also negative. Overall, to middle school students, parental support and involvement had very positive effects on prevention of the problem behaviors in school. In Australia, Canada, US, and England, parental involvement greatly reduced the occurrences of student absenteeism, classroom disturbance, profanity, arriving late at school, and vandalism problem behaviors. Nevertheless, the relationships between the parental involvement and cheating and theft were rather weak in several countries (e.g. in Chinese Taipei, Singapore, and Russia)."}, {"section_title": "Student problem behaviors and academic performance", "text": "Using school codes, we merged school files with student problem behaviors and student files with their academic achievement. Some cases were missed in this procedure, because not all schools matched the students. Therefore, those schools without student variables were excluded in the regression analysis (see Table 4 ). The results of regressions revealed that influences of student problem behaviors on their academic achievement were different among the countries. The prediction rates (R 2 ) in Korea, Chinese Taipei, and Russia (< \u00bc 5%) were not high, but in Hong Kong (R 2 \u00bc 26%), Australia (R 2 \u00bc 25%), England (R 2 \u00bc 17%) and Singapore (R 2 \u00bc 13%), these rates were practicable to predict students' academic achievement by student problem behaviors. Student absenteeism, intimidation or verbal abuse of other students, profanity, and skipping class played significantly negative roles in predictions of student academic achievement in most participating countries. Student cheating, theft, and violating dress code behaviors were positively correlated with student academic achievement in England, Singapore, and Chinese Taipei. These weak relationships/predictions in some countries also provided two questions: (1) were the student problem behaviors in school reported by principals not sensed by students, or students were not aware, or disturbed by these problem behaviors; and (2) are there some student problem behaviors or school environments that do not influence students' academic study?"}, {"section_title": "Changes of student problem behaviors by four cycles", "text": "Regarding student problem behaviors, TIMSS 1995 TIMSS , 1999 , and 2003 school questionnaire used the same items, which could compare the changes of the problem behaviors during these four regular cycles (except missing data for two cycles in England, and 1995 data in Japan and Chinese Taipei). From the figures (see Figures 1a, 1b, 1c) , an evident trend was that student problem behaviors reported by principals in middle schools were decreasing from 1995-2003, but the numbers of occurrences in many countries increased in 2007. This trend in Australia, Canada, Singapore, and the US was particularly true. The changes of vandalism, theft, intimidations or verbal abuse, and physical injury in Figure 1c were not very large, and mostly were decreasing over these 12 years, with the exception of student intimidations or verbal abuse of other students behaviors which had rebounds in several countries. The changes in Korea presented the best improvement of student problem behaviors during these four cycle years, but profanity behavior did not have significant changes. The changes of student problem behaviors in Japan were small, where the occurrences were low through whole nine years, and the serious absenteeism problem behavior in this country had lowered by about 0.5 level during the nine years. In Russia, changing trends of student problem behaviors were good, except for cheating and profanity behaviors were more serious in 2003 and 2007."}, {"section_title": "Discussions and conclusions", "text": "Although principals' reports are different among the countries, the occurrences of student problem behavior in middle schools show similar level orders in the participating countries. arriving late at school, absenteeism, skipping class, and classroom disturbance are problem behaviors that are common or severe, and these student problem behaviors have stronger relationships with teachers' attitudes, parental involvement, and students' performances than other problems. Student problem behaviors in classrooms partly indicate that troubled students do not like or do not pay attention to what they are studying in schools. So, raising awareness of the importance of academic studying, fostering of interests in learning, and developing meaningful and vivid lectures and activities in classes are basic strategies for reducing student problem behaviors in classrooms. Of course, other prevention or intervention programs/methods could also be implemented. Middle school teachers' job satisfaction and expectations for student achievement are negatively related with the student problem behaviors, especially with those problem behaviors occurring in classrooms. Teachers' expectations lead them to change teaching strategies and classroom activities, and influence students' learning system in schools. Teacher efforts to improve sensitivity, prospects, and supportiveness of students can have a broader influence on children's overall school functioning (Rey, Smith, Yoon, Somers, & Barnett, 2007) . Highly negative correlations of teachers' attitudes with absenteeism, skipping class, classroom disturbance, and arriving late at school behaviors should caution all school administrators and teachers. From very high scores of mathematics and science tests in five Asian countries, the top reading achievement in Russia, 2 and low occurrences of student problem behavior in school, it is necessary to explore further the relationships of student problem behaviors with their values on knowledge and school learning, and with academic achievement.\nGenerally, teachers' high expectation on student performance and parental involvement in school activities play important roles in reducing student problem behaviors in schools. Children's perceptions are a great predictor of emotional and behavioral problems (Berthold & Hoover, 2000; Yazdkhasti & Harizuka, 2006) . It is essential to foster more concern and encouragement from teachers and parents for reduction of problem behaviors in school. Therefore, how to increase support from teachers and parents needs to be further discussed to lead to better school environments, reduce classrooms disruption so that more time can be devoted to learning and instruction.\nAn interesting finding is that student problem behaviors in Japanese, Korean, and Russian middle schools are very different from the Western countries. In these three countries, the occurrences of student problem behaviors are fairly low, and the predictions for academic achievement by these problem behaviors were lower than those in the other countries. Of course, these differences are related to school/ nation culture, policy of education, social values, environment, and school psychology between the three countries and the Western regions. Inquiry of advantages and weaknesses of school culture and climate in the two regions is an advanced research field of international school psychology.\nThe same occurrence questions were reported by middle school principals across the four cycles, and thus, the changes during this period (12 years) basically represented development trends of student problem behaviors in schools. A common tendency is that there was an evident decrease of student problem behaviors in school from 1995-2003, but the rates had a rebound in last four years.\nWhat happened in each participating country that led to changes in the numbers of student problem behaviors in schools? More studies in this field should find and discuss the relationships of student problem behaviors in school with worldwide development and changes.\nPublic opinion over the past 30 years consistently rates lack of discipline in schools to be one of the biggest problems teachers have to contend with in schools (De Jong, 2005) . Analyses of international databases may help educators find existing educational states of affairs and relationships from a worldwide perspective, but its limitations are that the questions are beyond the scope of items in the databases and are therefore unavailable for analyses and impossible to follow-up. Thus, clear explanations of causes and internal reasons of the results requires further investigation. 1995 -18, in 1999 -17, in 2003 -22] "}]
