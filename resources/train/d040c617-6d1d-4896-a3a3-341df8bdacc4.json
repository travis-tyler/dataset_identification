[{"section_title": "T", "text": "he latest results of two major international studies present a mixed picture of the academic abilities of American students. In the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), American fourth-and eighth-graders significantly outperformed many of their international peers. While eighth-graders-including boys, girls and minority students-improved their scores compared to past TIMSS studies (1995 and 1999), scores for fourth-graders remained static in both subject areas. In the 2003 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), U.S. ninth-and tenth-graders (15-year-olds) performed below the international average in math literacy and problemsolving. This lag among high school students, says President Bush and U.S Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, underscores the need for annual learning assessments for all students in grades 9-11. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, such assessments currently apply only to students in grades 3-8. (For both studies' findings, see page 3.) The PISA results were released in December 2004 by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. A report on America's PISA results, published by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), is available at http://nces.ed.gov/ surveys/pisa, or by calling 1-877-4ED-PUBS with identification number ERN3787P, while supplies last. The 2003 TIMSS results is the third release since 1995 from the Amsterdam-based International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement.

Teaching to the level of each student in her class, Patti Berkley (photographed below) uses academic and learning-style assessments to understand each child's strong points. \"I teach each child through his or her strengths,\" she explained. Berkley noted that the assessment results generally fall into three main groups, which allows her to organize students into small groups to ensure that each student masters the required skills. As a first-grade teacher, Berkley weaves various strategies throughout the reading curriculum as well as the schoolwide social studies-or science-based thematic units that integrate the arts. This comprehensive approach to learning was adopted by the Oklahoma A+ Schools network, of which the Oologah Lower Elementary School is one of 19 participants. \"The neatest thing about teaching first grade is convincing the kids that they can read,\" she said. \"Every year there's that moment when you put the first sentence on the board and their eyes light up. You can see the spark when they know they've read their first sentence.\""}, {"section_title": "Donna Sollars, Tiffin Elementary School, Chillicothe, Ohio", "text": "With the challenge of teaching math, social studies, science and health to fourthgraders, Donna Sollars summarizes her teaching strategy. \"I have an interest in each child,\" she said, explaining that she does whatever it takes to help her students learn, including providing extra help beyond the school day. The strategy is working. Tiffin Elementary, where Sollars has taught for 13 years, has been recognized as an Ohio School of Promise for three years, with more than 80 percent of its students passing required reading and math achievement tests. \"Each day is different,\" said Sollars. \"Seeing students achieve makes every day rewarding.\" Students in Sharon Turner's fifth-grade class have busy hands. Using hands-on learning techniques, she develops lessons that involve students in making, seeing or doing things while learning math and science. \"Paperwork was boring when I was in school,\" she notes, \"so I try to use manipulatives-dominoes, cards, dice-instead of worksheets.\" She also encourages students to use the chalk-board to work out problems. Turner uses student achievement information and progress monitoring to plan her lessons for both large-and smallgroup work. She considers herself part of a team of teachers who have worked together to make George Elementary School one of three Jackson city schools ranked Level 5 (superior-performing) on the state's accountability system, up from Level 1 (low-performing) in 2001. Describing her role in preparing students for life, she said, \"It's wonderful to make a difference in their lives.\" "}, {"section_title": "Spirals dominate", "text": "Meghan Little's fifthgrade math program-not physical spirals, but curriculum spirals that keep math concepts coming back at more complex levels throughout the academic year. \"The spiral curriculum shows students the interrelatedness of concepts,\" she explained. \"They get a chance to review these concepts throughout the year.\" Working from a yearlong plan, Little uses six-week assessments to check student knowledge. In small groups, she works with individual students to help them master specific skills. Her school, KIPP DC: KEY Academy, a charter school in the District of Columbia, has recorded the highest math scores in the city. Little says she looks for a change in students' attitudes about math as a measurement of success. \"When I can see in kids' faces the point at which they go from being confused to saying, 'I'm going to attack this; I can do this,'\" she said, \"that's the most special moment for me.\" American Stars of Teaching is part of the Teacher-to-Teacher Initiative, which includes regional workshops, a teacher toolkit and regular e-mail updates.

Toward a Golden Age in American Education: How the Internet, the Law and Today's Students Are Revolutionizing Expectations examines the state of educational technology and offers recommendations for maximizing its contribution to improving education.
