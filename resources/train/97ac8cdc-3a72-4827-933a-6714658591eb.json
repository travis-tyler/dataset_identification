[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Aim Approximately half of the participants in the Diabetes Prevention Outcomes Study (DPPOS) had diabetes after 15 years of follow-up, whereas nearly all the others remained with pre-diabetes. We examined whether formerly unexplored factors in the DPPOS coexisted with known risk factors that posed additional risk for, or protection from, diabetes as well as microvascular disease.\nMethods Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine predictors of diabetes. Sequential modelling procedures considered known and formerly unexplored factors. We also constructed models to determine whether the same unexplored factors that associated with progression to diabetes also predicted the prevalence of microvascular disease. Hazard ratios (HR) are per standard deviation change in the variable.\nResults In models adjusted for demographics and known diabetes risk factors, two formerly unknown factors were associated with risk for both diabetes and microvascular disease: number of medications taken (HR = 1.07, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 1.03 to 1.12 for diabetes; odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16 for microvascular disease) and variability in HbA 1c (HR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03 for diabetes; OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.09 for microvascular disease per SD). Total comorbidities increased risk for diabetes (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16), whereas higher systolic (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.31) and diastolic (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22) blood pressure, as well as the use of anti-hypertensives (OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.62), increased risk of microvascular disease.\nConclusions Several formerly unexplored factors in the DPPOS predicted additional risk for diabetes and/or microvascular disease -particularly hypertension and the use of anti-hypertensive medications -helping to explain some of the residual disease risk in participants of the DPPOS."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "To date, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is the largest clinical trial in the world designed to determine whether an intensive lifestyle intervention or metformin could prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes in a highrisk multi-ethnic cohort [1] . Of the 3234 original participants in the DPP, 85% continue to be followed in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), 14-17 years post randomization at 10 July 2013, the closing date of this analysis. Approximately half the participants had developed diabetes and nearly all the others continued to have prediabetes, as they did from initial enrolment. The annual incidence rate of diabetes has decreased in all groups and has not differed significantly between the intervention groups in recent years, presumably due to depletion of susceptible individuals [2] . Thus, many participants have had persistent pre-diabetes, without the development of overt diabetes, over the past 15 years of study. This is the case despite the presence of significant baseline risk for progression based on traditional diabetes risk factors (e.g. obesity, elevated fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance). The observation that nearly half remained free of diabetes despite the presence of substantive clinical risk raises the possibility that residual factors coexist with known risk factors that collectively protect from or exaggerate risk for diabetes. Identification of these formerly unexplored factors could aid with risk stratification, and thereby improve decision-making in the setting where resources are being directed toward prevention.\nActive treatment during DPP resulted in rapidly apparent, persistent treatment-specific effects to prevent or delay diabetes [1, 3] , and the prevention/delay of diabetes was associated with a lower prevalence of microvascular disease 14-17 years post randomization [4] . Surprisingly, the treatment-specific differences in rates of diabetes have not produced corresponding differences in the overall prevalence of microvascular disease to date, with the exception that among women only, the prevalence of microvascular disease was lower in the intensive lifestyle group [4] . This observation has been ascribed to the minimal degree of hyperglycaemia experienced to date among most DPPOS participants who developed diabetes [4] . It may also suggest that the interventions used in the DPP, although effective at minimizing glycaemia, have been insufficient to mitigate important non-glycaemic determinants of microvascular disease, such as habitual diet or social factors. The possibility that non-glycaemic biomarkers could inform us about risk, for both diabetes and related complications, needs further elucidation.\nOnly part of the risk for diabetes [5] , and the risk for microvascular [6] and macrovascular [7] complications associated with diabetes is explained by known risk factors. This gap in the current knowledge led to a search for residual factors with diabetogenic or anti-diabetogenic potential. The objective of the current analysis was to examine the effects of factors formerly unexplored in the DPP to reduce or augment risk for diabetes and/or microvascular disease in this highrisk cohort. We hypothesized that formerly unexplored factors may be protective, rendering a state of nonprogressive pre-diabetes with a lower cumulative glycaemic exposure and lower risk for microvascular disease."}, {"section_title": "Patients and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The DPP was a randomized clinical trial performed at 27 research centres in the USA that enrolled overweight or obese adults with pre-diabetes determined on one occasion.

Median follow-up during the DPP was 3.2 years followed by a 10-month 'bridge' period when all participants were offered group-implemented lifestyle sessions prior to the start of DPPOS, including those who had been randomized to the intensive lifestyle arm during DPP [3] . Open-label metformin was also continued in participants initially randomized to metformin during DPP, and discontinued when progression to diabetes required management outside the protocol, or for reasons of safety and/or tolerability.

Hazard ratios (HRs) in these models represent the comparison of a categorical variable to its reference category, or per standard deviation difference in a continuous variable. We applied a parallel approach to evaluate the association of the candidate prognostic factors with microvascular disease, applying logistic regression rather than Cox proportional hazards modelling because composite microvascular disease prevalence data were available at only one point in time. Duration of diabetes was also included as a covariate for model 2 predicting microvascular disease. The model building procedure used to derive models 1 and 2 (above) was repeated to examine the predictive value of candidate factors on prevalence of nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy, as well as the composite microvascular complication outcome (i.e. one or more of these complications), occurring at a median time of 15 years since initial enrolment in the DPP. Using the methods of Bonferroni, a P-value of \u2264 0.002 was used to denote significance accounting for multiple comparisons.

The most common types of medication reported were hormones (oral contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone therapy) and anti-hypertensives, accounting for 24.8% and 17.7% respectively, of the total medications reported. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the use of anti-hypertensive medication explained the association between total medications reported and diabetes and microvascular disease. After omission of anti-hypertensive drugs, numbers of medications taken were no longer significantly related to diabetes (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11) or microvascular disease (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13). Anti-hypertensive use was associated with microvascular disease (OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.62), independent of blood pressure, with a similar trend seen for diabetes (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31).\nFormerly unexplored predictors of diabetes or microvascular disease, but not both, in the DPPOS Total comorbidities increased risk for diabetes (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16) with a similar trend observed for microvascular disease (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.20) .

We sought to determine whether protective factors coexisted with known risk factors to retard development of overt diabetes and/or microvascular disease, or, alternatively, if formerly unidentified novel risk factors compounded known risk in those who developed diabetes and/ or microvascular disease. Major findings from the current analyses suggest that the number of medications taken, as well as variability in HbA 1c , proved to be formerly unidentified predictors of both diabetes and microvascular disease in the DPPOS. Hypertension and the use of antihypertensive medications appeared particularly relevant to microvascular disease, but far less so to diabetes. Collectively, formerly unexplored factors appear to provide additional information for the prediction of microvascular disease rather than diabetes in our well-described DPPOS cohort.\nAs momentum builds in support of widespread preventive interventions in people with pre-diabetes [16] [17] [18] , important counter-arguments must be addressed. Yudkin and Montori wrote a recent counterpoint to the medicalization of prediabetes [19] , citing over-diagnosis by current criteria and unnecessary treatment for the~50% of people with prediabetes never destined to develop diabetes. Data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging suggest that twothirds of people with pre-diabetes will either spontaneously regress or remain with pre-diabetes for long durations, leaving only the remaining one-third at risk for diabetes itself [20] . In diabetes prevention studies, including the DPP, diabetes risk is determined primarily by elevated plasma glucose levels (fasting and/or post-OGTT). Current findings Numbers represent hazards ratio for diabetes and odds ratios for other outcomes in fully adjusted models. Each variable is adjusted for fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour glucose, HbA 1c , BMI, hsitory of GDM (coefficient for GDM is the difference between females with GDM vs. females without GDM; coefficient for female is the difference between females without GDM vs. male), use of anti-depressant medication, ever NGR, adiponectin, CIR, 1/[insulin]. See Table 1 for descriptions of the variables shown in Table 2 .

Numbers in bold denote P \u2264 0.002.\nhighlight the deficiencies of this approach and indicate a clear need for risk stratification beyond glycaemia. In the present analysis, we demonstrate higher incidences of both diabetes and microvascular disease in participants who reported a greater number of medications taken from the outset of the DPP, with only two medications needed to go from the 25th to the 75th percentile for risk (data not shown). This was particularly relevant when participants reported using antihypertensives. In addition, variability in HbA 1c (as a measure of glycaemic variability [21] ) over time, also appeared to influence risk for diabetes and microvascular disease beyond traditional risk factors. Ongoing clinical trials hope to prove this point [22, 23] making both the absolute HbA 1c and glycaemic variability relevant to patient care. Collection of this basic historical and laboratory information, which is already performed routinely, may improve our risk assessment for people with pre-diabetes where access to other information is limited.\nIn pursuit of novel risk-conferring or protective factors for diabetes and microvascular disease, some factors exhibited discordance associating with one or the other, but not both. Total comorbidities increased the risk for diabetes with a similar trend observed for microvascular disease. Given the close correlation between numbers of medications taken and numbers of comorbidities reported, this information likely reflects overall health status and deserves greater appreciation as a metric of health risk [24] . By contrast, both SBP and DBP increased the risk of microvascular disease with little association with diabetes. Although hypertension is widely recognized as a risk factor for microvascular disease and cardiovascular disease [25, 26] , this is the first report of these associations in the DPPOS. Importantly, these results highlight the risk for microvascular disease associated with hypertension that may precede the onset of diabetes [27] . Accordingly, the management of hypertension remains central in the prevention of both micro-and macrovascular disease.\nThe DPPOS used a composite microvascular disease outcome as its primary endpoint for long-term complications [4] , in part, with the expectation of a shared mechanism for retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy [28] . Although greater number of comorbidities reported and variability in HbA 1c associated with both diabetes and composite microvascular disease, they did not associate uniformly with each individual microvascular disease subtype. Specifically, a greater number of comorbidities reported predicted nephropathy, whereas variability in HbA 1c predicted retinopathy, in the fully adjusted models. The latter observation is consistent with the highly specific association between retinopathy and plasma glucose concentration [29, 30] . By contrast, hypertension appeared specific to nephropathy. Together, these preliminary post hoc results cast a degree of uncertainty on the prevailing paradigm that development of microvascular disease is relatively homogenous [28] . Expanding our knowledge of the pathogenesis of microvascular diseases will likely lead to new approaches to prevent them.\nSeveral limitations of our analysis warrant mention. This analysis is post hoc and the results can be viewed as hypothesis generating. Associations do not confirm causation. Thus far, rates of complications, especially for the individual components of microvascular disease, have been very low and different ascertainment schedules, as well as the sensitivity of our methods of detection, for the microvascular disease endpoints complicate direct comparisons of individual microvascular disease outcomes.\nIn conclusion, the current analysis highlights several formerly unexplored factors that associate with risk for diabetes, but did not heighten our understanding as to why approximately half of our high-risk cohort has developed diabetes since enrolment into DPP, whereas the other half has not. Several of these factors predicted composite microvascular disease, whereas some were associated with either diabetes or microvascular disease, but collectively only improved prediction for microvascular disease. Importantly, our findings were comprised of basic information (e.g. use of blood pressure lowering medication) routinely collected in a clinical setting providing additional information about who may be at risk for the complications of diabetes. subcontract with the coordinating centre.
