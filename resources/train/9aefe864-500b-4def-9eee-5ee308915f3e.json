[{"section_title": "", "text": "These findings suggested a single outbreak source in Beijing ( Figure S1B ).\nRetrospective epidemiological investigation revealed the earliest symptom onset of a patient on June 4 ( Figure S1C ).\nTo probe the origin of the infection, we analysed the spatial distribution of which is significantly higher than those of other areas in the market (1.7%, 47/2727, \u03c7 2 =363.29, P<0.001). Meanwhile, their symptom onset dates were also earlier than other employees' in the market ( Figure S2 ). The infections demonstrated spatial clusters in the basement, and highly clustered cases were identified in the seafood section (Table S1, Figure 1A and S3).\nWe further identified 14 booths ( Figure 1A Booth #S14 employees were also among the ones with early symptom onset time ( Figure 1C ).\nTo further investigate the origin of this outbreak, we sequenced 110 samples [5] [6] [7] and obtained 72 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences ( Figure S5) . Notably, all genome sequences shared eight mutations ( Figure 1D "}]
