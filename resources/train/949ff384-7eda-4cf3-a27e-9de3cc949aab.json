During a hurricane event, storm surges are often the greatest threats to the coastal communities, even greater than the powerful gusts and floods caused by torrential rainfall (Islam et al. 2010;Li et al. 2012). Hurricane storm surge heights may be on the order of several meters and may devastate the coastal areas, causing loss of lives, property damage, and inundation with significant ecological impacts. According to the tropical cyclone reports (http:// www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/) from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), some of the notable hurricane storm surge events (with high water levels) are selected and listed in Table 1.1. As can be seen, the Saffir-Simpson hurricane category at landfall is not necessarily a good predictor for surge height range. For instance, Hurricane Katrina (2005) made landfall as a category 3 hurricane; however, the surge heights caused by Hurricane Katrina were significantly higher than those of Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Opal (1995) which were both category 3 hurricanes at landfall.

Hence, accurate predictions of storm surge elevations are becoming more and more important for a variety of reasons including public safety, hazard mitigation, post-hurricane emergency response, and resilient coastal structure design (Chen et al. 2009). Due to the inherent randomness associated with the meteorological events, the complex nature of coastal environments, and the simplified assumptions made in storm surge modeling, errors do exist in storm surge simulations. Recent storm surge studies in the U.S. either did not consider modeling errors associated with the numerical models (e.g. Phan et al. 2007;Lin et al. 2010) or only quantified the modeling errors for a few selected major hurricane events (e.g. Demirbilek et al. 2008;Ebersole et al. 2009;Dietrich et al. 2011). Flather et al. (1998) conducted an extensive storm surge study for the northwest Europe. It is obvious that the outcomes of the study for the northwest Europe region cannot be applied to the U.S. due to the differences in meteorological and geological conditions. Therefore, to reliably predict the storm surge heights along the U.S. coastline, it is of paramount importance that the errors associated with the specific numerical models employed for the storm surge predictions or simulations are quantified using actual surge observations."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "The main objective of this study was to develop a methodology to quantify the modeling errors associated with the system of models used for storm surge simulation which includes the ADCIRC (Advanced Circulation) storm surge model (Luettich et al. 1992), the Georgiou (1985) wind field model, the HURDAT hurricane database (Jarvinen et al. 1984) and the ADCIRC tide database (Westerink et al. 1993). As an illustrative example, the proposed methodology was utilized to quantify the modeling errors at nine locations corresponding to real water level observation stations along the coast of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia by comparing the ADCIRC model simulated and station measured annual maximum surge heights. It was found that the model simulations suffer both systematic and random errors. The model tends to slightly underestimate and overestimate the actual annual maximum surge heights for low-and high-surge elevation events, respectively. To account for the modeling errors, a power equation was utilized to quantify the systematic errors and a lognormal distribution was used to quantify the random errors. To confirm the validity of the proposed error quantification methodology, 4 the error-adjusted annual, 5-year and 10-year maximum surge height simulations were compared to the actual storm surge observations at the nine water stations. Good agreements were observed between the actual recorded and the error-adjusted cumulative maximum surge height distributions."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER TWO", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PROCEDURE OF HURRICANE STORM SURGE SIMULATION", "text": "The storm surge simulation procedure used in this study consists of two components: storm surge modeling and hurricane wind field modeling (Figure 2.1).  In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the procedures for hurricane storm surge simulations (Kolar and Westerink 2000;Resio and Westerink 2008;Dawson et al. 2008). There are a number of computer models with varying complexities that are currently being used by researchers and risk analysts to simulate storm surges. Among these models, the ADCIRC (Advanced Circulation) model and the SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model (Jelesnianski et al. 1992) have been widely used and shown to provide surge simulations with reasonable accuracy (Aggarwal 2004)."}, {"section_title": "SLOSH Model", "text": "The SLOSH model is a two-dimensional finite difference hydrodynamic model developed by the National Weather Service (NWS) for real time forecasting of hurricane storm surges (Jelesnianski et al. 1992). It also plays an important role in providing storm surge guidance for hazard analysis to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and local emergency managers (Glahn et al. 2009). In the SLOSH model, the governing equations of motion for the Cartesian coordinate was first developed by Platzman (1963) and later modified by Jelesnianski (1967) with a bottom slip coefficient: where  (Figure 2.2). Although refined cells or meshes can be constructed near-shore, the modeling domain and grid resolution are still limited, especially for simulating complex shorelines. Because of its relatively coarse resolution and small analysis domains, the SLOSH model may produce 20% or more errors in surge height simulations for certain areas (Jelesnianski et al. 1992;Blain 1997;Aggarwal 2004). The ADCIRC model was used in this study to simulate hurricane storm surge elevations. The ADCIRC model not only enables one to construct fine grids around the studied shoreline for improved accuracy, it also allows one to specify temporal and spatial varying wind field information for different historical hurricanes. Advective terms, horizontal viscosity and astronomical tides, which are not considered in the 8 SLOSH model [see Eqns. (2.1) to (2.3)], can also be taken into account in the ADCIRC program. Therefore, the ADCIRC model may produce better results than SLOSH, however with a higher computational overhead, if a highly refined mesh is used and the hurricane wind fields are adequately described. The use of the ADCIRC model for storm surge modeling is well documented (Dietsche et al. 2007;Blain et al. 2010;Forbes et al. 2010), and it is actively employed by a number of research institutes and federal agencies for storm surge forecasting. The ADCIRC model is a well developed hydrodynamic finite element model. It has highly flexible and unstructured grids which can be used to solve the governing equations for coastal and ocean circulations (Luettich et al. 1992). In this study, twodimensional ADCIRC model ADCIRC-2DDI (2-Dimensional Depth Integrated) was utilized. As a finite element program, ADCIRC requires a minimum of three sets of inputs for hurricane storm surge calculations (Figure 2.1). These inputs are 1  where, \uf07a is the free surface elevation relative to mean sea level; U and V are the depthaveraged horizontal velocities; t is the time; R is the radius of the Earth; \uf066 and \uf06c are the degrees latitude and longitude, respectively; H is the total height of the water  where, s are the applied free surface stresses along the latitudinal and longitudinal directions, respectively, which are functions of hurricane wind velocities: C is the drag coefficient; \uf066 V and \uf06c V are the surface wind velocities; and W is the wind speed magnitude given by: The GWCE for spherical coordinates (Kolar et al. 1994) is derived by combining a time-differentiated form of Eqn. (2.4) and a spatially differentiated form of Eqns. (2.5) and (2.6), along with Eqn. (2.4) multiplied by a constant 0 \uf074 (Luettich et al. 1992), which is also known as the wave continuity weighting factor: In ADCIRC, this partial differential equation is discretized in space after time discretization of the derived Galerkin's weighted residual statements (Luettich et al. 1992). The ADCIRC inputs include the Newtonian equilibrium tide potential \uf068 (described in the next section) and the applied free surface stresses \uf06c (2.9) to (2.12)]. As the only output needed in this study, water elevation \uf07a was calculated in each time step and recorded at every observation station."}, {"section_title": "Astronomical Tides", "text": "In this study, the total water elevations including the tidal heights were calculated and compared with the real water level measurements. The tidal potential function described by Reid (1990) was utilized in this study: where, jn \uf061 is the effective earth elasticity factor for tidal constituent n of species j,  , and 0 t is the reference time. The tidal periodic forcing imposed along the ADCIRC grid open boundaries is a function of multiple tidal constituents. Seven major constituents, denoted as 2 in the ADCIRC tide database (Westerink et al. 1993), were considered in this study. It has been shown that the summation of these seven major constituents surpasses 95% in amplitude of the total tidal signal (Murray 2003). The latest version of the ADCIRC tide database has been verified using real elevations from over 100 13 observation stations. The ADCIRC tide database was shown to be more accurate than the Le Provost tide database (Le Provost et al. 1995) at the area of focus in both amplitudes and phases. Note that the Le Provost tide database utilizes a coarse mesh which covers the entire world. The larger errors of the Le Provost tide database may be attributed to the coarse resolution grids with sizes ranging from 30km at the land boundaries to 400km in the deep ocean (Le Provost et al. 1995). The relatively coarse grid resolutions of the Le Provost database may produce large errors close to the shallow coastal waters. As can be clearly seen from Figures 2.3 to 2.5, the simulated tide elevation time histories from the ADCIRC tide database generally agree well with the measured tide elevations at three water level observation stations within the area of interest. However, large errors are produced for tide simulations using the Le Provost tide database.

In this study, the wind field model proposed by Georgiou (1985) was employed to characterize the hurricane wind velocities and atmospheric pressures at a discrete time interval. compute the hurricane wind field (Georgiou 1985): where, are the gradient and translational wind speeds, respectively; r is the radial distance from the hurricane center (eye); a \uf072 is the air density; \u03b2 is the angle measures from the hurricane translational direction to where the wind speed is being considered (counter-clockwise is positive); and f is the previously defined Coriolis parameter: where, \uf057 is the angular rotation rate of the earth (7.272\u00d710 -5 rad/s). In Eqn. (2.18), r P is the air pressure at distance r from the hurricane eye. The air pressure field is described using the following equation: where, is the pressure profile parameter, also known as the Holland B parameter (Vickery and Wadhera, 2008); and max R is the radial distance measured from the hurricane eye to the location where the wind speed is maximum, termed radius-to-maximum wind. Note that the max R is not provided in the HURDAT. The following equation proposed by Vickery et al. (2000) was used to compute the max R of each storm: Where, \uf066 is defined previously as the latitude of the hurricane eye.   The direction ( g \uf079 ) of the gradient wind speed is: where, \uf071 is the hurricane heading angle measured from north (counter-clockwise is positive). Thus, the wind direction g \uf079 is measured from east (counter-clockwise is positive); and the gradient wind speed components along the latitudinal and longitudinal directions are: (2.25) In ADCIRC, the surface wind speed (10-meter elevation from the ground) is required as part of the meteorological forcing for storm surge simulations. In order to convert the wind speed from gradient level to surface level, the conversion factors developed by Vickery et al. (2009) were used. Vickery et al. (2009) suggested a conversion factor over water of around 0.71 per a boundary layer model, and about 19% reduction for sea-land transitions."}, {"section_title": "Determination of Hurricane Time Interval", "text": "Hurricane information (wind velocities and atmospheric pressures) is read into the ADCIRC model with an evenly spaced time interval (between hurricane time steps, see Table 2.1, WTIMINC), which is usually larger than the time step (Table 2.1, DTDP) used for solving the governing equation of the ADCIRC model. The ADCIRC model uses linear interpolation to upsample the hurricane wind velocity and atmospheric pressure time histories to match the computational time steps. According to the ADCIRC source code, linear interpolation is performed for hurricane wind speeds ( T W ) with a weighting factor \uf06b : where, T is the time in the model (corresponding to current computational time step); 1 T is the time at previous hurricane time step; Therefore, a methodology was proposed to determine a proper hurricane time interval to account for both accuracy and computational demand. As illustrated in Figure   2.15, the travel distance between any two hurricane time steps of each individual hurricane analyzed in this study (described in the next section) was not allowed to exceed 2 max R (half of the radius-to-maximum wind) at that particular step. In other words, the maximum hurricane time interval was not allowed to surpass the minimum travel time of  where, i R max, is the radius from hurricane eye to the maximum wind speed at hurricane time step i; and i T V , is the translational wind speed at hurricane time step i. Therefore, the temporal variation of hurricane wind field was modeled using a series of discrete wind fields at a 15-min time increment (see Table 2.1, WTIMINC = 900). Since the hurricane parameters in HURDAT are for a 6-hour time interval, linear interpolations were performed to obtain the wind field parameters for a 15-min time increment. Eqn. (2.22) was then used along with the gradient-to-surface wind speed conversion factors to calculate the 10-m surface wind speeds for each historical hurricane          in the modeling errors quantified in this study since observations at the CO-OPS stations included waves that could not be subtracted from the real measurements. The annual maximum surge height statistics since 1922 (90 years in total) were compiled for each of the nine water stations using the historical measurements obtained from the CO-OPS database. Data were collected for each water station starting from the following year when the particular station was established. Note that some data points were missing due to sensor failures at the water stations during a few major hurricane events. These data points were excluded from the modeling error calculations performed for the affected stations. It should be noted that only the annual maxima caused by the tropical storms were considered in this study. Surges due to other storms such as the nor'easter storms were not considered in this study. The scatter plots between the measured (  A previous study has shown that the relationship between the measured and simulated storm surge heights can be characterized using a power equation times a random error term (Pang et al. 2009): ) was used to account for the systematic errors of the model while the random errors were described using the error term ( \uf065 ) computed as the measured surge height (       where, x F is the lognormal cumulative distribution function; \uf046 (.) is the standard normal CDF; x ln \uf06d is the logarithmic mean, also known as the location parameter;  Table 3.1 (columns 4 to 8). Note that the logarithmic means of the random errors ( \uf065 \uf06d ln ) for all the stations are essentially equal to zero, which indicates that the random errors are unbiased.

Using the modeling error adjustment parameters quantified for the nine water stations (Table 3.1 columns 5 to 8), the following steps were performed to adjust the simulated surge heights: 1) For each station, determine the annual maximum surge heights based on the surge elevations simulated using the ADCIRC program ( s S ). 2) Adjust the model simulated annual maximum surge heights ( Table 3.1 (columns 5 and 6). 3) Fit the systematic-error-adjusted surge simulations ( s S ) to a lognormal distribution and estimate the logarithmic mean and standard deviation parameters (  Table 3.1 (columns 7 and 8). 6) Assuming the annual maximum surge heights are independent from year to year, calculate the 5-year and 10-year maximum surge CDF values by raising the annual x F values to the 5-th and 10-th power, accordingly ( The annual, 5-year and 10-year maximum surge height distributions and the lognormal fits for three selected stations are shown in Figures for all other locations are presented in Appendix G.

The K-S tests were performed to determine the goodness-of-fits of the lognormal distributions for the annual, 5-year and 10-year maximum surge data (Table 3.2). As shown in Table 3.2 (columns 4, 6 and 8), the K-S values are all below the critical K-S values, which mean the annual, 5-year and 10-year maximum distributions can be reasonably approximated using the lognormal distributions. From Figures 4.1 to 4.3, it can be seen that the dispersions of the unadjusted model simulated annual maximum surge heights (solid dots) are generally less than that of the observed surge heights (hollow circles). In other words, the slopes of the unadjusted model simulated cumulative maximum surge distributions, which do not include the random errors, are steeper than that of the corresponding observed cumulative surge distributions which inherently include the random errors. For engineering application, the upper percentile values, for instance the 90 or 95 percentile, are typically taken as the design values to ensure that the actual surge heights will be less than the design values 90% or 95% of the times. The surge data estimated without correcting for the modeling errors (both the systematic and random errors) are potentially unconservative and may underestimate the actual surge elevations particularly for the extreme high surge events. As can be clearly seen in Figures 4.1 to 4.3, the final erroradjusted annual, 5-year and 10-year maximum surge distribution curves generally match the actual observed surge data (circles, triangles and diamonds) well.

As can be clearly seen in these figures, the proposed methodology that worked for corrections of surge height distributions for a group of hurricane events over a long period does not work well for individual hurricanes. The RMS (root-mean-square) errors between the simulated and measured annual maximum surge heights before and after the adjustments were also calculated at all nine water level observation stations and listed in Table 4.1. In Table 4.1, \"distribution\" means the RMS errors were computed per rank-ordered simulated and measured surge data, while \"individual\" means the simulated surge heights were adjusted individually and paired with the correspondingly measured data. The same conclusion can be made based upon this table. The methodology works for surge height distributions for a group of hurricanes but not for individual events. Therefore, the methodology presented in this study should only be used to adjust the surge height distributions for long-term hurricane events and should not be used to adjust the simulated surge heights of individual hurricanes.     Using the measured hurricane storm surge heights at the CO-OPS water stations, the annual maximum surge height statistics were computed at the nine water level observation stations. The modeling errors (systematic and random errors) were estimated for each water stations by comparing the simulated to measured annual maximum surge heights. A power equation was utilized to quantify the systematic errors in the surge simulations and a lognormal distribution was used to characterize the random errors in the surge heights. The error-adjusted simulated surge heights have been shown to match well with the real storm surge measurements. Even though the determined modeling errors are only applicable to the specific combination of storm surge model (i.e. ADCIRC) and hurricane wind field model used in this study, the methodology employed to quantify the modeling errors can be easily applied to other models (e.g. SLOSH model combined with the Vickery et al. (2000) wind field model)."}, {"section_title": "60", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER SIX FUTURE WORK", "text": "This study can be further improved by addressing the possible shortcomings in storm surge simulations. The simulated surge heights will be more accurate if wave setup is taken into account. The wave components, which are important in storm surge simulations, can be considered by running the coupled ADCIRC+SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) model. By doing more, instead of a few parameter sensitivity studies, more reliable surge modeling parameters (such as break depth and horizontal eddy diffusion coefficient) can be obtained rather than only taking the recommended values. It should be noted that the standard deviation of the errors determined using the methodology presented herein is likely tied to the resolution of the finite element mesh. To reduce the error range, one may improve the quality and resolution of the finite element mesh (i.e. decrease the minimum distance between two nodes), using more detailed coastline database, and/or more accurate bathymetric and topographic data. For possible applications of this proposed methodology, other than generating reliable storm surge maps as mentioned in previous sections, it can be used for any other studies relevant to storm surge simulations to adjust for simulated surge heights, as long as the site-specific measured data are available. For instance, the study of climate change on hurricane storm surges, the development of site-specific joint distributions of hurricane wind and storm surge, the long-term loss estimation subject to combined hurricane wind and storm surge, and so forth. !
