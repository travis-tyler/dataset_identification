[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives: Adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for ovarian cancer treatment improves patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess disparities associated with ovarian cancer treatment in the state of Kentucky and central Appalachia.\nMethods: Data on patients diagnosed as having ovarian cancer from 2007 through 2011 were extracted from administrative claims-linked Kentucky Cancer Registry data. NCCN compliance was defined by stage, grade, surgical procedure, and chemotherapy. Selection criteria were reviewed carefully to ensure data quality and accuracy. Descriptive analysis, logistic regression, and Cox regression analyses were performed to examine factors associated with guidelines compliance and survival.\nResults: Most women were aged 65 years or older (62.5%) and had high-grade (65.9%) and advanced-stage (61.0%) ovarian cancer. Twothirds of cases (65.9%) received NCCN-recommended treatment for ovarian cancer. The hazard ratio of death for women who did not receive NCCN-compliant care was 62% higher compared with the women who did receive NCCN-compliant treatment. Results from the logistic regression showed that NCCN-compliant treatment was more likely for women aged 65 to 74 years compared with women aged 20 to 49 years, late-stage compared with early-stage cancers, receipt of care at tertiary care hospitals, and privately insured compared with Medicaid or Medicare.\nConclusions: When the treatment of ovarian cancer did not follow NCCN recommendations, patients had a significantly higher risk of death. Women were less likely to receive NCCN-compliant care if they were younger (20-49 years), had early-stage disease, did not have private insurance, or had care provided at a nontertiary care hospital. \n\u2022 There is a higher risk of death if ovarian cancer treatment is not compliant with National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.\n\u2022 Younger women are more likely than older women to receive noncompliant care.\n\u2022 Noncompliant care also was more common in women with early-stage disease and women with nonprivate insurance."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "O varian cancer is one of the more lethal gynecologic cancers because it presents regularly in advanced stages 1 and many women do not receive expert-recommended care. 2 Until progress is made in the early detection of ovarian cancer, it is important to understand the barriers that prevent women from receiving National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-compliant treatment. The NCCN publishes detailed guidelines for the treatment of ovarian cancer, which include comprehensive surgical staging for early-stage cancers and aggressive surgical cytoreduction for advanced-stage disease. With the exception of low-grade, early-stage ovarian malignancies, platinum-and taxane-based chemotherapy is recommended following surgery. 2 Adherence to NCCN guidelines has been shown to improve patient outcomes. 2 Unfortunately, as many as twothirds of women with ovarian cancer are not referred to a gynecologic oncologist for their primary surgery, 3, 4 and a similar fraction do not receive NCCN-compliant care. 2 A number of factors have been associated with noncompliant treatment according to NCCN guidelines. These include hospital and surgeon case volume, 2 treatment at National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC) facilities, cancer stage, 6 geographic proximity to the hospital, 7 race, 8 and socioeconomic status. 8 Although the median age at diagnosis for ovarian cancer is 63 years, 55% of women diagnosed as having invasive ovarian cancer are younger than 65 years 9 ; therefore, women of all ages should be included in populationbased evaluations. We also should consider whether noncompliant treatment is an intentional act of commission. A single institutional report from the University of Alabama at Birmingham noted that common reasons for noncompliance were intentional and related to chemotherapy toxicity, disease progression, patient refusal, and comorbidities preventing recommended surgery or chemotherapy. 10 An analysis of guideline concordance for colorectal cancer in the Appalachian region of Kentucky demonstrated that noncompliance was associated with chronic medical conditions, including myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, and surgical noncompliance was associated with low-volume centers and hospitals that were not designated by the Commission on Cancer."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "Our study objective was to perform a detailed analysis of treatment disparities for ovarian cancer in the state of Kentucky and central Appalachia based on published NCCN guidelines."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "This was a retrospective, population-based investigation of women diagnosed as having ovarian cancer while living in the state of Kentucky from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. Permission to perform the investigation was granted by the University of Kentucky institutional review board as an exempt protocol.\nOvarian cancer cases were selected based on International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition site codes C569 and extracted from the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) database. The KCR database was linked to insurance claim databases in the state of Kentucky, including Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers. This unique merging of clinical data eliminated patient age constraints seen when cancer registries are coupled to Medicare (patients aged 65 years and older). In addition, the use of both private and nonprivate insurers allows for a more complete review of medical comorbidities and insurance-related variables. The follow-up information in the KCR database is updated routinely by hospital and central cancer registrars. In addition, the database is cross-referenced routinely with the Social Security database and linked annually to Kentucky Death Certificate data and National Death Index data to ensure the most updated death information.\nPatient eligibility included an ovarian cancer diagnosis in the state of Kentucky, age older than 20 years, and a first diagnosis of an invasive cancer. To ensure complete and accurate treatment information, we included only patients with continuous insurance enrollment in the first year of cancer diagnosis (month of cancer diagnosis and 12 months following) or until the month of death in the first year. Borderline and nonepithelial ovarian malignancies were excluded from this study. There were 1450 cases identified with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer during the study period. A total of 361 cases were excluded because they had insufficient details to determine the surgical procedures that were performed; 20 were excluded because of age younger than 20 years, and 179 cases were excluded because ovarian cancer was not their first cancer diagnosis. An additional 68 cases were excluded because of nonepithelial histology. We defined NCCN compliance to include chemotherapy information captured from KCR-linked claims files, therefore, 322 cases were excluded because they did not have at least 13 months of continuous claims data. As such, a total of 413 cases were used for the complete analysis.\nThe primary outcome investigated was compliance with NCCN recommendations for ovarian cancer treatment. Chemotherapy and surgical guideline compliance were grouped to form a single bivariate value for compliance. For stages IIIB and below, adherence required a minimum performance of oophorectomy and lymphadenectomy, whereas stages IIIC and above required a minimum of oophorectomy and omentectomy and allowed for more extensive cytoreductive procedures. Guideline compliance required chemotherapy administration for all study cases with the exception of stages IA and IB grade 1 cancers. Surgical information was captured using KCR data, and chemotherapy information was identified by claims data linked to KCR data.\nHospitals were classified as high volume (>15 cases per year) or low volume (<15 cases per year) based on the number of ovarian cancer cases. Academic hospitals were defined to be tertiary care hospitals. The patient-specific variables analyzed were age, race, insurance type, Appalachian residence versus metropolitan status, educational level (percentage with high school education at county level), income level (percentage below the poverty level at county level), treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and geographic distance to the closest tertiary care hospital. We used the Great Circle Distance (GCD) method to calculate geographical distance and adapted the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR)'s SAS/GIS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) application (https://www.naaccr.org/gis-resources/#GREATCIRCLE). Appalachian status was based on the definition from the Appalachia Regional Commission (https://www.arc.gov/index.asp). The 2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (https://www.ers.usda.gov/dataproducts/rural-urban-continuum-codes) were used to define metro and nonmetro status, with values 1 to 3 being metro and 4 to 9 being nonmetro. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was assigned based on KCR-linked claims data from a period spanning 12 months to 1 month before cancer diagnosis. The CCI variable was treated as unknown when 12 months of continuous claims coverage before the cancer diagnosis was unobtainable. Tumor-related variables included cell type, stage, grade, number of lymph nodes examined, and tumor size.\nDescriptive analysis was conducted for all of the variables. Bivariate analyses with \u03c7 2 tests were performed to examine the association between guideline compliance and other covariates. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to determine significant factors associated with the delivery of NCCN-compliant care. Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were conducted for survival analysis. A Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the survival effects of various covariates, including NCCN compliance. All of the analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. Statistical tests were two-sided, with a P value \u2264 0.05 used to identify statistical significance."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Of a total study population of 413 women, 272 (65.9%) received NCCN guideline-compliant care. For the 141 women who did not receive guideline-compliant care, 87 (61.7%) did not receive the recommended chemotherapy and 79 (56.0%) did not receive the appropriate surgery. The summary of demographic characteristics is shown in Table 1 . The mean age of the study population was 65.5 years and 62.3% of study subjects were 65 years or older. More than half of the cancers were diagnosed at an advanced (III or IV) stage (60.9%). The majority were also grade 3 or 4 malignancies (65.7%). Fewer than 10% of patients had a CCI >2. Only 39.1% of cases were treated at a tertiary hospital, whereas 58% were treated at high-volume hospitals as defined by at least 15 ovarian cancer cases per year. Medicare insured 65% of the women in this study. Although more women were treated in non-Appalachian metropolitan areas (44.7 %) than any other, 31.2% were still treated in rural Appalachia."}, {"section_title": "NCCN Guideline Compliance", "text": "The bivariate analysis between patient characteristics and NCCN compliance is listed in Table 1 . Women who received NCCNadherent care were more likely to have late-stage disease (stages III and IV), smaller tumors (<10 cm), and treatment at a tertiary care hospital. Women from non-Appalachian metropolitan areas were more likely (51.9%) to have private insurance carriers, whereas women from Appalachian rural areas were more likely to be covered by Medicaid. Patient income and education level were not associated with NCCN compliance or survival. The average GCD to the closest academic hospital for all subjects was 62.9 miles (\u00b148.5 miles). The average GCD for noncompliant cases was 59.8 miles (\u00b145.3 miles) compared with NCCN-compliant cases of 64.5 miles (\u00b150.1 miles).

In addition, women living in non-Appalachian metropolitan areas had better survival compared with women living in rural Appalachian areas (HR 0.698, 95% CI 0.491-0.990). A patient's distance to the closest tertiary care hospital was marginally associated with survival (HR 1.003, 95% CI 1.000-1.006). As expected, overall survival was better for younger women than for older women, early-stage compared with late-stage diagnosis, and women with low compared with high CCI."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Ovarian cancer remains a significant cause of cancer death for women. One way to improve cancer outcomes is to ensure that women have access to expert-recommended care. Cancer incidence rates in Kentucky are among the highest in the United States, and the geographic region of central Appalachia has numerous barriers that may limit access to expert medical care. Understanding the specific disparities is critical to improving ovarian cancer outcomes in this region. The age-adjusted incidence for ovarian cancer in the state of Kentucky in 2013-2014 was 10 cases per 100,000 people, similar to the national rate of 11.9 cases per 100,000 people. 12 The corresponding age-adjusted mortality rate is 6.8/100,000 in Kentucky versus 7.2/100,000 nationwide. 12 Compliance rates for NCCN-recommended treatment for ovarian cancer have not been reported for the state of Kentucky or central Appalachia.\nThe NCCN was established in 1995 and now consists of a membership of 27 leading cancer facilities in the United States; its mission is to develop and institute standards of care for the treatment of cancer.\n13 NCCN panels consisting of recognized subject area experts routinely publish and review evidencebased guidelines pertaining to all facets of treatment and management of cancer from multiple primary sites. These guidelines frequently are used not only in the delivery of clinical care but also as benchmarks for analyses of the quality of cancer care delivery in the United States."}, {"section_title": "2,8,10", "text": "In our investigation, the overall NCCN compliance rate for the treatment of ovarian cancer was 65%. As reported in other studies, women who received guideline-compliant care had better overall survival. In our multivariate analysis, younger women (20-49 years) were significantly less likely to receive guidelinerecommended ovarian cancer treatment compared with women 65 to 74 years of age. Previous publications have reported that older women are at risk of receiving NCCN-noncompliant care for ovarian cancer, 1, 7, 8, 14 but our findings are the first to show this disparity in younger women. This is particularly poignant when one considers the potential number of life-years at risk for young women diagnosed as having cancer. When using Medicare-linked databases, population-based reports are restricted to ages 65 years or older. 8 In our investigation, we were able to include all women aged 20 years or older.\nWe elected to analyze age as a categorical as opposed to a continuous variable. This is logical because expert organization guidelines directing the management of adnexal masses vary for premenopausal versus postmenopausal women. 15 Furthermore, age-related comorbidities are likely to be a greater factor in older women than in those who have recently completed menopause. Consequently, using three age strata (20-49, 65-74, >75) considers age in relation to these key factors, rather than age as a continuous variable. The results of our survival analysis demonstrate that younger age is associated with better survival, which is an expected result. The results of our logistic regression demonstrate that younger age is associated with inferior guideline compliance, which is unexpected. This may suggest that decision-making guidelines in the younger-than-50-years age group are not satisfactory.\nOther publications have demonstrated low rates of NCCN guideline compliance for early-stage cancers. 6, 14 We also find that women with early-stage ovarian cancer are less likely to receive NCCN-compliant care. Because young women are more likely to have early-stage disease, 16 it is possible that stage and age are confounding factors in these analyses. Patients with early-stage ovarian cancer are more likely to have appropriate staging and treatment when their initial surgery is performed by a gynecologic oncologist 17 ; therefore, referral to a specialist is an important consideration.\nIn our study, patients with private insurance were more likely to receive guideline-compliant treatment than those with Medicaid or Medicare. This relation between insurance provider and quality of care in ovarian cancer has been reported previously. 1 It is not well understood why the type of insurance affects the quality of treatment, although possible explanations include differences in physician reimbursement or cultural issues relating to access. In the case of Medicaid, there is a direct correlation with individual income, and it is conceivable that the insurance provider may be a surrogate variable for socioeconomic status in this specific case. The extrapolation of that rationale to Medicare is less reliable. It is important to note that in this investigation, patient education and income status were not associated with differences in NCCN compliance or with overall survival. NCCN guideline compliance was higher when treatment was provided at a tertiary care facility. It is well known that for the treatment of ovarian cancer, high-volume hospitals and experienced surgeons provide more guideline-concordant care. 2 In addition, one report demonstrated greater rates of concordance when care was provided at NCI-designated CCCs, compared with both high-and low-volume hospitals that were not NCIdesignated CCC hospitals. 5 Other publications on ovarian cancer treatment have commented on disparities in guideline concordance based on socioeconomic status and race. 18 No race-disparate care was noted in our analysis, but the evaluation is limited by the small numbers of African Americans in central Appalachia (1.9%) and the state of Kentucky (7.9%). Insurance type may have served as a surrogate variable for socioeconomic status because income levels are based upon census tract data in relation to a subject's ZIP code of residence, whereas Medicaid insurance status is linked to low income on an individual level. We did observe a survival difference favoring nonAppalachian metropolitan populations compared with rural Appalachian populations. It is not evident whether this is related to the quality of care or other factors. Increased cancer mortality for Appalachian populations is a relation previously accredited to several factors, including medical comorbidities and access to care. 19 The literature is replete with guidelines and strategies for the preoperative evaluation of an ovarian mass; nevertheless, disparate cancer treatment remains common. Many women still are not referred to a gynecologic oncologist for their initial ovarian cancer operation. 3, 17 Ultrasound is available worldwide as a reliable and objective method to evaluate ovarian tumors. 20, 21 Serial sonography further enhances the ability of ultrasound to differentiate benign from malignant ovarian tumors. 22, 23 In addition, multivariate index assays are highly sensitive in detecting malignancy, [24] [25] [26] [27] including early-stage cancers, 28 and can be combined with ultrasound to stratify further the likelihood of malignancy. 29 These practical preoperative evaluation strategies should be considered for all women whose ovarian tumors are concerning enough to require surgery, regardless of cancer stage, patient age, location, or insurance provider.\nThe authors acknowledge several study limitations. Claims data allowed us to determine whether chemotherapy was received, but we were unable to determine individual agents or number of cycles. We also were unable to determine the subspecialty or case volume of the primary surgeon, both of which have been associated with survival in other studies. 2, 15 Lastly, our survival analysis did not include parameters related to the extent of primary cytoreduction or parameters related to disease recurrence, including time to recurrence and specific chemotherapy agents administered.\nOur study has several strengths. Our team linked KCR data to the majority of insurance databases in our state, thereby minimizing insurance provider-related biases. Such biases are potentially significant with regard to age (Medicare, age older than 65), and with regard to socioeconomic status (public vs private insurance in relation to patient income level). Our study gave a thorough account of medical comorbidities, a significant confounding variable that affects decisions related to surgery and chemotherapy. The requirement for 13 months of continuous claims data mandated the exclusion of a substantial number of cases but enabled us to capitalize on features of our KCR insurance provider-linked database. Lastly, we were able to use this comprehensive database to investigate the patterns of care for ovarian cancer in central Appalachia, an underserved and understudied region of the United States.\nThe findings of this investigation reaffirm that ovarian cancer survival is highest when treatment is concordant with published NCCN guidelines. Women with early-stage disease, nonprivate insurance, or treatment at nontertiary-care hospitals are more likely to receive noncompliant care. We also find that younger women with ovarian cancer are significantly less likely to receive NCCN-compliant care. Continued patient and physician education is needed to ensure that available imaging and biomarker tests are routinely used to help identify high-risk women for referral to an ovarian cancer specialist, regardless of cancer stage, location, insurance provider, or patient age."}]
