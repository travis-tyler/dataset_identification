Despite a wealth of research efforts since the active 2005 hurricane season (i.e. Katrina, Rita, Wilma), key questions related to hurricane flood characterization, mitigation, forecasts, and frequency remain under-explored. This dissertation addresses such research topics by combining several numerical models with hindcast, deterministic, and probabilistic methodologies to represent multiple hurricane flood hazards, including storm surge, rainfall-runoff, and interactions between these two sources of flooding (joint flooding). This thesis begins with the first numerical analysis of the performance and sensitivity of different hurricane storm surge indices, or simple parametric descriptors of hurricane characteristics, and their ability to represent a hurricane's storm surge response. After Katrina (2005) several surge indices were proposed to replace the category-based Saffir-Simpson index, but these surge indices were either not evaluated or their performance relative to one another was determined inconclusive due to limited observational data. For this, and other projects in this thesis, the storm surge response of hurricanes was evaluated using the tightly coupled ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) and Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model (ADCIRC+SWAN). Findings from this research demonstrate the performance and sensitivity of different surge indices and can help guide the replacement of Saffir-Simpson categories with an improved hurricane storm surge index. In the second study of this thesis, storm surge dynamics are characterized in a complex bay environment to understand how variations in storm and environmental factors, including sea level rise and the potential erosion of barrier islands, influence flow dynamics across the various tidal inlets and barrier islands that make up Galveston Bay's (the Bay's) coastline. This research provides useful insight regarding the regional flood vulnerability of the Houston-Galveston region and how this flood vulnerability can effectively be reduced by focusing surge mitigation along specific sections of the Bay's coastline. The third study in this thesis demonstrates that while a coastal barrier can prevent flood impacts from oceanic storm surge, significant storm surge can still develop within Galveston Bay itself, suggesting the additional need for multiple lines of defense strategies. This study proceeds to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of several regional surge mitigation strategies, including designs that protect from oceanic storm surge as well as local surge that can develop within Galveston Bay itself. Analyses in this study goes beyond the typical 100-yr rule of thumb design by evaluating the performance of different strategies for several return period events under current as well as future sea level conditions. The final study of this thesis evaluates joint flooding in coastal watersheds due to rainfallrunoff associated with hurricanes and its interactions with storm surge. Such analysis is crucial given that rainfall associated flooding is still not represented in probabilistic forecasting and frequency (i.e. 100-yr floodplain) products despite causing ~27% of human fatalities during hurricane events. To fill this information gap, a rapid hurricane flood prediction system was developed to represent the joint flood response from hurricanes. The utility of this joint flood prediction system was then demonstrated by improving upon probabilistic hurricane flood forecasting and frequency products. In this thesis, numerical flood analysis was performed in coastal watersheds, a bay, and the open coast. By characterizing, forecasting, and evaluating different strategies to protect against hurricanes, the author hopes to not only advance the current state of hurricane science, but to additionally provide practical insight and tools to increase coastal resiliency.            and 60km west from landfall C, which is considered a direct hit at the mouth of Galveston Bay. xiii Landfall D is 30km east of landfall C. b) Intensity (Vmax) and size (Rmax) of synthetic storms simulated as compared to historical storms in the Gulf of Mexico (data from NOAA 2016b). ... 68     Each node represents the result from a simulation.

Each of these events motivated research that reshaped our understanding of hurricane properties and their potential impacts. Wilma, led researchers to reevaluate the physical limits a hurricane's minimum central pressure can reach and thus the maximum wind speed such storms can develop (i.e. Elsner et al., 2008). Rita, led many to reconsider the uncertainty associated with forecasted hurricane characteristics and how to improve evacuation during hurricane events (i.e. Litman, 2006). Finally, Katrina led to questions regarding the damage potential of hurricanes with moderate wind speeds, but large wind fields (Powell and Reinhold, 2007;, and how to best provide storm surge protection at the regional level for cities like New Orleans (i.e. Lopez, 2009). These and other hurricane events have additionally resulted in explosive rainfall that has been poorly studied despite known increases to inundation levels (i.e. Ray et al. 2011;Mashriqui et al. 2014). Accurately representing this additional source of flooding is particularly necessary for flood forecasting and frequency analysis.

This dissertation is motivated by the reasoning that holistic resiliency against hurricane-related natural hazards can be achieved by i) properly understanding the characteristics and possible impacts of the natural hazards themselves, ii) ensuring an accurate description of impending hurricanes via accurate public advisories and flood warnings, and, iii) providing structural protection, when necessary. As a whole, these individual components make-up a continuum of flood resiliency products that can help decrease human and monetary flood losses and provide coastal, flood vulnerable areas with a greater capacity to prepare for and recover from major flood events. Due to limited observational data, numerical models are essential to evaluate potential flood impacts from hurricanes. In addition, the flexibility of numerical models allows for the evaluation of scientific questions of interest or hypothetical situations that can occur but could not be evaluated otherwise. Throughout this thesis, advanced numerical modeling methods are used to address remaining or insufficiently explored questions that are crucial to the scientific understanding of hurricane characteristics and a given hurricane's damage potential. Specifically, this dissertation evaluates the accuracy of different surge indices used for public advisories, characterizes complex storm surge dynamics in a bay environment, assesses different regional surge mitigation designs, and improves upon current flood forecasting and frequency products by probabilistically representing joint flooding. The majority of this thesis focuses on characterizing storm surge and rainfall-runoff flood hazards to further our fundamental understanding of such hazards, their potential impacts, and to fill gaps in current forecasting and frequency products for coastal areas.

These three objectives encompass comprehensive resiliency by advancing the characterization, mitigation, and forecasting and frequency analysis of hurricane flood hazards. The first two objectives focus solely on storm surge, while objective three additionally considers hurricane associated rainfall. Objective 1: Characterize and advance the current understanding of hurricane storm surge dynamics For this objective, two research projects were completed.

Due to the computational demand required for accurately representing storm surge with the high-fidelity hydrodynamic model ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) and its coupling with additional numerical models to represent rainfall-runoff, a surrogate or statistical model was trained to represent the relationship between hurricane wind-and pressure-field characteristics and their peak joint flood response typically determined from physics based numerical models.

In the Atlantic Ocean, these storms originate as tropical depressions off the west coast of Africa between June and November. These low-pressure depressions can then be filled with warm, moist air from surrounding higher pressure regions. These winds, which begin to fill the low-pressure core of a developing storm may converge and rise. As these winds and their associated warm, moist air rise, they cool and eventually condense at altitudes ranging from 2 to 5 km, releasing latent heat in their phase change from gas to liquid. The release of latent heat increases pressures and causes high altitude winds to diverge to surrounding, lower pressure areas. The divergence of air at higher altitudes results in low surface pressures at the eye of the tropical depression, which once again begins to fill with warm air from surrounding areas that have higher pressures (Figure 2-2). Warmer oceanic conditions provide greater amounts of warm, moist air that can continuously feed the low-pressure core of a tropical system. Given favorable environmental conditions, the process described in this paragraph can iteratively repeat itself to eventually form tropical storms or hurricanes. The transfer of warm moisture from the ocean to the low-pressure core of a hurricane increases with lower-pressure cores of a hurricane (Emanuel, 1991). This explains why increases in wind speed associated with a hurricane is inversely correlated with decreases in the pressure of a hurricane's core. Given favorable environmental conditions such as warm and moist air, minimum sea surface temperatures of 80 deg. F., and low wind shear (NOAA HRD, 2014), this cyclonic movement of air can continue, resulting in storms classified as tropical depressions for winds below 39 mph (17.4 m/s), tropical storms for wind speeds between 40 and 73 mph, and a hurricane for wind speeds greater than 74 mph (33 m/s). Since the previous conditions are most favorable from August to October (in the northern hemisphere), the majority of hurricanes form during these months (Figure 2-3). The general track of a hurricane is directed by global winds or jet streams that move east to west in the northern hemisphere and the opposite direction in the southern hemisphere (ref. Figure 2-1), while the rotation of hurricane winds themselves (counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, clockwise in the southern hemisphere) is caused by the coriolis force or the rotation of the earth. Hurricane winds spiral cyclonically around the center or eye of a hurricane owing to a near balance of the coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, resulting in the eye of the hurricane to be relatively calm with light winds.   "}, {"section_title": "Historical Hurricanes and their Impacts", "text": "Roughly 30% of the world's major natural disasters have been caused by floods ( Table 2-1), with ~85% of these events being hurricane related. Several hurricane events have also resulted in extensive human and economic losses along the active U.S. Atlantic coast (20-35 lat.) ( Table   2-2), where hurricanes strike a given coastal county roughly once every 10 years (Figure 2-4). These events can produce multiple hazards including storm surge, rainfall, and winds. On average, winds from hurricanes account for only about 8% of human losses, while the majority of losses are due to storm surge (49%) and rainfall flooding (27%) (Rappaport, 2014). This dissertation focuses on hurricane flooding (storm surge and rainfall-runoff) since they result in the majority of human and economic losses from hurricanes. The overall impact of a hurricane is largely defined by the exposed population and its resilience (ability to prepare for, absorb, and respond) to hurricane strikes and subsequent flooding. Despite advances in coastal resilience, coastal development is partly to blame for the increases in annual flood damage seen in the U.S. between the 1960s ($86 million) and 2000s ($10-16 billion) (Brody et al. (2011)). Today, roughly 40% of the U.S. population resides in coastal counties (NOAA 2013), and these coastal areas are seeing growth rates nearly twice that of the national average (NRC 2014a). In addition to increasing the population and infrastructure vulnerable to coastal hazards, development leads to increased impervious cover and thus greater flood impacts.   Given the increasing trend in coastal development, impacts can be reduced through an informed, prepared, and if necessary, protected public. For example, despite coastal development in Bangladesh, significant governmental efforts in improving forecasts and evacuation plans have resulted in significantly less human losses (in the 1000's) for hurricane strikes with similar characteristics to previous events that caused 100,000+ losses (i.e. Cyclone Sidr 2007 compared to Cyclone Gorky 1991) (Bimal Kanti Paul, 2009). From this dissertation, the author hopes that coastal communities and individuals will directly or indirectly benefit from a better understanding of storm surge and hurricane flooding, by providing effective options for regional surge mitigation, and by improving the current-state of forecasting and frequency products."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Storm Surge and Rainfall", "text": "Various factors play a role in determining the potential impacts of a hurricane, including the climatic conditions in which a hurricane develops, the characteristics of the hurricane itself, the physical geography of the area in which the hazard strikes, and the resiliency of a population (i.e. how well informed, flood protection, etc.). Each of these topics are discussed separately in this section as they relate to research questions addressed in this dissertation. Additional factors can influence the resulting impacts of a hurricane, such as accessibility for evacuation and the reliability of flood protection structures, however such topics are beyond the scope of this thesis."}, {"section_title": "Climate Change Considerations", "text": "The characteristics of a hurricane hazard itself is related to the environmental and climatic conditions that allow for the formation and development of a hurricane. For example, the following are required to form a hurricane: high sea surface temperatures (greater than 80 deg. F), low wind shear, high humidity in the lower-to-mid troposphere, sufficient distance from the equator, and rapid cooling with height. Decadal climatic oscillations have a direct influence on these environmental factors as well (i.e. El Ni\u00f1o). Long-term, increasing trends in sea surface temperature due to climate change will increase hurricane storm surge impacts. In a suite of future climate scenarios, the IPCC (2014) suggest that global sea surface temperature will likely exceed 1.5\uf0b0C and may increase to 4.8\uf0b0C by 2100. Primarily due to the thermal expansion of oceanic water and melting ice sheets, global sea level is expected to rise from 0.3 m to 2.5 m by 2100, with intermediate projections of 1 m (NOAA 2017). Uncertainty in projected sea level rise (SLR) estimates are largely based on different emission-based scenarios and the possibility of a \"tipping point\" where massive ice sheets may begin to rapidly melt. Regional or relative SLR estimates deviate from global sea level rise owing to several factors including vertical land movement, subsidence, and shifts in oceanic circulation. SLR is a particular concern for coastal flooding and hurricane events since various studies have demonstrated that a given rise in sea level can result in non-linear increases in storm surge (Mousavi et al. 2010). In addition, recent research suggests that for every 1\uf0b0 C increase in sea surface temperature, hurricane wind intensity will increase, on average, by 8% for hurricanes with wind speeds greater than 111 mph Tuleya 2004, 2008). However, current trends in hurricane intensity-size relationships suggest that this may imply future hurricanes will also be smaller. Exactly how the overall structure of hurricanes (size and intensity) will vary due to increases in sea surface temperature requires further research. Throughout this thesis, sea level rise, the most direct and well understood impact of climate change on hurricanes is incorporated into analyses concerning future conditions. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 incorporate sea-level rise to, respectively, represent how SLR will impact future surge dynamics across Galveston Bay and to evaluate the performance of surge mitigation designs for the Houston-Galveston region under future conditions."}, {"section_title": "Correlation of Hurricane Properties to Storm Surge and Rainfall", "text": "In terms of the hazard itself, higher intensity, larger hurricanes typically result in greater storm surge. While this may seem intuitive, only recent research has demonstrated the importance of hurricane size in determining a storms surge response (Powell and Reinhold 2007;Irish et al. 2008). The delayed realization of the importance of hurricane storm size is at least partially due to the widespread use of the Saffir-Simpson Scale since its adoption by the National Hurricane Center in 1974, which categorizes a hurricane according to its maximum wind intensity (Simpson, 1974). This indicator of a storms strength has proven misleading as demonstrated in further detail in Chapter 3 of this dissertation. To provide a simple example of the importance of this issue, Figure   2-5 demonstrates the significantly greater storm surge impacts that would occur due to Hurricane Ike, a category 2 storm with a large windfield, as compared to a synthetic category 4 storm with a small windfield (both making landfall slightly west of Galveston Bay). In addition to hurricane size and intensity, which, for a given landfall location, have the most direct impact on a hurricane's storm surge response, the forward speed and angle of a hurricane can additionally result in variations to storm surge (Figure 2-6). Generally, as forward speed is increased, peak storm surge will slightly increase to a maximum value and then either remain the same as forward speed is increased further or decrease slightly. For angle of approach, peak surge typically occurs at an angle slightly west of shore-normal, with lower surge responses likely for hurricane angles further west or east (Irish et al. 2008;Resio et al. 2012  A hurricane's characteristics also have a direct impact on the spatial distribution and intensity or amount of rainfall a hurricane can produce. Near the eyewall of hurricanes, winds that collide and rise eventually cool down, condense, and result in thunderstorms. When this air condenses, latent heat is released, which causes the air to rise even further to result in greater condensation (Stewart et al. 2016). Just outside the eye of a hurricane, explosive rainfall rates can occur, with rainfall intensity decreasing with distance. Statistical relationships between a hurricane's characteristics and its rainfall amounts have only recently been developed for quantitative precipitation forecast (Tuleya et al. 2007). In general, rainfall rates are higher for more intense storms since the collision of surface winds leads to greater vertical uplift of moist air that eventually condenses out at higher altitudes. These rainfall rates initially increase with distance from the eye of a hurricane to a hurricane's maximum winds and then exponentially decrease with radial distances beyond the radius of maximum winds (Figure 2-7) (Lonfat et al. 2004). Rainfall rates can reach, on average, 12 in/day for Category 3-5 storms, 6.75 in/day for Category 1-2 storms, and 3 in/day for tropical storms. As a result, more intense storms are not only expected to result in greater storm surge, but also greater rainfall amounts. In addition to rainfall intensity, the cumulative amount of rainfall received at a given location increases with storm duration, which occurs for storms with slower forward speeds. In general, storm intensity is the main characteristic that influences rainfall intensity and storm forward speed the total amount of rainfall associated with a tropical storm or hurricane. However, additional hurricane characteristics such as a storms size and angle directly influence the spatial extent of rainfall (Langousis and Veneziano 2009). Also, prevailing environmental conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind shear can influence rainfall patterns (Lonfat et al. 2007). Finally, sharp topographic conditions in inland environments and local convection associated with fronts that are not associated with a hurricane can add to the overall precipitation during a hurricane event."}, {"section_title": "Influence of the Surrounding Environment", "text": "The physical geography of the area in which a hurricane strikes can have a large impact on storm surge and the rainfall-runoff response of a storm for various reasons. While open-coast storm surge impacts are relatively well studied, storm surge can undergo several additional processes in bay and estuary environments that require further research (  Although diurnal tidal exchange that occurs across tidal inlets can be well-characterized, exchange that takes place across bay coastlines during hurricanes is less predictable. Generally, tidal inlets serve as a direct connection between the open-ocean and inland bay environments, while barrier islands can provide natural protection that may eventually be overtopped or breached. Past research has performed single event, hindcast analysis of storm surge interactions across bay coastlines (Canizares et al. 2008;Rego et al. 2010;Grzegorzewski et al. 2011;Sebastian et al. 2014). However, a comprehensive understanding with regard to how much storm surge may flow across the multiple tidal inlets and barrier islands that make up the coastline of a bay has not been evaluated in the context of a range of possible storms. In addition to coastal surge that can flow across a bay's coastline to subsequently impact inland environments, storm surge can develop within a bay itself due to local wind-fetch. The Okeechobee Hurricane of 1928, the second deadliest hurricane to ever strike the U.S. (ref . Table   2-2), resulted in extensive flood impacts to an enclosed lake, 80 km inland from where it originally made landfall along Florida's coast. Given strong support for a coastal barrier to protect the Houston-Galveston region (discussed in Chapter 5) there are concerns regarding the levels of storm surge that could be produced within an enclosed Galveston Bay because of the similarity in dimensions between Lake Okeechobee and Galveston Bay (Figure 2-9). In Chapter 6 the potential for local or in-bay surge is evaluated to guide effective surge mitigation strategies for the Houston-Galveston region. Finally, the coast can change during hurricane strikes or overtime. Daily wave action and alongshore drift or movement of sediment can cause changes along the coast that may impact storm surge levels. In addition, major hurricanes can erode sand dunes and cause breaches along barrier islands. However, eroded barrier islands typically return to a pre-storm state within 5-years after a hurricane strike along the TX coast (HDR, 2014). These changes can influence the storm surge response, and should be considered when appropriate or feasible. Hurricane associated rainfall can also be impacted by its surrounding environment. Estimates of the amount of rainfall produced within areas with sharp topographic relief need to be adjusted to account for processes such as orographic lift, which results in wetter conditions on the windward side of mountains. In addition, the rainfall-runoff response is directly related to a "}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Uncertainty: Impacts on Forecasts and Frequency Estimates", "text": "Uncertainties associated with hurricanes have resulted in significant challenges for coastal engineers. For hurricanes, two primary areas, flood frequency analysis and flood forecasts, must address uncertainties associated with data limitations and possible errors associated with a hurricane's forecasted characteristics, respectively. For a hurricane expected to make landfall, the National Hurricane Center forecasts the intensity, size, forward speed, angle, and several storm size descriptors every 6-hours along the projected track of a hurricane. For each of these hurricane characteristics, the NHC provides possible errors in their predictions based on forecasted error statistics from the previous 5 years (Rappaport, 2009). While these errors have reduced significantly over the past few decades and typically decrease as a hurricane approaches landfall (Figure 2-10 As such, flood frequency levels for the Gulf and Atlantic coast have recently been determined for different locations based on the resulting storm surge response of hundreds of ADCIRC simulations of the full range of possible hurricanes that could impact a given region.

To accurately solve the storm surge response with any hydrodynamic model the following are required: a well-defined mesh that represents the bathymetry/topography of the landscape, accurate (manning's) roughness of the sea bottom and inland land cover, detailed features such as roads and levees, and accurate wind-and pressure-fields.

The Sea, Lake, and which is a finite difference model, makes some sacrifices in its spatial extent, numerical discretization, resolution, representation of hurricane windfields, minor simplifications to the shallow water equations, and is not able to account for wave-setup, tides, and freshwater inflows. However, this was mostly by design in order to allow for rapid simulations and thus probabilistic flood estimates that can account for the uncertainty associated with hurricane forecasts. Despite its limitations in accuracy, SLOSH is the primary model used by the NHC to provide real-time hurricane storm surge forecasts given its ability to make hundreds of simulations in a short amount of time (Massey et al., 2007). On the other hand, ADCIRC, which uses an unstructured finite element scheme and a discontinuous Galerkin solution to solve the full 2d shallow water equations, requires up to an hour for a single simulation owing to its relatively high resolution mesh, larger spatial domain (mesh represents the entire east Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico), and ability to incorporate wave-setup amplifications to storm surge by coupling with wave models such as Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) ). In addition, ADCIRC, unlike SLOSH, can incorporate tidal and freshwater inflows. Despite longer run times, ADCIRC allows for a more accurate representation of a storms surge response in complex environments such as bays, estuaries, lakes, and inland areas. As a result, ADCIRC has been used for determining surge frequencies for coastal U.S. flood insurance rates (FEMA and USACE 2011) and in the evaluation of surge mitigation designs for New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina (i.e. USACE 2006). However, given the long run-time required for each simulation, ADCIRC can only provide deterministic estimates of storm surge in a forecasting environment or at best a few ensemble runs (Dresback et al. 2013) and requires coupling with advanced statistical methods for frequency analysis (Resio et al. 2009;Niedoroda et al. 2010;Toro et al. 2010). ADCIRC+SWAN was chosen for storm surge and wave analysis in this dissertation for several reasons. First, the model is more accurate in representing a hurricane's storm surge response in environments that require higher resolution such as bays, estuaries, or inland environments (Lin et al. 2010) like that of Galveston Bay evaluated in Chapters 4 and 5 and the watersheds in southeast Houston evaluated in Chapter 6. Second, as described in the next section, the model allows for a more flexible, realistic representation of hurricane wind-fields, which was required for analysis and comparison of different surge indices in Chapter 3. Finally, one of the objectives of this dissertation is to improve upon the accuracy of SLOSH storm surge forecasts currently provided for the Upper TX coast. This will be achieved by utilizing high-fidelity ADCIRC simulations along with machine learning techniques to provide rapid estimates of storm surge and hurricane flooding (Chapter 6)."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Wind-and Pressure-Fields", "text": "As expected, as a pre-requisite, modeling the storm surge impacts of hurricanes requires an accurate or realistic representation of hurricane wind-and pressure-fields. In addition to the differences previously stated, SLOSH is limited to relatively simple descriptions of a hurricane's windfield, while ADCIRC is able to incorporate windfields that allow for more detailed and thus more accurate representations of historical and/or synthetic hurricanes. For this dissertation, hurricanes were used that were created from two well-accepted and widely used windfield models for creating synthetic and historical storms. These include the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) model developed by Thompson and Cardone (1996) for the synthetic storms and H*Wind for Hurricane Ike's (2008) windfield (Powell et al. 1996;Hope et al. 2010). To generate windfields, the PBL model solves the vertically averaged equations of motion that govern a boundary layer subject to horizontal and vertical shear stresses. At 6-hr intervals along the track of a hurricane, the PBL model requires the following characteristics as inputs: central pressure deficit (\uf044P), peakedness and wind field distribution as defined by the Rmax and Holland B parameter, storm forward speed (Vf), and storm position. The resulting pressure fields of the PBL model can be described by a symmetric, exponential increase from the eye of the hurricane to ambient pressures, while the windfields vary in an asymmetric fashion (Figure 2-12). As shown in Figure 2-12, the Holland B parameter determines the radial wind (and pressure profile) of hurricanes so as to capture the different shapes a hurricane can develop (Holland 1980). Variations in the Holland B parameter are necessary for developing synthetic storms with varying shapes and sizes representative of the variations realistic storms can have. Variations in this parameter were included in this thesis. When necessary, additional synthetic storms were additionally created for research in this dissertation by modifying storms produced from the PBL model. Details regarding how these storms were modified are included in Appendix A. "}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Rainfall", "text": "In addition to storm surge, hurricanes can produce explosive amounts of rainfall (as and Hurricane Harvey (2017) which produced, respectively for each storm, ~1000-yr rainfall, 100yr rainfall (13.5 in over 24 hrs.), and ~500-yr rainfall in some portions of the Houston-Galveston region. These and several other events, in addition to the fact that rainfall from landfalling U.S. Atlantic hurricanes from 1970 to 2014 result, on average, in roughly 27% of human losses during hurricane events (Rappaport 2014), have led to recent investments in improving the understanding and prediction of hurricane rainfall and its interactions with storm surge. From the 1950s to 2000, estimates of hurricane rainfall were based on a rule of thumb equation (attributed to R.H. Kraft) dependent only on a hurricane's forward speed. It was only at the turn of the 21 st century that researchers first began to develop statistical-and physics-based rainfall models that related a hurricane's characteristics to its spatial and temporal likelihood for rainfall (Tuleya et al. 2007;Langouisis and Veneziano 2009a;Zhu et al. 2013).  hurricane. Due to data limitations these statistics-based models are based on the average amount of rainfall produced from crudely defined categories of storms. As a result, the model can severely under-or over-predict rainfall (Langousis and Veneziano 2009a). A more promising hurricane rainfall model is the modified Smith for Rainfall model (MSR) due to its consideration of the entire windfield of a hurricane and resulting surface rainfall rates based on the physical representation of the convergence of surface winds, the subsequent uplift of atmospheric moisture, and condensation at higher altitudes (Langousis and Veneziano 2009a). MSR utilizes the same 2-dimensional description of a hurricane's windfield produced from hurricane windfield models (i.e. PBL model discussed in Section 2.2) to determine surface rainfall rates: where the first term combines the ideal gas law with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to determine the volume of liquid water per unit volume of saturated air after complete condensation and the partial derivatives represent the vertical wind velocity at a given distance (R) from the center of a hurricane and the redistribution of rainfall based on the direction of a storm (\uf071). U is the surface radial wind velocity component, which influences how winds horizontally converge, rise, and eventually condense, while V represents the tangential wind velocity component which influences the asymmetric distribution of rainfall. Since this algorithm depends on the radial and tangential wind velocity at each location throughout a hurricane's windfield, storm characteristics such as radius to maximum winds and storm size (i.e. Holland B) that play an important role in a hurricane's rainfall distribution are taken into account. By using each time-step in a gridded hurricane's windfield, rainfall intensity can be determined throughout the duration of a hurricane's life for any location of interest. Langousis and Veneziano (2009a) determined that rainfall intensity is strongest correlated to a vertical wind velocity at a 3 km height (Z). T and Q represent the depthaveraged temperature and saturation ratio, which range between 20 to 24\uf0b0C and 75 to 85%, respectively, over tropical and subtropical waters (Smith, 2003). Further details regarding the numerical rainfall algorithm and its parameters can be found in Langousis and Veneziano (2009a). The MSR algorithm was chosen to represent hurricane rainfall expected form synthetic storms in this thesis (for Chapter 6 analysis) owing to its physics-based representation of hurricane rainfall and its validation against Hurricane Frances 2004and Katrina (2005), in which it was demonstrated to accurately capture hurricane associated rainfall as compared to statistics-based models such as R-Cliper Veneziano, 2009a, 2009b)."}, {"section_title": "Rainfall-Runoff", "text": "Several hydrologic models exist to accurately represent the rainfall-runoff response of a watershed. In a hydrologic model, rainfall serves as input and the runoff response throughout a watershed is determined based on infiltration rates and subbasin and channel routing. To accurately represent the runoff response throughout a watershed, an accurate description of the following characteristics of a watershed are required: topography, overland cover (manning's roughness coefficient, impervious cover), soil properties (hydraulic conductivity, wetting front suction, soil depth), and channel geometry. Two distinct types of hydrologic models exist, lumped models that represent spatially averaged characteristics at the subbasin-scale and distributed models that explicitly account for the spatial variability of a watersheds physical characteristics. Lumped models typically utilize unit hydrographs or semi-empirical equations to represent the characteristic rainfall-runoff response of a subbasin, while distributed models typically utilize simplifications to the St. Venant equation (continuity and momentum) to represent overland runoff at the grid or raster-scale. In this dissertation, the lumped hydrologic model HEC-HMS (Chapter 6) was utilized for representing rainfall-runoff since both HEC-HMS and Vflo have accurately been calibrated and utilized for flood forecasting, mitigation, and frequency analysis in other studies. Both HEC-HMS and Vflo are discussed to highlight the differences between these two models. In hydrologic modeling, several choices must be made in terms of the equations used to solve for infiltration, overland runoff, and channel routing. To represent infiltration or rainfall volume-losses in HEC-HMS (same as Vflo), the physics-based Green-and-Ampt equation was used: Where f is the infiltration rate, K is the hydraulic conductivity, \u2205 is soil porosity, is the initial soil water content, is the wetting front soil suction head, and is accumulated infiltration. In this dissertation, the Clark Unit Hydrograph method was utilized in HEC-HMS to represent a subbasins rainfall-runoff response, while Vflo always solves for overland flow using the kinematic equation. In HMS, Clark's model derives a Unit Hydrograph by explicitly representing two processes in the transformation of excess precipitation to runoff. These processes include translation or the movement of excess precipitation from its origin to the outlet of a subbasin, and attenuation or the reduction of the magnitude of discharge due to storage throughout the subbasin. The storage of a subbasin is represented using a linear reservoir model, and the time required for water to move from its origin to the outlet is represented using a linear channel or routing model. The Clark model requires two parameters: time of concentration (Tc) which is used for subbasin routing and a storage coefficient (R). In Vflo, overland runoff is solved from grid cell to grid cell (rather than for a subbasin like in HEC-HMS) using the kinematic equation, which is based on the one-dimensional continuity equation for overland flow: Where is rainfall rate; is infiltration rate; is overland flow velocity rate; and \u210e is flow depth rate. This simplified version of the full momentum or St. Venant equation assumes uniform flow or that the water surface is parallel with the overland bed slope. For channel routing, storage-discharge relationships determined from HEC-RAS were utilized in HEC-HMS, while Modified Puls routing is implemented in Vflo for flat areas like Houston. Modified Puls routing, also known as storage routing or level-pool routing, is based on a finite difference approximation of the continuity equation coupled with an empirical representation of the momentum equation (Chow, 1964;Henderson 1966): Where is inflow, is outflow, and is storage. The only unknowns in Eqn. 2-6 are +1 and +1 , allowing for an iterative solution at each time step for routing a flow hydrograph. Modified Puls, as compared to other numerical methods for channel routing, is typically used in flat regions such as Houston owing to its ability to better-represent storage. Using the previous equations to solve for infiltration, overland runoff, and channel routing, HEC-HMS and Vflo can provide streamflow hydrographs at user-defined locations of interest. Calibration of the hydrologic models and the characteristics of the watersheds evaluated in this thesis are included in the research chapters of this dissertation. Vflo can additionally provide stage information; however, since Vflo solves a simplified St. Venant equation, backwater effects such as that caused by bridges, tides, and/or storm surge cannot be accounted for. As a result, as discussed in the following section, streamflow information should be used in unsteady hydraulic models to evaluate the impact of backwater effects such as that caused by bridges or storm surge."}, {"section_title": "Riverine-Surge Interactions", "text": "Accurately representing the interaction between rainfall-runoff and tides or storm surge from a bay or estuary can be a challenging task. While streamflow can be incorporated as a boundary condition in hydrodynamic models (i.e. ADCIRC), it must be specified at a domains edge. Consequently, streamflow from a given river can only be specified at a single location that depends on the extent of a hydrodynamic models mesh, resulting in a poor representation of the distributed hydrologic response that typically occurs due to overland runoff and tributary inflows. To accurately represent overall inundation levels in coastal watersheds, unsteady hydraulic models such as HEC-RAS should be used. Hydraulic models can represent inundation due to rainfall-runoff and storm surge interactions along riverine channels and any resulting overbank flooding. Figure 2-13 demonstrates the typical workflow for modeling inundation from historical or observed events for which rainfall and tidal or storm surge data is available. Given rainfall across a watershed, a hydrologic model must be used to determine overland runoff and any streamflow contributions from tributaries. The time-variable streamflow data provided by the hydrologic model then serves as input to a hydraulic model. This time-variable streamflow data must be specified along the length of the main channel and any tributaries that discharge directly to the main channel of a watershed. Finally, a downstream tidal or storm surge boundary condition must be specified. While the steady-state solution of the energy equation in HEC-RAS can be used to approximate the maximum water level due to peak flows in inland environments, an unsteady solution that incorporates time-variable streamflow and stage hydrographs is required in coastal environments. This is necessary since a steady-state model assumes flow only occurs in the downstream direction, which does not allow for the upstream propagation of tides or storm surge. As such, the 1D unsteady HEC-RAS model is employed in this dissertation to represent resulting water levels in coastal environments (Chapter 6). Unsteady HEC-RAS implements a four-point implicit finite difference scheme to simultaneously solve the one-dimensional St. Venant or continuity and momentum equations at each cross section along a channel: (2-7) Where is channel cross-sectional flow area, S is the storage from non-conveying portions of the channel (i.e. the floodplain), is flow entering a control volume, is the lateral inflow per unit length, is velocity, is acceleration due to gravity, is water surface elevation, and is the friction slope. The continuity equation describes conservation of mass and the momentum equation states that the rate of change in momentum is equal to the external forces acting on the system. The performance of HEC-RAS and how it was used to represent joint flooding from hurricanes is discussed further in Chapter 6 of this dissertation.

"}, {"section_title": "Overview and Objectives", "text": "Since 1975, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) has used the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) as the primary index for predicting a tropical cyclone's (TC) storm surge impacts (Simpson 1974). The SSHS was originally proposed as an index of the potential wind damage of a TC; however, in its early adoption by the NHC, surge heights were introduced for each category of the SSHS. Recently, various storm events and hindcast analyses have demonstrated that the SSHS can provide misleading estimates of surge impacts owing to its dependence on a single maximum wind intensity value and its neglect of TC storm size (Kantha 2006;Powell and Reinhold 2007;Irish et al. 2008). For example, Hurricane Katrina (2005) which had nearly the same landfall location as Hurricane Camille (1969) resulted in significantly greater impacts despite its category 3 winds as compared to Camille's category 5 winds, primarily due to the greater storm size of Katrina (Powell andReinhold 2007, Irish et al. 2008). Although real-time and projected forecasts of storm surge impacts can be provided with hydrodynamic numerical simulations (i.e. Glahn et al. 2009;Dresback et al. 2013), surge indices can be useful for communicating the strength of a TC and its potential storm surge impacts during an impending strike in addition, or for those without access, to graphical products. In addition, surge indices that summarize the characteristics of a TC to describe their potential storm surge impacts are useful for putting historical and impending storms into context. Using the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) and Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model (referred to as \"ADCIRC+SWAN\"), this study provides the first quantitative evaluation of the performance of these different alternative surge indices as they compare to the traditional SSHS (reference Table 3-1). An overview of these different surge indices and how they were derived can be found in Bass et al. (2016).\nThe previous chapter outlined how different hurricane characteristics can be parameterized into a surge index for informing expected storm surge impacts along coastal areas. However, due to the variable coastlines and bathymetry/topography of bay environments, site-specific studies can be required to understand surge dynamics that are unique to these areas. In this study \"coastal surge\" which is surge that flows across a bay's coastline is evaluated in detail ( Fig. 4-1) for Galveston Bay along the Upper TX Coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Coastal surge is evaluated in detail for Galveston Bay since it was found to have a nearly direct relationship to inundation area throughout the Houston-Galveston region (Fig. 4-11). Thus, by understanding how much surge flows across the Bay's different tidal inlets, barrier islands, and its seawall, insight from this study can inform where the location and height of surge mitigation designs for the region can provide the greatest surge reductions. While estimates of diurnal tidal exchange are generally well-understood, studies to date have only evaluated coastal surge, or the volume of surge that flows across bay coastlines, for a few, discrete historical or synthetic TC events (Grzegorzewski et al., 2011;Ca\u00f1izares et al., 2008;Rego et al., 2010;Sebastian et al., 2014). Having an overall understanding of this surge component is important for guiding surge mitigation designs, regional forecasting guidance, and informing urban development practices along barrier islands. In this study, a representative range of all possible hurricanes that could impact the study area are evaluated to understand how non-linear trends in coastal surge scale with storm characteristics. In addition, since findings from this study are intended to inform surge mitigation designs, conservative estimates are performed by considering possible barrier island erosion as well as future sea level conditions. While the results from this study apply to Galveston Bay, advances in the understanding of surge dynamics and general surge mitigation concepts that result from the study will be useful for other bay environments. In addition, the methodologies used to further the understanding of existing surge dynamics and subsequently to provide practical insight for surge mitigation strategies in the study region can be applied to other bay and estuary environments.\nChapter 4 provided an in-depth evaluation of coastal storm surge that can flow from the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay via the different tidal inlets and barrier islands that make up its coastline. In this chapter, \"local surge\", or surge generated within Galveston Bay itself, is additionally evaluated to highlight the complex surge dynamics the Houston-Galveston region, and other bay environments, may be vulnerable to. This analysis suggests that in addition to protecting against coastal surge that can flow into the Bay from the Gulf of Mexico (as studied in detail in Ch. 4), the Houston-Galveston region may require in-bay defenses (\"multiple lines of defense) to protect from local surge. Based on Galveston Bay's vulnerability to local surge levels, the performance of several multiple lines of defense strategies were subsequently evaluated against a range of return period or \"proxy\" storms under current and future sea level conditions. The objective of this chapter is to go beyond typical 100-yr rule of thumb designs of surge mitigation, where levee heights may be set to the 100-yr surge level for a region. This is particularly important for Galveston Bay, where local and coastal surge contribute to overall surge levels."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "The metrics against which the surge indices were evaluated in this study were determined along the coast and thus results are applicable for coastal regions. Surge impacts to unique environments such as bays, estuaries, and islands can depend on several additional factors that would be challenging to incorporate into a surge index that is intended to be simple, yet effective in communicating a storms potential storm surge impacts. This study was limited to analysis along the northwest Gulf of Mexico. While this region includes a wide range of steep to shallow offshore bathymetries, the regional bathymetry is the same. As such, specific storm surge levels may increase or decrease for other regions, while the overall performance of the surge indices correlation to the storm surge metrics evaluated should generally remain the same. The accuracy of these surge indices are evaluated specifically for coastal regions, while in-depth characterizations of storm surge impacts and forecasting products are recommended for more complex environments such as bays, estuaries, and islands. = air density; U = wind speed; v = volume of air parcel; Vmax = maximum wind intensity; R33 = radius to hurricane winds; \u2206P = ambient pressure minus central pressure; 30 = distance to offshore 30-meter depth; \u03a8 = storm size function 2 IKETS refers to the IKE calculated for winds greater than tropical storm intensity (18 m/s) and IKEH refers to the IKE calculated for winds greater than hurricane wind intensity (33 m/s) 3 The Surge Scale includes a linear function \u03a8 that is equal to R33 divided by L30 and should only be used when less than one; when \uf059x, or R33 divided by L30, is greater than one it is set equal to one (Irish and Resio 2010) Name of Surge Index Abbreviation Equation 1  Author \nA bay is a semi-enclosed body of water that is connected to the ocean and partially surrounded by land. The coastline of a bay is typically made up of some combination of tidal inlets and barrier islands that separate a bay and its inland environments from the ocean. During TCs, barrier islands provide a natural form of protection that can help prevent coastal surge from entering a bay, whereas tidal inlets serve as a direct connection for coastal surge to enter a bay. Although diurnal tidal exchange that occurs across tidal inlets is generally well-characterized, exchange that takes place across bay coastlines during TC events is less predictable. This is due to non-linear surge interactions across coastline-bay environments that depend on various factors, including the dimensions and bathymetry of tidal inlets and topography of barrier islands, TC characteristics and their respective influence on storm surge, and erosion and breaches that can alter barrier islands during TC strikes. In this study, Galveston Bay, with an area of approximately 1554 km 2 and an average depth of roughly 3 m (Fig. 4-2a), is evaluated in detail. As the seventh largest estuary in the B1 and B3 partially protect the region against storm surge as natural sand barrier islands. While the topography along these barrier islands varies significantly in their respective alongshore and cross-sectional dimensions (Fig. 4-2b), B1 and B3 stand from 0.75 to 2 m above MSL. Peak dune elevations along the seaward facing side of these barrier islands range from 1.5 to 3 m above MSL for B1 and B3. The main tidal inlets along the bay's coastline include T1 and T2, which, respectively, contribute roughly 20% and 80% of the diurnal tidal exchange that occurs between the bay and the Gulf of Mexico (Lester and Gonzalez, 2011). T2 makes up the majority of tidal exchange because of its extensive width (3.75 km) and maximum depth of roughly 15 m, as compared to T1, which has a width of 1.1 km and a maximum depth of 4.25 m (Fig. 4-2b). Various local and regional surge mitigation strategies have been proposed for the Houston-  \nFor the Houston-Galveston region and much of the Upper Texas Gulf Coast, the devastation imparted by the Hurricanes of 1900and 1915and Hurricane Ike (2008 have demonstrated the surge risks inherent to the region. Figure 5-1 demonstrates the population density and industrial presence in the region, highlighting those areas that require the greatest protection from storm surge. Given the vulnerability of the Houston-Galveston region, the local research community has responded with a series of surge mitigation strategies for the area (Merrell et al. 2011;Christian et al. 2014;Blackburn et al. 2014;GCCPRD 2015;SSPEED Center 2015). In one such proposal, Merrell et al. (2011) suggested a 17 ft. continuous barrier along the Bay's coastline ( Figure 5-2a), which is comprised of levees along barrier islands and flood gates across tidal inlets. Given that a coastal barrier is being considered as a comprehensive solution for surge mitigation throughout the Houston-Galveston region (Merrell et al. 2011), analysis of local surge that could develop within Galveston Bay was evaluated even after the introduction of an idealized coastal barrier. Subsequent to understanding vulnerabilities to local surge, the SSPEED Center (2015) developed a lower-bay strategy (LBS) and mid-bay strategy (MBS) as shown in Fig. 5-2b and Fig. 5-2c, respectively, to provide further protection to heavily populated residential areas and industrial areas.  \nIn this study joint flooding is evaluated in SE Houston study (Figure 6-1). The southeast Houston study area is made up of several watersheds, including the Clear Creek, Armand Bayou, Horsepen Bayou, and Taylor Bayou watersheds. The area being evaluated covers 666 sq. km.., encompasses 16 cities, and includes a total population of roughly 300,000 people. Due to its location, the area experiences frequent rainfall-runoff events that interact with diurnal tides and less frequent, but more severe tropical storm and hurricane events. For example, during Hurricane Ike storm surge levels reached 12 ft. at the watersheds outlet, an average of ~8 inches occurred over the watershed, and ~3,000 houses were flooded. The regions shallow slope ranging from 70 feet at its upstream end to mean sea level at its outlet to Galveston Bay, loamy to clay soils that prevent infiltration, and areas of impervious cover exacerbate flooding in the watershed. The modeling framework and analysis performed to represent overall inundation levels in the study area (as discussed in the following sections) should similarly be applied to other coastal watersheds vulnerable to hurricane strikes with large populations located in low-lying, coastal areas.  "}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "\nThis study evaluates possible TC intensity (Vmax) and size (Rmax) combinations that could impact the study region using the physics-based, tightly coupled ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) and simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) numerical model (referred to as ADCIRC+SWAN). The model set-up and its description are the same as that used for analysis in Chapter 3 (reference Section 3.3.3). Also, similar to Chapter 3, the storm suite was developed using FEMA (2011) storms in addition to modified FEMA storms using the synthetic storm program outlined in Appendix A. The following paragraph discusses the storms used for analysis in this chapter (many of the storms are similar to those used in Chapter 3 with minor differences). To evaluate baseline (existing) coastal surge conditions, 20 storms were simulated at four landfall locations near Galveston Bay, for a total of 80 simulations. Characteristics of the storms are listed in Table 4-1 and represent unique combinations of maximum wind speeds (35.8 to 71.5 m/s, 80 to 160 mph) and radius to maximum winds (15 to 62 km). All storms were simulated using the same forward speed (6.7 m/s), track, and angle of approach (-41\uf0b0 relative to due north). Figure   4-3a depicts the different landfall locations and tracks of the storm suite. Figure 4-3b illustrates the different storm sizes and intensities evaluated, and how they compare to historically observed storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Typical landfall Holland B values for the region (0.9 to 1.2), which define the shape of a TC's wind and pressure profile, were utilized (FEMA 2011). As demonstrated in Fig. 4-3b, the synthetic storm suite encompasses possible TC sizes and intensities that could impact the study area based on historical data. Since previous studies (e.g., Sebastian et al., 2014) have indicated that the regional surge response is highly-sensitive to landfall location, the four different landfall locations were chosen to generate a large gradient of surge responses. The angle and forward speed of the synthetic storm suite were selected based on the most probable parameters for the study region (FEMA and USACE, 2011;Dorst, 2014). These values include an average forward speed of 6.7 m/s, which can range from 4.5 m/s to 8.9 m/s, and an average angle of approach of -41 degrees from due north, which can range from -78 to +10\uf0b0 relative to due north based on historically observed TC characteristics for the study region (FEMA and USACE, 2011). In addition to the synthetic storms, Hurricane Ike (2008) was simulated at its original landfall location (same as landfall C -reference Fig. 4-3a for landfall and Table 4-1 for characteristics) to put results into context of a historical storm with reliable windfield data that impacted the study region. The wind and pressure fields for Ike were derived from post-storm reconstruction analysis via NOAA's Hurricane Research Division Wind Analysis System (H*Wind) (Powell et al. 1998;Hope et al. 2013).  TCs can take on a wide variety of parameters, including variations in landfall location, wind intensity, storm size, forward speed, and angle of approach. Studies to date have shown that storm landfall location, wind intensity, and size have the strongest influence on a storm's peak surge and volumetric surge response (Irish et al. 2008;Rego et al. 2009;. While forward speed and angle generally have a relatively minor influence on a storm's peak surge response, the forward speed of a storm can impact the duration of a storm over a body of water and thus the time-variable surge dynamics analyzed in this study. Thus, while this study focuses on general trends in coastal storm surge dynamics by focusing on the main factors that influence storm surge (landfall, wind speed, storm size), a brief sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate how forward speed can impact the volume of surge that flows across Galveston Bay's coastline, and subsequent surge levels and inundation throughout the Houston-Galveston region. The analysis representing sensitivity to forward speed can be referenced in Appendix C. For each storm simulated, the net volume of water or storm surge that flowed across the entirety of the bay's coastline as well as its individual coastline sections (T1, T2, B1, B2, and B3 in Fig. 4-1) was calculated. Figure 4-4 provides a schematic of the method used to determine the volume of surge across the bathymetry/topography of a given coastline section. First, as shown in Fig. 4-4a, flow at a given point in time was determined by splitting a given coastal section into discrete points, and multiplying the bathymetry, water surface elevation, and unit normal velocity of storm surge simulated using ADCIRC+SWAN at each point using the trapezoid rule as shown in Equation 4-1: where Q is the flow or flux across a given coastal stretch of interest, \u2206 is the distance between two points along a given coastal transect, 0 to n represent the points along the transect, y represents the depth of water which is equivalent to the water surface elevation minus the bathymetry, and * \u20d1 represents the unit normal velocity relative to the transect. This calculation was performed at each hour throughout a given TC simulation to obtain flow throughout an event ( Fig.   4-4b). Then, the volume or net flow into the bay was determined by simply summing flows into Galveston Bay for each hour and multiplying by the duration of the event, which approximates the integral of positive flows: This analysis was performed to further the current understanding of storm surge dynamics across the bay's coastline, and to provide insight for surge mitigation designs that could most effectively reduce surge impacts to the Houston-Galveston region. Analysis for the 80 storms in Table 4-1 was performed for baseline or existing conditions that did not take into account erosion or breaching of barrier islands.   (Doran et al., 2009;Rego and Li, 2010) was utilized to guide the modification of baseline barrier island conditions along Galveston Bay's coastline. After Ike (2008), elevations on B3 were reduced to 25% of their original height, except for a roughly 500 m wide strip behind peak dune elevations, where elevations increased by 0.3 m (Rego and Li, 2010). West Galveston Island (B1) experienced a similar reduction of its peak dune elevations to 25% of their original height during this event, with less extensive erosion across the entire barrier island since right-hand side winds fell to the right of B1 (Doran et al. 2009). To represent a severe, but possible erosion scenario based on post-Ike conditions, the elevation of both barrier islands was reduced to 25% of their original height and a 0.3 m increase was introduced for a 350 m wide strip behind the peak dune elevations of each respective barrier island (Fig. 4-5 (Fig. 4-6).  In the ADCIRC+SWAN simulations, the primary surge forcing mechanisms, including direct wind stress, barotropic water level adjustments, and wave radiation stress were accounted for; however, oscillating astronomical tides were not included to avoid random variations in the surge response of the TCs. A semi-implicit numerical scheme with a 1 second time-step was used in the model setup. The sector based wind-drag coefficient relationship was used as in the Ike (2008) validation study by Hope et al. (2013) and described in  and . Simulations were performed using the Stampede Linux cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas using 1200 cores with roughly a 1-hour wall-clock time per simulation of baseline conditions.  Peak surge levels and their sensitivity to different TC characteristics provide useful insight;\nIn this chapter, local surge as well as different surge mitigation strategies were evaluated. To evaluate local surge, the ADCIRC+SWAN mesh was reduced to isolate Galveston Bay from coastal surge influences and evaluate the amount of local surge that could develop within the bay itself. The boundary of this reduced mesh is defined along the bay's coastline and then cuts inland at the ends of the bay's coastline (referred to as \"idealized Coastal Barrier\"). By isolating the bay and defining the edge of the mesh as a no-flow boundary condition, this mesh configuration resulted in conditions analogous to that if the bay were protected by a solid coastal barrier of an infinite height (i.e. no influence from coastal surge). Defining the mesh in this manner, allowed for an evaluation of reductions, as well as remaining local surge after the introduction of an idealized coastal barrier. A suite of 7 storms were simulated against this idealized coastal barrier. Five of these storms (storms 3a to 3e in Table 4-1) were simulated at landfall B to characterize the range of local surge levels produced within the bay for varying wind intensities. Storm 3e was additionally evaluated at locations C and D to evaluate what levels of local surge could develop in different parts of Galveston Bay for an extreme TC. This purpose of this study was to demonstrate the potential need for in-bay defenses even after preventing coastal surge from flowing from the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay, rather than providing an extensive characterization similar to that performed for coastal surge in Chapter 4. In response to the regions vulnerability to local surge highlighted in the results section of this chapter, the SSPEED Center developed promising multiple lines of defense surge mitigation strategies for the Houston-Galveston region (Fig. 5-2b and Fig. 5-2c). The ADCIRC mesh representing baseline or existing conditions in the Houston-Galveston region was modified to reflect these surge mitigation strategies using the Aquaveo Surface Modeling System (SMS) software. While ADCIRC solves the 2D shallow water equations, flow across these levees / flood gates is represented with the weir equation. In a SPEED Center report (2015), the residential and industrial damage reductions provided by these strategies were evaluated against Hurricane Ike with a 15% increase in its wind speeds, with landfall at a worst case location (referred to as \"Ike+15%, p7\") (Sebastian et al. 2014). In this study, these strategies are additionally evaluated against different proxy storms under current and future sea level conditions.   storms 3a to 3e in Table 4-1). As TCs approached landfall and moved inland, wind fetch began to act across the bay's extensive horizontal (east to west) and then vertical (south to north) extent, resulting in an increasing gradient of peak surge levels from the southeastern to northwestern portion of the bay (Fig. 5-3 Fig. 5-3), was additionally simulated at landfalls C and D to highlight the different areas within the bay vulnerable to local surge due to TC landfalls west of (B), directly at (C), and just east (D) of the bay. Figure 5-4 compares the maximum surge levels that develop for baseline (existing) conditions versus the idealized coastal barrier for these storms.  The peak surge impacts are fairly uniform across the bay for each respective landfall location under baseline conditions, with decreasing impacts to the bay as TC landfall shifts to the east. However, for the idealized coastal barrier condition, sharp gradients in local surge levels resulted ( Fig. 5-4) due to wind-fetch across the bay's shallow, smaller volume of water without coastal surge influences. For a direct hit (landfall C), northeasterly winds initially acted over the bay and became southwesterly as the TC moved across the bay. As observed for Hurricane Ike (Rego and Li, 2010;Sebastian et al., 2014), a sloshing effect caused a reverse in direction of local surge as the TC moved across the bay, with water initially being \"pushed\" from the northeast to the southwest, and then pushed back to the northeast from the opposite direction. Maximum local surge levels for landfall C were relatively low, with 2.75 m in both the southwest and northeast portions of the bay as compared to peak local surge levels as high as 5 m for landfall B. The lower local surge produced for landfall C was due to variations in wind direction, which did not allow for sustained winds to act towards a single portion of the bay, as well as the weaker winds of the eye of the TC crossing directly over the bay.\nIn this study several models were loosely coupled (Figure 6-3) to represent joint flooding of the full range of TC characteristics that could impact the SE Houston study area. The 223 synthetic wind-and pressure-fields developed for FEMAs north Texas Flood Insurance Study (FEMA and USACE, 2011) were used as a forcing for the coupled modeling framework. These TCs have a 2-km resolution across the majority of the Gulf of Mexico and corresponding inland areas, and represent the full range of TC storm characteristics that could develop and impact the north Texas coast, which includes the SE Houston study area (Figure 6-4). As shown in Fig. 6-4  Input TC characteristics and their corresponding peak inundation levels obtained from the coupled numerical models were stored as input/output training features to develop a surrogate model based on ANN and kriging supervised machine learning approaches (discussed in Section 6.3.2). In addition to joint flooding, a surrogate model of only storm surge was developed for comparison against previous studies and to demonstrate increases in flooding due to rainfallrunoff. Since the surrogate models are trained on the full range of TC characteristics that could impact the study area, they could be used to allow for predictions of peak inundation levels given any new set of TC characteristics. However, while the suite of storms encompass the full range of TCs that could impact the study area they do not include weak tropical storms with winds less than 29.8 m/s which can take on winding paths such as Tropical Storm Allison (2001) or Tropical Storm Harvey (2017)."}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Since historical data limitations do not allow for a thorough assessment of the fidelity of the IKE (as well as other surge indices), the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) and Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model (referred to as \"ADCIRC+SWAN\") was used in this study to assess the performance of the surge indices in Table 3-1. Furthermore, utilizing hydrodynamic models allowed for standardization of parameters such as landfall location and forward speed in order to permit a more systematic review of the surge indices. A suite of synthetic TC's as well as historical Hurricane Ike 2008, which has reliable spatial wind field data, were used to assess the performance of the IKE compared to the SSHS, the HSI, and the SS. Surge index values were determined based on gridded TC wind fields with 2-km resolution, and bathymetric data for the SS. The IKE was calculated for wind intensities greater than tropical storm (IKETS) and hurricane (IKEH) wind speeds from the gridded wind fields, with results primarily presented for the IKETS owing to its stronger correlation to storm surge as discussed in the results section. The performance of the four different surge indices (SSHS, IKE, HSI, and SS) were assessed against three surge response metrics: i) peak surge height (m) along the coast, ii) volume of surge propagation across the coastline (km 3 ), and iii) alongshore length (km) of surge above 2.5 m (8.4 ft.) (referred to as \"L2.5\"). These metrics were chosen in order to assess what surge index provides the best performance in capturing not only a local peak surge, but also regional surge impacts.\nFigures 3-3 to 3-5 compare the performance of the surge indices evaluated in this study.

FEMAs synthetic storms were developed with the coupled hurricane vortex-planetary boundary layer (PBL) model (Thompson and Cardone 1996), which is outlined in detail in section 2.3.2. Using the synthetic storm generator program outlined in Appendix A, these FEMA wind fields and their corresponding pressure files were scaled and/or shifted to different landfall locations in order to standardize landfall locations and develop a storm set representative of nearly the full range of possible TC sizes and intensities, and thus IKE factors, that could impact the study region. The synthetic storms used in this study were grouped into three characteristic storm sets: 1) storms with different IKE values, but the same angle, landfall, and forward speed, 2) storms with different IKE values, different landfalls, but the same forward speed and angle, and 3) storms with different IKE values, different angles and/or different forward speeds, but the same landfall.     continuous-Galerkin version of ADCIRC is a shallow-water model that utilizes an unstructured triangular mesh to solve for unsteady water levels and currents by solving respectively the generalized wave continuity equation and vertically-integrated momentum equations (Luettich and Westerink 2004;Westerink et al. 2008). SWAN was developed at TU-Delft to simulate gravity surface wind generated waves by solving the action balance equation (Booij et al. 1999) and has been tightly coupled with ADCIRC, as described by . The tightly coupled model simultaneously solves for water levels, currents, and wave action to represent the evolution of storm surge and waves from their initial oceanic development to their generation, propagation, and dissipation at the coast and within complicated nearshore systems including estuaries, tributaries and floodplains. In this study, the primary surge forcing mechanisms, including direct wind stress, wave radiation stress, and barotropic water level adjustments were accounted for; however, to avoid random fluctuations in the performance of the surge indices and to reduce computational requirements for each run, contributions to storm surge resulting from oscillating astronomical tides were not included.

To provide a comprehensive representation of a storm's regional impacts, from a hydraulic perspective, the following section describes the volume of storm surge that enters Galveston Bay via its coastline, which can have a strong relationship to resulting surge levels within the Bay and inundation throughout the surrounding Houston-Galveston region.   . However, as compared to peak surge which can vary significantly throughout the bay for a given storm, the volume of surge entering the bay is useful owing to its ability to represent regional surge impacts from a hydraulic perspective. As shown in Fig. 4-11a, the volume of surge across the bay's coastline has a nearly direct relationship to the inland area inundated along and behind the bay's coastline (including the bay's barrier islands and the greater Houston-Galveston region within the bounded area of Fig. 4-11b). Based on the simulated results, dimensional analysis was performed to allow for the evaluation of the inundated area expected from any TC intensity and size of interest for the landfall locations considered in this study (included in Appendix B). Note, while sensitivity analysis discussed in Appendix C suggests that the volume of positive flow into the bay does not vary significantly for storms with varying forward speeds, the resulting inundated area throughout the Houston-Galveston region can increase significantly for slower storms due to increased residence time over the bay.  As expected, increasing storm intensity and size resulted in greater surge volumes to flow across the bay's coastline (Fig. 4-10). However, contrary to peak surge, which was shown to fluctuate in its sensitivity to the range of storm intensities (Vmax) and sizes Rmax .5-to 7.5-fold increase in the volume of surge across the bay's coastline for landfall A, a 4.5-to 5.5-fold increase for landfall B, a 3.5-to 4.5-fold increase for landfall C, and a 3-to 4-fold increase for landfall D. This sensitivity analysis provides useful insight regarding a given storms volumetric surge response and subsequent potential for regional surge impacts (i.e. inundated area) as compared to peak surge. Figure 4-12 demonstrates the relationship between the volume of surge that enters the bay and peak surge levels at a central (Ctr) point location within the bay (reference Fig. 4-7). Since surge levels vary throughout the bay, this only provides a general indication of increases in water levels within the bay due to increases in the volume of water entering the bay; however, such analysis is useful for understanding the relative influence of coastal surge on peak surge levels. Under normal conditions, the bay contains roughly 4.5 cubic kilometers of water. A doubling of this volume of water results in a ~3 m increase in water levels, a 3x increase in volume results in a ~5 m increase, and a 4x increase in volume results in a ~6.5 m increase. Unlike the direct, linear relationship between volume of surge and inundated area shown in Fig. 4-11a, this demonstrates that increases in the volume of surge results in a quadratic increase in peak surge levels that eventually begins to level out for larger, more intense storms.  \n\n"}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Surge Indices against Peak Surge", "text": "As shown in Figure 3-3a, the SSHS had a weak correlation with peak surge (R 2 of 0.57). Predicted peak surge values vary as much as 2.5 meters for category 1 storms to 5.0 meters for category 5 storms. The weak correlation of the SSHS index to peak surge was expected since it relies on a single maximum wind intensity value and does not account for a storm's size. Of all the surge indices evaluated, the SS had the weakest correlation to peak surge, with an R 2 of 0.54 (Figure 3-3d). The weak correlation of the SS is due to the sensitivity of the index to the L30 parameter in addition to the SS's disregard of storm size information for larger storms. I found that the R 2 of the SS improves to 0.61 when L30 values were measured from 60 kilometers east of a TC's landfall to the offshore 30-meter depth contour. This is due to the continental shelf slope's more direct influence on the surge response of a TC along its right side (in the northern hemisphere) where winds are more intense and peak surge typically develops. I additionally found that when using a single, regional average of the offshore bathymetry, the SS correlation with peak surge improved even more, with an R 2 value of 0.68. This suggests that the regional offshore bathymetry of a given region can serve as a preferential indicator of a storm's surge response in order to avoid over-sensitivity to the L30 parameter. Despite the improved performance of the SS with my modified L30 parameters, the SS still had a weaker correlation to peak surge than the IKETS and HSI. This is primarily due to the SS's disregard of storm size information for larger storms. A significant number of storms in this study, with similar intensities (\uf044P), but different sizes (R33), resulted in the same SS value for a given landfall location (e.g. storm ID's 2c-4c, 2d-4d and 2e-4e in Table 3-2). The IKETS had a strong correlation to peak surge, with an R 2 of 0.83; however, issues were noted for small and intense storms (e.g. storm ID's 1e to 1g labeled in Figure 3-3). This issue occurs because the IKETS incorporates winds between hurricane and tropical storm intensities that have a small impact on the peak surge response for small, but intense storms. While the IKEH performed better in characterizing the peak surge response of these small, intense storms, it performed slightly less accurately for the entire storm set as compared to the IKETS. Finally, of all the surge indices evaluated, the HSI provided the strongest correlation to peak surge values, with an R 2 of 0.90 (Figure 3-3c). I believe that the HSI performs well in capturing the peak surge response since Vmax is typically observed near the location where a TC's peak surge develops and because the R33 parameter, which represents the distance from the eye of a TC to hurricane intensity winds (33 m/s), performs fairly well in approximating a storms size that influences the peak surge response. However, it is worth noting that the IKETS had a stronger correlation to peak surge (R 2 of 0.96) than the HSI (R 2 of 0.90) when small, intense storms (storm ID's 1d-1g) were removed from the dataset."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Surge Indices against Regional Surge Metrics", "text": "While estimations of a TC's peak surge are useful for a localized area, an index that captures a TC's regional surge impacts can also be of beneficial use. As such, this section discusses the performance of the different surge indices in capturing two regional surge response metrics: i) the volume of surge (km 3 ) that propagates across the coastline (Figure 3-4) and ii) the alongshore length (km) of surge above 2.5 m (L2.5) (Figure 3-5). The SSHS had a weak correlation to the volume of surge across the coastline and L2.5, with an R 2 of 0.29 and 0.25, respectively (Figures 3-4a and 3-5a). This was expected since the SSHS is dependent on a single maximum wind speed value of a TC and does not incorporate storm size information. The SS had a weak correlation to the regional surge metrics as well, with an R 2 of 0.27 and 0.26 as shown in Figures 3-4d and 3-5d, respectively. When a single, regional bathymetric parameter was employed the R 2 of the SS improved to 0.38 and 0.40 for the two regional surge metrics (not shown in figure). Despite this improvement, the index still had a weak correlation to the regional surge metrics evaluated, largely due to its disregard of storm size for larger TC's. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the SS was derived with the intention to indicate a TC's peak surge rather than its regional surge impacts (Irish and Resio 2010). The HSI had a fairly strong correlation to the volume of surge across the coastline and L2.5, with an R 2 of 0.78 and 0.66, respectively (Figures 3-4c and 3-5c). This suggest that the R33 parameter can serve as a good approximation of the storm size of a TC that influences regional surge impacts. However, significant scatter is observed in the HSI's ability to capture the regional surge response of various storms. Of all the surge indices, the IKETS had the strongest correlation to the regional surge metrics evaluated, with an R 2 of 0.91 and 0.85 as shown in Figures 3-4b and   3-5b, respectively. These results reflect the IKETS' ability to capture a TC's integrated wind field as compared to indices that utilize single parameter values to approximate a TC's intensity and size. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "By providing a detailed numerical comparison and evaluation of the traditional SSHS versus more recent, alternative surge indices, this study provides a reference that can be used to select and appropriately use a more accurate descriptor of a TC's potential storm surge impacts as compared to the SSHS. In summary, this study found that the Saffir-Simpson categories and the Surge Scale have a weak correlation to local and regional surge metrics, the HSI provides the best indication of a storm's peak surge, and the IKETS serves as the best indicator of a TC's regional surge impacts. When considering all surge metrics, the IKETS provides the while the best overall performance for representing a TCs potential surge (ref. Fig. 3-6). Whether or not the public would benefit more from a surge index that indicates a local peak surge alone or additionally provides an indication of regional surge impacts will have to be decided by appropriate agencies responsible for public advisories during such events (i.e. the National Hurricane Center). Once a surge index is selected it can easily be normalized to a familiar 0 to 5 scale like the traditional SSHS to ensure a smooth transition to a new surge index. The implementation of the IKETS or HSI using a familiar scale could significantly improve coastal populations' risk perception and ensure the accurate communication of potential storm surge impacts. However, such indices should never replace numerical storm surge forecasts that can be made by hydrodynamic models such as Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) (i.e. Glahn et al. 2009) or ADCIRC+SWAN (i.e. Dresback et al. 2013), but rather serve as an additional resource to communicate the potential storm surge impacts of a TC, particularly for those without access to graphical forecasting products. This study additionally found that if the IKETS or HSI surge indices were to incorporate bathymetric information, a regional representation of offshore bathymetry should be used rather than a local representation like the L30 term. Also, I suggest supplementing this study with observed data, especially as NHC operational forecast and predicted 2d spatial wind fields continue to improve and more spatial wind field data becomes available in subsequent hurricane seasons. Finally, although the surge indices evaluated in this study can represent that larger, more intense storms will result in greater impacts to a bay, different bay coastlines can be made-up of unique combinations of tidal inlets and barrier islands that can alter the influence of a storms impacts (i.e. Ca\u00f1izares and Irish 2008;Grzegorzewski et al. 2011). It is suggested that these environments receive site-specific analysis and more detailed forecasting products as compared to a coastal surge index. \nThis study provides the first characterization of the relative amounts of surge that can flow across a bay's coastline for a range of TC sizes and intensities. This analysis was performed for Galveston Bay, which has a complex coastline made up of tidal inlets, barrier islands, and an existing seawall. In addition to evaluating surge dynamics for baseline conditions, a severe erosion scenario representative of post-hurricane barrier island conditions and sea level rise for the years 2050 and 2100 were studied (ref. Fig. 4-6 for scenarios evaluated). This numerical evaluation provides a technical perspective of coastal storm surge dynamics that has not fully been explored before for baseline conditions and the additional erosion and sea level scenarios evaluated. Given the direct relationship between coastal surge or the volume of surge that flows across Galveston Bay's coastline and subsequent inland inundation (ref. Fig. 4-11) practical results from this research can aid in understanding regional storm surge impacts and help guide surge mitigation strategies in the study region. In this study various technical and practical questions were elucidated by evaluating relative amounts of surge that can flow across a bay's coastline for a range of TC sizes and intensities. For example, storm size (Rmax) was shown to have a greater influence on a TC's volumetric surge that enters Galveston Bay as compared to wind intensity (Vmax). In addition, for varying landfall locations, storm sizes, and storm intensities, the volume of surge across Galveston Bay's coastline was shown to have a nearly direct correlation to the extent of inland areas inundated behind the bay's coastline (ref. Fig. 4-11). Such information can be useful for describing a given storm's regional impacts from a hydraulic perspective, and served as the basis or motivation for analyzing the relative volume of surge across the bay's different coastline sections. Analysis of the relative volume of surge across Galveston Bay's different coastline sections provided insight that can help guide surge mitigation designs that have a reduced structural footprint, and thus lower costs and environmental impact. Specifically, for Galveston Bay, minor amounts of surge were found to enter the bay via T1, suggesting that a flood gate across this tidal inlet, which allows for fresh/salt-water exchange necessary for the health of the bay, is likely unnecessary. On the other hand, the majority of surge was found to flow across T2 and B3, indicating that surge defenses across these sections could achieve nearly the same surge reductions as a uniform coastal barrier across the bay's entire coastline (ref. Fig. 4-16). Analysis for the erosion scenario and future sea level conditions suggest that the majority of surge will continue to flow across these two coastline sections (T2 and B3), with a relative increase (decrease) in importance for B2 (T2) under the additional scenarios evaluated (ref. Fig. 4-20). This study also found a transition at which a greater amount of surge began to flow across Galveston Bay's barrier islands as compared to its tidal inlets (ref. Fig. 4-15). While the exact storm intensity and size necessary to reach this transition may be unique to Galveston Bay, other bay environments may exhibit this transition as well, which could be determined using similar analysis to that performed in this study. Also, while this transition may occur for extreme storms under baseline conditions, possible erosion of barrier islands and sea level rise can significantly reduce the storm size and intensity threshold required for this transition (ref. Fig. 4-21). This finding has important implications for whether stakeholders in a given bay environment may be more invested in protecting against small, weak storms where surge across tidal inlets dominate or large, intense storms where surge across barrier islands can become relatively more important. Where and to what height protection across tidal inlets versus barrier islands is provided can ultimately dictate whether, for example, 100-or 500-yr surge levels are protected against. Such information is crucial for bay environments considering surge mitigation designs, and cannot be obtained from FEMA's peak frequency levels, which are typically uniform along a given coastal stretch, such as a bay's coastline (FEMA, 2011). The methodologies used to understand coastal surge dynamics in this study can be applied to other bay and estuary environments. This is particularly recommended for bays or estuaries considering surge mitigation strategies such as New York Harbor (Aerts et al. 2014) \nThis study evaluated the levels of local surge that could develop within Galveston Bay. Analysis demonstrated that while an idealized coastal barrier could provide significant reductions in the height and extent of surge impacts to the Houston-Galveston region, local surge, as high as 5 m, could still develop in different portions of the bay for very intense TCs (ref. Figs. 5-3 and 5-4). This finding suggests that multiple lines of defense, with surge protection across the bay's coastline as well as within the interior of the bay, may be required to achieve satisfactory surge protection for the region. Other bay environments may similarly require \"multiple lines of defense\" depending on their respective wind-fetch across the bays, bathymetry and inland topography, and TC climatology. Based on the Houston-Galveston regions vulnerability to local surge, multiple lines of defense surge mitigation strategies were subsequently evaluated against a range of return period or \"proxy\" storms in addition to a 2050 sea level condition. Results from this hydrodynamic analysis showed that the mid-bay strategy provides the greatest reductions in return period flood levels for critical residential (clear lake) and industrial (Houston Ship Channel) areas of the Houston-Galveston region. Given the promising hydrodynamic performance of the MBS, different construction phases and levee heights were subsequently evaluated in detail (ref. Torres et al. 2017). Future research should incorporate cost-benefit information into analysis of varying levee heights to determine an economically optimal surge mitigation strategy for the Houston-Galveston region. A cost-benefit analysis based on economic optimization can provide a logical design as compared to designing surge mitigation strategies to a rule-of-thumb 100-yr surge level such as that typically performed by FEMA and the USACE (Jonkman et al. 2009). Figure 5-7 demonstrates a hypothetical economic optimization for a single levee, where an optimal levee height is defined by the minimum total cost; total cost is defined by the sum of investment in the levee and total residential and industrial damage for a given levee height (Van Dantzig 1956). This approach makes sense as compared to a rule of thumb 100-yr design level since an optimized levee height may require a lower total cost to protect against 1,000 year water levels as compared to a design to protect against 100-yr water levels.   \nThe main contribution of this study is the development of a new methodology for representing joint flooding at the watershed-scale, which includes rainfall-runoff, storm surge, and their interactions. The methodology is made up of two components, a coupled numerical modeling framework and a surrogate model that is trained based on the results of the coupled numerical models. This section discusses potential improvements that could be made to the coupled numerical models that were utilized, and final conclusions. Of all the numerical models utilized in this study, the rainfall model had the greatest uncertainty based on its validation against Hurricane Ike. While the MSR model may be able to capture broad-scale TC rainfall and its asymmetric redistribution, it cannot represent several additional rainfall processes, including convection within the eyewall of a TC or mesoscale rainfall bands. While the most appropriate TC rainfall model was chosen at the time of the study, a subsequent study should provide a review of existing statistical and physics-based rainfall models against historical observations to determine the accuracy and biases of each rainfall model. Such analysis will require a fairly extensive effort, including the collection of TC characteristics and windfields required for each rainfall model, implementing the algorithms associated with each model, and finally comparing results to spatial statistics of observed TC rainfall events. Based on such analysis, the most reliable rainfall model should then be used within the methodology proposed in this study. In addition, this study utilized FEMA models for representing TC rainfall-runoff and its interactions with storm surge. These models were utilized to allow for a more direct comparison of joint flood frequency levels against FEMAs current flood insurance practices that do not consider joint flood hazards. However, future work may consider using a fully-distributed hydrologic model, rather than a lumped hydrologic model, as well as a hydraulic model that represents 2D conditions across floodplain areas rather than the 1D hydraulic model utilized in this study. Such modifications would likely allow for a more accurate representation of flow direction and resulting inundation levels. Finally, future work should evaluate several study areas with a range of watershed and climate characteristics to highlight what conditions lead to increased vulnerability to increases in flooding due to the interaction between rainfall-runoff and storm surge. In addition, future work should evaluate TC rainfall-runoff versus storm surge flooding at a regional scale and their resulting damages to provide insight regarding the relative severity of these two sources of flooding. Such analysis will require analyzing the decomposed contributions from rainfall-runoff versus storm surge as well the their combined flood interactions. Finally, given increasing ocean and atmospheric temperatures, which can exacerbate the storm surge and rainfall response of TCs, analysis of joint flooding will only continue to become more important to evaluate under future conditions. In this study, a surrogate model was developed that is capable of rapidly representing peak inundation due to the joint occurrence and interaction between rainfall-runoff and storm surge from TCs. The surrogate model was used to expand upon the Joint Probability Method (JPM) by representing joint TC flood frequency levels, which is not currently represented in flood insurance studies performed by FEMA. The surrogate model requires basic landfall TC characteristics to approximate peak joint flood levels from a TC. Given the high-fidelity representation of storm surge, which requires a 1 to 2 hour run time on 1000s of computer cores for a single storm, and the coupling of the storm surge response with additional numerical models to represent distributed rainfall-runoff conditions, this surrogate modeling approach provides a rapid methodology for performing joint flood frequency analysis at the watershed-scale. While the study area evaluated experiences extreme rainfall events that are not associated with TCs, other climates where extreme rainfall events are primarily driven by TC rainfall may experience greater increases in flood frequency levels under a probabilistic joint flood frequency analysis such as that performed in this study. Although this study was performed for coastal watersheds in SE Houston, TX, the models and data required for this analysis intentionally built upon open-source resources FEMA utilizes for its inland and coastal flood frequency analysis. This allows for the methodology utilized in this study to easily be applied to other coastal areas in the U.S. that are interested in their joint TC flood risk, rather than solely storm surge. The methodology utilized in this study can additionally be applied to any coastal area in the world, albeit may require additional data collection and model development. Such analysis is highly recommended for densely urbanized, coastal watersheds vulnerable to TC flooding like the study area evaluated."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Ike (2008) Revisited", "text": "This study found that 6.57 km 3 of surge flowed across Galveston Bay's shoreline during Hurricane Ike (2008), which made a direct hit at Galveston Bay (same location as landfall C in Figure 4-3a). Of this total volume, 4.6% flowed across T1 (San Luis Pass), 0% across B1 (West Galveston Island) and B2 (the Seawall), 66.2% across T2 (Bolivar Roads), and 29.2% across B3 (Bolivar Peninsula). Sebastian et al. (2014) found that the volume of water within Galveston Bay effectively doubled owing to the contribution of surge propagation across T2 (Bolivar Roads) (Sebastian et al. 2014). However, by expanding analysis in this study to include all of Galveston Bay's different coastline sections, this study found that the volume of water entering the Bay nearly tripled due to the additional surge across B3 (Bolivar Peninsula). It is worth noting that results demonstrate no overtopping occurred at the Seawall, which stands at 5.2 m (17 ft.); however, during Hurricane Ike significant flooding occurred behind the Seawall of Galveston Island. This finding confirms that the flooding that occurred behind the Seawall during Hurricane Ike was due to wind fetch acting across the bay that pushed water onto the backside of Galveston Island, rather than overtopping of the Seawall itself. This \"local surge\" component of hurricanes is further evaluated in Chapter 5. Characteristics of Hurricane Ike's (2008) coastal surge demonstrate the complexities involved in predicting the volume and relative amounts of surge that can propagate across a bay's shoreline for a given TC. To understand and put these surge dynamics into perspective beyond a single historical hurricane, the following section discusses the relative amounts of coastal surge that occur across the Bay's shoreline due to nearly the full domain of TC intensities and sizes that could impact the study region.  For landfall locations A and B, trends in the relative volume of surge across the tidal inlets and barrier islands were non-linear, and generally approached asymptotic limits (Fig. 4-14). For example, relative contributions across the barrier islands are initially flat for the smallest, weakest storms, then exponentially increase as storm size and intensity increased, and then begin to flatten out for the largest, most intense storms. The asymptotic behavior in the surge response for the small, weaker storms was expected since the storm surge was required to reach a minimum height to crest the barrier islands. Once crested, increases in storm size and intensity, resulted in nonlinear, nearly exponential increases in the volume of surge across the barrier islands. Finally, the relative volume of surge across the barrier islands began to reach an asymptotic upper limit, which is likely due to a limit or upper bound on the amount of surge that can develop along the shallow continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico for the larger storms (Irish and Resio, 2010). As illustrated in Fig. 4-15, a storm size and intensity threshold was reached for landfall locations A, B, and C that led to a transition in the majority of flow occurring across tidal inlets to barrier islands. As discussed in Section 4.4.4, these results are non-conservative, and this transition point could occur at a lower threshold due to erosion of barrier islands. These findings provide insight for understanding complex surge dynamics and their impacts to Galveston Bay, where volume of surge across tidal inlets may dominate for small, weak storms, whereas the volume of surge across barrier islands can become relatively more important for larger, more intense storms. The relative volume of surge across components other than T2 and B3 were fairly small. of the storms and landfall locations evaluated, the majority of surge, ranging from 40 to 92%, flowed across T2 because of its large cross-sectional area without obstructions (i.e. roadways)."}, {"section_title": "Relative Volume of Surge across Different Coastline Sections", "text": "However, as storm size and intensity increased, the volume of surge across T2 became nearly equivalent to B3 for the most intense and largest storms making landfall at locations B and C. In contrast to T2, the relative volume of surge across T1 only reached a maximum of 8% likely due to this tidal inlets small width and shallow bathymetry. The relative volume of surge across B2 only reached a maximum of 5% owing to the small amounts of surge that crest the 5.2 m height of the seawall barrier. Relative volume of surge across B1 were generally small; however, for the larger and more intense storms at landfall A, the volume of surge across this section became significant, with a maximum relative contribution of 22.5%. Lessons learned from this analysis can help guide surge mitigation strategies that have a reduced structural footprint, and thus less environmental impact Specifically, for Galveston Bay, minor volumes of surge were found to enter the bay via T1, suggesting that a flood gate across this tidal inlet, which allows for fresh/salt-water exchange necessary for the health of the bay, is likely unnecessary. On the other hand, the majority of flow was found to occur across T2 and B3, suggesting that surge defenses across these sections could achieve nearly the same surge reductions as a uniform coastal barrier across the entirety of the bay's coastline. As a proof-of-concept, storm 3c was simulated at landfall B against baseline (existing) conditions, a scenario with barriers introduced along T2 and B3, and a scenario with a fully enclosing barrier along the bay's coastline (Fig. 4-17). Storm 3c has a moderate Rmax of 41.3 km and a Vmax of 53.6 m/s, which, when compared to FEMAs preliminary flood insurance maps, results in approximately 250-yr stillwater levels throughout the Houston-Galveston region (FEMA, 2011). Levees along T2 and B3 and the fully enclosing barrier were set at a 15 m height to avoid any overtopping. While west Galveston Island (B1) would be inundated for the condition with barriers along T2 and B3, the extent of inundation and surge levels throughout the remainder of the Houston-Galveston region were nearly equivalent to the fully enclosing barrier which includes additional defenses across T1, B1, and B2. "}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity to Erosion and Sea Level Rise", "text": "This section discusses results for the three scenarios outlined in Table 4-2, which include i) severe erosion to Galveston Bay's barrier islands (B1 and B3), ii) projected sea level conditions for the year 2050, and iii) projected sea level conditions for the year 2100. The subset of storms evaluated, which include the weakest, smallest storm (1a), an intermediate storm (3c), and the largest, strongest storm (4e) from the suite of storms evaluated for baseline conditions provide an indication of potential variations in surge dynamics for these different scenarios relative to baseline conditions. Discussion of coastal and in-bay storm surge dynamics is provided for landfall location B, which results in the most severe storm surge response along the bay's coastline and throughout the Houston-Galveston region for baseline conditions; however, additional simulations at landfall locations A, C, and D showed similar trends to the findings discussed in this section. Details regarding the erosion and sea level conditions can be referenced in the methodology section and Fig. 4-5 and Fig.4-6. Figure 4-18a shows variations in the volume of surge that flows across Galveston Bay's coastline for the different scenarios and corresponding percent increases in volume, peak surge at a north point location (ref. Fig. 4-7), and inundation area of the Houston-Galveston region. Negligible differences in the volume of surge across Galveston Bay's coastline as well as peak surge (Fig. 4-18c) for the north point location was observed for the erosion scenario compared to baseline conditions. However, for this same erosion scenario, noticeable increases in inundation area (Fig. 4-18d) were observed ranging from 64% for the smallest, weakest storm (1a) to 31% for the intermediate and largest, strongest storm (4e). The primary reason for increases in inundation for the smallest, weakest storms is due to inundation of the barrier islands, which flood more easily for lower surge levels due to peak barrier island elevations of 0.25 to 0.75 m above MSL for the erosion scenario as compared to 1.5 to 3 m above MSL for baseline conditions. For the intermediate storm (3c) and the largest, strongest storm (4e), increases in inundation area may additionally be attributed to increases in the volume of surge across barrier islands as compared to tidal inlets which results in more distributed flow across the bay's entire coastline. As shown in Figure 4-19, under the erosion scenario, the volume of surge across the main tidal inlet (T2) decreases, while the volume of surge across both barrier islands (B1 and B3) increases. This change in coastal surge dynamics suggests that a shift in preferential flow paths occur for the erosion scenario due to the lower-lying barrier islands. This shift in coastal storm surge dynamics can result in differences in the resulting inundation area, hence possibly lead to increases in inland inundation.  Generally, all surge responses, including volume of surge across the bay's coastline, peak surge levels, and inundated area, increase due to increases in sea level. For the year 2050, minor increases ranging from 25% to 3.5% are observed for the volume of surge across Galveston Bay's coastline, while significant increases ranging from 75% to 15% are observed for the year 2100, respectively, for the smallest, weakest to the larger, strongest storm ( Fig. 4-18b). Increases in peak surge levels were found to generally scale linearly with increases in sea level rise. As a result, the same increase for a lower surge level (i.e. caused by a smaller, weaker storm) results in a greater percent increase as compared to a larger, stronger storm ( Fig. 4-18c). This same reasoning holds for the percent increases observed in inundation area due to sea level rise for the smallest, weakest storm (1a) to the largest, strongest storm (4e) ( Fig. 4-18d). (larger, stronger) storms. The results shown in Fig. 4-20, confirm that the majority of flow will continue to occur across T2 and B3, with a relative increase (decrease) in importance for B2 T2under the additional scenarios evaluated. As demonstrated in Fig. 4-21, these results suggests that the volume of surge that flows across barrier islands can be relatively more important for presentday conditions due to erosion that can occur from a direct TC strike and will only become more important in the future. For the three scenarios evaluated, the relative volume of flow across barrier islands, as compared to tidal inlets, will increase from least to greatest for 2050 sea level conditions, the erosion scenario, and 2100 sea level conditions. For the erosion scenario and 2100 sea level conditions, a transition in the majority flow occurring across tidal inlets to barrier islands occurs at or below the storm size and intensity of the intermediate storm (3c) evaluated in this study, which results in 250 year surge levels throughout the study area. These findings indicate that the storm size and intensity threshold required to transition in the majority of flow occurring across tidal inlets to barrier islands reduces significantly when considering possible erosion and 2100 sea level conditions, which should be considered when planning regional surge mitigation.

This is true for all landfall locations and portions within the bay, except for the local surge produced in the southern portion of the bay due to landfall D. For landfall D, sustained northeasterly winds acted across the bay and caused water to accumulate or pile up against the idealized coastal barrier. Along the backside of the existing location of B2, peak local surge levels were shown to be as high as the surge that would develop for the same TC and landfall location under baseline conditions (4.5 m). Nonetheless, this issue would be reduced with operational flood gates that could open to allow for the outflow of surge across the bay's primary tidal inlet, Bolivar Roads (T2), at critical moments along a TC's track."}, {"section_title": "Proxy Storm Analysis of Different Surge Mitigation Strategies", "text": "Given the vulnerability of the Houston-Galveston region to local surge, practical surge mitigation strategies were subsequently evaluated, including the lower-bay and mid-bay strategies that were designed to reduce local surge.

The objective of this study is to develop a methodology for representing probabilistic joint flood forecasts and frequency levels that can easily be applied to any watershed along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coast.

Sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 discuss currently available TC flood forecasting and frequency products, respectively, and how their limitations are addressed in this study.

Forecasts are updated every 6-hours, and for each time-step the NWS has a statistical error associated with their forecasts based on estimated versus observed errors from forecasts made in the previous 5-years (Rappaport et al. 2009). Using this information, TC wind-and pressure-fields can be developed as a forcing for hydrodynamic models to represent storm surge levels expected for a TC. The NWS does not provide flood forecasts of rainfall-runoff flooding associated with a TC. The NWS provides deterministic and probabilistic forecasts of storm surge levels. Deterministic products are based on the high-fidelity ADvanced CIRCulations (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic model (NWS, 2017), which can require simulation times greater than an hour on 1000+ computer cores. While deterministic products are useful given the high-fidelity of ADCIRC, such forecasts can grossly over-or under-estimate the possible impacts of a TC due to the large uncertainty associated with forecasted TC characteristics. As a result, probabilistic forecasts from the NWS represent the likelihood a given surge level will occur based on the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model (NHC and NOAA, 2017b). Given several wind, mesh, and physics-based model simplifications (Glahn et al., 2009), SLOSH allows for thousands of simulations that can represent the uncertainty associated with NWS forecasted TC characteristics; however, SLOSH is less accurate than ADCIRC, particularly in complex environments such as bays, estuaries, and inland areas. For example, a study by Kerr et al. (2013) demonstrated that SLOSH simulations in the Gulf of Mexico with the same wind and pressure forcing as ADCIRC, resulted in peak surge mean absolute errors that were 2 to 3 times greater than ADCIRC. The accuracy of these forecasts are important for several reasons ranging from evacuation decisions to surge mitigation operations. Aside from the NWS, academic research products such as the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS) allows for the simulation of a few alternative TC tracks and characteristics during real-time forecasts (Fleming et al. 2007). In addition, ADCIRC has been coupled with the wave model, Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN), and rainfall-runoff models for deterministic forecasting purposes (Dresback et al. 2013). However, given the computational cost of ADCIRC and SWAN (henceforth referred to as ADCIRC+SWAN), such products are unable to provide probabilistic forecasts that represent the uncertainty associated with NWS forecasted TC characteristics. In addition, rainfall-runoff is coarsely represented in ADCIRC given its representation at 6-hr intervals and the requirement that runoff conditions must be defined at the edge of an ADCIRC mesh, which typically occurs tens to hundreds of kilometers inland. This may be appropriate for high-order riverine systems such as the Mississippi, but can lead to a poor representation of distributed runoff that occurs in many coastal environments."}, {"section_title": "Frequency Overview", "text": "Similar to probabilistic TC forecasts, coastal frequency or return period products such as that provided by the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA, 2017) do not represent the joint occurrence of TC storm surge and rainfall-runoff. FEMA uses the joint probability method (JPM) to represent storm surge frequencies based on TCs that could impact a given area, while inland rainfall-runoff flood frequencies are determined based on a 24-hr design storm derived from historical data. This can result in an under-estimation of the return period depth and extent of coastal floodplains since the joint occurrence of TC rainfall-runoff and storm surge is not considered. In addition, similar to storm surge, rainfall from TC's are likely not sufficiently represented in historical rainfall datasets that include measurements from only a few TC's (Zhu et al. 2013). As compared to forecasting efforts, more attention has recently focused on joint TC storm surge and rainfall frequency analysis; however, this study addresses key limitations not addressed in previous studies and provides a methodology that can be applied along the majority of the U.S Gulf and Atlantic coast. Wahl et al. (2013) evaluated the likelihood of the joint occurrence of storm surge and rainfall by determining the correlation of these two natural hazards at 30 gauge locations along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coast. They demonstrated that in several coastal locations, extreme surge and rainfall events typically occur jointly due to tropical storm events, rather than as discrete events. While insightful, Whal et al. (2013) did not evaluate inland floodplains and their analysis was limited to discrete locations with observational records greater than 30 years. Another study by Zong et al. (2014) evaluated the flood frequency of joint flooding using a hydraulic model with boundary conditions determined from a downstream stage gauge and upstream streamflow gauge with long observational records since 1939 and1901, respectively. In their study, they found slight increases in return period levels due to joint flooding along their study area, the Rotterdam River, Netherlands, as compared to existing practices that treat rainfall-runoff and storm surge as separate events. However, this study was made possible due to long observational records that are rare for other coastal areas and cannot be applied for riverine systems where distributed hydrology must be represented to characterize the flood response. While the previous studies discussed were insightful, both were limited to locations with long observational records. As a result, their methodology can only be extended to a limited number of global locations with sufficiently long periods of both stage and rainfall-runoff records. In addition, statistical analysis, even for areas with long observational records, will be highly sensitive to a small sample of all possible TC's for a given area. These limitations have required that TC flood frequency assessments utilize additional sources of information, such as sedimentary geologic records (i.e. Hippensteel et al., 2013;Woodruff et al. 2015) or, more commonly, the representation of synthetic storms based on a given regions historical or possible TC characteristics (Myers 1975;Ho and Myers 1975). In the JPM, distributions of a regions possible TC characteristics are developed, from which storms are sampled and subsequently simulated in a hydrodynamic model for frequency analysis. Storms can be sampled using a Monte Carlo approach which requires the use of less accurate, but faster hydrodynamic models (i.e. SLOSH, Lin et al. 2010), or by employing Optimal Sampling techniques (Resio et al. 2009;Niedoroda et al. 2010;Toro et al. 2010) that reduce the number of simulations required for surge frequency analysis with high-fidelity hydrodynamic models."}, {"section_title": "Surrogate Modeling for Probabilistic Flood Analysis", "text": "In order to allow for high-fidelity representations of real-time probabilistic storm surge forecasts or frequency levels, researchers have recently investigated the use of surge response functions (SRFs) and other surrogate modeling approaches based on supervised machine learning techniques. Surrogate models are defined as computationally efficient models that are trained to represent the input / output relationship that is typically determined from high-fidelity physicsbased numerical models. For TC storm surge analysis, these surrogate models can rapidly estimate the peak surge expected from a TC based on its landfall characteristics. SRFs were first proposed as a method to allow for the estimation of storm surge levels of a given TCs characteristics in order to aid in FEMA flood frequency analysis (Resio et al. 2009), and later adapted for flood forecasting purposes (Irish et al. 2011). SRFs are developed at point locations with dimensionless functions that capture the relationship between TC landfall characteristics and their peak storm surge response determined from a comprehensive set of high-fidelity TC simulations. However, SRFs are limited to estimates at point locations and have resulted in low levels of accuracy for complex environments such as bays (Irish et al. 2015). Recently, supervised machine learning methods, including artificial neural networks (ANNs) (Hsieh and Ratcliff, 2013;Kim et al. 2015) and kriging Taflanidis 2013, Jia et al. 2016) have been proposed as alternatives to SRFs for forecasting purposes. Hsieh and Ratcliff (2013) developed an ANN for estimating peak surge levels based on ADCIRC simulations coupled with the steady-state spectral wave model (STWAVE). In their study they used 446 TC simulations completed as a part of FEMAs west and east coast Louisiana flood insurance study. However, the ANN developed only allowed for predictions at a few discrete points with test set coefficients of determination based on surrogate model predictions versus simulated peak surge values (R 2 ) ranging from 0.912 to 0.931. Using the same TC dataset as Hsieh and Ratcliff (2013), Jia et al. (2016) demonstrated the most successful supervised machine learning study to date for peak surge predictions by developing a kriging model with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Using leave-one-out cross validation to evaluate the generalization accuracy of their surrogate model, a coefficient of determination of 0.942 was achieved to allow for the prediction of peak surge across a grid of 545,635 nodal ADCIRC locations in the New Orleans area. Both the ANN and kriging+PCA studies utilized 5 TC characteristics to train their surrogate models, including central pressure (Cp), radius to maximum winds (Rmax), angle, forward speed (Vf), and landfall location. The supervised machine learning studies discussed have shown high predictive accuracy owing to their ability to develop complex functions that map the relationship between a TC's landfall characteristics and its peak surge response simulated with high-fidelity hydrodynamic and wave models. Such techniques allow for rapid and accurate predictions of a TC's peak surge; however, to date, overall or joint flooding in coastal watersheds due to rainfall-runoff and its interactions with storm surge have not been incorporated into predictive models capable of rapid simulations for probabilistic analysis. Failing to represent TC associated rainfall-runoff can preclude the representation of upstream flooding in addition to increases in the depth and extent of flooding in areas where rainfall-runoff interacts with storm surge. In this study a surrogate or predictive model is developed based on high-fidelity simulations of storm surge and waves (ADCIRC+SWAN) coupled with inland hydrologic and hydraulic models that represent TC rainfall-runoff and its interactions with storm surge. By employing a supervised machine learning approach based on coupled hydrodynamic and hydrologic modeling results, this study provides the first model capable of providing rapid, probabilistic estimates of joint flooding from TCs. This surrogate model is then utilized to provide rapid estimates of joint flooding for probabilistic flood forecast and frequency purposes, two products that are currently limited to probabilistic representations of only storm surge. The study is performed for coastal watersheds located in southeast (SE) Houston, but the proposed methodology can be applied to other coastal watersheds due to its use of open-source models and data that are available for the majority of the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coast."}, {"section_title": "Loosely Coupled Models", "text": "To represent rainfall-runoff interactions with storm surge, the high-fidelity 2D hydrodynamic ADCIRC+SWAN model was loosely-coupled (ref. Fig. 6-3) with a lumped hydrologic and 1D hydraulic model representative of several watersheds in SE Houston (Clear Creek, Armand Bayou, and Horsepen Bayou). ). In this study, the primary surge forcing mechanisms, including direct wind stress, wave radiation stress, and barotropic water level adjustments were accounted for, and the garret wind drag law was utilized. An overall increase in the initial steric water level of 0.5628 m was applied to represent the average offset between Mean High Water (MHW) and NAVD88 (0.3738 m) in addition to an increase in water levels due to thermal expansion (0.189 m) (FEMA and USACE 2011). A semi-implicit numerical scheme with a 1-s time-step was used in the model setup. The length of time required per hydrodynamic simulation (roughly 1 hour on 1200 cores) highlights the requirement for using a surrogate model to represent a high-fidelity model's flood response for probabilistic analysis. The same wind-and pressure-fields from the suite of 223 storms simulated in ADCIRC+SWAN were additionally utilized to obtain the expected rainfall associated with each TC. The physics based asymmetric Modified Smith for Rainfall (MSR) algorithm developed by Langousis and Veneziano (2009a) was employed to determine rainfall intensity across the study area. This rainfall algorithm was chosen as compared to other statistics based algorithms such as R-Cliper (Lonfat et al. 2004) or R-Phram (Lonfat et al. 2007) due to the physics-basis of the algorithm, its ability to represent variations in rainfall due to variations in storm intensity and size throughout a storms entire wind-field, and because of its promising validation against historical storms compared to R-Cliper (Langousis and Veneziano, 2009a). MSR determines the vertical flux of moisture and resulting surface rainfall rates based on basic thermodynamics that account for the depth-averaged temperature and saturation ratio inside a TC boundary layer and a numerical model for calculating vertical winds in the lower troposphere due to tangential wind convergence at the 10-m height of the TC windfields. However, while able to account for large scale rainfall patterns, MSR (like R-Cliper) does not account for stochastic, small scale variations due to local convection, intense rainfall within the core of a TC, and any rainfall due to downdraft winds or mesoscale features such as spiral bands. Due to the limitations discussed in the previous paragraph, the MSR algorithm may not be suitable for estimating flood levels for a single deterministic event, but given that flood frequency is evaluated over a large suite of probabilistic events, I expect that errors in rainfall estimates will average out across the suite of storms evaluated for frequency analysis in this study. In other words, estimated rainfall may be slightly higher or lower than for a single event, but for a large suite of events these errors will likely average out. This is not an issue for frequency analysis where a large suite of storms with varying characteristics are evaluated; however, for forecasting purposes this can lead to over-or under-estimations of rainfall even if deviations of a storms forecasted characteristics are taken into account since the deviations are with respect to a single storms characteristics. Nonetheless, the probabilistic forecasts provided in this study can still capture the sensitivity of a storms expected flood response due to errors in forecasted storm characteristics, and thus can be utilized as a supplement to deterministic estimates of inundation based on highfidelity numerical weather model forecasts of TC rainfall. This limitation could be better addressed via stochastic rainfall representations for each TC (i.e. Langousis and Veneziano 2009b); however, given the coupled modeling framework such analysis was not computationally feasible. Parameters for the MSR model suggested by Langousis and Veneziano (2009a) were used in this study, including a reference altitude of 3 km, a depth-averaged temperature of 22\uf0b0C, and a saturation ratio of 80%. Rainfall intensities were obtained at 15-min intervals based on the same 2-km resolution, 15-minute time-step windfields used as a forcing for ADCIRC+SWAN. While MSR does not account for topographic impacts on rainfall intensity, such impacts are minor given the study areas elevation near mean sea level (ranges from 0 to 18 m) and shallow slope (0.00045 km / 1 km). Empirically based rainfall models such as R-Cliper and R-PHRaM (Tuleya et al. 2007, Lonfat et al. 2007 were not utilized based on their grouping of storm rainfall intensities according to Category 1-2 and Category 3-5 storms, which can result in a low bias for frequency analysis, and their limited ability to account for spatial variations in storm size and intensity. Rainfall obtained from MSR was used as input for the hydrologic model HEC-HMS and subsequently routed to obtain inundation levels in the 1D unsteady hydraulic model HEC-RAS. The HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS models used in this study were developed as a part of the post   Figure 6-6 demonstrates modeled versus observed results for Hurricane Ike for the entire suite of coupled models utilized in this study. While MSR has accurately been validated against Hurricane Frances (2004) and Katrina (2005) Veneziano, 2009a, 2009b), the validation against Hurricane Ike results in roughly 70% of the actually observed cumulative rainfall averaged across the study area (17.2 cm from MSR versus 24.3 cm observed). Since Hurricane Ike moved directly over the study area, the estimates from MSR are low due to the models limited ability to represent intense eyewall convection. For reference, R-Cliper's estimate of Hurricane Ike rainfall is additionally shown, which is lower than MSR because of its treatment of Hurricane Ike as a storm that results in similar rainfall to a Category 1-2 storm despite it being only 0.447 m/s (1 mph) from a Category 3 storm. As shown in Figure 6-6, MSR's initial rainfall estimate translates into lower estimates of streamflow and stage, as compared to observed, for areas influenced by rainfall-runoff (i.e. Gauges 6 and 8). Nonetheless, given the accuracy of the hydrologic and hydraulic models when evaluated against events with observed rainfall and stage data, the high-fidelity and validation of the hydrodynamic model performed in previous studies, and the expected averaging out of the MSR rainfall estimates for a large set of storms (for frequency analysis), the suite of 223 synthetic storm wind-and pressure-fields were subsequently simulated in the loosely coupled numerical models to serve as training data for a surrogate model. To summarize the hazards associated with the suite of storms, the maximum 12-hr cumulative rainfall averaged across the study area and the peak storm surge at the outlet for each storm, which were determined from MSR and ADCIRC+SWAN, respectively, are shown in Figure 6-7. As expected, a correlation between these two sources of TC flooding is shown, which simply indicates, that for the study area, similar storm characteristics that result in increases in storm surge generally result in increases in rainfall. "}, {"section_title": "Supervised Machine Learning", "text": "As discussed previously, to represent peak inundation levels expected from a given TC several numerical models were utilized in this study, including a high-fidelity hydrodynamic model that requires more than an hour simulation per storm event even with parallel processing on 1000s of computer cores. To allow for rapid estimations of peak inundation levels, which is necessary for probabilistic flood forecasting and frequency analysis, a surrogate model was developed based on numerical model results via supervised machine learning methods. Since both kriging and artificial neural networks (ANNs) can learn complex, non-linear functions and have been applied with varying success in previous studies for storm surge predictions, both of these machine learning methods were evaluated to develop a surrogate model. Despite added complexity and possible increases in non-linearity due to the addition of rainfall-runoff and its interactions with storm surge, I anticipated that a well performing surrogate model could still be developed since the physical mechanisms that influence TC rainfall intensity are based on many of the same characteristics that determine storm surge levels, including storm intensity, size, forward speed, angle, and landfall location. Similar TC characteristics utilized in previous studies (i.e. Jia and Taflanidis 2013) were employed as baseline characteristics for training separate surrogate models for predicting peak storm surge and peak joint flood levels. These training characteristics include the following parameters at landfall: minimum central pressure (Cp), radius to maximum winds (Rmax), 6-hr forward speed (Vf), angle of approach (from due north), and landfall location represented by longitude (x). In addition to evaluating these baseline characteristics, alternative storm descriptors were evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the surrogate model to more descriptive training features. However, negligible increases in accuracy were observed with these alternative storm descriptors (i.e. radius to tropical storm and hurricane winds, integrated kinetic energy factor) and thus only results for the baseline characteristics are included. As discussed previously, peak inundation levels were obtained for each storm using the coupled modeling framework shown in Fig. 6-3   In this study, each dry point for a given simulation was modified by taking on the WSEL of its nearest point. The corresponding ground elevation of each point is then compared to WSEL predictions of the surrogate model in order to determine whether or not a point location is actually inundated. This technique, which was developed and applied by Jia and Taflanidis (2013), is necessary for flood frequency analysis and allows for kriging and artificial neural networks to train on latent output variables such as those determined using PCA. Kriging contains two components: i) a linear or quadratic polynomial regression that includes weights that are globally fit to the training data and ii) a non-parametric portion that assumes that the true function y(x) is a realization of a stochastic process (Z(x)): were evaluated and the correlation function for Z(x) was optimized for an order between 0.5 to 2, hence allowing for the evaluation of Exponential as well as Gaussian correlation functions. Thus, the hyperparameters optimized for kriging in this study include quadratic versus linear basis functions for the training features, the order associated with the correlation function, and the amount of variance or latent variables included in PCA. Further discussion regarding the kriging algorithm used in this study can be found in Jia and Taflanidis (2013). Traditional ANNs are made up of an input layer corresponding to the original input data features (TC storm characteristics), a number of hidden layers with a corresponding number of neurons in each hidden layer, and an output layer where predictions are made (peak surge or joint flood levels). As the number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer increase more weights are introduced and more complex functions can be learned by an ANN; however, training time will increase and the model may begin to overfit the training data, leading to poorer predictions on unseen data sets. ANN's typically utilize a form of the backpropagation algorithm that adjusts weights throughout the ANN by distributing the final error from a given iteration throughout the network. Hence, model weights are iteratively tuned by making a prediction, and then adjusting model weights based on a distribution, throughout the network, of the final error between predictions and true results. This study utilizes the Bayesian Regularization backpropagation algorithm due to its ability to additionally optimize the amount of regularization implemented to prevent overfitting using the Bayesian methods described in Foresee and Hagan (1997). The hyperparameters optimized for the ANNs include the number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each hidden layer, and the amount of variance or latent variables included in PCA. Additional information regarding ANNs can be obtained from a variety of resources, including Johnson et al. (2017) which explains the theory and optimization of ANNs and Solomatine et al. (2008) for an overview of example applications in hydrology. Ten-Fold cross-validation was utilized to evaluate the performance of the ANN and kriging surrogate models. This approach can provide a better indication of a models predictive performance compared to one-fold cross validation or a single partition of the dataset into a single training, validation, and test set (Ron Kohavi, 1995). In this validation approach a surrogate model trains on 9/10 of a random portion of the training data (i.e. 200 of the 223 TCs simulated), and then evaluates the models performance on the remaining unseen data (23 storms). This process is repeated 10 times in order to allow for an evaluation of the models predictive performance on the entire data set. Performance or error metrics, per standard practice, are based on the average validation accuracy of the 10 surrogate models trained in 10-fold cross validation. These error metrics were computed at each of the 76,610 prediction points for joint flooding (49,326 for surge only), to obtain an average coefficient of determination (R 2 ), root mean square error (RMSE), and absolute mean error (AME)."}, {"section_title": "Surrogate Model", "text": "Surrogate models based on kriging+PCA and ANN+PCA supervised machine learning methods were optimized based on the hyperparameters discussed in the methodology section.  surge in previous studies that were performed in New Orleans; however, comparisons for joint flooding are not included since such analysis has not been performed before. The kriging model provides similar prediction accuracy compared to previous studies, while the ANN provides a significant improvement compared to the best performing ANN in previous studies. After ensuring surrogate models could successfully be developed for storm surge with comparable accuracy to previous studies, a surrogate model for joint flooding was developed. As compared to the trained models for storm surge, both the ANN and kriging model for joint flood predictions have a lower R 2 and slightly higher RMSE. Although there is a strong correlation between the TC characteristics used as training features and a TCs expected rainfall, the surrogate model's decrease in performance can be attributed to an increase in complexity from the introduction of additional models to represent rainfall-runoff and its interactions with storm surge and the greater variation in the overall flood response from storm to storm. Overfitting issues, particularly for joint flooding, resulted in ANNs performing less accurately than kriging. This is demonstrated in Figures 6-9  is not surprising since a floodplain is a continuous surface containing spatial information that kriging directly takes into account, and agrees with previous studies that have evaluated other continuous surfaces (i.e. Matias et al. 2004). Nonetheless, this study confirms that kriging performs better for not only storm surge, but also joint flood predictions at the watershed-scale as compared to ANNs. Finally, the RMSE for each storm, based on the validation process during training for each surrogate model, is shown for the best kriging models determined for storm surge and joint flooding in Figure 6-12a. As demonstrated in Fig. 6-12a, the surrogate model for joint flooding generally has slightly higher errors than the surrogate model for storm surge; however, there are a few exceptions in which the surrogate model may have greater difficulty in predicting storm surge as compared to joint flooding. The characteristics of these storms were evaluated and decreases in minimum central pressure (Cp), which corresponds to more intense storms, is the only characteristic that showed a trend with decreasing accuracy for the storm surge predictions ( Figure   6-12b).   "}, {"section_title": "Forecasting", "text": "The surrogate model was subsequently evaluated against Hurricane Ike demonstrates the surrogate models predicted peak inundation levels along the main channel of the study area as compared to observed gauges. In the downstream end of the study area, which includes a gauge at the outlet of the study area, the surrogate model accurately predicts peak surge levels within 0.15 m; however, for areas influenced by rainfall-runoff, such as gauges 4, 6, and 8, the surrogate model under-predicted by 0.38 to 1.09 m. This discrepancy is due to the TC rainfall model's prediction of 17.2 cm as compared to the 24.3 cm of rainfall that were actually observed across the study area. analysis, the number of storms that resulted in a water level greater than a water level of interest for a given prediction location could simply be divided by the total number of storms sampled (50,000) to determine the probability of inundation above a given water level of interest. Results from this analysis is shown in Figure 6-14, where the probability of inundation due to storm surge is overlaid on the probability of inundation due to joint flooding. This provides an indication of the probability of the different sources of flooding, while additionally demonstrating increases in flooding due to rainfall-runoff which is currently not accounted for by probabilistic TC flood forecasts of storm surge only. Representing the likelihood of TC flooding can be crucial to avoid potentially significant over-or under-estimations of a storms flood levels from deterministic forecasts. In addition, probabilistic forecasts can inform critical facilities such as hospitals that need to know their risk for a given flood level (i.e. Fig. 6-14b) in order to properly plan evacuations and mitigation measures for a TC strike. "}, {"section_title": "Frequency Analysis", "text": "As discussed in Section 6.1.2, current FEMA flood insurance practices account for storm surge in coastal areas, but do not account for TC rainfall-runoff. In order to address this issue, while allowing for a relatively straightforward application to other coastal areas along the U.S. The following equation demonstrates the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of a given inundation level based on the multi-dimensional parameter space of storm characteristics. The multi-dimensional parameter space is defined by joint probability distributions of historical as well as possible TC characteristics that could impact the study area: where \uf06c represents the mean annual rate of storms in the study area. While the terms in this equation appear the same as those from Equation 6-2, the probability distributions of storm characteristics are representative of historical as well as possible storms that could impact the study area as compared to probability distributions representing possible deviations from forecasted characteristics in Equation 6-2. To approximate this risk integral, synthetic storms were constructed by random selection of 100,000 storms from the joint probability distributions of storm characteristics, resulting in the histograms of storm parameters shown in Fig. 6-4. Then, flood frequency levels were analytically fit by ranking the simulated water level responses from largest to smallest and corresponding return periods were determined using the Weibull formula which provides an unbiased estimate of the recurrence interval: where T is the return period, \uf06c is the average time between storm events (9.667 years), n is the total number of storm samples (100,000), and m is the magnitude or rank of each simulated water level. This Monte Carlo method has widely been used for extreme flood frequency analysis with large observational or numerically simulated data sets and, as shown in Figure 6-15, provides a satisfactory comparison against FEMAs surge return period levels at the outlet of the study area. Flood frequency analysis was performed using the separate (kriging) surrogate models of joint flooding and storm surge only to demonstrate the source apportionment of flood frequency levels throughout the entire study area. Water levels, based on the suite of 100,000 storm samples of the regions joint probability distributions, were obtained at each of the 76,610 prediction points, from which annual exceedance probabilities (AEP) or return period flood levels were determined for each point location.  Following FEMAs methodology for inland watersheds, design rainfall events were simulated in the study area using the same HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS models discussed in Section 6.3.1, except HEC-RAS was simulated in steady state per standard FEMA practices. The design rainfall events utilized for the region include 24-hour rainfall with SCS Type-III distributions of 19.81 cm for the 10-yr, 29.46 cm for the 50-yr, 34.29 cm for the 100-yr, and 49.02 cm for the 500yr return period (HCFCD, 2009). To determine surge frequency levels the storm surge surrogate model was utilized using the same JPM approach applied for determining joint flood frequency levels. The maximum inundation levels between the inland design rainfall-runoff analysis and coastal surge frequency analysis were then compared to joint flood frequency levels that account for probabilistic TC rainfall-runoff, storm surge, and their interactions.  Fig. 6-17a, increases in the extent of flooding throughout the study area due to joint flooding were not observed compared to FEMAs current flood frequency practices. This is due to more severe rainfall from the design rainfall events compared to the synthetic rainfall events in addition to the spatially uniform and thus conservative representation of design rainfall compared to the spatially heterogeneous rainfall from TCs. However, increases in the depth of inundation were observed throughout the study area as shown for increases of at least 0.1 m in inundation in Fig. 6-17b. Increases in flood depth were primarily observed for 500-yr flood levels and, as demonstrated in Fig. 6-17c, are concentrated along the upstream end of the study area and a middle portion of the study area's main channel. Increases in inundation levels for the upstream end may be related to a combination of storm direction relative to the study area, with TC's typically moving from the downstream to upstream end of the study area, as well as possible backwater effects due to extreme storm surge conditions that may cause a decrease in drainage in the upstream end of the study area. The increases in inundation observed along the middle portion of the study area's main channel are due to interactions between rainfallrunoff and storm surge that FEMA does not account for in its steady state analysis. These interactions occur in a transition zone that is located between the upstream portion of the study area that is dominated by rainfall-runoff and downstream portion that is dominated by storm surge. This transition zone can roughly be represented for a given return period by the location where the representation of joint flood levels overlaps with storm surge levels (i.e. such as that shown for 100-yr flood levels in Fig. 6-16b).  "}, {"section_title": "Chapter 7: Conclusions", "text": "This thesis provided different flood characterization, forecasting, and frequency products, with the intent of advancing urban resiliency against hurricane events that can produce extreme storm surge and rainfall. The thesis opened with a background on hurricanes and hurricane-related research in Chapter 2, and proceeded (Chapters 3 to 6) to inform the reader of new analysis and/or products developed in the thesis. This final chapter provides a brief recap of the findings in each chapter and suggestions for future work. Chapter 3 provided a numerical analysis of the ability of different storm surge indices to represent storm characteristics and their correlation to different surge response metrics. This was the first study to provide a comprehensive evaluation of local as well as regional surge responses of the different surge indices evaluated which are typically only compared against peak surge, and the first study to evaluate the Integrated Kinetic Energy (IKE) factor. Findings in this chapter indicated that the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale performs poorly and should be replaced by a more accurate index such as the IKE factor, which provides the best overall performance for capturing a storm's surge response. While the findings from this study are qualitatively applicable to any coastline in terms of the ability of the different surge indices to capture different surge responses, future work could evaluate how quantitative metrics such as the peak surge response for a given surge index varies for areas with distinct storm types, unique geographies such as islands, and for areas with shallower or steeper continental shelf slopes. In this thesis, advanced numerical and statistical flood analyses were combined to improve the characterization of hurricane storm surge. Surge indices such as the Integrated Kinetic Energy factor, which are gaining greater recognition among not only the scientific community but also the public, now have a reference regarding their accuracy and sensitivity to different hurricane characteristics. The strong correlations demonstrated between some of these simple parametric surge indices and their peak surge response were later used to guide the training of the first product capable of providing probabilistic hurricane flood forecasting and frequency levels due to multiflood hazards (rainfall-runoff, storm surge, and their interactions). This thesis also evaluated surge dynamics unique to bay environments by characterizing where the majority of coastal surge flows across Galveston Bay's coastline and by determining the levels of local surge that can develop within the bay itself. Furthering the understanding of existing and future surge dynamics throughout Galveston Bay, provided useful insight for guiding the design of regional surge mitigation strategies with multiple lines of defense. Overall, the research performed in this thesis combined hurricane theory with advanced numerical and statistical flood analysis to provide practical insight and tools that can be used to increase coastal resiliency. While significant work remains to reduce losses from severe hurricane and tropical storm events, the research performed in this thesis increases our understanding of surge indices used for public advisories, surge dynamics and mitigation options in bay environments, and joint flood risks. that previously we scaled Ike to Ike+15% winds, and would report that winds at landfall increased from 109 to 125 mph. For the FEMA storms (and for historical storms like Ike), there are periods during the storm in which the winds \"spin-up\" and decrease or increase in intensity, all of which need to be considered when modifying the wind intensity of the storm to maintain a realistic hurricane along its path. Note that when scaling the wind values uniformly there is a large and non-realistic increase in the storms wind speeds during the majority of the storms life. When modifying the wind speed of a storm uniformly in the x, y direction of the windfield you can create storms with extremely large sizes. This becomes problematic because unrealistic storms with possibly small Rmax's but extremely large IKE values or storm sizes can be created that are unrealistic. As shown in Figure A-2, for a given Holland B, a relationship exists between the radius to hurricane (and tropical storm) winds and the average of the maximum wind speed and radius to maximum winds as shown in the above figure. This relationship was used to modify wind values using an exponentially increasing (decreasing) wind multiplication factor in the x, y space of the storms windfield for storms being made more intense (weaker). This was performed to ensure that the modified wind fields had realistic storm sizes or radii to hurricane and tropical storm wind speeds. Please note that storms with different Holland B values had unique correlations.      As demonstrated in Fig. C-1 storms with an average forward speed result in peak surge levels along the coast and inside the bay that are generally equal to or greater than peak surge levels for faster and slower moving storms. For the weakest storms (3a) with a maximum wind speed of 35.7 m/s, minor differences are generally observed between peak surge levels along the coast and within the bay. For the faster moving storm, the intermediate (3c) and most intense (3e) winds, respectively, result in coastal surge levels that are 1.17 to 1.57 m lower, and in-bay surge levels that are 1.80 to 3.04 m lower with respect to an average forward speed. For the slower moving storm, the intermediate (3c) and most intense (3e) winds, respectively, result in coastal surge levels that are 0.97 to 1.18 m lower, and in-bay surge levels that are roughly the same as a storm with an average forward speed. These results indicate that faster moving storms begin to result in significant reductions in coastal and in-bay peak surge levels as wind intensities increase. Slower moving storms generally result in lower peak surge levels along the coast as wind intensity increases; however, in-bay surge levels are roughly the same as a storm with an average forward speed. This suggests that the highest surge levels are produced along the coast for an average forward speed for the study region owing to the balance or trade-off between effective wind speeds on the right hand side which increase (decrease) for faster (slower) moving storms and the increased (decreased) residence time storms with slower (faster) winds have to act across the mildly sloping Gulf of Mexico continental shelf. Despite lower coastal surge levels produced for a slower moving storm, the increased residence time a storm's winds have to act across the bay increases overall surge levels within the bay to an equivalent level of a storm with an average forward speed.  Houston-Galveston region. As shown in Fig. C-2a, differences in the volume of surge for the weakest storm (3a) are small. For the faster moving storm, the intermediate (3c) and most intense (3e) winds, respectively, result in a volume of surge across the bay's coastline that is -4.07 km 3 (41%) and -8.23 km 3 (42%) less than the storm with an average forward speed. For the slower moving storm, the intermediate (3c) and most intense (3e) winds, result in a volume of surge that is nearly equivalent to that observed for the storms with an average forward speed. These results indicate that faster moving storms begin to result in significant reductions in the volume of surge entering Galveston Bay as wind intensities increase. This intuitively makes sense since lower surge levels are produced for faster moving storms (Fig. C-1a) for a shorter duration. On the other hand, despite lower coastal peak surge levels (Fig. C-1a), slower moving storms generally result in nearly equivalent volumes of water entering Galveston Bay as storms with an average forward speed owing to the increased duration of time in which elevated water levels are produced for the slower moving storms. Figure C-2b demonstrates that the inundated area across the Houston-Galveston region does not necessarily follow the same trends as that observed for the volume of surge entering Galveston Bay via its coastline. For example, the weakest storm (3a) demonstrates 21% and 29% increases in inundated area for faster and slower storms, respectively. For the intermediate (3c) and most intense (3e) winds, faster storms result in slightly lower amounts of inundated area (-6 to -9%), and slower storms result in significant increases in inundated area (29 to 38%). Generally, these results indicate that in addition to the volume of coastal surge that enters the bay via its coastline, the forward speed and thus resident time over Galveston Bay begins to become relatively important for determining the inundated area throughout the Houston-Galveston region. Figure C-2. Impact of forward speed on a) volume of surge across the bay's coastline and b) area inundated throughout the Houston-Galveston region Figure C-3 demonstrates variations in the relative volume of surge that enters via barrier islands versus tidal inlets for the different forward speed storms. Results suggests that faster and slower storms result in slight increases in the relative volume of surge across tidal inlets as compared to tidal inlets, with a maximum 10% change. This is primarily attributed to lower peak coastal surge levels for faster and slower moving storms (Fig. C-1a), and thus less overwash along barrier islands. While the intention of this study is to provide a general description of coastal storm surge dynamics based on storm characteristics known to have the strongest influence in determining a storm's surge response (landfall, storm intensity, storm size), I consider the insight provided with respect to storm forward speed in this appendix important given the integrated timevariable surge analysis performed in the study. Most importantly, this analysis found that the inundated area could increase from 29 to 38% for an intermediate (53.6 m/s) to extreme wind intensity (71.5 m/s), respectively, for a slower moving storm as compared to the average forward speed evaluated in the main text of this study.   The original hydrologic (HEC-HMS) model significantly over-predicted peak flows and volume of flow for the events evaluated. Thus, calibration of the hydrologic model was required, which was achieved by writing a script that allowed for the scaling or modification of subbasin and reach parameters within reasonable values in order to improve the match between modeled and observed streamflow. The calibration was performed from the upstream to downstream direction, and was only performed until Gauge 3 due to the availability of streamflow measurements. Calibrations upstream of Gauge 3 included subbasin storage (coefficient R) scaled by 2.625 and wetting front suction was scaled by 2.5 (representative of clay conditions). In addition to the previous, storage-discharge routing relationships that were originally specified by steady state HEC-RAS models for TSARP (2001) were updated based on the calibrated unsteady HEC-RAS model discussed in the following paragraph. Figure D-4 demonstrates modeled versus observed streamflow for the historical events evaluated. The baseline or uncalibrated unsteady HEC-RAS model significantly over-predicted peak stage as well as the duration of stage. A few modifications to the HEC-RAS model, aside from the steps previously discussed in converting it from steady to unsteady state, were required in order to improve the performance of the HEC-RAS model. The first step involved updating the geometry of each cross-section in the model. This was performed in order to update the original 2001 LiDaR to 2008 LiDaR. Secondly, a few bridges were causing significant instabilities and unrealistic backwater effects. The modeling methods and geometry of these bridges were modified in order to allow for conveyance through the bridges while still representing backwater effects from piers and bridge decks. The previous steps allowed for a stable, functional unsteady model. However, in order to match observed stage conditions manning's roughness along the channels, which is the primary factor that is modified for calibration in hydraulic models, had to be adjusted. Manning's roughness for channels can vary significantly from 0.015 (concrete channel) to 0.1 (channel with dense weeds and brush) (McCuen, 2004). Given the influence of tide and storm surge, the stage at tidally influenced locations in the model were sensitive to manning's roughness changes both upstream and downstream of their respective locations. This made calibration rather challenging; however, several iterations of manning's values were tested until modeled stage matched as close as possible to observed stage for the rainfall-runoff dominated events. The manning's roughness was scaled by 0.45 upstream of Gauge 2, scaled by 0.75 from Gauge 2 to Gauge 3, and scaled by   "}, {"section_title": "D.2 Time-variable Joint Flood Analysis for Clear Creek", "text": "Chapter 6 provides probabilistic analysis of peak inundation due to joint flooding. In this appendix, the time-variable contributions of rainfall-runoff versus storm surge flooding is discussed for two synthetic storms of interest that were simulated using the modeling framework outlined in Section 6.3.1. This highlights the importance of rainfall-runoff and storm surge interactions along the Clear Creek channel of the SE Houston study area, which served as an initial incentive to evaluate peak joint flood levels throughout this study area. Two hurricanes were evaluated in detail to gain a preliminary understanding of the impact of hurricane rainfall on timevariable and spatial inundation levels along Clear Creek. These hurricanes included a weak, slow moving storm and an intense, fast moving storm (see characteristics in Table D-2). These storms were simulated at a \"worst-case\" landfall location in terms of their surge and rainfall impacts to the SE Houston study area (Figure D-6). These two storms were of particular interest, since the weaker storm could potentially result in greater flood impacts due to its slow movement and thus potentially greater rainfall amounts as compared to the more intense, faster moving storm.  at the outlet of the watershed for these two storms. As shown in this figure, the peak surge is slightly greater for the more intense, faster moving storm; however, the rainfall is substantially greater for the slower moving, weaker storm.   To evaluate the timing of rainfall-runoff versus storm surge and whether or not increases due to compound flooding (interaction between rainfall-runoff and storm surge) could occur during these synthetic hurricane events, the following scenarios were evaluated in unsteady HEC-RAS: inundation due to rainfall only, inundation due to storm surge only, and inundation due to rainfall and storm surge. Figure D-9 demonstrates the time-variable impacts under each of these scenarios for a location along the middle portion of Clear Creek where joint flood interactions was apparent. Note that the peak rainfall and surge occur roughly at the same time, which coincides with the point in time in which the hurricane passed over the study area of interest (just a few hours after the hurricane has made landfall along the coast). However, peak runoff does not occur until roughly 18 hours after the hurricane's landfall. As a result, inundation is initially driven by storm surge soon after the hurricane makes landfall, and then rainfall-runoff roughly a day after the hurricane's landfall. However, throughout this time (from landfall until roughly a day after landfall) inundation levels, and in particular the maximum inundation level that occurs throughout the entire duration of this event are due to compound flooding. This suggests that compound flooding can be an important consideration for coastal flood forecasts and flood frequency analysis. an open records request.
