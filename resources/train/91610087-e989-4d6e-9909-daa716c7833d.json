[{"section_title": "", "text": "Among employed SEH doctorate holders in 2008, higher percentages of blacks (58%) and Hispanics (55%) than of most other racial/ethnic groups (34%-47%) were employed in education in a variety of settings and appointments (table 2). 3,4 Differences in field of doctorate account for some of the differences in employment by sector. Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native doctorate holders are more likely than white and Asian doctorate holders to have doctorates in the social and behavioral sciences, fields in which academic employment is prevalent (NSF/SRS 2011). Of the approximately 291,000 SEH doctorates employed in educational NOTES: Underrepresented minority includes American Indian/Alaska Native, Black/African American, and Hispanic. Other/unknown race/ethnicity includes Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, those who indicated \"no\" to the Hispanic ethnicity item but did not indicate race, and those who did not provide race/ethnicity. institutions in 2008, approximately 221,000 were faculty in universities and colleges (table 3). Of these, 13% were Asian, 4% were black, 4% were Hispanic, 1% were two or more races, and less than 1% were all other race/ ethnicity (American Indian/Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander). Because the fraction of SEH doctorates awarded to minorities has increased over time, minorities are a higher percentage of faculty with recent SEH doctorates than they are of all faculty with SEH doctorates. Among faculty who received SEH doctorates in 2005 or later, 22% were Asian, 5% were black, 6% were Hispanic, 2% were two or more races, and less than 1% were all other race/ethnicity. Differences in years since doctorate are likely to account for some of the differences by race/ethnicity in rank and tenure. Smaller percentages of black, Hispanic, and Asian doctoral faculty with SEH doctorates than of white faculty are full professors, and larger percentages are assistant professors. Similarly, smaller percentages of black, Hispanic, and Asian faculty than of white faculty are tenured. As is the case with field of doctorate, faculty with SEH doctorates differ by race/ethnicity in field of employment. A higher percentage of black faculty than of most other faculty with SEH doctorates are employed as faculty in S&E-related occupational fields, including the health sciences, or in non-S&E occupational fields (figure 1). A lower percentage of Asian than of most other faculty with SEH doctorates are employed as social science faculty, and a higher percentage are computer science, mathematics, or engineering faculty. Minority faculty with SEH doctorates also differ in citizenship status and sex. About one-third of black, 37% of Hispanic, 91% of Asian, and 11% of white SEH doctoral faculty members are non-U.S. born, most of them being naturalized citizens (table 3). Higher percentages of black and Hispanic faculty with SEH doctorates are women than is the case for white and Asian faculty."}, {"section_title": "From What Types of Schools Did They Earn Their Doctorates?", "text": "Most (79%) faculty with SEH doctorates employed in U.S. academic institutions earned their doctorates at institutions in the Carnegie Classification category of research universities with very high research activity (RUVH). Lower percentages of black faculty than of white, Asian, or Hispanic faculty earned their doctorates at RUVH institutions, and higher percentages earned them at academic institutions in the other two Carnegie Classification categories of doctorategranting institutions (research universities, high research activity [RUH], and doctoral/research universities [DRU]) (table 4)."}, {"section_title": "Where Are They Employed?", "text": "Among all faculty with SEH doctorates employed in U.S. academic institutions in 2008, a total of 36% were employed in RUVH institutions, 24% were employed in other doctorate-granting institutions (either RUH or DRU) or medical schools, and 21% were employed in master's-granting institutions (table 5). Minority faculty follow a similar pattern, with one notable exception. Black faculty with SEH doctorates differ from most other racial/ ethnic groups in that a lower percentage were employed in RUVH institutions   However, among faculty who received their SEH doctorates from RUVH institutions, relatively fewer (31%) of black faculty were employed in RUVH institutions than faculty of most other racial/ethnic groups (39%-48%). A higher percentage of black faculty (25%) with SEH doctorates from RUVH institutions than of white (20%) or Asian faculty (15%) were employed in master's-granting institutions. The relative prevalence of black faculty in master's-granting institutions is at least partly attributable to their prevalence in historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) (figure 2), most of which are master's-granting institutions. Although HBCUs are the employers of only 2% of all faculty with SEH doctorates, they are the employers of 24% of black doctoral SEH faculty."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Limitations", "text": "This InfoBrief updates a previous publication (NSF 06-318) that was withdrawn in 2010 because of the discovery of quality issues in racial/ ethnicity data from the National Science Foundation's 2003 and the 2006 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). In this report, the racial/ethnic categories are mutually exclusive. The non-Hispanic white, black, Asian, and American Indian/Alaska Native categories are referred to here as white, black, Asian, and American Indian/Alaska Native, respectively. In tables, American Indians/Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders (excluding those selecting an Hispanic ethnicity) are included in the \"other\" race/ethnicity category. The faculty data included in this report refer only to U.S. faculty with doctoral degrees in SEH fields from U.S. institutions.
