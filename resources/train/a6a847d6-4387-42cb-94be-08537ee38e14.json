[{"section_title": "", "text": "their health care through VHA (Department of Veterans Affairs 2016). The total 9 million veterans currently enrolled in VHA health care is likely an underestimate of the number of veterans who could potentially qualify for VHA health care. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has suggested that approximately 60 percent of unenrolled Veterans-about 8 million additional Veterans-may be eligible for their health care through VHA (Congressional Budget Office 2014). In recent years, the demand for VHA health care has grown, and this trend, coupled with other complex dynamics, has contributed to long appointment wait times and related health care access challenges for some Veterans (Bagalman 2014; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2015; Department of Veterans Affairs 2016). For instance, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) analysis of VHA data showed that, in 2014, the average wait time for new primary care appointments was 43 days, with a range of 2 to 122 days across all VHA facilities (Institute of Medicine 2015). The timeliness of obtaining both physical and behavioral health care is essential. Studies have shown that delays and extended wait times are associated with adverse health outcomes for a range of health conditions, from spinal fractures to heart disease (Institute of Medicine 2015). Timely access to behavioral health care is particularly important, and a number of analyses have indicated that treatment may be more effective and patients respond better if behavioral health care is delivered in a timely and well-coordinated manner (Institute of Medicine 2015). In response to health care access issues, Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 to increase health care access for eligible Veterans (Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act 2014). Under this legislation, VA instituted a temporary program authorizing health care-eligible 1 Veterans who meet certain criteria to obtain care outside of the VHA health care system (Department of Veterans Affairs 2015a; Panangala 2015; Commission on Care 2016). However, despite efforts to address health care access issues through the VCA program, utilization has been low, with only 27,000 Veterans having utilized Veterans Choice Program (VCP) providers as of November 2014 (Hegseth 2015). A recent report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found that shortages of primary care providers in the community were one reason for low VCP utilization cited by officials from medical centers and the VHA (Government Accountability Office 2016). In addition to creating the VCP, the Veterans Choice Act also required an independent assessment of VHA's health care delivery systems and established the Commission on Care to review the assessment findings. Based upon extensive analysis of the 4,000-page Independent Assessment Report as well as stakeholder engagement, site visits, and public meetings, the Commission developed 18 recommendations to address seven broad areas: the VHA Care System; Clinical Operations; Health Care Equity; Facility and Capital Assets; Information Technology; Governance, Leadership, and Workforce; and Veteran Eligibility (Commission on Care 2016). Two recommendations focused on community health care needs are the impetus for this analysis. First, the Commission on Care Report suggested conducting community assessments of Veterans' needs, local VHA capacity, and non-VA community providers to assist in capital asset and resource planning. This assessment would assist the VA in identifying areas where VHA will provide services and where it would be efficient to purchase services. Second, the Commission recommended establishing integrated, community care networks of VHA credentialed providers to help address the health care, \"misalignment of capacity and demand that threatens to become worse over time\" (Commission on Care 2016, p. 3). While both recommendations focus on local area needs, the Commission's Report does not identify specific geographic areas where there is a potentially critical need for health care providers for Veterans. Given ongoing budget constraints, identifying areas with the highest health workforce needs is important for prioritizing the resource planning suggested by the Commission and for ensuring adequate characterization of local health workforce capacities. The purpose of the current study is to identify geographic areas where health care provider supply potentially does not meet the health care needs of Veterans. This work is intended to serve as an initial step in characterizing health care capacity for Veterans across the United States. More specifically, this study links geographic information on VHA health facility locations with Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-designated Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) to identify geographic areas where there are potentially inadequate supplies of health professionals to meet Veteran demands. HRSA-designated HPSAs reflect geographic areas and populations with potentially insufficient provider capacity. Currently, there are Veterans in Shortage Area Counties approximately 6,100 primary care HPSAs and 4,000 mental health HPSAs (Health Resources and Services Administration 2016b). Instead of only reporting acute shortages of health care providers nationally, this analysis seeks to identify specific areas where there are high concentrations of VHA-enrolled Veterans and high health care need. In addition, this study examines two Veteran population subgroups with specific health care needs: women Veterans and Veterans aged 65 years and older. Careful planning related to these populations is becoming increasingly important as Veterans' need for health care intensifies as a consequence of population aging and the commensurate increase in complex health conditions requiring care (Horgan, Taylor, and Wilensky 1983;Selim et al. 2004;Sorrell and Durham 2011). As the Commission on Care Report also suggested ensuring that Veterans with a service-connected illness, injury, or disability have priority access to care (Commission on Care, 2016, Recommendation 18), this study also considers Veterans in health workforce shortage areas who are receiving service-connected compensation benefits from the VA. Finally, as health care providers are in short supply in rural areas (Ricketts 2005;Hoge et al. 2013) and Veterans are more likely than non-Veterans to live in rural areas (Department of Veterans Affairs 2015b), the rurality of areas where Veterans live is also examined."}, {"section_title": "DATA", "text": "Data for this analysis come from two publicly available resources: HRSA's 2015-2016 Area Health Resource Files (AHRF; ahrf.hrsa.gov) and the VA via VA's Open Data portal (www.va.gov/data).

The AHRF contains a collection of county-and state-level data from over 50 different sources on health care professionals, hospitals, health care facilities, and population demographics. County-level estimates of the FY 2015 population of Veterans aged 65 and older were obtained directly from VA. All Veteran population estimates are as of September 30, 2015, and derive from VetPop 2014, an actuarial projection model developed by VA's Office of the Actuary (http://www.va.gov/ vetdata/Veteran_Population.asp).

Counties were considered \"rural\" if they were completely rural regardless of whether they were adjacent to a metropolitan area (code 8 or 9)."}, {"section_title": "Health Professional Shortage Areas", "text": "Data on mental health and primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) came from the 2015-2016 AHRF. HPSA designations assist federal and state governments in prioritizing resources to areas where there are significant health care needs. HPSA designations consider travel time, population size, demand for and utilization of health services, number of providers, geographic characteristics, and population groups served (Health Resources and Services Administration 1993, 2015, 2016a. Primary care providers were considered if they were osteopathic or allopathic physicians from the following practice areas: General or Family Practice, General Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. HPSAs do not consider other types of practitioners who provide primary care services such as those from NPs and physicians assistants. Although the Federal Register defined psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatric nurse specialists, and marriage and family therapists as mental health professionals to consider in HPSA designations, most mental health HPSAs were based on the distribution of psychiatrists alone (Health Resources and Services Administration 2015, 2016a). Under these definitions, portions of some counties are considered HPSAs, as are certain populations and facilities (e.g., a correctional facility). However, this study considers geographically defined whole-county and partial-county HPSAs (Health Resources and Services Administration 2016a,b)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "This study defined a Shortage Area County as a county that (1) has no VHA health or medical facility; and (2) has been designated by HRSA as either a primary care or a mental health geographic HPSA (i.e., either a whole-county HPSA or a partial-county HPSA). Thus, the first step of this analysis involved assigning each VHA health facility to its appropriate county. VHA health facility assignments were made for VHA community-based outpatient clinics (or CBOCs), VHA integrated clinical facilities, VHA outpatient clinics, VA medical centers, and Vet Centers. County assignment of VHA health care facilities was performed using a geocoding procedure available in Base SAS 9.4 (proc ginside). SAS was unable to assign 22 VHA facilities to an appropriate county, and county-level determinations were performed manually for these facilities. The county-level VHA facility assignments were then linked to countylevel HPSA categories using Federal Information Processing Series county codes (FIPS codes) to identify Shortage Area Counties. To reiterate, a Shortage Area County is a county that (1) has no VHA health facility; and (2) has been designated either a primary care or a mental health geographic HPSA (i.e., either a whole-county HPSA or a partial-county HPSA)."}, {"section_title": "464", "text": "HSR: Health Services Research 52:1, Part II (February 2017) County-level Veteran population estimates and county-level rural status codes were then linked to the Shortage Area County designations, again using FIPS codes. These summaries were tabulated by state to determine estimates of the total number of Veterans living in Shortage Area Counties in each state. Subpopulation estimates were also tabulated for Veterans enrolled in VHA health care, women Veterans, Veterans aged 65 years and older, and Veterans who receive service-connected compensation from VA (i.e., service-connected Veterans). The statistical software R (version 3.2.3) was used to generate these tabulations. In addition to county-and state-level analyses, this study examined the distribution of Veterans in Shortage Area Counties by U.S. Census division. Census divisions are subdivisions of the four U.S. Census Regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). Each divisional grouping is made up of three to eight states, and thus, Census divisions can afford a more granular view than is possible at the U.S. Census Region level. Table 1 shows the distribution of Veterans overall, by subgroup, and in Shortage Area Counties. Of the 21,479,000 Veterans in the United States (i.e., Veterans in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia), 8,843,000 Veterans, or 41 percent, are enrolled in VHA, 9 percent are women, and 46 percent are older than 65 years. About 20 percent of all Veterans-or 4,141,000 peopleare receiving VA compensation for a service-connected illness, injury or disability. Of the 21 million total Veterans and the approximately 9 million VHA enrollees in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, between 23 and 24 percent live in Shortage Area Counties. Similarly, about one-quarter of Veterans older than 65 years live in Shortage Area Counties while about 22 percent of women Veterans live in these areas."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "These national-level estimates obscure considerable variability at the state level for all Veteran subgroups. For example, the state-level proportion of Enrolled Veterans in Shortage Area Counties is more than twice the national-level proportion in five states (Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Mississippi, and Oklahoma). Using this same criterion of twice the national proportion, two states have disproportionately high levels of women Veterans (Mississippi and Oklahoma), while four states have disproportionate numbers of Veterans aged 65 years and older and service-connected Veterans in Shortage Area Counties. Mississippi consistently has the highest subgroup        Veterans in Shortage Area Counties (New England, Middle Atlantic Division, Mountain Division, and Pacific Division). Figure 2 shows the distribution of Shortage Area Counties and high VHA enrollment across the United States. One salient trend is the lack of Shortage Area Counties in certain states and regions. Southern California, Arizona, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and other states in the New England Division have numerous contiguous counties that are not considered health workforce shortage counties. Shortage Area Counties with high VHA enrollment (defined as enrollment rates above the third quartile) tend to be more concentrated in areas in the northern United States-such as Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota-and the Appalachian region covering parts of West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, and North Carolina. The aforementioned geographic trends may be driven in part by the geographic distribution of rural versus nonrural counties, and this is explored in Table 2. Of the 644 rural counties in the United States, 627 are considered       Shortage Area Counties and 232 counties-or 36 percent-are rural shortage area counties with high VHA enrollment (i.e., VHA enrollment rates above the third quartile). Table 2 also suggests considerable variation by state. For instance, all four rural counties in Wyoming and 80 percent of the rural counties in Minnesota are Shortage Area Counties with high VHA enrollment. However, none of the rural counties in Washington, Nevada, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, and New York are shortage areas with high VHA enrollment. "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Nationwide, it is estimated that almost one-quarter of all Veterans and those enrolled in VHA live in counties that are health professional shortage areas and do not have VHA health care facilities or medical centers. Almost onequarter of Veterans older than 65 years and 22 percent of women Veterans live in shortage area counties. However, these estimates mask considerable geographic heterogeneity. Forty-nine states have one or more Shortage Area Counties, while in 32 states, 50 percent or more of the state's counties are considered Shortage Area Counties. Moreover, counties in the South Atlantic Division have a disproportionate number of Veterans in Shortage Area Counties followed by the East North Central and West South Central Divisions of the United States. The highest proportion of Veterans living in Shortage Area Counties-across all subgroups considered-is in Mississippi. Most strikingly, nearly 71 percent of Veterans older than 65 years in Mississippi live in Shortage Area Counties. Findings from this study reinforce the importance of considering rurality in geographic analyses of Veterans. While shortage area counties with high VHA enrollment tend to be distributed across many states in the United States, many are concentrated in areas in the northern United States-such as Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota-and the Global findings from this study are consistent with at least one study of Veterans; however, these findings also underscore local area variability of providers in studies of health care access for Veterans and for policy planning. It is important to note that previous nationally representative studies on Veteran health care access have come to conflicting conclusions. Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2006 to 2011, Bernard and Selden (2016) find that nonelderly Veterans were comparable to and non-Veterans in terms of health care access after controlling for various characteristics (Bernard and Selden 2016). However, using data from the 2010-2011 Health Tracking Household Survey, Lee and Begley (2016) find that, after controlling for various characteristics, Veterans were more likely than those with private insurance to report delayed needed medical care (Lee and Begley 2016). On a national level, this study shows that the majority of Veterans across the United States do not live in Shortage Area Counties, a finding consistent with Bernard and Selden (2016). Conversely, findings from this study also show that Veterans living in certain areas in the United States potentially face significant barriers to accessing care-particularly those living in Mississippi and other specific areas mentioned previously. Thus, while some Veterans in the United States do not experience significant barriers to receiving the health care they were promised in exchange for their service to the American people, there remain large populations of Veterans who do. Nevertheless, these findings, in addition to recommendations from the Commission on Care report, suggest opportunities for the flexible use of health workers. For instance, allowing nurse practitioners (NPs) practice to the fullest extent of their license has been found to be cost-effective and efficient, improving health care quality, health care access, and patient satisfaction (Newhouse et al. 2011;Kutzleb et al. 2015;Kilpatrick, Jabbour, and Fortin 2016;Riley, Litsch, and Cook 2016). Recognizing these potential benefits, the Department of Veterans Affairs proposed a rule that would grant full practice authority to Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) when they are acting within the scope of their VA employment. Expanding the scope of practice for NPs is also a Commission on Care recommendation for increasing access to quality health care for Veterans. This change could potentially enhance health care access for Veterans living in shortage areas in Mississippi, West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, and North Carolina, where APRN scope of practice is either reduced or restricted. Although Service Area Counties reflect areas where there are no VHA facilities, expanding APRN scopes of practice could increase the availability of providers to Veterans whose services can be purchased by VHA. Despite the strengths of using current county-level data to identify geographic trends, this study has several limitations. First, counties are the smallest level of analysis considered, and this unit of analysis is not sufficiently granular in many-if not most-cases to address community-level needs. Unfortunately, HRSA's HPSA designations and the publicly available Veteran population data do not permit a more granular analysis. Second, this study relates to the use of VHA health facility locations as a proxy for the supply of VHA providers. Providers may be geographically spread across multiple counties and some VHA facilities may have potentially inadequate capacities. Thus, this assumption may lead to an underestimation in the number of Shortage Area Counties and in the attendant Veteran populations in these Counties. Third, the current study does not consider specific types of providers. For instance, neither access to obstetricians/gynecologists for women Veterans nor access to geriatricians for Veterans aged 65 years and older are captured in this analysis. Access to health care is complicated and not driven solely by the presence or absence of providers or facilities, which broadens opportunities for future research. Provider capacity, provider willingness to accept new patients, specialty, and cultural competence all factor into whether, where, and how needed health care is obtained (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 2014; Commission on Care 2016). Logistical constraints (travel time, transportation availability, etc.) can be major drivers in determining health care access. An individual's health literacy and ability to seek care can also have a profound influence on access to health care services. While the countylevel analysis presented herein was not able to take these factors into account, it is hoped that this analysis can serve as an initial step in characterizing health care capacity for Veterans across the United States, and that it can help to provide the foundation for targeted, community-level analyses in which provider capacity, provider specialty, and other factors are examined. For example, a Census block group or tract-level analysis, using nonpublic data available through VA or through the U.S. Census, may provide important information, especially in states with a high proportion of Shortage Area Counties. Targeted analyses of specific provider types and Veteran subpopulations (e.g., the supply obstetrician/gynecologists versus the population of Women Veterans) may also be informative for states where there large proportions of Veterans or Veteran subpopulations in Shortage Area Counties. Veterans Affairs is working to substantially improve Veterans' access to health care, and VA's FY 2017 budget includes funds to expand community programs, strengthen and integrate mental health services, construct and upgrade VHA facilities, provide medical education, and institute other initiatives to improve the ability of eligible Veterans to obtain needed health care (Department of Veterans Affairs 2016). Many of these initiatives explicitly target geographically remote settings. Other agencies are also working to strengthen the health workforce, improve access, and more effectively integrate primary care and behavioral health for all Americans. Ensuring that all Veterans have adequate access to health care is a shared challenge for the U.S. health care system-a challenge that requires a detailed understanding of the widespread geographic imbalances in provider supply. It is hoped that this study provides a first step in informing those analyses."}]
