[{"section_title": "Overview", "text": "The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) recognizes the importance of understanding and responding to information on impacts of climate change on the U.S. transportation system. FHWA further recognizes that this is a rapidly evolving area of research and that useful information may come from a wide variety of sources both inside and outside the United States . For that reason, FHWA has commissioned a review of U.S. and international approaches to address global climate change adaptation. FHWA recognizes that efforts to address adaptation are in their infancy and in some cases, adaptation efforts may be limited to a qualitative assessment of vulnerability. Thus, this literature review focuses on three major categories of activities: vulnerability assessments, risk assessments, and adaptation approaches. Ultimately, some combination of these actions will inform a new risk assessment framework for FHWA. This remainder of this report presents the findings of a streamlined literature review for Task 2.1 (see Appendix A for a detailed discussion of the literature review methodology). Ultimately, this Task and the subsequent Tasks (2.2 and 2.3) are intended to inform the development of a risk assessment framework (Task 2.4). The framework will draw on several tools to assist policy makers in assessing and responding to projected climate change impacts. Transportation officials will likely begin by identifying the climate effects, assessing the climate impacts on transportation infrastructure, and evaluating/prioritizing adaptation options. In order to maximize the usefulness of the information presented in this report, examples from the literature are presented in three categories: (1) vulnerability assessment, (2) risk assessment, and (3) adaptation approaches. Each of these sections provides a general overview of the assessment or approach, the methodology that policymakers may utilize for applying the assessment or approach, and selected examples. In the absence of a framework, one or all of the methodologies discussed here may be utilized to address climate change impacts on transportation systems\u037e the methodologies' relative usefulness in specific situations is highly dependent on several factors including the infrastructure in question, the design life, and available resources, among other considerations."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Assessment", "text": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines vulnerability as \"the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes\" (IPCC, 2007). The vulnerability of a given system to climate change can vary with the unique characteristics of that system including its exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (Snover et al., 2007). Climate change can impact a study group (or system) by introducing new stressors into the system, and may also exacerbate existing stressors. Depending on how \"the system\" is defined for the purpose of conducting a vulnerability assessment, factors external to the system itself may influence its vulnerability\u037e these factors may include development patterns, the surrounding physical environment, the distribution of resources, and existing stressors (IPCC, 2007). Vulnerability analysis has evolved over time drawing on issues associated with entitlement, diversity, and resilience (Turner et al., 2003). The first relates to human needs that render a system more or less vulnerable. The second, diversity, addresses the need for redundant functions and the third has roots in ecology, alluding to a system's ability to maintain equilibrium (even if that equilibrium is dynamic) despite exposure to disturbance or stress. There is a rapidly growing body of literature addressing terms such as vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity, particularly for natural systems. The remainder of this section focuses on how \"vulnerability assessments\" may be useful for FHWA in addressing climate change impacts on the U.S. highway system. In this context, vulnerability to climate change and climate variability acts as a function of the structural In this context, vulnerability to climate change and climate variability acts as a function of the structural strength and integrity of the infrastructure, as well as the potential for damage and disruption in transportation services (CCSP, 2008). While factors for determining the vulnerability of transportation infrastructure may vary across transportation agencies, common factors may include: the age of the infrastructure element\u037e condition/integrity of the infrastructure element\u037e proximity to other infrastructure elements/concentrations\u037e and the level of service (CCSP, 2008). Currently, there is no comprehensive inventory of U.S. transportation infrastructure considered vulnerable to climate change, the degree of infrastructure vulnerability, or the estimated costs of associated damages (NRC, 2008). However, there are several local and regional studies available in the U.S. that utilize a bottomup approach to evaluate infrastructure vulnerability that attempt to capture this information (Larsen et al., 2007\u037e Kirshen et al., 2006. In addition, various international vulnerability assessments have been conducted at local and regional levels (Andrey and Knapper, 2003\u037e Allen Consulting Group, 2005\u037e Ibarrar\u00e1n et al., 2008."}, {"section_title": "General Methodologies of a Vulnerability Assessment", "text": "The literature provides some guidance on the methodology of vulnerability assessments. Two reports provide the foundation for this described methodology (Mehdi et al., 2006 andSnover et al., 2007). In general, a vulnerability assessment can be broken into 3 key elements as illustrated in Box 1 . The available budget, time allocated for the study, the number of planning areas encompassed within the study, and the objective of the assessment will dictate the level of effort and detail appropriate as evidenced by the vulnerability assessment examples in section 2.2 (Snover et al., 2007). Once a vulnerability assessment has been assembled, continual monitoring and review is necessary to ensure the findings throughout each element of the process are uptodate and relevant including integrating new information into the decisionmaking and planning process as it becomes available (Mehdi et al., 2006\u037e Snover et al., 2007. Element One: Assess Current Vulnerability. This element identifies the system's vulnerabilities to existing stressors, including relevant climate conditions that currently affect the system stressors. This assessment provides a roadmap for which climate variables (temperature, precipitation, etc.) are most likely to be of interest. The current vulnerabilities are apt to be affected by a complex number of factors including environmental (extreme weather), social (policy changes) and economic (market changes) factors (Mehdi et al., 2006). This step may draw heavily from historical data, experience, and past climate events to provide further insight into the potential responses and vulnerabilities of the system (Mehdi et al., 2006). Element Two: Estimate Future Conditions. The future climate change effects within the assessment area are projected to a particular time period to determine the potential changes in relevant climate variables and climate variability (Mehdi et al., 2006). Questions for this step may include (Snover et al., 2007): 1. What is the projected change in the climate conditions identified (and by what time period)? 2. What is the projected climate change impact to the system (absent adaptation action)? 3. What are the projected changes in existing system stressors as a result of the projected climate change impacts? 4. Are they likely to get worse, stay the same, or improve as a result of climate change impacts? Or, do new system stressors emerge altogether? Further, it is important to recognize that these climate effects may have strong seasonal and regional Further, it is important to recognize that these climate effects may have strong seasonal and regional signatures (e.g., excessive summertime drought conditions in the Southwest)\u037e it is critical to capture these signals to adequately assess vulnerability (Mehdi et al., 2006). Element Three: Estimate Future Vulnerabilities. How vulnerable a system is to climate change can be determined by (1) estimating how sensitive the system is to climate change and (2) how resilient the system is to change (Turner et al., 2003). A system is considered sensitive to climate change if the system is likely to be affected by the projected climate scenarios (Snover et al., 2007). This step will draw from the findings of element two which describes how the projected climate effects affect the current and newly introduced system stressors and uses this information to identify system vulnerabilities. This step may further rank the associated impacts through a quantitative or qualitative process, using rankings such as high, medium, or low, enabling decision makers to prioritize the future impacts (Snover et al., 2007). In addition, estimates of vulnerability will include the system's adaptive capacity (i.e., how well can the system sustain the climate effects with minimum disruption or cost) (Snover et al., 2007). Key considerations for evaluating adaptive capacity include (Snover et al., 2007): 1. Is the system already able to accommodate changes in climate? 2. Are there barriers to a system's ability to accommodate changes in climate? 3. Is the system already stressed in ways that will limit the ability to accommodate changes in climate? 4. Is the rate of projected climate change likely to be faster than the adaptability of the system? 5. Are there efforts already underway to address impacts of climate change related to the system? Table 1 is an example of a vulnerability assessment conducted for various planning activities (Snover et al., 2007). The vulnerability scenarios may be broken into sectors such as the potential effects on environmental, social and economic systems. Here the vulnerability of pavement to extreme heat events is analyzed qualitatively: the pavement is considered to be extremely sensitive to the heat event, yet the decision makers have opportunities to cope with the consequences leading to a moderate level of vulnerability. Policymakers can use this type of ranking system to assess and prioritize the vulnerability of planning areas or impacted systems. Once future vulnerabilities are assessed, adaptive approaches can be developed in response to the increased vulnerabilities or new opportunities, and noregrets adaptation strategies can be identified (Mehdi et al., 2006). Depending on the level of the assessment, the identification of adaptation options may occur as part of a more quantitative risk management approach and/or in the context of a dedicated adaptation planning effort\u037e both of these approaches are described in the following sections. In fact, the Canadian Climate Impacts and Adaptation Research Network (CCIARN) expanded upon this three element approach described above by prefacing these three elements with stakeholder involvement and adding a final step of identifying adaptation strategies when outlining the elements of a vulnerability assessment (Mehdi et al., 2006). This demonstrates the grey lines that exist between these different assessments and approaches. "}, {"section_title": "Examples of Vulnerability Assessments", "text": "The following summarizes studies that have utilized some aspect of the vulnerability assessment methodology outlined above in the approach and highlights each study's key findings. Systems and Infrastructure: Gulf Coast Study, Phase I (CCSP, 2008) Synthesis and Assessment Product (SAP) 4.7 focuses on the Gulf Coast and examines the potential impacts of climate change on vulnerable transportation systems and infrastructure. This study follows many of the steps described in the methodology section including the assessment of current vulnerabilities, estimating future climate conditions and identifying the associated projected vulnerabilities. Future projections of climate will vary depending on the choice of emission scenarios (i.e., various scenarios describing how emissions of greenhouse gases will change over the projected years in response to changes in policies, population growth, economic development, etc.). This report estimates future conditions using climate models driven by a variety of emissions scenarios from the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), including the lowemissions B1 scenario, the midrange A1B scenario, and the highemissions A2 scenario. The AIFI scenario was also added to the SRES scenarios to assess the impacts of sea level rise."}, {"section_title": "Synthesis and Assessment Product 4.7: Impacts of Climate Change and Variability on Transportation", "text": "These scenarios examined climate impacts in 2050 and 2100. The climate impacts on transportation infrastructure assessed in this study rely on the combination of an understanding of historical climate trends and future projections from general circulation models (GCM). Factors of existing transportation infrastructure were considered in assessing future climate changes. For example, sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100 were factored against land surface elevation and subsidence rates of sample sites. In the case of increasing temperatures, transportation analysts have identified several specific attributes of temperature change of concern in transportation planning: \"changes in annual days above 32.2 \u00b0C (90\u00b0F ) and maximum high temperature, for example, will impact the ability to construct and maintain transportation facilities. Concrete loses strength if it is set at air temperatures greater than 32.2 \u00b0C and the ability of construction workers and maintenance staff to perform their duties is severely curtailed at temperatures above 32.2 \u00b0C degrees\" (CCSP, 2008). This study finds highways, ports, and rail infrastructure are particularly vulnerable to projected sea level rise and future storm surges (see Table 2 for sample results). In addition, the maintenance of infrastructure (such as rail and highways) is projected to be vulnerable to increasing temperatures while bridges are projected to be especially vulnerable to changes in precipitation and flooding.  (CCSP, 2008). This type of vulnerability assessment can be replicated in other regions as the climate scenarios are applicable worldwide and the results can be incorporated into regional vulnerability assessments relying on regional expertise and existing infrastructure inventories. The bridges most impacted by the storms are found to be the numerous bay and river crossings throughout the region. Several bridges were completely destroyed, while others sustained significant damage. The vulnerability of these roads and bridges are attributed to the storm surge and wave action from the storms, as well as problems with structural design. Roadways were likewise inundated and damaged by these storms resulting in roadway weakening and sinkholes requiring reconstruction and improvements. The analysis also includes a discussion of the cost of infrastructure repair. Requests for emergency repairs to Mississippi highways after Katrina totaled approximately $580 million. The Louisiana Recovery Authority estimates that the cost of rebuilding transportation infrastructure damaged by the hurricanes would cost $1518 billion. These estimates provide some indication of the potential expense that would occur if hurricane frequency and/or intensity increase as the climate changes. (Harvey et al., 2004) This Australian report uses a vulnerability assessment to investigate how projected climate effects will affect road infrastructure. The climate effects were projected based on the IPCC SRES A2 scenario providing temperature, precipitation and moisture for 2100. This paper focuses on select road system components including: pavement performance, road use demand, and road design and maintenance\u037e additional modeling tools were utilized to make the connection between climate projections and road system component (e.g., Pavement Life Cycle Costing (PLCC) model, and the Highway Development and Management Version 4 (HDM4) model). In order to undertake the vulnerability assessment, the following road system datasets were utilized: road inventory data, traffic information (e.g., annual average daily traffic), pavement type (e.g., materials, strength, thickness), and pavement condition (e.g., age, initial pavement roughness)."}, {"section_title": "Impact of Climate Change on Road Infrastructure", "text": "This study finds significant state variations in the change of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation costs as a result of climate variation and population and transport demand levels. In addition, there is a small decrease (between 0% and 3%) in the required pavement maintenance and rehabilitation budget based solely on change in climate factors. This result reflects the generally warmer and drier Australian climate which reduces the rate of pavement deterioration. structures, and buildings. The report provides an assessment of vulnerability based on case studies. In the case of transportation infrastructure (i.e., roads and associated structures), the locations analyzed include the City of Greater Sudbury, Ontario, and the City of Edmonton, Alberta. The engineering vulnerability assessment conducted in these two case studies employed a sophisticated three dimensional analysis of infrastructure components including how the components respond to climate events and the particular set of climate events under consideration. Examples of the factors considered in these case studies are presented in Table 3 below. Key findings of transportation infrastructure vulnerabilities to climate change include: (1) infrastructure systems studied were generally resilient to discrete, onetime, climate events\u037e and (2) infrastructure systems were particularly vulnerable to longterm cumulative impacts. (Tighe et al., 2008) A Canadian study conducted a case study analysis of pavement sensitivity to temperature and precipitation. Specifically, this report analyzes pavement performance over a 20year period using the MechanisticEmpirical Pavement Design Guide (ME PDG) to determine how climate changes in precipitation and temperature will affect the pavement performance indicators of international roughness index (IRI), longitudinal cracking, transverse cracking, alligator cracking, asphalt concrete (AC) deformation, and total deformation.

Pavement deterioration will be significantly accelerated by climate change (Smith et al., 2008). Pavement performance will require maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction to occur earlier in pavement design life. Commission, 2009) This report assesses the vulnerability of San Francisco Bay and its shoreline to the impacts of climate change, identifies information needs for future vulnerability assessments, and suggests nearterm and longterm strategies to address climate change impacts. For this assessment, two IPCC scenarios were used to report on climate change impacts in California : A2 (a higher emissions scenario) and B1 (a mediumlow scenario). Researchers used the A2 and B1 scenarios to run multiple global climate computer models and performed additional research to project specific climate changes in California . Two sea level rise estimates were selected for analysis in this report: a 16inch (40 cm) sea level rise by midcentury and a 55inch rise in sea level by the end of the century (SFBCDC, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Living with a Rising Bay : Vulnerability and Adaptation in San Francisco Bay and on its Shoreline ( San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development", "text": "Many of the major roads and highways within the Bay region may be significantly impacted by sea level rise and extreme flooding events due to their proximity to the Bay and the Pacific Ocean . Approximately 99 miles of the major roads and highways within the region are vulnerable to a 16inch rise in sea levels (by midcentury) and approximately 186 miles of major roads and highways are vulnerable to a 55inch rise (by the end of the century). Some roads and highways will be subjected to other impacts, such as erosion from increased storm activity. These types of impacts have been shown to undermine existing structures, which can substantially increase maintenance costs. Supporting structures of many of the region's bridges may also be vulnerable to unanticipated, prolonged contact with corrosive salt water (SFBCDC, 2009). This study considers the vulnerability of regional transportation infrastructure to climate change to be \"High\" as there are many highways are adjacent to the Bay and crossing the Bay. Flooding of these highway segments in the regional transportation network would disrupt the movement of goods from ports. Approximately 99 miles of the major roads and highways within the region are vulnerable to a 16 inch rise in sea levels (by midcentury) and approximately 186 miles of major roads and highways are vulnerable to a 55inch rise (by the end of the century).

While this assessment does not take into account long term climate changes or variability, this assessment may be useful for providing a vulnerability assessment methodology framework for the highway system."}, {"section_title": "Risk Assessment", "text": "The concept of risk is not new to transportation planners, designers, engineers, managers, community stakeholders and policymakers\u037e however, the application of risk assessment methods in the context of climate change is relatively new. The purpose of a climate change risk assessment is to identify hazards that may be caused or exacerbated by climate change, and to assess the likelihood and relative consequence of these hazards in order to prioritize responses and mitigate risks (NZCCO, 2004)\u037e where the term \"hazards\" refers to perturbations and stresses (Turner et al., 2003). A climate change risk assessment can help identify noregrets climate change adaptation options, that is, the uncertainty associated with the stressor is very low warranting implementation of adaptation options (Willows and Connell, 2003 Risks vary spatially and temporally. At present, risks are not consistent regionally or even locally, and will differ down to the specific asset in question. Additionally, risks faced today at a given location may change in the future, dependent upon climatic changes, management decisions, and the implementation of adaptation measures, for example. Scale. As the ultimate goal of a climate change risk assessment is to inform the decisionmaking process, risk assessments need to be carried out at an appropriate scale in order to support that processspatially (e.g., national, regional, local), temporally (e.g., present day to 2050, 2050 to 2100, etc.), and also in terms of ability to satisfy data requirements in order to complete the assessment. Uncertainty. Natural variability and knowledge gaps are sources of uncertainty, which should be considered in the risk assessment process. Communication. The outputs of a risk assessment should be communicated to relevant decision makers and to the public, as appropriate. (adapted from NZCCO, 2004) Climate change risk assessment can be a tool for enhancing the resilience of the transportation network (CCSP, 2008). Weather conditions are becoming increasingly variable due to climate change, which translates into additional risks that have the potential to carry financial, environmental, and social costs related to longlived transportation infrastructure assets (Fankhouser et al., 1999). For example, a financial \"side effect\" of bearing this increased risk may include difficulty in financing climatesesitive projects (Frankhouser, et al., 1999). Identifying potential climaterelated hazards and prioritizing atrisk infrastructure in the context of other risks currently under consideration by policymakers is critical in assessing whether or not adaptation is appropriate, and if so, when and where to focus adaptation efforts. In the context of climate change risk assessment, riskis best defined as the combination of two elements: (1) the likelihood of an event occurring (e.g., flooding, hurricane, heat wave, etc.), and (2) the consequence of such an event (e.g., moderate highway flooding resulting in disruption in services for several days) (NZCCO, 2004). In developing quantitative risk assessmentsand related riskbased indices as a tool for prioritizing risks, risk can be more precisely defined as the product of the probability and the consequence of a given event (i.e., risk = probability x consequence) (Snover et al., 2007). Several fundamental concepts apply to any climate change risk assessment process (see Box 2 )."}, {"section_title": "General Methodologies", "text": "Methodologies for conducting risk assessment (i.e., incorporating tools and approaches to prioritize the potential impacts of climate change) can vary depending upon resources and information available. In the literature, risk assessment approaches fall into two distinct classes based on the availability of data and effort and are discussed here as the Tier 1 assessment and the Tier 2 assessment.\nThe IPCC discussed adaptation strategies in its first assessment report in 1995. Despite acknowledgement that adaptation strategies were needed, action on climate change adaptation is still in its infancy. The literature is relatively sparse, but growing with respect to systematic descriptions of adaptation approaches compared to vulnerability and risk assessment methodologies (Heinz, 2007). Through our literature review, we have compiled a series of core steps that may be considered within an adaptation approach based on the information gathered from a limited number of reports (IPCC, 2007\u037e Willows and Connell, 2003\u037e Snover et al., 2007\u037e U.S. EPA, 2009. It is assumed this methodology will continue to evolve as planners begin to incorporate climate change into their decision making processes. Interestingly, adaptation approaches are extremely broad and are likely to include qualitative screening assessments, some quantitative risk assessments, policy and implementation actions, as well as outreach and communication efforts. As officials and managers of natural and human systems are finding, adaptation is an extremely farreaching concept, requiring a wide range of activities and skillsets. As the literature has noted, planning for climate change requires building and improving partnerships, soliciting expert assistance, partnering with funding organizations, and convening advisory groups (Snover et al., 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Tier 1 Preliminary Risk Screening / Qualitative Risk Assessment", "text": "The primary elements of a preliminary risk screening, or a more detailed qualitative risk assessment include (Snover et al., 2007\u037e NZCOO, 2004 Is any lifeline infrastructure located within the area (e.g., hospitals, ports, key transportation or network utilities which provide lifeline connections for which there is no alternative)?

The evaluation of the likelihood and consequence of climaterelated impacts provides policymakers with some guidance on the level of risk and may be based upon a literature review or expert survey (Snover et al., 2007). The risk can be determined for a given system or program and focuses on a defined set of stressors (such as climate change effects). The analysis for a given system or program can be divided into endpoints of interest such as environmental, human health, and financial where each endpoint has its own risk table. The risk product for each stressor and endpoint reflects the level of risk for policymakers. Table 4 describes a qualitative approach of assessing risk of hazardous events and describes how risk associated with an event is categorized (adapted from NZCCO, 2004\u037e CSIRO et al., 2007\u037e IPCC, 2007. For example, an event that is very likely to occur and produce catastrophic consequences has a high level of risk associated with it (illustrated below in red). Alternatively, an event that is not likely to occur and, if it were to occur, would produce very little damage would be considered a very low risk (illustrated below in white). Ideally, the risk thresholds of the policymaker are also incorporated into the design of the evaluation. For example an extreme climate event such as intense rainfall events may be considered rare but the actual impacts may be very severe and may warrant a greater degree of associated risk than the findings of the evaluation (Willows and Connell, 2003).  2004\u037e CSIRO et al., 2007\u037e IPCC, 2007 The consequence of impact for the risk table can be determined for each endpoint of interest described in Box 4 . The likelihood of impact and/or severity of the stressor on the system or program for each endpoint of concern can be assessed and described also according to a qualitative scale (Snover et al., 2007). For example, \"very likely\" may refer to an event or stressor that occurs repeatedly across multitude of regions and/or within one region but continually over time\u037e \"likely\" may refer to an event or stressor that has occurred in a particular location more than once\u037e and so on. For climate projections, it may be more appropriate to also include scientific literature that provides some indication of the potential magnitude of an event or stressor opposed to relying on historical observations. A Tier 1 analysis can help ensure that climaterelated stressors are included in the decision process at an early stage (Willows and Connell, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Box 4 .

Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) does attempt to associate probabilities with specific hazardous events (e.g., storm surge). Further, some approaches attempt to superimpose incremental climate related hazards on existing hazards in order to assess potential changes in frequency and severity in the future (Jacob et al., 2000). Methods or frameworks for quantitatively assessing and prioritizing risks and direct and indirect Methods or frameworks for quantitatively assessing and prioritizing risks and direct and indirect consequences, or probable losses, due to climaterelated impacts are not well established. However, models do exist to help understand existing natural hazards that may be exacerbated by climate change and to quantify damagee.g., the HAZUSMH Hurricane Wind Model is a scenariobased model that draws upon National Weather Service forecasts and enables analysis of economic and social losses from hurricane winds at the state and local levels\u037e or, for example NOAA's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model, which is used to estimate storm surge heights and wind speeds based on historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes (CCSP, 2008). Additionally, some state DOTs have developed mathematical models to prioritize bridges for retrofitting based on their seismic vulnerability and their importance as \"lifelines\" (see WSDOT Bridge Seismic Retrofit Planning Program). For example, the WSDOT \"priority index\" is expressed as: Where \"A\" describes the criticality of the route, \"C\" describes the vulnerability of each bridge to seismic failure and \"I\" is between zero and 100 representing the relative priority of Washington state. The subcomponents of the criticality factor \"A\", which are represented as numerical coefficients, include: interstate route vs. all other routes\u037e length of available detour routes\u037e criticality of the route itself as a detour route\u037e whether or not the bridge carries essential utility lines\u037e etc. This methodology for assessing criticality may be a useful approach when prioritizing climaterelated risks to transportation infrastructure. The coefficients for the seismic vulnerability factor \"C\" are: a coefficient describing the likelihood and severity of seismic activity within state subregions based on historical data\u037e a factor representing the remaining service period of the bridge\u037e and, a factor representing the structural vulnerability to seismic activity of the bridge, which involves an assessment of the superstructure, substructure, foundation, and soil conditions for each. In contrast to managing seismic risks, climate change impacts usually involve complex interactions of multiple climaterelated effects. For example, in some areas coastal flooding will become more frequent and more severe due to the confluence of rising sea levels, storm surge, and heavy precipitation events, which introduces a high degree of uncertainty in judgments about specific climaterelated impacts. While assessing seismic risks is a similar exercise to assessing climaterelated risks in terms of uncertain timing, location, and severity of the hazard, data on seismic activity is more readily assimilated into impactanalysis because the singular effect(i.e., an earthquake of a given magnitude) more directly translates into a given impact(i.e., infrastructure damage due to the earthquake) based on historical data. For these reasons, while the framework outlined above is instructive, it may not be feasible to follow precisely without thorough consideration of interacting climaterelated effects, and consideration of how these effects might accelerate or otherwise change in the future. 3.  HACCAS, 2008) The United Kingdom has developed a sevenphase process for assisting transportation decisionmakers in addressing climate change impacts on highways. This approach provides methodologies for vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, and adaptation. Developed by the United Kingdom Department for Transport (DfT) Highways Agency, Highways Agency Adaptation Strategy Model (HAASM) is a seven phase, systematic approach that identifies and manages the transportationrelated activities projected to be affected by a changing climate to assist transportation decisionmakers in the development of the Highways Agency Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (see Box 5 ). This framework draws upon UK climate projections and practical templates, schedules, and guidance of assessments for vulnerability, risk, and adaptation options. The first step of the framework defines the objectives and decision making criteria to then be used throughout the process. The next two steps help transportation decisionmakers identify the climatic trends that may impact the highway agency and the associated vulnerabilities. In step 4, each vulnerability identified receives a riskranking based on a risk appraisal scoring using four primary criteria: (1) uncertainty, (2) rate of climate change, (3) extent of disruption, and (4) severity of disruption (see Table 5 ). Step 5 and 6 then prioritize the results of step 4 determining the timescales for action and highlighting the priority areas requiring early involvement through adaptation strategies (see Table 6). Early rounds of implementation of the HAASM have identified more than 80 Highways Agency activities that may be affected by climate change. A preliminary appraisal of the risks associated with these vulnerabilities has been undertaken finding that over 60% of them are expected to be affected by current predicted levels of climate change within the relevant asset life or activity time horizon. 3.2.1 Infrastructure and climate change risk assessment for Victoria , Australia (CSIRO et al., 2007) This report includes a Tier I infrastructure risk assessment for Victoria , Australia and implements the New Zealand risk management guidebook (NZCOO, 2004). The study assesses the risk for various types of infrastructure against a range of climate change variables. Each climate change variable in the report is described in terms of a worstcase scenario for low and high climate change projections for 2030 and 2070 while assuming no adaptation between now and then. Each infrastructure category, including transportation infrastructure, was assessed in terms of the impact of climate change on physical infrastructure assets, the services they provide, their value as a \"social amenity\", and the impact on operations, maintenance, repair, and replacement. The primary transportation infrastructure types include roads, rail, bridges, tunnels, airports and maritime ports. In the transportation infrastructure risk summary, risk scenarios and ratings (i.e., low, moderate, high risk) were assigned to each transport type for 2030 and 2070. Roadrelated risks include: asphalt degradation due to increased solar radiation and increased variation in wet/dry spells and decrease in available moisture\u037e flood damage to roads due to increases in extreme daily rainfall and increases in frequency and intensity of storms (see Table 7 and Table 8 ).

This risk assessment found an increase of sea level rise of less than 1 meter by 2100 increases the frequency of coastal flooding by factors of 2 to 10 by 2100. The report appendix provides a description of a, \"\u2026basic probabilistic hazard definition,\" and its applicability in probabilistic risk assessment, which is a more detailed, mathematical approach to probabilistic risk assessment. However, as previously noted, a more detailed probabilistic approach requires detailed, locationspecific data on climaterelated effects, physical infrastructure characteristics (including detailed vulnerability data), and direct and indirect infrastructure value.

(Winter et al., 2008) This study investigates the potential impacts of mudslides associated with the recent and projected increase in seasonal intense storm events in Scotland . Changes in the frequency and annual timing of heavy precipitation events have a direct impact on the debris flow that causes mudslides. The risk assessment is a GIS based assessment using maps to represent debris flow as a function of water conditions, vegetation and land cover, stream flow, and slope angle. Groundtruthing was employed through site specific studies. The study suggests two approaches for reducing the climate impact: exposure reduction through outreach and road closures, and hazard reduction through road protection, minimizing the opportunity of debris flow, and road realignment. Mudslides are not confined to Scotland but are of global concern. The Canadian Climate Impacts and Adaptation Research network (CCIARN) hosted a workshop to discuss and identify the impacts of landslides, adaptation and risk management and future needs associated with future climate projected in Canada to include increased water, steepness, and intensity of storms (CCIARN, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Mudslide Hazard Assessment", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "AdaptationAssessment", "text": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines adaptation as the \"adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities\" (IPCC, 2007)\u037e that is, adaptation enhances resilience or reduces vulnerability to observed or projected changes in climate (PPIC, 2008). Reducing vulnerability may address one or many of the projected impacts of climate change. For example, elevating coastal roads reduces vulnerability to the impacts of anticipated sea level rise\u037e or investing in coastal protection infrastructure reduces coastal vulnerability to storm surges and anticipated sea level rise (IPCC, 2007). Alternatively, adaptation may increase a system's resilience to future impacts through the fortification of structures or implementing measures to increase a system's ability to bounce back after an impact (Turner et al., 2003). An adaptation assessment is defined by the IPCC as \"the practice of identifying options to adapt to climate change and evaluating them in terms of criteria such as availability, benefits, costs, effectiveness, efficiency and feasibility\" (IPCC, 2007). Longterm planning can prepare for potential climate changes and address the uncertainty with changing conditions. For example, roads and bridges are designed to be maintained and replaced in a certain time frame. Incorporating improvements in design and maintenance can enhance the lifetime expectancy of this infrastructure, and improve resilience to climate impacts."}, {"section_title": "2007).", "text": "Identify Adaptation Responses.There are three types of adaptation responses relevant to transportation planning which address climate impacts at varying time scales: protect, retreat and accommodate (CCSP, 2008). These responses can be put into practice through investing in infrastructure and technology or changes in management approaches (PPIC, 2008\u037e CCSP, 2008: Protect includes such options as redesigning the infrastructure or instituting measures to reduce the climate impact (such as armoring against storm surges). Retreat includes abandonment of the infrastructure. Accommodate includes operational strategies that can be implemented to reduce the climate impact (such as pumping water after a flood event). In some cases, these options are not implemented until predetermined climate change thresholds are observed or are until an established time frame is reached. Proactive or anticipatory options take place before the impacts of climate change are observed, this includes a \"no regret\" option (IPCC, 2007). A no regret option applies to a decision option that is determined to be worthwhile now (in that its immediate benefits exceed its costs), and continues to be provide benefits with or without changing climate conditions (Willows and Connell, 2003). This is in contrast to the generally more expensive reactive adaptation which describes actions that take place in response to already occurring climate change (Mehdi et al., 2006). Partnership building with other communities. (Snover et al., 2007) Determine Appropriate Adaptation Action. Adaptation actions may be either incorporated into existing policies, practices and procedures through some modification or, in some cases, new policies, practices, and procedures will need to be created (Snover et al., 2007). According to the Climate Impacts Group (CIG) at the University of Washington (2007), modification to existing policies, practices and procedures should: allow regular reevaluation and adjustment in accordance with changing conditions\u037e require planning that is not based strictly on the past, and does not restrict certain decisions to certain periods or seasonal patterns\u037e and reinforce trends that reduce vulnerability or increase adaptive capacity. On the other hand, climate change adaptation can be incorporated into existing planning through modifying zoning codes, land use planning guidance, or emergency planning. Select and Prioritize Actions.Adaptation assessments may identify a wide variety of potential options for considered action. In order to prioritize and select among these options, planners may consider a range of criteria including: the timeframe of risk\u037e design life of the infrastructure at risk\u037e cost of action/inaction\u037e the likelihood of the action to reduce risk\u037e the timeframe for implementation\u037e and other constraints or limitations (Snover et al., 2007) (see Box 7 for more discussion). Implementing Actions. Once particular actions have been identified, a plan for implementation is developed. Implementation may include nearterm operational and maintenance responses or longerterm developed. Implementation may include nearterm operational and maintenance responses or longerterm design strategies (see Box 6 ). Implementation is often the most difficult stage of adaptation to accomplish. Plans may languish on the shelf unless the actions identified in the plan are tied to specific actors and timelines for implementation. In many cases, implementation will require input and cooperation from several actors inside and outside the relevant transportation agency."}, {"section_title": "Box 7 . Tools for Determining Appropriate Adaptation Actions", "text": "Timeframe of risks: The timeframe for projected impacts (e.g., shortterm, midterm, longterm) can be assessed relative to the timing of management decisions and actions (U.S. EPA, 2009). The severity and probability of projected impacts can also be factored into this analysis (see section on risk assessment) and compared to the timeframe available for implementation of action. Costbenefit considerations: The potential costs associated with an action is compared to the potential benefits the action will provide (Bueno et al., 2008\u037e Stanton and Ackerman, 2008\u037e Williamson et al., 2008. Decision makers will have to determine the time frame to be considered for benefits (i.e., some benefits of adaptation options may not be seen until climate impacts occur). Constraints or limitations: Various limitations or constraints may affect the decisionmaking process. These factors can be considered prior to implementation. These may include regulatory, operational, political, or legal constraints. In many cases, planners will develop strategies for overcoming these barriers in preparation for implementing adaptation actions (U.S. EPA, 2009). Measuring Progress.Ideally, any adaptation plans will incorporate regular evaluation of adaptation effectiveness and consideration of new or better information on climate effects (U.S. EPA, 2009). Standards for evaluating effectiveness may need to be developed and reevaluated in order to facilitate the periodic evaluation process. The timeframe for measuring progress in climate change preparedness will depend on: the nature of the vulnerabilities and risks that are addressed in priority planning areas\u037e the planning horizon, investment rules and/or other factors related to a given capital project or system in a priority planning area\u037e and organizational planning and budget cycles (Snover et al., 2007). Over time, climate change data and information used to develop planning goals may need to be updated based on new research. Climate change plans and actions will also need to be regularly updated once new information has been reviewed and basic assumptions have been examined (Snover et al., 2007). While these considerations provide a general methodology for assessing adaptation options, individual organizations may vary in the specific application of this process. For example, the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme (Willows and Connell, 2003) identifies a threetiered approach for analyzing actions: Tier 1 a systematic qualitative analysis, where the size, significance and relative importance of the risks, costs and benefits for each option are described. There should be an emphasis on ranking the options in terms of costs and benefits, but this may not involve quantification. Tier 2 a semiquantitative analysis, where some aspects of the risks, costs and benefits are assessed in quantitative terms while others are assessed qualitatively\u037e the assessment would aim to assess uncertainty by placing upper and lower bounds on the risks, costs and benefits. Tier 3 a fully quantitative analysis, where the probable performance of each option in managing the risk is quantified in terms of costs and benefits and, in some cases or where possible, converted into monetary terms."}, {"section_title": "Examples of Adaptation Action in the United States", "text": "Some states and communities have begun to integrate climate change adaptation into their planning process as illustrated in Box 8 ."}, {"section_title": "Alaska Climate Change Strategy ( Alaska Climate Change Strategy, 2008)", "text": "Alaska 's Public Infrastructure Technical Working Group identified the following actions as part of the Alaska Climate Change Strategy (2008) in order to address climate impacts on Alaska 's transportation infrastructure: Ensure that climate change is considered as part of Alaska 's State Transportation Plan\u037e Develop an inventory of potentially impacted infrastructure\u037e Evaluate and address damage to highways, roads, and bridges from thawing permafrost and coastal and river erosion\u037e Add additional planning scrutiny to future infrastructure investments in undeveloped hazard affected coastal areas\u037e Integrate critical area planning requirements with comprehensive planning laws, including emergency planning, emergency evacuation routes, and infrastructure planning requirements.

This report lays out the specific priority policy recommendations of the ARWG to address shortand longterm adaptation and response measures, planning and policy integration, education and outreach, performance measurement, and, where necessary, new legislation and/or modifications to existing laws.

State and local governments must commit resources and time to assure progress."}, {"section_title": "Adaptation Options for Transportation Infrastructure", "text": "According to the National Research Council's (NRC) Potential Impacts of Climate Change on U. S. Transportation: Transportation Research Board Special Report 290 (2008), adaptation to climate change within the transportation sector falls into three categories of actions: operational changes, design changes, and other actions. Table 7 demonstrates the findings of a number of studies investigating adaptation options for transportation infrastructure and is organized by climate impact. Climate variability and extreme events, such as storms and precipitation of increased intensity, will require changing operational responses from transportation providers. While U.S. transportation providers require changing operational responses from transportation providers. While U.S. transportation providers already address the impacts of weather on transportation system operations in a diverse range of climatic conditions, existing planning does not take into account longterm changes in climate. Operational changes may include (NRC, 2008): adjusting maintenance (both in the timing and type of maintenance)\u037e improved monitoring of conditions (both climatic and infrastructure conditions)\u037e incorporating climate scenario modeling into infrastructure planning\u037e modifying procedures for emergency management\u037e and altering construction schedules. In general, operational changes will apply to procedural planning at varying degrees of adjustment. For example, greater use of technology such as climate scenario modeling can enable infrastructure providers to monitor climate changes and receive advance warning of potential failures due to changing conditions (such as water levels and currents, wave action, winds, and temperatures) exceeding what the infrastructure was designed to withstand (NRC, 2008). While transportation planning efforts do take weather conditions into account in the design of infrastructure, there is less examination of whether current design standards are sufficient to accommodate climate change (NRC, 2008). For example, the drainage capacity of road infrastructure often incorporates consideration of a 100year storm event. However, climate projections indicate that current 100year storm events are likely to occur more frequently (such as every 50 or perhaps even every 20 years) by the end of the current century (NRC, 2008). In this case, design standards for drainage would need to be updated to consider these changing conditions. Examples of design strategies include (NRC, 2008): improving materials or developing new materials\u037e using alternative methods\u037e upgrading current systems with improvements in design\u037e and enhancing protection. Similarly, FEMA maps are often used to support development decisions, including citing roads. Because FEMA maps do not reflect projected climate change impacts, including effects of climate change on floodplain designations, roads may be established in areas that are highly vulnerable to flooding in the future. Larsen et al. (2007) employs a bottomup approach to monetize the costs and benefits of adapting through strategic redesign and replacement in Alaska . This study uses climate change projections for the nearterm and farterm to estimate the replacement of statewide infrastructure and compares these estimates with what would be anticipated in the absence of climate change. The study determines the cost of adaptation through the redesign and replacement of airports, bridges, harbors, major roads, and railroads in response to permafrost melt, sea level rise, accelerated coastal erosion, increased flooding and increased fire risk. Benefits are realized over the long term as agencies will have greater opportunity to incorporate adaptation options into the state infrastructure planning (as planning practices evolve and infrastructure replacement opportunities arise) and include the reduction of costs that would have been realized had proactive adaptive strategies not been implemented. Kirshen et al. (2006) also uses a bottomup approach to estimate the impact of climate change on various infrastructure sectors in metro Boston . The study compares three adaptation scenarios including a proactive scenario, a reactive scenario, and no adaptation scenario. The costs of the climate impact sustained through loss of service and repair/replacement are calculated as well as the adaptation costs associated with adjusting infrastructure systems and services to avoid the climate impact. Interestingly, this study allows for the interrelation of climate impacting one infrastructure sector that in turn adversely impacts a secondary infrastructure structure, suggesting studies which focus on a single sector may minimize the actual costs. This study finds proactive adaptation optimally minimizes the costs associated with climate impacts In addition to operational and design changes, other types of adaptation options are available for transportation infrastructure. Transportation planning and land use controls, especially concerning new construction and development, can integrate projected climate changes into the planning process. For example, development can be restricted or prohibited in zones most at risk from storm surges, flooding, and sea level rise. In addition, longrange planning and promoting crossagency collaboration are two examples of other potential adaptation actions for transportation planning (NRC, 2008). Simpson et al. (2007) investigates the suitability of current culvert infrastructure in the White Brook watershed in Keene , NH to meet the projected increased frequency of heavy precipitation events. GCM projections are used to represent the changing climate. The assessment finds almost half of the culverts were undersized and will require upgrading.
