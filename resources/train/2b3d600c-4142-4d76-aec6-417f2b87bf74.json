[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. The Western Mediterranean Sea is often subject to intense winds, especially during the winter season. The effects of the enhanced enthalpy and momentum fluxes on the upper ocean is investigated using sea surface temperature and sea surface height observational data products in the period 1993-2014. The maximum surface cooling associated with the anomalous ocean heat loss, with upwelling, and with diapycnal mixing is shown to occur a couple of days after the intense wind event, to be dependent on the wind intensity and to persist for over a month during winter, when deep water is formed, and for about 10 5 days during summer, when the thermocline is very shallow. The sea surface height signal reaches a minimum in correspondence of the intense wind, and normal conditions recover in about six weeks. Unlike for intense winds in the tropics, associated to tropical cyclones, no long term sea surface height anomaly is observed, indicating that the water column heat content is not significantly modified."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "Intense winds typically leave a cold wake on the surface of the ocean. The surface cooling is related to three different processes, their relative importance being dependent on the wind properties (Price, 1981; . First, air-sea fluxes of sensible and latent heat, that are typically an enthalpy loss for the ocean, monotonically increase with wind speed. Second, the action of the winds induces a surface intensified current, whose vertical shear generates instability and produces vertical mixing with the underlying water, which is typically colder than the surface water. Third, when the winds are associated with 15 a synoptic or mesoscale cyclonic pattern in the atmosphere, the generated Ekman flow leads to horizontal divergence at the surface and upwelling of deeper and colder water.\nThe overall net effect of the three processes is surface cooling. Studies on tropical regions have investigated the cold wake left at the ocean surface by tropical cyclones (for a systematic study see , revealing that the amplitude of the cold surface anomaly depends on the intensity of the winds, on the translational speed of the atmospheric pattern causing 20 them, and crucially on the stratification properties of the upper ocean (Mei et al., 2012; . Furthermore, the SST recovery time scale has been estimated on the scale of a couple of weeks (Sanford et al., 2007; Price et al., 2008; , as an effect of anomalous air-sea fluxes and mixed layer baroclinic instabilities associated with the front induced by the localized mixing (Boccaletti et al., 2007; Mei and Pasquero, 2012) .\nWhile the surface signature disappears within a few weeks, the subsurface warming associated with the wind intensified vertical mixing survives for a much longer time, resulting in a long term warming effect of tropical cyclones on the water column (Emanuel, 2001; Sriver and Huber, 2010; Jansen et al., 2010; . As proposed in the cited works, the net long-term warming of the water column due to the action of the intense winds in the tropical regions can affect ocean heat transport and impact processes that depend on ocean heat content. These studies have however been limited to the tropical 5 regions, while little attention has been given to extra-tropical environments.\nThe aim of this work is to perform the same type of analysis in the Mediterranean Sea. This region is of special interest mainly because it is extremely peculiar in the sense that deep water formation occurs at the end of the winter season in its Western part, in particular in the Gulf of Lions, affecting the thermal properties of the water column, as documented for the first time by the MEDOC experiment (MEDOC GROUP, 1970) . The stratification of the Western Mediterranean shows in 10 fact a strong seasonal variability. The Mediterranean mixed layer depth (MLD) seasonal variability is characterized by a basin scale deepening from November to February-March and an abrupt restratification in April, which is maintained throughout the summer and early autumn (D'Ortenzio et al., 2005; Houpert et al., 2014) . Deep water formation is driven by particularly intense dry winds acting above the doming isopycnals generated by the cyclonic circulation present in the Gulf of Lyons, which shallow the mixed layer and allow for the erosion of the upper ocean stratification related to the intrusion of warm and salty"}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "Levantine Intermediate Water (MEDOC GROUP, 1970; Schott et al., 1994) . A systematic analysis of the short and long term effects of intense wind events on the properties of the Western Mediterranean Sea is lacking. With this work we perform this analysis exploiting high resolution observational datasets for surface winds, sea surface temperature and sea surface height.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present the observational datasets and describe the statistical analysis we have performed in order to identify the intense wind events and evaluate their impact on the state of the upper ocean. In Section 20 3 we discuss the results of this analysis. We first describe the short term (few weeks) behavior of sea surface temperature and sea surface height anomalies just after the occurrence of the intense wind event, both locally and area averaging over a region with the typical size of the dynamical structures responsible for the intense winds. We then study the persistence on seasonal scale of the signature that strong winds generate on the upper ocean. In Section 4 we draw our conclusions and discuss the implications of our findings. \nThe wind dataset extends from July 1987 to July 2015, the sea surface temperature dataset from 1981 to November 2016, the sea surface height dataset from January 1993 to December 2016. We have therefore limited the analysis to the overlapping period 1993-2014.\nThe average wind intensity over the Mediterranean region computed from the CCMP dataset shows a strong non-stationarity across the 1993-2014 period. The average kinetic energy of the winds increases by a 20% factor during this time period. This is 20 likely to be a bias of the dataset, caused by inhomogeneities in the assimilation procedure used to merge the ERA-Interim first guess with observations (Ross Hoffman, personal communication) . Due to the non stationary number of observational data, observations tend to weight more in the estimate towards the end of the time period, while in the first part the ERA-Interim background field dominates the average. Since ERA-Interim has a coarse spatial resolution, it tends to underestimate wind intensity extremes with respect to observations. More intense wind events are thus observed in the second half of the time 25 period rather than in the first half. Using the CCMP dataset to study climatic trends at global and regional scale (Zheng et al., 2016) , at least in the Mediterranean area, is therefore questionable. This issue is of relatively little concern for our analysis though, as we are not interested in the temporal changes of the statistics of wind intensity. Having artificially weaker extreme winds in the first period of the dataset leads to miss events happening at earlier times, hence to have a poorer statistics overall, but does not affect our results otherwise. See Appendix A for a more in depth discussion on this issue.

The version of OISST we consider uses as relevant satellite SST sensor the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), which, as an infrared instrument, can make observations at relatively high resolution but cannot see through clouds.\nDaily mean sea height anomalies over the Mediterranean with a spatial resolution of 0.125\u00b0for the period 1993-2016 were obtained from the Copernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS, http://marine.copernicus.eu/) . They are produced from the SL-TAC multi-mission altimeter data processing system. Optimal Interpolation is applied to all altimeter 5 fields in order to obtain gridded sea level anomalies merging all the satellites data.\nSea surface wind data are taken from the V2.0 Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP, http://www.remss.com/measurements/ ccmp) gridded surface vector winds product (Atlas et al., 2011; Wentz et al., 2015) . The V2.0 CCMP processing merges Remote Sensing System (RSS) radiometer wind speeds (SSM/I, SSMIS, AMSR, TMI, WindSat and GMI), QuikSCAT and ASCAT scatterometer wind vectors, moored buoy wind data, and ERA-Interim model wind fields using a Variational Analysis Method 10 (VAM, Hoffman et al. 2003) to produce 6 hourly maps of 0.25\u00b0degree gridded vector winds. VAM combines RSS instrument data with moored buoy measurements and a starting estimate of the wind field, provided by the ERA-Interim reanalysis winds.\nAll wind observations (satellite and buoy) and model analysis fields are referenced to a height of 10 meters.\nWe have remapped the sea surface height data on the coarser 0.25\u00b0grid of the winds and sea surface temperature by bilinear interpolation. The wind data have a time resolution of 6 hours, while sea surface temperature and height are provided daily.\nComposite SSHA starts decreasing well before, 10 to 15 days, the occurrence of the strong wind event, much earlier than the SSTA signal. This is likely not related to the passage of the atmospheric dynamical structure itself, and it is unlikely that it is due to some interpolation procedure in the creation of the dataset. The same feature has been observed in a similar analysis of the effect on SSHA of the passage of hurricanes in the Tropics (Supplementary Information in ), but to our knowledge no explanation has been given yet.\nThe SSHA signal shows a sensitivity to the intensity of the wind, with an area averaged drop peaking at -12 mm for winds stronger than 16 m/s and at -17 mm for winds stronger than 20 m/s. The minimum SSHA is reached exactly at the occurrence of the intense wind events, while for SSTA it was a few days later. Clearly this difference might be in part due do the interpolation 5 procedure to obtain spatially and temporally uniform fields, but the physical mechanism at the base of the signal can also be relevant: SSH responds to enthalpy fluxes and Ekman pumping, which impact the sea level on short timescales, while the signal in SST requires mixing that develops by shear instabilities and convection, which require time to develop.\nWinter SSHA shows a similar initial recovery period as SSTA: it increases for the first 60 days, and is significantly different from zero, according to the uncertainty estimate, at least for the first 40 days. Thanks to the fact that the SSHA is less noisy 10 than SSTA, it is more clear the appearance of an oscillation on a period of about 20 days, whose nature remains unclear, but whose presence appears ubiquitous in our composite analysis.\nDuring the summer season, no significant SSHA is detected, due to the large fluctuations associated to the low number of events occurring during this season (see fig. 3b ). It might also be that the signal is smaller during summer than winter because events are not associated to synoptic scale cyclones and the Ekman divergence is smaller. with an exponential fit, does not significantly depend on the wind intensity.\nWe have also analyzed sea surface height. The response of sea surface height anomalies is characterized by a drop of a few cm, caused by divergent Ekman flow induced by the cyclonic wind stress during the passage of the storm and also to the evaporative enthalpy loss . The signal is particularly evident during winter, when the cyclonic nature 15 of the synoptic scale perturbation in which the strong winds are embedded is responsible for a large Ekman divergence.\nThe amplitude of the SSHA depends on the wind intensity. The recovery time is consistent with what found for sea surface temperature anomalies, and does not depend on the wind intensity. Unlike for the tropics, where intense winds associated with tropical cyclones are responsible for long term warming of the upper ocean, no long term SSHA signal is observed. This is probably related to the very different stratification of the water column: In the tropics a warm mixed layer is present at the 20 surface and intense winds mix water at the thermocline, bringing warm water down which, after the upper layer returns to normal conditions, is responsible for a net increase of the water column heat content . In the Gulf of Lyons, on the other hand, the very weak winter stratification prevents the burial of heat in the lower layers as the mixing water is nearly homogeneous in temperature. Thus the SSHA returns to zero after a few weeks.\nIt would be interesting to further characterize the upper ocean response to intense winds in terms of the salinity. This will 25 become possible in the next future, when satellite missions will have collected several years of sea surface salinity data.\nThe impact of the strong winds during a storm on the state of the upper ocean can lead to memory effects influencing the coupled atmosphere-ocean system at different time scales. In the Tropics, this extends to seasonal time scales: it has been shown that hurricanes on the long term pump heat into the ocean leading to a warming detectable 4-6 months after the event (Emanuel, 2001; Sriver and Huber, 2010; Jansen et al., 2010; . This work shows that in the Western Mediterranean this 30 process is not at play,\nOutside the Tropics, and specifically in the Western Mediterranean area, it has been shown in a modeling case study (Lebeaupin Brossier et al., 2013 ) that a strong wind event can influence weather on a time scale of a week through the signature on the SST and its consequent impact on the air-sea fluxes. Similarly, air-sea coupling on sub-monthly time scale has been found to be important in the modulation of heavy precipitation events in this and other regions of the Mediterranean in a climatic modeling study (Berthou et al., 2016) .\nOur work confirms from observational data that the signature of intense wind events on the state of the upper ocean in the region persists for weeks, and has the potential to influence air-sea processes on different time scales. The fact that surface thermal anomalies persist for at least 30 days, confirms thus the potential of (sub-)monthly scale feedbacks. (red line of figure A1 ). In the previous version of the CCMP product (version 1.1, light blue) the trend is even stronger, as the estimate at later times is close to the estimate of the new product, while they 10 differ at the beginning of the time period. However, such signal appears not to be present in other observational dataset that are part of the assimilation process of the CCMP product.\nWe have considered the same annual average of KE in the ERA-Interim reanalysis (which is used as first guess or background field for the CCMP estimate), in the SSM/I radiometer data (http://www.remss.com/missions/ssmi/) and in the ASCAT scatterometer data (http://www.remss.com/missions/ascat/). Additionally, we have compared these results with a 30 years long 15 run of the atmospheric regional model WRF in non-hydrostatic setup, at 4 Km horizontal resolution, forced with ERA-Interim data (Pieri et al., 2015) .\nAverage KE appears to be stationary in ERA-Interim ( The presence of this spurious trend makes questionable to use the CCMP dataset for studying global and regional trends, at least in the Mediterranean region, despite having be used sometimes for this purpose in the recent past (e.g. Zheng et al., 2016) . For our study however this is not a serious issue, as we are not interested in the statistics of wind speed by itself. The underestimate of strong winds at earlier times results in our case simply in missing intense wind events in the first part of the dataset (indeed we observe that about two thirds of intense wind events are found the second half of the considered period)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Intense wind events characterization", "text": "The intensity and frequency of winds in the Mediterranean region has a strong seasonal dependence. Strongest winds typically occur during the winter months, when the region is subject to the extratropical storms typical of the mid latitudes: about 90% of the events within the upper fifth percentile in terms of wind intensity occur between November and March, and very few 5 occur during the summer months from June to August. This aspect, together with the fact that the upper ocean conditions have a strong seasonal cycle which can lead to different ocean responses to intense winds in different seasons, is at the basis of the focus of the analysis presented in this paper to what in the following we call \"winter\", that is the 5 months period from\nNovember to March, and we include some summer (June, July, August) results for completeness only.\nFrom the CCMP dataset we consider the instantaneous 6-hourly surface wind velocity vector \u2212 \u2192 u (\u03c6, \u03bb, t 6 ) at latitude \u03c6, longi-10 tude \u03bb and time t 6 .

Maximum values are found in the area of the Gulf of Lions in the Western Mediterranean, with secondary maxima present in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nWe limit the analysis to the area characterized by u 95 > 15 ms , for a temporal 15 coordinate (t 6 ) and for at least one couple of spatial coordinates (\u03c6, \u03bb) within the region inside the closed solid line in fig. 1 .\nFurthermore, the wind dataset has a time resolution of 6 hours, while sea surface temperature and sea surface height have a time resolution of 1 day. For this reason, we define an intense wind day a day in which there is at least one intense wind event, as previously defined. Each intense wind day is assigned to the winter or summer dataset depending on its date of occurrence, t i , with i = 1, .., N , and with N=N w , N s the total number of intense wind days in the winter and summer datasets, respectively.

In the composite averages we mix values of the observable from different years and different calendar days, which are statistically not equivalent due to long term variations and seasonal cycle. Therefore, we remove from the sea surface temperature and the sea surface height locally at each point (\u03c6, \u03bb) the long term linear trend and the seasonal cycle. We refer to the detrended and 25 deseasoned sea surface temperature anomaly and sea surface height anomaly as SSTA and SSHA respectively.\nLet us consider a generic surface observable O(\u03c6, \u03bb, t), in the following either SSTA or SSHA, with t at daily resolution.\nWe compute its average over the Gulf of Lions, and then consider its time evolution before and after the day of occurrence of an intense wind event, at a time lag \u03c4 .

These values correspond to 122 and 11 days featuring at least one intense event. Therefore, statistical robustness is expected only for low values of the threshold. The area covered on average by intense winds every day recorded as intense wind day is also substantially smaller, dropping form 38% for a=16 m s "}, {"section_title": "Composite analysis of SSTA", "text": "The composite average of the time evolution of winter SSTA before and after the occurrence of intense wind events, computed for the different values of the threshold is shown in figure 2a .

Note that the drop actually starts slightly before the occurrence of the intense wind event. This signal might be due to the fact that SST are provided daily in the OISST 5 dataset, but they have been obtained by performing a bias adjustment using a spatially smoothed 7-day in situ SST average, which might anticipate the temporal signal (Reynolds et al., 2007) . Additionally, weather conditions favoring surface cooling are probably present in the days preceding the individual days with intense winds as those are usually embedded in a synoptic scale perturbation, and during wintertime winds have a temporal correlation of about a week (not shown).\nThe cooling in correspondence of the anomalous winds can be in principle related to three mechanisms: the enhanced en- The values of the SST anomalies are very small, consistent with the fact that the deep water formation region in the Gulf of Lions is usually very weakly stratified during the winter season. Strong winds bring up deep water, but this is only marginally colder than the water above. Similarly, enhanced enthalpy fluxes associated with intense winds have a minimal impact on the SST reduction when the loss is shared among the whole water column and not limited to a surface layer.\nAfter reaching a minimum a few days after the occurrence of the strong wind, SSTA slowly returns to zero. Two time scales 5 seem to be involved. A first roughly exponential recovery is followed by a series of oscillations. SSTA returns to a statistically stable state after about 100-120 days. The relaxation time scale of the first recovery is about 40 days, computed by fitting with an exponential the SSTA composite average in the first 60 days after the maximum of the drop, and does not depend on the value of the threshold. The first recovery period lasts for about 60 days, at the end of which the system has not yet properly reached a state that is zero compatibly with the error bars. A subsequent oscillation on a period of about 20 days follows, even 10 if the extremely noisy nature of the signal makes it difficult to interpret its behavior after the first 60 days.\nFor completeness, we report in fig. 2b also the results of the analysis relative to the summer months (June through August).\nThe signal is noisier than for the winter case due to the limited number of events but it is clear that the maximum SST anomaly is one order of magnitude larger than for winter events, reaching values of about 2.5K for the strongest winds (note the different scale in the temperature axis). Clearly, the strong stratification typical of summer months (D'Ortenzio et al., 2005) 15 is responsible for the large drop in SST as the shallow strong stratification favors the upwelling of water several degrees colder than the surface water. The initial recovery time scale is about ten days, much shorter than during winter, probably because the large short wave radiation input quickly re-stratifies the water column. It remains to be determined whether a warm anomaly survives below the surface for longer times, as it happens for tropical cyclones."}, {"section_title": "Composite analysis of SSHA", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "Sea surface height is influenced by both dynamical and thermodynamical processes related to the occurrence of the strong wind.\nThe inverse barometer effect associated with the low pressure system that typically embeds these events can be responsible for a small increase in the sea level.

This is likely due to the fact that SSHA is a vertically integrated measure which depends on the thermal properties of the entire water column, and it is thus less sensitive to the fast fluctuations of the surface fluxes due to weather activity. Beside that, the general behavior of the SSHA signal qualitatively resembles that of the SSTA signal, with some notable differences."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Since we study the response of the state of the upper ocean to intense wind events, and since we can safely assume that the nature of this interaction has not changed with time, we only have a problem of loss of statistics rather than of biasing.\nCompeting interests.
