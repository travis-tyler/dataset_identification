[{"section_title": "", "text": "For many students, the end of 8th-grade signals the beginning of a transition period. During this time, students and parents make many decisions about high schools, courses of study, and extracurricular school activities that will influence the 8thgrader's postsecondary education or occupational plans. It is also realistic to hypothesize that a decision to participate in high school varsity sports at the 8thgrade may lead to participation in intercollegiate sports at the highest levelNCAA Division I. At the Division I level, football teams face off in the Rose or Orange bowls and basketball teams strive to make it to the \"Final Four.\" This report examines youth participation in both high school and intercollegiate varsity athletics by following a cohort of 8th-graders through high school and the first two years of postsecondary education. Participation in intercollegiate varsity sports is reported separately for three groups of students. The first group is all 1988 8thgraders who were followed from 8th-grade through two years after scheduled high school graduation (including dropouts). The second group is those 8th-grade cohort members who completed high school (high school graduates). The third group is those 1988 8th-graders who attended 4-year colleges by 1994 (students attending 4year colleges). For the approximately 3 million students enrolled in 8th-grade in 1988, was it realistic to dream about participation in intercollegiate sports at 4-year colleges?' For most, the answer seems to be no. The proportion of 1988 8th-graders reporting participation in intercollegiate sports' at 4-year colleges is small. By 1994 (two years after scheduled high school graduation), 5.2 percent (52 out of each 1,000 students) actually reported participation in intercollegiate sports at 4-year colleges. This proportion is reduced to 2.2 percent (22 out of each 1,000 students) if participation at NCAA Division I schools' is examined separately. For these Division I athletes, these numbers may be further reduced if only student-athletes receiving athletic aid are considered. According to data supplied by the NCAA, 48 percent of all NCAA Division I athletes in 1992/93 received athletic aid.' Other highlights of this analysis include:"}, {"section_title": "U.S. Department of Education Office of Educational Research and Improvement", "text": "NCES  EST COPY AVA1LA ,e) LE Males from the 8th-grade class of 1988 were almost twice as likely as females (2.8 percent as compared to 1.5 percent) to report participation in intercollegiate sports at NCAA Division I schools. High socio-economic status (SES) students were 10 times as likely to report participation at Division I schools as were low SES students (5.0 percent compared to 0.5 percent). Black students were just as likely as white students to report participation in intercollegiate sports at Division I schools (2.5 percent for blacks and 2.3 percent for whites). Among the high school graduates from the 8thgrade class of 1988 (group 2): Elite high school varsity athletes' were much more likely to report participation in intercollegiate sports at NCAA Division I schools (10.5 percent) than were other senior varsity athletes (4.5 percent), other varsity or junior varsity athletes (1.2 percent), or those who did not report being varsity or junior varsity athletes (0.3 percent). Three out of each 10 (30.4 percent) elite high school varsity athletes from advantaged backgrounds (high SES) reported participation in intercollegiate sports at 4-year colleges. Among elite high school varsity athletes, those from more advantaged backgrounds (high SES) were 3.5 times more likely to report intercollegiate athletic participation at NCAA Division I schools as were those from less advantaged backgrounds (low SES) 14.7 percent as compared to 4.1 percent. Among the students attending 4-year colleges from the 8th-grade class of 1988 ( athletics by members of the 8th-grade class of 1988. For each student who participated in the study between the years 1988 (base-year) to 1994 (third follow-up), participation status was examined for both high school varsity sports and intercollegiate varsity sports. A student was classified as participating in intercollegiate athletics if he/she attended a 4-year college and reported participation in intercollegiate athletics. For purposes of this analysis, four types of 4year colleges have been identified. Using data9 supplied by the NCAA, codes identifying Divisions I, II, and III were attached to the 4year college identification codes of colleges attended by NELS:88 students. Four-year colleges that did not have a NCAA code were classified into the category \"other.\" There are 955 colleges that are classified into the three NCAA divisions (Division I -305 member schools; Division II -260 member schools; and Division III -390 member schools). According to the 1994/95 NCAA manual, a Division I college \"strives in its athletics program for Given the high level of participation in varsity level sports in high schools across the country today and the scarcity of openings on athletic teams at 4-year colleges, students with collegiate athletic aspirations need to begin planning early. First, these students must develop athletic skills that will allow them to participate on their high school teams. Second, they must begin planning early to meet the strict academic requirements specified by the NCAA for freshman eligibility if they plan to participate in intercollegiate athletics at NCAA Division I schools.'\u00b0 Both of these factors, participation in high school varsity sports\" and academic eligibility as defined by NCAA's Propositions 48 and 16 are examined in this report. Since other factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, and family socio-economic status (SES) may also be related to final participation, these factors are also examined."}, {"section_title": "Participation by gender", "text": "Males reported participation in intercollegiate sports at higher rates than females across all 4year colleges (6.6 vs. 3.7 percent)'2 (see Group 3 (other athletes) included individuals who did not report participation in varsity sports as a senior, but did report participation in varsity athletics as a sophomore or in junior varsity athletics. Group 4 (non-athletes) included individuals who did not report participation in high school varsity or junior varsity athletics in either sophomore or senior years. Using this classification system, this report compares elite varsity athletes to other varsity and junior varsity athletes and non-athletes. For those students participating at the \"elite\" level of varsity athletics in high school, almost 1 out of each 4 (24.5 percent) reported participation in intercollegiate athletics at 4-year colleges by 1994 (see table 2). This participation rate was greater than the rate for (1) other senior varsity athletes, (2) other athletes or (3) nonathletes (24.5 percent as compared to 10.5, 3.3, or 0.8 percent respectively). If participation is limited to NCAA Division I colleges, 1 out of each 10 \"elite\" varsity athletes reported participation compared to 1 in 20 for other senior varsity athletes."}, {"section_title": "Participation by high school varsity athletic participation and SES", "text": "For those 8th-grade cohort members who were classified as \"elite\" varsity athletes, more advantaged students (as measured by SES) were more likely than less advantaged students to report participation in intercollegiate sports at 4year colleges (high SES = 30.4 percent; middle SES = 22.2 percent; low SES = 13.6 percent). This means that 30 out of each 100 elite varsity athletes from advantaged backgrounds (high SES) reported participation in intercollegiate athletics while about 14 out of each 100 elite low SES students reported this same outcome.

About 22 out of each 1,000 students from the See technical appendix for more detailed information on institution \"attended longest\" as compared to \"first\" or \"last' institution attended. In creating this variable (participation in intercollegiate athletics at 4-year colleges), the NAME OF INSTITUTION ATTENDED LONGEST was checked to determine if it was a 4-year institution. If it was a 4-year institution, then student responses to \"VARATH\" were In a 1995 report \"Participation Statistics Report,\" the NCAA reported that there were 2,735,784 full-time students in NCAA Division I schools. The report further reported that. 123,751 (4.5 percent) of these students participated in intercollegiate athletics. Before this number can be compared to the NELS:88 data (11.5 percent overall participation rate) though, it is important to point out that not all college-level varsity sports participation reported by NELS:88 are among the 21 administered NCAA championship sports (e.g., table tennis, rugby, bowling). The NELS:88 questionnaire item for varsity sports participation did not specify that the sports had to be NCAA sanctioned. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that some students responding \"yes\" to participation in intercollegiate sports did not actually participate in NCAA sanctioned sports. It may also be possible that a student participated his/her first year (or semester) in college, but not the current year (or semester). Intercollegiate sports supported by the NCAA As reported on page 114 of the NCAA report \"Participation Statistics Report,\" men participated in 19 major sports including baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey , lacrosse, rifle, skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor track, outdoor track, volleyball, water polo, and wrestling in Division I sports. The seven most popular sports were football, baseball, outdoor track, indoor track, soccer, basketball; and cross country. It should be noted that not all sports are supported by each of the 305 NCAA Division I colleges. For example, only 10 colleges support men's skiing. As reported on page 115, women participated in 15 sports including basketball, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, indoor track, outdoor track, and volleyball. The seven most popular sports were outdoor track, indoor track, basketball, cross country, swimming, volleyball, and softball. Under NCAA's Proposition 48freshman eligibility for Division I sportsa potential college athlete must have a high school GPA (Grade Point Average) of 2.0 in eleven core subjects and a minimum SAT score of 700 (ACT score of 17). Under Proposition 16 (implemented August, 1996), the number of core courses increase to 13 and a sliding scale is used to determine eligibility. For example, while a student with a 2.0 GPA must have a SAT score of 900 (ACT score of 21), a student with a GPA of 2.5 only needs to have a SAT score of 700 (ACT score of 17). In the following section, specific requirements of the non-centered version of recentering, the NCAA has approved a recentered score of 820 to be equivalent to a score of 700 on previous tests. For this publication, a SAT score of 700 will be used as the cut-off because the SAT tests taken by the members of the 1988 8th-grade cohort were administered prior to 1993. 9. The listing supplied by the NCAA included mailing labels for Division I, II, and III member colleges. It should be pointed out that it is possible for a member college to be on the Division I mailing list, but not be at the Division I level in all sports. 10. The actual NCAA application process for Division I schools involves (1) the high school attended by the high school student athlete, (2) the student athlete, and (3) the NCAA Clearinghouse. The Clearinghouse serves as the gate keeper in the process by evaluating information provided by the high school and the student athlete applicant. This group determines who is a qualifier, partial qualifier, or nonqualifier (see 1995-96 NCAA Manual, Section 14.02.9). Information provided by the applicant's high school includes descriptions of the courses offered by the school. The NCAA Clearinghouse evaluates these course listings and makes a determination as to which can be used to satisfy the 13 core courses required by Proposition 16. The NCAA HOTLINE number is 1-800-638-3731. The student athlete applicant must also fill out an application that states the applicant's intention to participate in varsity sports at the collegiate level. The NCAA Clearinghouse keeps applicants advised as to their status on meeting the freshman eligibility requirements. In addition, applicants can use the NCAA automated phone number by entering their personal ID number to receive a message as to their status. For those students who do not meet the core course or GPA requirements at the end of eight semesters in high school, the student athlete loses one year of eligibility at If taken prior to April 1, 1995 'If taken on or subsequent to April 1, 1995 16. The question may be raised as to why 11.4 percent of all Division I college athletes do not meet the NCAA Proposition 48 requirements for athletic eligibility. It is possible that the NCAA Clearinghouse process and the NELS:88 researchers could reach different conclusions for a given NELS:88 student as to athletic eligibility for a NCAA Division I school for several reasons: For example, because students are allowed to take the SAT/ACT tests multiple times, it is possible (but not likely) that The NELS:88 Baseline comprised a national probability sample of all regular public and private 8th grade schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the 1987-88 school year. During the base year data collection, students, parents, teachers, and school administrators were selected to participate in the survey. A total of 24,599 8th-grade students participated in the base-year survey (93 percent response rate). The NELS:88 first follow-up survey was conducted during the spring of 1990. Students, dropouts, teachers, and school administrators participated in the follow-up, with a successful data collection effort for 17,424 individuals in the student survey (approximately 93 percent response rate). Prior to data collection, the sample was freshened with tenth-grade students who did not have the opportunity to be in the 8th-grade sample during the base-year (e.g., out of country). During second follow-up data collection activities (1992), data were collected from students, dropouts, parents, teachers, school administrators, and extant high school transcripts. Again, as was done in the first follow-up, the sample was freshened. In addition, high school transcripts were collected. During third follow-up data collection activities (1994), data were collected from 14,915 respondents (94 percent response rate). As of 1994, these respondents had taken many different paths that included (1) dropping out of high school, (2) high school graduation, (3) entry into the world of work, (4) entry into postsecondary education, and (5) family formation. For those going on to postsecondary education, information was collected on type of college attended and activities experienced while in college. One of these activities was participation in intercollegiate sports. For those NELS:88 students attending 4year colleges, information provided by the NCAA (i.e., type of NCAA collegeDivision I, II, or III) was merged onto respondent records."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the sample used for this report", "text": "The student sample used for this study included all NELS:88 8th-grade students who remained in the study through third follow-up.

Characteristics of retained students and students with incomplete data For this analysis, the distribution of 1988 8thgrade students who were (1) retained for this analysis (\"complete cases\"), and (2) excluded because of incomplete data (e.g., status could not be determined or imputed \"incomplete cases\") were compared.
