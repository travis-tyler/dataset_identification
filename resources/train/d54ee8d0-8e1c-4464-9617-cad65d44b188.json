[{"section_title": "Brief Methodology", "text": "As a supplement to its 2011-2016 AGEP award, SREB received funds from the National Science Foundation to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Institute's impacts. The evaluation began with a survey sent to all 2011-2016 Institute attendees who were enrolled as graduate students during at least one Institute (n=1,900). For participants whose survey invitations were returned as undeliverable, efforts were made to locate and contact them through web and social media searches. When updated contact information was obtained, survey invitations were resent to the addresses provided. Reminders to complete the survey were sent twice in biweekly intervals, and all respondents received a $5 gift card as a participation incentive. Ultimately, 711 completed surveys were received, reflecting a 37.4% response rate. However, it was determined that some surveys were duplicates from the same individual or lacked responses to more than 50% of items. When duplicate surveys were received, the first submission was retained for analysis. Surveys with fewer than 50% of items responded to were excluded from analysis. Thus, the final data set consisted of 625 unique surveys, reflecting a final response rate of 32.9%. Surveys were administered in a web-based format that included \"branching\" items as a function of participants' prior responses. The net effect of branching was that respondents still enrolled in Ph.D. programs (n=291) were not asked to respond to items on attained employment and post-graduation experiences. Likewise, respondents no longer enrolled in Ph.D. programs (n=334) were presented with fewer items related to their degree programs. For both groups, survey items elicited information in three general categories: (1) perceived value for and impact of experiences within the Institute, (2) academic and career outcomes, including degree completion, desired/attained type of employment, and assessments of the extent to which they were prepared by various experiences for their employment, and (3) demographic information, including race/ethnicity, gender, family education history, and current income bracket. Drawing on identifying information and survey responses, participants also were matched to their publication records in Elsevier's Scopus database to assess levels of scholarly productivity. Some names could not be disambiguated during the matching process (e.g., common name with insufficient institutional or disciplinary information to be certain of correct match), so those cases were withheld from productivity analyses, yielding a subset of the sample (n=549). Survey responses were analyzed in several ways. First, descriptive statistics were computed for all participants, and by discipline, race/ethnicity, and gender. For items completed by both current students and alumni, response patterns were compared to assess the extent to which perceived Institute outcomes might differ. For all appropriate survey items, participant responses were demographically matched and compared against national baseline data collected through the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR; National Center for Educational Statistics, 2018) using data from 2012-2016 to avoid conflating differences in historical trends with differences between Institute participants and SDR respondents. Items were considered appropriate for comparison if identical or highly similar wording was used between the two surveys. Due to item response format (3-or 5-option Likert), most SDR comparisons were performed using a two-way chi-square (\u03c7 2 ) test, with statistical significance examined for both the omnibus test and residuals within individual cells. In other words, the frequencies of response in each category were compared between the SDR data and the data collected from Institute attendees. Overall differences between the two samples were assessed across response categories using an omnibus test, and differences within categories were assessed through analysis of residual values. P-values less than 0.05 and chi-square values greater than 2.0 were considered to reflect differences not attributable to chance."}, {"section_title": "Demographics", "text": "Among respondents overall, 64% of participants identified as Black/African-American, 25% Hispanic/Latino, 7% American Indian/Alaska Native, 4% Asian, and 0.7% Native Hawaiian (see Figure 1).

Nearly all alumni respondents reported having full-time employment (only 16 were unemployed). How much did the knowledge and skills attendees attributed to participation in the Institute help to prepare them for their current jobs, compared with the professional preparation provided by their Ph.D. programs? As shown in Figures 9 and 10, more participants rated the Institute as preparing them \"extremely well\" for their current professional roles than their Ph.D. programs. Still, the majority of respondents indicated their Ph.D. programs prepared them \"extremely well\" (n=125) or \"very well\" (n=146) for their current positions (mean=2.07; SD=1.00) (see Figure 9). As shown in Figure 10, when asked how well the Institute improved their preparation for their current job, respondents also were highly positive: The majority of responses were \"extremely well\" (n=132) or \"very well\" (n=133). Respondents were asked about their experiences since completing their Ph.D. programs and the extent to which they might make the same choices in their preparation if they had to start over. Specifically, they were asked whether they would take the following steps again: pursue a Ph.D. in general, pursue a Ph.D. in the same field, choose the same institution, and choose to attend the Institute. Figure 11 shows that respondents were more likely to select \"Definitely would\" for the Institute than any other aspect of their preparation. (\u03c7 2 =195.4, p<0.001). "}, {"section_title": "Professional Preparation", "text": "To assess the extent to which Institute participation is associated with perception of preparation for employment attained following degree completion that may differ from national trends, data from alumni with degrees in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines were compared against SDR data aggregated for the 2012-2016 period. SDR data for 2011 were not used, as Institute alumni who were not students for at least one year of the NSF award period were excluded from this study. The SDR survey asked participants to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" on whether their Ph.D. training prepared them for their current employment, but the Institute survey asked for responses on a 5-point Likert scale [\"extremely well (1)\" to \"poorly (5)\"]. To make the comparison, the Institute survey's Likert range was reduced to two categories by pooling the 1 and 2 responses (mapping to \"yes\" in the SDR survey) and the 4 and 5 responses (mapping to \"no\" in the SDR survey). Values of 3 from the Institute survey were withheld from the analysis. Institute respondents were asked to rate how well their Ph.D. program and their Institute participation, respectively, prepared them for their current job. Responses did not differ significantly between Ph.D. programs and Institute. However, Institute alumni reported that their participation in the Institute prepared them for their current employment significantly more frequently than SDR participants indicated that their Ph.D. programs prepared them for their current employment (\u03c7 2 =71.2, p<0.001). This finding was the same across all gender and racial/ethnic subgroups, as shown in Table 9. Participants also were asked to assess how well their Ph.D. programs and their experiences at the Institute respectively prepared them to apply specific knowledge, skills, attributes, and behaviors. These were: (1) applying research methodologies, tools, and techniques; (2) grant writing; (3) research ethics and scholarly integrity; (4) developing new ideas, processes, or products rooted in research; (5) critically analyzing and evaluating findings and results; (6) demonstrating a theoretical and practical understanding of their subject matter; (7) working constructively with colleagues; (8) influencing others; (9) communicating clearly and persuasively in writing; (10) communicating clearly and persuasively when speaking; and (11) communicating clearly and persuasively to a wide variety of audiences. The profiles of responses for each skill are shown in Figures 12 and 13. Figure 12 shows respondents' perceptions of their Ph.D. programs. Figure 13 shows their perceptions of learning outcomes from the Institute. A chi-square analysis contrasted the likelihood of each response level for each knowledge category between the Ph.D. programs and the Institute to assess the extent to which the Institute added value to the overall doctoral training experience in terms of specific learning outcomes for respondents. The results, summarized in Table 10, indicate that participants reported better preparation related to research skills (e.g., applying research methodologies, research ethics, and critically analyzing results), as expected. However, respondents indicated that they received equal preparation in working with colleagues and communicating clearly when speaking. Perceptions of grant writing skill preparation were mixed. Further, the Institute was rated as significantly more effective in preparing respondents to influence others and communicate clearly to a variety of audiences. "}, {"section_title": "Comparative Analyses of Current Students vs. Alumni", "text": "The responses of current students and alumni are contrasted to determine if there are meaningful differences between the two groups. As survey responses are inherently perspectival, it is expected that those perspectives might differ as a function of relative position along a professional trajectory. Respondents' needs and concerns are likely to differ as a function of whether they are engaged as a graduate student or a member of the workforce. Further, it is possible that some knowledge and skills addressed by the Institute may have more salience for those who are current, rather than prospective, members of the workforce. The first comparison examined respondents' differences in the value and usefulness of Institute sessions. Only three sessions yielded significant differences: Mentoring Relationships (\u03c72=13.2, p=0.009), Communicating about Your Research (\u03c72=13.5, p=0.011), and Developing Your CV (\u03c72=12.3, p=0.015). In each of these comparisons, the frequency differences of Likert-scale response categories (\"Extremely [1]\" to \"Not at all\" [5]) driving the significant outcomes were the \"Moderately (3)\" category. For all three, current students were disproportionately more likely to rate their perceived value for the session as moderate than their counterparts who had completed the Ph.D. The second comparison examines respondents' differences in their confidence to use the knowledge and skills they gained from the Institute sessions. Seven sessions yielded significant chi square tests indicating differences in value: Academic Integrity and Ethics (\u03c7 2 =10.8, p=0.029), Career Options for the Ph.D. (\u03c7 2 =11.4, p=0.023), Mentoring Relationships (\u03c7 2 =16.5, p=0.002), Communicating about Your Research (\u03c7 2 =21.5, p<0.001), Completing the Dissertation (\u03c7 2 =28.5, p<0.001), Postdoctoral Experiences (\u03c7 2 =9.9, p=0.042), and Interacting with Difficult Colleagues (\u03c7 2 =10.1, p=0.039). In each of these comparisons, the frequency differences of Likert response categories (\"Extremely [1]\" to \"Not at all\" [5]) driving the significant outcomes were the \"Moderately (3)\" or \"Slightly (4)\" categories. For all of these, current students were disproportionately likely to rate their confidence in their ability to effectively use the knowledge and skills from the session as moderate than their counterparts who had completed their Ph.Ds. In some cases, alumni also were more likely to respond \"Extremely (1)\" confident. Such patterns are not surprising given the additional academic and professional successes of alumni (e.g., successful defense of dissertation, obtaining gainful employment). The third comparison examines respondents' differences in how much they felt Institute sessions have contributed to their academic and professional success. Seven sessions yielded significant chi square tests indicating differences in value: Career Options for the Ph.D. (\u03c7 2 =9.9, p=0.043), Mentoring Relationships (\u03c7 2 =13.9, p=0.008), Developing Your CV (\u03c7 2 =9.6, p=0.047), Academe and Society (\u03c7 2 =11.8, p=0.019), Communicating about Your Research (\u03c7 2 =16.2, p=0.003), Completing the Dissertation (\u03c7 2 =11.0, p=0.027), and Issues for Women of Color (\u03c7 2 =11.6, p=0.020). In each of these comparisons, the frequency differences of Likert response categories (\"Extremely [1]\" to \"Not at all\" [5]) driving the significant outcomes was the \"Moderately (3)\" category. For all of these, current students were disproportionately likely to rate the session's contribution to their success as moderate than their counterparts who had completed the Ph.D. This may be attributable to the fact that academic and professional successes are still in formative stages for students. In addition, for the Career Options for the Ph.D. and for Mentoring Relationships sessions, alumni were generally more likely to give positive ratings to the sessions' contributions to their success (i.e., 1-2 range), which again is not surprising given the centrality of navigating early career employment and reliance on mentors' recommendations in that process. For the survey question asking about the overall importance of attending the Institute to their success, the response patterns of students and alumni did not differ significantly. Similarly, the item asking respondents to rank sources of value for the Institute did not differ between groups of respondents."}, {"section_title": "Alumni Professional Outcomes", "text": "To assess the extent to which Institute participation is associated with professional outcomes that may differ from national trends, data from alumni with degrees in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) disciplines were compared against data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), aggregated for the 2012-2016 period. SDR data for 2011 were not used, as alumni who were not students for at least one year of the NSF award period were excluded from the study. The construction of most items permitted direct comparison between collected survey data and SDR data based on high similarity or exact match of item wording and identical response scales. In some instances, the Institute survey's Likert range exceeded that of SDR (e.g., 5 response categories vs. 3 response categories).

Across these sectors, the distribution of Institute alumni differed significantly from the SDR baseline, with significantly more alumni entering the 4-year College/University and Non-U.S. Government sectors and significantly fewer entering the Business/Industry, Federal Government, and State/Local Government sectors (\u03c7 2 =1540.0, p<0.001). Table 11 provides sector-specific actual and expected counts for those with significant differences between Institute and SDR participants, along with chi-square values for each cell. In these sectors, there were also significant differences by gender between Institute alumni and SDR respondents overall. Female Institute alumnae were significantly more likely to work in the 4-year College/University sector than female SDR respondents, and male Institute alumni were less likely than their male SDR counterparts (\u03c7 2 =14.9, p<0.001).

Chi square analyses were conducted for three groups: less than $50,000 per year, $50,000-$89,999, and $90,000 or more per year. Reported income differed significantly between Institute alumni and the SDR baseline respondents only for the $90,000 or more group. For respondents earning at least $90,000 per year, the overall difference was significant, with \u03c7 2 =7.9 and p=0.019.

Overall, Institute alumni and SDR respondents differed significantly in their employment activities (\u03c7 2 =36.4, p<0.001). Table 17 shows the differences in primary job responsibilities, with \u03c7 2 values reported when differences are statistically significant. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Findings", "text": "Overall, the findings presented in this report indicate that participants find great value in the Institute for Teaching and Mentoring, both as current students and in retrospect after completing the Ph.D. Alumni further identify areas in which they feel their professional preparation from the Institute met or exceeded the preparation from their doctoral programs. Current students and alumni both identify specific sessions as differentially valuable in contributing to their academic and professional success. However, they also are consistent in their prioritization of \"sense of community\" as the most important aspect of the Institute, followed by \"professional network,\" with skill development most commonly ranked third. The most unique outcomes from this evaluation are those that compare the professional readiness and employment outcomes of Institute alumni against respondents to the SDR from the same years. These comparisons provide a clear picture of how Institute alumni fare in their professional endeavors following the completion of their doctorates. While several important indicators suggest that Institute participants do not exceed the SDR's baseline data, it is vital to consider the limitations of disaggregation. For example, it was not possible to disaggregate available data by race/ethnicity in all cases. When SDR did not enable such comparisons, analyses examine the success of Institute alumni who responded to the survey (77% Black, 32% Hispanic) against a sample that is predominantly White (52%; 7% Black; 10% Hispanic). Accordingly, findings of no significant difference overall or by gender in fact show that historic gaps in academic and employment success are closing for Institute participants. One such finding is that the rate of female Institute alumnae attaining faculty positions is greater than the baseline rate for SDR respondents. Beyond being a positive outcome in its own right, it indicates that women of color who attended the Institute are disproportionately successful in securing faculty positions compared to a majority-White sample. It should be noted, however, that these positions are less likely to be tenured or tenureline than those belonging to female respondents in the SDR baseline sample. Given that the express purpose of AGEP funding is to enhance the diversity of the professoriate, the finding (that the rate of female Institute alumnae attaining faculty positions is greater than the baseline rate for SDR respondents) is important. Likewise, Black Institute alumni hold positions in which the primary activity is basic research at a rate higher than their Black counterparts from the SDR sample. The same trend is evident for alumni whose employment primarily entails development (i.e., using knowledge of research to inform the production of materials or devices; SDR).
