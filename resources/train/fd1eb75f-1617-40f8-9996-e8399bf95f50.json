[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. This paper describes a method based on metric structures for anatomical analysis on a large set of brain MR images. A geodesic distance between each pair was measured using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM). Manifold learning approaches were applied to seek a low-dimensional embedding in the highdimensional shape space, in which inference between healthy control and disease groups can be done using standard classification algorithms. In particular, the proposed method was evaluated on ADNI, a dataset for Alzheimer's disease study. Our work demonstrates that the highdimensional anatomical shape space of the amygdala and hippocampi can be approximated by a relatively low dimension manifold."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the past decade, computational anatomy (CA) [1] has emerged as a discipline to study the neuroanatomical variability via morphometric mapping algorithms. Quantitative analysis of anatomy has thus become possible. This paper studies the problem of embedding healthy control (HC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects into an anatomical shape space by computing a dissimilarity representation between subjects. Manifold learning techniques are applied on the dissimilarity representation to obtain embeddings for different subjects followed by classification in the embedded space. A widely-used framework in CA, large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) [2] was used for dissimilarity measurement. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of 385 MR images obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [3] . Instead of studying the whole brain, here we consider only two anatomical structures, hippocampus and amygdala, which have been reported to be affected morphologically by AD.\nThere have been several related methods proposed in the literature to apply manifold learning methods to dissimilarities measured on structural images. Most of them quantify inter-subject dissimilarity based on volume image data. For example, a similarity measurement called bending energy is employed in [4] . In [5, 6] , random forest has been used to measure dissimilarity on some statistical region-based features extracted from volume images. In [7] , dissimilarity was calculated via a small deformation to approximate a large deformation for computational efficiency. Similar approximations can be found in [8, 9, 4] . However, the explosive growth of computing power along with parallel computing resources have made the problem of computation less severe. Thus a full large deformation diffeomorphic metric is adopted in this paper. In this study, we couple the volume imagery to surfaces, and track the variations of shape using surface models. Studying surfaces allows us to capture the variation of neurodevelopment very efficiently [8] .\nLow-dimensional embedding can be calculated from the dissimilarity information via standard manifold learning approaches, such as multidimensional scaling (MDS) used in [5, 6, 10] , Isomap used in [4, 8, 9] , Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) used in [7] .\nAfter the embedding in low-dimensional space is calculated, statistical inference is often carried out. One choice is classification between different cohorts. Classification accuracy then becomes an important criteria for evaluating the dimension of the embedding. We note that we only consider the two-class classification problem, i.e., HC and AD. In this paper, a number of standard manifold learning and classification algorithms were employed. Section 3 presents our experiments and result. Compared with related works mentioned above, our investigations are more extensive, i.e., we consider a larger dataset. Our methodology achieves comparable classification accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "In this section, the framework of our method is described step by step.

Although there are more than 800 subjects with 4000 scans in ADNI database, we considered the healthy control and disease groups, with the baseline, i.e. the first scan, for each subject. Some scans (84 out of 840) were excluded if they suffered severe degradation due to motion artifacts or significant clinical abnormalities (e.g., hemispheric infarction). A dataset of 756 subjects was formed after this unbiased selection, including 210 subjects of HC, 175 subjects of AD, and 371 subjects of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We only considered the HC and AD here. Table 1 presents detailed information of this dataset."}]
