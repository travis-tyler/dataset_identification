In 1988, some 25,000 eighth-graders and their parents, teachers, and school principals were surveyed. These same students were resurveyed in 1990, 1992, and 1994 as part of the first, second, and third follow-ups of NELS:88. The fourth follow-up will revisit the same sample of students in the year 2000, when many of these individuals will have completed college and are 8 years out of high school. The NELS:88 fourth follow-up is being conducted by the Research Triangle Institute, a contract research organization located in North Carolina. Earlier data collection activities were carried out by the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago. What data was collected and from whom? NELS:88 is a longitudinal study of a national probability sample of eighthgraders. The base year student population excluded students with severe mental disabilities, students whose command of the English language was insufficient to understand survey materials, and students with physical or emotional problems that would limit their participation. Thus,NELS:88 began with a sample of eighth-grade students in 1988 who attended regular public and private schools across the United States. Hispanic and Asian students were oversampled, as were private school students. Additional context information was collected from school administrators, parents, and teachers. Base year 1988The base year of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 represented the first stage of a major longitudinal effort designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they leave elementary school and progress through high school and into postsecondary institutions or the workforce. Many of the variables collected in the base year serve as predictor variables (e.g., family characteristics, school experiences, aspirations, and school achievement and course work) for later outcome measures (e.g., graduating from high school, attending postsecondary school, graduating from college)."}, {"section_title": "First follow-up (1990)", "text": "The first follow-up in 1990 constituted the first opportunity for longitudinal measurements from the 1988 baseline. It also provided a comparison point to high school sophomores 10 years before, as studied in High School and Beyond (HS&B), another longitudinal study of American young people. The first follow-up study captured the population of early dropouts (those who left school prior to the end of 10th grade), while monitoring the transition of the student population into secondary schooling. Second follow-up 1992The second follow-up took place early in 1992, when most sample members were in the second semester of their senior year of high school. The  The third follow-up took place in 1994, when most sample members had completed high school. The primary goals of the 1994 round were: 1) to provide data for trend comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B; 2) to address issues of employment and postsecondary access and choice; and 3) to ascertain how many dropouts have returned to school and by what route. Fourth follow-up 2000The fourth follow-up is scheduled for 2000, when most sample members who attended college and technical schools will have completed their postsecondary education. The survey will be conducted primarily by computer-assisted telephone interviewing. The primary goals of the 2000 round will be: 1) to provide trend comparisons with NLS-72 and HS &B; 2) to address issues of employment and postsecondary persistence and attainment; and 3) to ascertain how many high school dropouts have returned to school and by what route."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "What are some of the research issues that can be addressed by NELS:88/2000?

Since its inception in 1988, the following data have been collected by NELS:88: (1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994) 0.4 Student assessment data (1988, 1990, and 1992) *\u00b0\u00a9\u00b0D ropout data (1990, 1992, and 1994)  Teacher data (1988, 1990, and 1992) 0 * * 0 School data (1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994)  What kinds of analyses (reports) can be generated using NELS:88 data? The NELS:88 data set was designed to support three typds of analyses, including: 1. Cross-sectional examining students at a single point in time; 2. Longitudinal following students over time; and 3. Trend using data from previous longitudinal studies to establish trends over time. Examples of NCES reports that fit these three categories follow: Cross-sectional  1988Eighth-Graders (NCES 1999020, December 15, 1998 Trends Trends Among High School Seniors, 1972-1992(NCES 95380, July 3, 1995 How will the NELS:88/2000 data be disseminated? NELS:88/2000 information will be disseminated in two formats: 1) electronic codebooks (ECBs) on CD-ROMs and 2) as part of the Data Analysis System (DAS). What is the NELS:88/2000 EC While the ECB system is primarily an electronic version of a fully documented survey codebook, it is also more. With the ECB, the data user of NELS:88 data can examine NELS:88 on his/her personal computer. The list below summarizes the major options that the ECB software provides to researchers using the NELS:88/2000 data. The ECB displays the SAS code that was used to create composite variables (if all of the variables that were used to construct the composite are also present on the data file). The ECB includes electronic display of the distribution of counts and percentages for each variable in the database."}, {"section_title": "+", "text": "The ECB permits users to select or \"tag\" variables of interest."}, {"section_title": "Users can subsequently:", "text": "o print a hardcopy codebook that displays the distributions of the tagged variables; o generate SAS-PC, or SPSS-for-Windows program code for the tagged variables (that in turn can be used with a user's own SAS or SPSS statistical software); and generate a \"tag\" file that will save the set of tags for import into another application."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "The NELS:88 ECBs run on IBM-compatible PCs equipped with compact disc (CD-ROM) readers. Note that the ECB does not directly access the NELS:88 data on the CD. Instead, the ECB system generates program code that can later be used by the researcher with his/her own copies of SAS or SPSS. Optimal use of the ECB's SAS-PC or SPSS for Windows program code option requires access to the PC versions of these statistical software packages. However, users may modify the ECB-generated code for use with versions of SAS or SPSS running on other platforms, such as a mainframe or Unix systems. Statistical software is not provided with the NELS:88 ECBs. What is the NELS:88/2000 DAS? The Data Analysis System (DAS) is a Windows software application that provides public access to NCES survey data (including NELS:88/2000). With the DAS, users can generate tables of percentages, means, or correlation coefficients simply by choosing the DAS variables (based on survey questionnaire items) that they would like to appear in a table. Users specify the information they would like to appear in a table by creating a table parameter file (TPF). The DAS software will process the TPF and generate the table in the form of a PRN file. The PRN file provides the table numbers (usually percentages of students) and the corresponding standard errors that have been calculated taking into account the complex sampling procedures used in the NELS:88 survey. It should be pointed out though that the NELS:88/2000 DAS will not contain all NELS:88/2000 variables. It will contain a subset of the variables (those that were used by NCES in producing NELS:88/2000 reports). 3"}]
