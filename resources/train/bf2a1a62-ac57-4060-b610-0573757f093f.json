[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Over the past fifteen years, the demand for organic food has risen substantially in the United States. Organic milk products have been a large component of this shift in demand, representing approximately four percent of total milk products consumed in the U.S. in 2013 and fifteen percent of total organic food sales (USDA/ERS 2013; USDA/ERS 2014). To accommodate this demand shift some conventional dairies are choosing to go through the lengthy organic conversion process which allows them to sell USDA certified organic milk. The response has been swift; total organic milk cows have increased from 38,196 in 2000 to 254,771 in 2011, representing over a five-hundred percent increase in just eleven years (USDA/ERS 2013). Despite this large supply response, the high demand for organic milk has resulted in a high price premium. This has been insufficient to incentivize widespread adoption among conventional dairies, which raises the question: Conditional on the existence of a high organic price premium, what motivates conventional dairies to convert? In this paper, we argue that technological characteristics of production play an important role in the decision of conventional farms to convert to organic practices. Several studies have examined non-price factors that induce conventional farms to transition to organic production. Two consider the role of technical efficiency in conversion (Kumbhakar, Tsionas and Sipil\u00e4inen 2009;Latruffe and Nauges 2014). Kallas, Serra and Gil (2010) summarize demographic and farm-level attributes that previous studies have shown to be important, such as education, age, opinions and perceptions of the environment, and social contact. While these factors have been found to be economically and statistically significant, prior literature has neglected examination of several other factors that economic theory and the nature of the organic certification requirements suggest may be important. Another limitation in the existing literature concerns the strong emphasis on European agriculture. The difficulty arises due to differences in organic standards between the U.S. and the European Union (Rosati and Aumaitre 2004), which raises questions about the legitimacy of extrapolating results derived from European data to the U.S. The final significant limitation in the organic conversion literature is a lack of studies specific to the dairy industry, which has a very different set of certification requirements compared to field crops, again raising the issue of whether non-dairy results can be extended to milk production. In this analysis, we address the limitations of the current literature with the goal of providing a more complete view of technological reasons why some conventional dairies are converting to organic in the U.S. and others are not. We specifically address the role of technical efficiency, returns to scale, output diversification, and elasticities of substitution between key input combinations as potential drivers of conversion to organic milk production. The focus on technical efficiency and returns to scale is warranted by current trends in the U.S. conventional dairy sector, where research has documented the existence of non-decreasing returns to scale across nearly all firm sizes (Melhim and Shumway 2011) and the significance of returns to scale in driving industry consolidation (Mosheim and Lovell 2009). We hypothesize that less technically efficient firms operating with higher returns to scale have a higher likelihood of converting to organic production in an attempt to remain profitable since they are unable to compete with larger, more efficient farms. We also hypothesize that firms that can easily substitute between key inputs find it easier to satisfy the organic conversion requirements, which increases the probability of organic adoption. To test these hypotheses, we employ a two-step estimation procedure using data from the 2005 and 2010 U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). This survey collects cost and input usage data from a large, stratified random sample of farms in the U.S. In the first step, we estimate a multi-output input distance function to simultaneously estimate firm-level technical efficiency, returns to scale, and direct elasticities of substitution. In the second step, we estimate a linear random utility model to assess the impact of the estimated technical characteristics on the probability that a conventional farm converts to organic production. We also control for operator characteristics that have previously been identified in the literature as associated with organic adoption. This paper is also the first to employ the new Box-Cox Fourier functional form for a multioutput input distance function. Previous researchers seeking a more robust functional form than the translog for stochastic frontier analysis utilized the Fourier-flexible form of Gallant (1981;1982), which allows for a global approximation to an unknown data generating process. However, due to approximation problems at the tails of the data, authors resorted to data truncation, introducing a source of bias into their results (Berger and Mester 1997). The Box-Cox Fourier functional form retains the robustness of the original Fourier-flexible form without the associated boundary approximation errors (Skolrud 2015). Empirical results demonstrate the economic and statistical significance of technical efficiency, returns to scale, and several elasticities of substitution in determining organic conversion. The direction of the effects conforms to the initial hypotheses. Specifically, technically inefficient firms with higher returns to scale and higher elasticities of substitution between feed and land, capital and land, feed and labor, and medicine and labor are more likely to convert. This finding implies an increase in consolidation in the conventional dairy industry as inefficient farms lacking the appropriate scale exit for organic. Further, we expect to see the continuation of a high organic price premium if the most efficient producers with higher capacities opt to remain conventional. If agricultural policymakers intend to incentivize adoption, our results imply that the subsidization of close substitutes for inputs restricted by organic regulations may be an effective incentive."}, {"section_title": "Firm-level motivation", "text": "Consider the case of a conventional dairy employing a vector of inputs c i z in the production of 5 milk c i y in accordance with the production function ( , ), \u0393 is a vector of firmspecific production characteristics (e.g. elasticities of substitution between inputs, returns to scale, technical efficiency). 1 The subscript i emphasizes variables that are firm-specific and the superscript c designates the variable's association with conventional production.

In the conversion to organic production practices, input quantity choices will be affected 6 by three issues: (1) higher input prices, (2) input scarcity, and (3) organic regulations restricting input usage.

Using a sample of Finnish dairy farms, Kumbhakar, Tsionas, and Sipil\u00e4inen 7 (2009) find that technically inefficient firms are less likely to adopt organic technology. The authors reason that the subsidy available to converting firms is large enough to attract the most efficient conventional operators. We hypothesize that in the U.S., where the organic subsidy is less than four percent of the total transition cost for the average-sized firm, technically inefficient firms will be more likely to adopt organic practices in an attempt to remain profitable. 3 Viewing conversion as an \"exit\" from the conventional industry followed by entrance into the organic industry, this is consistent with research empirically linking technical inefficiency with a significantly higher probability of industry exit (Tsionas and Papadogonas 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Returns to scale", "text": "The majority of empirical studies examining returns to scale in the conventional dairy industry demonstrate the predominance of non-decreasing returns to scale and its role in increasing average farm size. In their study using ARMS firm-level data from the year 2000, Mosheim and Lovell (2009) find that increasing returns to scale exist over all firm sizes in the survey. Using their preferred specification, the authors estimate an average long-run scale elasticity of 2.06 after accounting for both technical and allocative inefficiency in their parameter estimates. Even for large firms with herd sizes of at least 2,000, the long-run scale elasticity is still 1.25, indicating that average costs can still be diminished by increasing scale. Their finding of increasing returns to scale even for large firms is consistent with most of the recent literature examining the relationship between size and average costs of milk production. Tauer and Mishra (2006) and MacDonald et al. (2006) report evidence of a declining average cost curve, and Skolrud and Shumway (2013) report nondecreasing returns across multiple firm sizes (mean 1.32, 95 th size percentile 1.03). Melhim and Shumway (2011) are the only exception. Using ARMS data from the year 2000 and considering risk as well as profit as arguments in their utility function, they report evidence of significantly decreasing returns to scale for the largest ten percent of firms. Across the majority of the literature, the consensus is clear: in the conventional dairy industry, bigger is better. However, research indicates that the production technology employed by conventional U.S. dairy farms is fundamentally different than that of organic dairies (Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander 2010). U.S. organic milk certification through the National Organic Program (NOP) (USDA/AMS 2014) requires that animals have access to certified organic pasture for at least 120 days a year, be fed 100% organic feed, and be allowed free access to the outdoors for the entire year. 4 Each of these requirements has the potential to substantially reduce economies of scale. For example, organic certification dramatically increases the required land in comparison to conventional dairy operations which is a disincentive to large scale, especially in areas where land prices are high. Further, in an analysis of 2005 ARMS data, McBride and Greene (2009) find that for the largest organic dairies, those with herd sizes of 200 or more, sourcing organic feed was reported as the most significant difficulty of organic farming. This has the potential to act as a major conversion deterrent for larger conventional dairies, which are more likely than smaller dairies to rely on commercial feed rather than pasture for forage (McBride and Greene 2009). The organic regulations could result in a more traditionally U-shaped average cost curve, where expanding beyond a certain scale begins to increase average costs. If this is in fact the case, smaller conventional dairy farms (i.e., with higher returns to scale) may be incentivized to transition to organic, where the optimal scale may be much smaller. Thus, we hypothesize a positive relationship between the propensity to convert and returns to scale. 9"}, {"section_title": "Elasticities of substitution", "text": "When faced with NOP restrictions regarding input use, a farm's inability to substitute non-restricted or relatively lower priced inputs could play a significant role in determining how output and profit will be affected. All else equal, a farm that can more easily substitute away from a restricted input will experience a comparatively smaller impact on total output as a result of the restriction. In the case of the NOP, restrictions limit three important input categories: (1) medical and veterinary services, (2) physical capital, and (3) feed. The goal of NOP restrictions governing the use of medicine and veterinary services is to emphasize the role of preventative care. This means that antibiotics and most synthetic drugs are not allowed, and that no drugs can be administered in the absence of illness. 5 To accommodate these restrictions, organic farms can employ more labor to monitor herd health and more capital to allow for structural improvements associated with better health outcomes (e.g. clean bedding, more shade structures, barns allowing for more movement and ventilation). The NOP also requires significant capital improvements, many of which are aimed at improving herd health. For example, organic dairies must provide \"year round access for all animals to the outdoors, shade, shelter, exercise areas, fresh air, clean water for drinking, and direct sun-light\u2026\" (NOP \u00a7205.239, 2006). While any of these restrictions can be difficult to implement, perhaps none are as difficult as the requirement of using 100% organic feed. With very few exceptions, all feed must come from organic operations that are NOP-certified. With these specific input requirements in mind, we suspect that a farm's ability to substitute away from medicine, capital, and commercial feed can mitigate the impact of the restrictions on 10 potential output and thus be associated with the propensity to convert to organic production. Labor and capital can partially substitute for medicinal and veterinary inputs, and land for pasture can substitute for commercial feed (McBride and Greene 2009). Thus, we include all elasticities of substitution between labor, capital, land, and medicine as components of the i \u0393 vector in the adoption decision model."}, {"section_title": "Additional production factors", "text": "In addition to the estimated production characteristics discussed above, we include several nonestimated firm characteristics as components of . associated with NOP restrictions. For example, use of AI has been found to be more important for organically managed herds (Reksen, Tverdal, and Ropstad 1999), so we hypothesize that conventional firms already employing AI may be more likely to transition to organic management. Also, we include output diversification as a measure of the ease with which additional land may be converted to organic crop and pasture production for feed and manure distribution."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "To identify the impact of production characteristics on the organic adoption decision, we proceed in two steps. Using data from a sample of conventional firms in 2005, we estimate an input distance function using stochastic frontier analysis in the first step. This allows us to estimate firm-level production characteristics hypothesized by our theoretical model to have an impact on the adoption decision. In the second step, we use these estimates along with the additional farm and operator characteristics in a random-utility model to assess the importance of these factors in driving organic adoption between 2005 and 2010."}, {"section_title": "Input distance function", "text": "In previous studies comparing the efficiency of conventional and organic dairies (Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander 2010;Lansink, Pietola, and B\u00e4ckman 2002), technical efficiency estimates are obtained from estimating stochastic production frontiers, which are only suitable for single-output technologies. However, dairies often produce multiple outputs, suggesting that estimating a stochastic production frontier may be inappropriate. Instead, we estimate an input distance function which allows the specification of multiple outputs. Assuming M outputs and N inputs, the input distance function is specified as where ni z is the i th firm's use of input n and mi y is the i th firm's production of output . m Defining i z and i y as the respective sets of input and output vectors for firm i, the input distance function where () i L y represents the set of input vectors that can produce output vector i y , and 1 \uf072 \uf0b3 is a scalar defining the maximal contraction factor of inputs such that the desired output vector i y can still be produced. The input distance function has several important properties, notably that it is non-decreasing, linearly homogenous and concave in inputs and non-increasing and quasi-concave in outputs (Coelli et al. 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Functional form", "text": "To increase the robustness of our first-stage estimation to problems associated with functional form misspecification, we utilize the Box-Cox Fourier (BCF) functional form of Skolrud (2015). In stochastic frontier analysis, the original Fourier-flexible form as proposed by Gallant (1981) has often been used as a more robust alternative to the popular translog functional form (Berger and Mester 1997;Fenn et al. 2008;Berger and DeYoung 1997). However, as noted by Berger and Mester (1997), this form, which we refer to as the translog Fourier flexible form (TLF) due to the nesting of the translog, has significant approximation problems at the lower and upper tails of the data. Berger and Mester (1997) address this problem by simply removing the smallest 10% and largest 10% of observations from their sample. This approach is infeasible in our study due to the higher percent of smaller conventional firms that convert to organic. In fact, were we to employ this approach, our second-stage sample size would be reduced by over 30%. To circumvent this problem, we employ a version of the BCF functional form which has been shown to ensure the robustness of the Fourier-flexible form with good approximation properties at the boundaries of the data (Skolrud 2015). The BCF functional form is composed of a truncated Fourier-series appended to a secondorder expansion in Box-Cox polynomials: where i x is a vector of explanatory variables [ , ] is the set of parameters to be estimated (with dimensionality depending on the order of approximation), \uf061 k is an integer-valued set of vectors that determines 13 the order of approximation, and ( )  x and the function in equation 4becomes the original Fourier-flexible form of Gallant (1981).

Multiple estimation methods have been suggested; corrected OLS (COLS), maximum likelihood, and method of moments. In general, maximum likelihood is preferred to COLS for its desirable asymptotic properties (Coelli et al. 2005). Results from a Monte Carlo experiment by (Olson, Schmidt, and Waldman 1980) suggest that maximum likelihood is preferred to method of moments in terms of mean-squared error for sample sizes greater than 400. As our sample of conventional dairy farms greatly exceeds that threshold, we choose maximum likelihood estimation. We impose standard assumptions (Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander 2010) on the stochastic components of (5), namely that ( ) 0  where \uf046 is the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable, I is the sample size, and ln( ( , , ). ) Parameter estimates are obtained through a three-step estimation process which we now describe."}, {"section_title": "Estimation", "text": "To obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in (6),  adjusted by the absolute value of the Jacobian of the nonlinear transformation of the dependent variable.

Each estimated production characteristic is a function of input and output data and the maximum likelihood parameter estimates obtained from the previous section. An input-oriented measure of technical efficiency is defined by Coelli et al. (2005)  and 01 i TE \uf0a3\uf0a3 , with 1 i TE \uf03d indicating no technical inefficiency, and 0 i TE \uf03d indicating that the firm is completely inefficient. To estimate returns to scale, we employ the commonly used elasticity of scale measure, which is the summation of output elasticities across all N inputs: y represents the fluid milk output of farm i. Note that this measure is product specific, meaning that all other outputs 1,i y \uf02d are held constant. This formulation (or the equivalent dual version) is commonly used in the technical efficiency literature (Coelli and Perelman 1999;Coelli et al. 2005;Fenn et al. 2008). Returns to scale are decreasing, constant, or increasing for i RTS values less than, equal to, or greater than one, respectively. Of the numerous elasticities of substitution available to applied researchers (see Stern (2011) for a summary), we choose a measure best suited to use in a multi-output input distance function, the symmetric elasticity of complementarity proposed by Stern (2010). Defining k D as the firstpartial derivative with respect to input k, we define the elasticity of substitution for firm i of good k for good l as: EOS indicate that goods k and l are substitutes in production for firm i, and negative values indicate that the goods are complements in production for the firm. This measure is preferable to alternatives as it holds the values of other inputs, outputs, and input distance constant, leading to a direct measure of the curvature of the typical production isoquant (Stern 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Organic adoption model", "text": "With the firm-level production characteristics estimated, we can proceed to the estimation of the This decision rule is wellsuited to estimation within the framework of a random-utility model.

We can express the probability that Y takes a value of one in the following way: We also require a parametric assumption governing the relationship between production characteristics i \u0393 and the difference in profit, . Specifically, we assume that the difference in profit can be linearly decomposed into three components: This construction separates the difference in profit into: (1) a linear function of production characteristics, 2  Due to the perfectly competitive nature of the input and output markets for the organic and conventional dairy industry, differences in prices are not identifiable as they are not expected to vary across firms. Therefore, the \uf077 parameter is not identified in the empirical model. Assuming a logistic distribution for the error term, we employ a logit model to estimate the probability of conversion. 8 The presence of the technical efficiency term on the right-hand side of the empirical adoption model has been recognized as potentially endogenous (Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander 2010;Kumbhakar, Tsionas, and Sipil\u00e4inen 2009;Latruffe and Nauges 2014). The concern revolves around the issue of simultaneity biasis organic a less-efficient technology or is it that less efficient firms are simply more attracted to organic technology? When technical efficiency and adoption are estimated contemporaneously, this is an issue that must be dealt with. Mayen, Balagtas and Alexander (2010) address the issue through the use of propensity score matching, and Kumbhakar, Tsionas and Sipil\u00e4inen (2009) construct a single-step maximum likelihood estimation procedure that simultaneously estimates technical efficiency and the propensity to adopt. We deal with the issue in a manner similar to Latruffe and Nauges (2014), by using estimates of technical efficiency lagged five years which are much less likely to be endogenous in the adoption prediction model."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We In the estimation of the distance function, we employ seven inputs and two outputs.

This is indicative of a large number of small farms that shift the mass of the distribution leftward and the presence of a smaller number of very large firms.

The variables included in the estimation of the discrete choice model consist of all the esti- Because we don't have time-varying, firm-level data for the organic milk price premium, we use state-level averages of the difference between the price paid to organic producers (per hundredweight) and to conventional producers, which are reported in the ARMS data. Organic milk prices are partially governed by the same Federal milk marketing orders that determine conventional milk prices, with the exception of a processor-specific premium for the value added from organic production (McBride and Greene 2009). By using state-level differences, we account for part of the variation in the organic premium. Referring to Table 2, farms that converted to organic were much smaller on average (85 average herd size vs. 193). More converting farms used pasture for grazing and used a pasture-based manure distribution system, differences which are statistically significant at the one-percent level. They were also more risk averse and faced a modestly higher price premium for organic milk. In terms of operator characteristics, farmers who converted were younger (significant at the ten percent level), less-educated (significant at the one percent level), and more likely to participate in a Johne's disease program (significant at the five percent level)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We first consider results relating to selection of functional form for the multi-output input distance function.

Tests indicate a strong preference for the BCF with rejections of each alternative at the 1% level of statistical significance. Rejection of these alternatives suggest that functions of their estimates will be subject to a degree of bias from functional form misspecification.

Results are separated into two parts: the four left columns of the table show results from the BCF functional form, and the four right-most columns summarize results from the TL functional form. We highlight not only the difference in means between the estimates, but the difference in several sample moments that govern the shape of the distributions of estimates. For conventional dairies in 2005, we estimate an average technical efficiency (TE) of 0.81 from the BCF and 0.85 from the TL, which is similar to the results of Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander (2010) who report a TE estimate of 0.836 for conventional farms. In Figure 1, we examine histograms of TE estimates for both BCF (left panel) and TL (right panel) estimates. BCF estimates demonstrate a much higher concentration of efficient firms compared to the TL estimates, which have a higher concentration of firms centered around the mean and lower concentrations at the tails. TE estimates from the BCF are less left-skewed than corresponding TL estimates, and have less kurtosis. Estimates of returns to scale demonstrate the presence of non-decreasing returns to scale for the majority of the sample of conventional firms. We estimate an average returns to scale of 1.05 from the BCF and 1.10 from the TL. The BCF estimate is not significantly different from one, suggesting that constant returns to scale cannot be rejected at the data means. This result is consistent with Melhim and Shumway (2011), and varies slightly with Skolrud and Shumway (2013) and Mosheim and Lovell (2009), who find evidence of significantly increasing returns to scale at the mean using their preferred specification. Figure 2 presents histograms and fitted normal distributions for returns to scale estimates estimated from the BCF (left panel) and TL (right panel). Both distributions are more similar in shape to a normal distribution compared to the TE distributions in Figure 1, with the BCF estimates much more right-skewed (skewness of 0.89) than their TL-estimated counterparts (skewness of 0.15). The distribution of BCF estimates also have thicker tails, with a kurtosis of 3.89 compared to 2.95 for the TL estimates. Estimates of the elasticities of substitution between capital, land, labor, and medicine are shown in the last rows of Table 4. With one exception (capital/medicine), both BCF and TL estimates identify similar pairs of inputs as substitutes or complements at the data means. Medicine and labor are the strongest substitutes, followed by feed and land. Feed and labor have the most complementary relationship between the input combinations, which holds for both the BCF and TL. Beyond those similarities, some of the elasticity magnitudes are very different between the BCF and TL estimates. Seven of the ten distributions of BCF elasticity of substitution estimates have thicker tails than do the TL estimates, and eight of the ten distributions are less right-skewed. In Table 5, we explore the difference in estimates of returns to scale and technical efficiency by functional form and herd size. Despite similarity in mean estimates between the BCF and TL functional forms, Table 5 illustrates large differences between the two sets of estimates. For the smallest and largest firms, those with herd sizes less than 30 and over 2,000, respectively, the differences are especially pronounced. For example, the BCF estimate of returns to scale for the smallest firms is 1.69 compared to a TL estimate of 1.28. To save space, we do not present the results for differences in elasticity of substitution estimates across herd sizes, but the differences in those estimates correspond to the pattern observed with both the returns to scale and technical efficiency estimates. 13 The difference between the estimates across herd sizes motivate our expectation for differences in the discrete choice model results, despite the similarity between the mean estimates. Finally, we note the observed negative relationship between returns to scale and herd size (correlation coefficients -0.84 and -0.79 for BCF and TL, respectively) and the positive relationship between firm size and efficiency (correlation coefficients 0.88 and 0.72 for BCF and TL, respectively). Table 6 separates estimates of production characteristics by functional form for farms that remained conventional and those that transitioned to organic for the 130 farms that we were able to match between the 2005 and 2010 surveys. Importantly, these estimates are all derived from the 2005 survey when these farms were conventional-the 'Conventional to Organic' column is for farms that will make the transition to organic in time for the 2010 survey. Using the BCF estimates, results indicate that firms that remained conventional were more efficient (significant at the five percent level), had lower returns to scale (significant at the ten percent level), and seven of their 10 input pairs had lower elasticities of substitution (were more complementary) than firms that converted by 2010. When evaluating the means, the TL estimates demonstrate consistent differences between conventional and converted firms, but fewer of the differences are statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "Organic adoption results", "text": "Parameter estimates from our discrete-choice model of organic adoption suggest that estimated production characteristics are highly associated with the decision to convert from conventional to organic technology. As evidenced in Table 7, BCF estimates of technical efficiency, returns to scale and several elasticities of substitution are statistically significant predictors of organic adoption. Table 7 is also separated into two columns, those utilizing BCF estimates (left) and those utilizing TL estimates (right). Parameter estimates can be interpreted as semi-elasticities, implying that a marginal change in the regressor is associated with a percentage change in the relative probability of organic adoption equal to the parameter estimate. Focusing on the BCF results, we find that technical efficiency is negatively associated with adoption, a relationship which is statistically significant at the five-percent level. A one-unit increase in TE results in a 20% decrease in the relative probability of conversion. This result is counter to the findings of Kumbhakar, Tsionas, and Sipil\u00e4inen (2009) who estimate the impact of TE using organic farming data from Finland. These authors suggest that more efficient farms are attracted to organic due to the large conversion subsidy. The lack of a corresponding U.S. subsidy may be one of the contributing factors behind the negative relationship that we find between TE and adoption. Returns to scale is positively associated with adoption and is significant at the five-percent level. For the mean firm with returns to scale of 1.05, an increase in returns to scale to 1.15 corresponds to a 19% increase in the odds of organic adoption. This finding is consistent with our theoretical prediction and the negative relationship between TE and adoption. An increase in substitutability between capital and land, feed and land, feed and labor, and medicine and labor are all statistically significant positive drivers of conversion. Substitutability between feed and land is the most significant (one-percent level) followed by feed and labor, and capital and land (five-percent level), with substitutability between medicine and labor significant at the ten-percent level. At the mean level of substitution between feed and land for conventional firms, a one-percent increase in substitution results in a two-percent increase in the odds of conversion. Several non-estimated production and operator characteristics are also significantly associated with organic adoption, including milk cows (negative and significant at the ten-percent level), the use of a pasture-based manure distribution system and artificial insemination (both strongly positive and significant at the five percent level), and participation in the Johne's disease program (strongly positive and significant at the one percent level). We find that smaller herd sizes are associated with adoption, similar to results found in previous organic dairy conversion studies (Kallas, Serra, and Gil 2010;Kumbhakar, Tsionas, and Sipil\u00e4inen 2009;Latruffe and Nauges 2014;Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander 2010). All other variables are statistically insignificant determinants of organic adoption. Importantly, results from the adoption model when TL estimates are used provide substantially different results. Only five variables are statistically significant predictors of adoption compared to ten BCF parameters. The significant parameters have the same signs as the BCF parameters but some of the magnitudes differ greatly. They highlight the importance of model selection and the role of functional form misspecification bias, reminding us that the popularity of the TL specification in distance function estimation is no guarantee of accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and conclusions", "text": "Using a nationally-representative sample of U.S. dairies, we examine the role of production characteristics in the decision to convert from conventional to organic dairy technology. Previous studies focus primarily on the role of operator characteristics on the propensity to convert, neglecting important features of the existing production technology. While some aspects of production including technical efficiency, firm size, and the use of advanced technology have been considered as conversion determinants, other important production features have been overlooked. Due to the nature of the requirements specified by the National Organic Program, we hypothesize that returns to scale and the ability to easily substitute between key input combinations will be important drivers of organic adoption for conventional dairies. Ours is the first study to use U.S. firm-level data to examine the impacts of these characteristics measured before the start of the conversion process on organic technology adoption. We find that for conventional firms, higher returns to scale and easier substitutability between capital and land, feed and land, feed and labor, and medicine and labor inputs are all statistically significant drivers of organic adoption. Because of the prevalence of non-decreasing returns to scale in this industry, firms with higher returns to scale are further away from achieving the scale benefits that are such significant drivers of growth and productivity in the conventional dairy industry. Failure to achieve scale benefits as a conventional dairy increases the likelihood of exit from the industry. We suspect it also incentivizes organic adoption as these firms search for alternative uses of the physical and human capital. Additionally, the significant restrictions placed on capital, medicine, and feed as a result of the National Organic Program requirements drive the association between a firm's ability to substitute away 29 from these inputs and their propensity for adoption. Our identification of a new set of production characteristics as significant determinants of organic adoption has important implications for U.S. policies aimed at increasing organic dairy production, as well as the future of the organic dairy industry. With no changes to policies or restrictions governing organic dairies, we conclude that conventional firms with comparatively lower technical efficiency and higher returns to scale will be drawn to organic production in an attempt to remain profitable. However, an organic industry comprised solely of these types of firms may be unable to produce milk at the same quantity or scale as the conventional industry, which implies that organic milk prices will continue to be higher than conventional milk prices by an amount that exceeds the additional costs of organic production. Additionally, the exit of inefficient firms will necessarily increase consolidation in the conventional industry. Based on our results, we conclude that policies designed to allow for greater substitutability away from restricted inputs may provide a strong incentive for further organic adoption. By analyzing the most important elasticities of substitution relating to conversion, policymakers could determine inputs that might be subsidized or given a tax credit to offset the burden of specific organic input regulations. For example, a labor tax credit for organic farmers would help decrease the burden of medicinal restrictions and predictably lead to higher rates of adoption. Our results also suggest that relaxing somewhat the organic feed and pasture requirements may incentivize adoption among larger firms, but these restrictions can't be changed without altering the NOPdefined meaning of what it is to be an organic dairy. Finally, we stress the importance of functional form misspecification bias from our results. We demonstrate through likelihood ratio testing that, despite its dominance, the translog functional form has important limitations for input distance function estimation relevant to technology adoption. By comparing adoption results using estimates from the translog with the more accurate Box-Cox Fourier model, we show that misspecification bias can have a non-trivial impact. With its ability to provide a global approximation to an unknown function and accurately estimate the boundaries of the data, the Box-Cox Fourier functional form should be considered a viable, robust alternative to the translog and other functional forms for stochastic frontier analysis.
