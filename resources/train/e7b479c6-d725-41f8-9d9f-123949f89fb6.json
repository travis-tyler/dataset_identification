In recent decades, the index approach, or the summation of key mea ures (metric ) of re ident biological com munitie or water-quality properties that are re lated to the overall tream conditi on, ha become a popular method for a e ing both biological integrity (Karr and others, 1986; Hughe and Oberdorff, 1998; Barbo ur and others 1999) and water quality (Ott, 1978; Dunnette, 1979; and Cude, 200 1 ) .

Since Karr (1981) developed the first Index of Biotic Integrity (IB I) u ing fi h, the succes es of numerous fish IBI have been documented in many regions and for evera l surface-water type (Mi ll er and others, J 988; Davis and Simon, J 995; Hughes and Oberdorff, 1998; and Simon , 1999) ; likewi e, waterAbstract quality indices also have been modified for many region s in the United States and abroad (Cude, 2001) .\nGenerally, the emphasis on water quality in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain Ecoregion (MAP; Omemik, 1987) i less than in other areas of the United States. No States in the MAP have adopted biocriteria for streams, and no large-cale ecological studies have been conducted. Investigations may have been impeded for several reasons: (a) population density in the MAP is low, and MAP streams generally are not sources of drinking water; (b) most MAP streams are turbid and lack aesthetic appeal for primary contact; and (c) although the spatial extent of the MAP is quite large, the area in any one of the six States compri ing the MAP (i.e., Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri, and Kentucky) is much smaller than the total area of each State.\nAlth ough indices have been used for assessing streams in adjacent upland ecoregions (Shields and others, 1995; Hlass and others, 1998) , no biological or ecological indices have been published for assessing MAP streams. Developing an ecologically relevant and cost effective index for the MAP could be beneficial in at least two ways; (I) an index could facilitate biocriteria development, and (2) an index could be used to identify landscape variab les that influence ecological integrity.\nOne problem related to the u e of the index approach for assessing ecological integrity in the MAP, as compared to other areas, is that stream-channel and basin alterations related to crop production have resulted in the loss of reference conditions. Hughes ( 1995) documents why the condition of reference sites that are used for index development should be ( 1) relatively unaltered, and (2) have little potential for nonpoint source runoff. By the e standards, the MAP would not be considered to have reference streams. Concerning point (I), most of the MAP streams having good water chemi try are dredged ditche (a possible effect of permeable and sub trates and ground-water di charge). Concerning point (2) , virtually all MAP streams receive agricultural runoff. Given the level of di turbance in MAP treams, an approach different than the conventional reference-tream approach is needed (Karr and other , 1986; Hughes, 1995; Barbour and other , 1999) to develop an index for this ecoregion."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Scope", "text": "The purpose of this report is to identify a combination of cost-effective biological, chemical, and physical metrics as an index of ecological integrity (IEI) for MAP streams, and to examine the relation between lEI scores and selected land cape variables.

The index described herein was developed by using those data, as well as biological , chemical, and physical data collected at 30 additional sites sampled in the MAP (including a site in Kentucky and a site Tennessee) in 1997 and 1998.\nPrior to analyzing data collected in 1997 and 1998, the 36 sites sampled in each of the 2 years were subdivided into three a priori classifications: streams (in Arkansas, Missouri , Kentucky, and Tennessee) east of Crowleys Ridge ( fig. 2 ; an erosional remnant consisting of 40-to 50-million-year-old sedimentary rock in the upper Mississippi River Alluvial Plain ; U.S. Geological Survey, 2001), stream in Arkansas west and south of Crowleys Ridge, and streams in Louisiana and Mississippi . Barbour and others (1999) uggest that a priori clas ifications can be te ted and confirmed with univariate or multivariate statistical methods , and that uch classifications can be beneficial for index development. Observation made by USGS personnel as they collected sample throughout the region were equally important fore tablishing this classification, as were data from the six sites ampled in 1996.\nObservations that di tinguished streams east of Crowleys Ridge from treams in the other two a priori classifications were that stream ea t of Crowleys Ridge generall y had less clay turbidity during stable low-flow periods, and the streambeds for the \"ea t\" streams generally had a high percentage of sand as opposed to fine depositional material. An observation that distinguished streams in Arkansas we t and south of Crowleys Ridge from streams in the other two classifications was that these streams generally were less altered (channelized, straightened, dredged , etc.) .\nChemical and biological data from the six sites sampled in 1996 also indicated difference between stream in the three spatial classifications. Compared to the five sites in the two other a priori classifications, one site east of Crowleys Ridge had lower nutrient concentrations (Coupe, 2002) and had more fish taxa (Justu s and Caskey 2000) . Compared to site in Loui iana and Mis i ippi , the ite ea t of Crowleys Ridge al o had fewer pesticide detected in water sa mpl es ( oupe, 2000) , had lower concentration of pe ticides in water sam ples (Coupe, 2000) , had lower concentration of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in fish ti su samples (Kiei and other , 2000) , and had more rnaroinvertebrate taxa (Ju tu , 1998) . ompared to ite in Louisiana and Missi ippi , ites in Arkan a we t and south of Crowleys Ridge gene rally had lower con ntration of nutrient ( oupe, 2002) , lower concentrations of DDT in fish ti sue sample (Kleis and others, 2000) , and more taxa identified in fish and macroinvertebrate sample (Justu , 1998) .\nTwo factors were con idered prior to electing the 30 site ampled in 1997 and 1998. First, site were cho en to represent a gradient of crop in ten ity for corn, cotton, and rice-three major crop grown in th MAP. Secondly, site were selected that provided broad spatial coverage of the MAP. County-lev I land-u e data for 1995 and 1996 were used to determine crop intensities (Arkansas Agricultural Statistic Service, 1996; Kentucky Agricultural Statistics Service, 1996; Louisiana Agricultural Statistic Se rvice, 1996: Misis ippi Agricultural Stati tics Services 1996; Mis ouri agricultural Statistics Service, 1996; Tennessee Agricu ltural Statistics Service, 1995). Photographs and maps showing the sampling locations at each of the sampling sites can be viewed at http://ms. water.u gs. gov/misenawqa/ (acces ed January 21 , 2003) .\nBiological aspects of the study involved sampling macoinvertebrate and fish communities and asse sing habitat quality. Sampling method generally were consistent with NAWQA sampling protocols; however, becau e of environmental conditions pecific to the MAP, orne biological sampling methods were modified slightly. Detailed biological methods for all study aspects are described in Ju tus and Caskey (2000) and Ju tus and others (2000) .\nMacroinvertebrates were collected from all 36 sites in 1997 by using aD-frame net with a mesh size of 425 J.Un. Six habitats were sampled: undercut banks, aquatic vegetation, coar e woody drift, deteriorating leave , deteriorating sticks, and fine sediment. Fish samples were collected in 1998 by electrofishing and seining the same reach that had been sampled for macroinvertebrate . In conjunction with fish community 2 tncludes all areas used for the production of row crops such as soybeans , vegetables, tobacco, and cotton, as well as small grains such as wheat and rice. Excludes areas used for the production of hay Index Development Methodssampling, field personnel also collected fish tissue samples for organochlorine pesticide analysis. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus) were collected at all but two sites; black bass and gar were analyzed in the absence of carp. Surface-water samples were collected at the 36 sites three times (shortly after planting, midway through the growing season, and just prior to harvest) during the 1997 growing season, and were analyzed for 23 pesticides, 10 major ions, and 8 nutrient constituents. Additionally, five chemical properties (conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, and water temperature) were measured in situ. Mean values were calculated for all properties measured on multiple occasions except pH; median values were used to evaluate pH. Data for the previously described sampling can be accessed at http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ms/nwis/ nwis (accessed January 21, 2003) .\nEight habitat variables (average depth, bank stability, canopy angle, channel aspect, canopy density, channel width, stream velocity, and stream discharge) were measured (Meador and others, 1993) ; however, clay turbidity prevented assessment of instream habitat features (quantity and quality of woody habitats) by NA WQA protocols.\nTwo multivariate methods-Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA; Hill\u00b7and Gauch, 1980) and Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN; Hill, 1979) -were used to compare the value of the fish community (data are reported in Justus and Caskey, 2000) and macroinvertebrate community (data are reported in Caskey and others, 200 I) for the index. Prior to using DCA, community data were first ordinated with Correspondence Analysis (CA; Hill, 1974) ; however, an arch effect was observed (the data on the econd axis exhibited no new information because of a quadratic relation with data on the first axis; Jongrnan and others, 1995) for the fish community data, and DCA was used thereafter. DCA is an ordination technique based on reciprocal averaging that is commonly u ed when CA data plots exhibit an arch effect (Jongman and others, 1995) . DCA site scores were obtained by using the Multivariate Stati tical Package (MVSP; Kovach , 1998) . TWINSPAN is a computer program that eparates site ba ed on abundance of species, and allow the con truction of an ordered two-way table that ex pres e the synecologic~l relations of the species (Hill, 1979) . TWINSPAN results were obtained by u ing the Cornell Ecology Program (Hill , 1979) set for default values. The \u00b7arne data sets were used for both DCA and TWINSPAN. Family-level taxa and higher were omitted from the analysis because, in almost all cases, the abundances of these taxa were low compared to abundances for genus-and species-level taxa. Rare taxa (those composing less than 2 percent of the total abundance at the site) were combined into a \" rare-taxa\" species.\nDCA ordinations were plotted for each community by usi ng site scores of the first and econd axes; site scores of the third and fourth axes were not plotted because they had low eigenvalues and explained a small amount of variability. Spatial distributions for the 36 sites within the DCA plot from each community were evaluated and compared to the three a priori spatial classifications. Eigenvalues and the percentage of variability for the first two DCA axes also were compared for the two communities. As an additiona l comparison, and as a means of reducing the number of chemical and physical variables considered for the index, site scores of the first axis for both communities were each correlated against 41 chemical and physical variables (table 2). These 41 variables included all chemical constituents and physical properties that were measured in the laboratory or the field that were detectable above reporting limits at one-half or more of the sampling site . Few chemical and physical metrics were correlated (Spearman's rho values greater than 0.50) with the second DCA axis for either community, and neither second axis was used to develop the lEI. Scatter plots were used to evaluate linearity and to indicate the presence of outlier data.\nThe first TWINSPAN division for each community was evaluated for site groups associated with one or more of the three a priori spatial classifications. Subsequent TWINSPAN divisions are not reported for either community because those analyses were not valuable for separating sites into the three a priori spatial classifications.\nA total of 43 fish metrics were calculated and were considered as candidates for the lEI (table 3). All metrics had either been used in other indices for other regions or, based on field observations, were suspected of being ecologically relevant in the MAP. Metric categories for the candidate biological metrics included taxonomic richness, abundance, health , trophic gui lds and feeding processes, diversity, and tolerance. The 41 chemical and physical metrics that were detectable above reporting bmits at one-half or more of the sampling sites also were considered as candidates for the lEI (table 2). Biological, chem ical, and phy ical metrics were retained or omitted from con ideration for the index based on correlation between each metric and DCA site scores. Metric with the highest correlation to site scores of the fir taxi of the selected DCA ordinati n (the ordination that best fit the three a priori patial classifications, had the highe t eigenvalue , explain d the most variability, and was correlated to the mo t chemical and physical metric ) were retained as candidates for the index. The e metric were suspected of having strong relations to underlying factors responsible for positioning the 36 ites in the DCA ordination plot.\nTo ensure that the lEI was not influenced by multiple metrics that were related to each other, all metric retained as candidates were evaluated for redundancy and taxonomic similarity. The redundancy evaluation involved correlating metrics in each respective group (biological, chemcial , and physical) with one another. Metrics that had a 0.80 (Spearman's rho) or higher correlation to each other were suspected of being redundant. The similarity evaluation involved identifying metrics that had strong taxonomic relations to each other (the number of black bass, and the sum of lengths for all black bass). Once metrics that were redundant or similar were identified, considerations that deterrnilled which of the metrics would be retained for the lEI included (a) the strength of the correlations of each metric with site scores of the first axis of the selected DCA ordination, (b) response consistency to other variables measured at the site (an indication of ecological relevance), (c) costs associated with sampling or analysis, (d) the amount of subjective judgment required to obtain the metric, and (e) diurnal variability (chemical and physical metrics).\nResponse consistency for each of the biological metrics selected for the index to other variables was evaluated by comparing metric scores at two sites that seemed to have the least degraded and most degraded water chemistry from each of the three a priori classifications. In theory, sites having the least degraded water chemistry would be expected to have favorable biological metric scores, whereas sites with the most degraded water chemistry would be expected to have less favorable biological metric scores.

Coefficients of variation (CV) for the spatial and temporal components were reported as averages for each biological metric selected for the lEI."}, {"section_title": "Metric description", "text": "Two methods were evaluated for scoring index metrics-a \"centering\" method (Minns and others, 1994; Hughes and others, 1998; and Ganasan and Hughes, 1998) and a \"ranking\" method (Merritt and others, 2002) . The underlying assumptions of both scoring methods are that the ecological integrity for the sites sampled covers the range of ecological integrity in the study area, and the metrics being used are ecologically relevant.\nThe centering method uses two approache to score metrics, depending if high or low metric values indicate least degraded conditions. For metrics where high metric scores indicated least degraded conditions, the metric score was divided by the range of metric values, and the resulting quotient was multiplied by 10. For example, the range of fish taxa collected at the sites was 37, therefore, a site with 16 taxa scored 4.3 or [(16/ 37) x 10]. For metrics where low metric core indicated least degraded conditions, the metric score was divided by the range of metric values, but the resulting quotient wa subtracted from 1 before being multiplied by 10. For example, the range of turbidity at the sites was 134.6 nephelometric turbidity unit ; therefore, a turbidity of 3.4 nephelometric turbidity units was cored as 9.7 or ( [1-(3.4/134.6) x 10]). To produce an lEI ranging from 0 to 100, centered scores of the six metrics were summed, multiplied by 10 and divided by the number of metrics in the index (Ganasan and Hughes, 1998) . Sites having the highest cores had the least degraded conditions, whereas sites with the lowest scores had the most degraded conditions.\nFor the ranking method, each site was ranked from best (1) to worst (36) based on metric values at the 36 sites. In cases where values for a metric were the same at two sites, both sites were given the same rank and the subsequent rank was used for the next lower or higher value. Ranks for all metrics were summed for each site to get the final site score. Results for the ranking method were converse to results for the centering method; lowest scores indicated least degraded conditions.\nAs a mean of comparing the two coring method results for each method were correlated to hemical and phy ical metrics that had high correlation to DCA axis core . The scoring method that had the highest correlations to tho e chemical and physical metrics was selected for the lEI."}, {"section_title": "METHODS FOR RELATING THE lEI TO LANDSCAPE VARIABLES", "text": "Index scores were compared to 148 land cape variables (table 4 and 5) . Land cape variables included use rates (kilogram of an active ingredient applied per basin) for 91 pesticides that are used on com, cotton, and rice in the MAP (Giane si and Anderson, 1995); 32 estimated and reported fertilizer rates (Battaglin and Gool by, 1995) ; percentage of three surficial geologic formations (Saucier, 1994) ; population (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 1990); and 21 other land-use/land-cover, oil , and riparian habitat characteristics identified with geographical information systems (GIS). The 21 variables were identified as part of a cooperative project between the USGS and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Data for the GIS coverage were obtained from remote sensing data (Vogelman and others, 1998) and from Natural Resource Conservation Service soils data (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1991).

To obtain estimates for basin-level pesticide-use rates, county-level pesticide-use rates were obtained by multiplying State-based pesticide-use coefficients by county-level crop acreages (Thelin and Gianessi , 2000) . Secondly, county-level pesticide-use rates were multiplied by the area of each county in each respective (Gianessi and Anderson, 1995) Table 5 .

In contrast, the first TWINSPAN divi ion using the macroinvertebrate clustered nine sites east of Crowleys Ridge with five sites in Arkansas west and south of Crowleys Ridge and three sites in Mississippi (fig. 6 ). Eigenvalues for the first TWINSPAN division were comparable for the fish and macroinvertebrate communities (0.30 and 0.35, respectively).\nOf the 43 fish metrics, 12 metrics were retained as candidates because they were correlated (Spearman's rho> 0.50 and p < 0.001) with DCAFl site scores (table 2). Of tho e 12 metrics, eight metrics were disregarded because they were redundant or taxonomically similar to other fish metrics that had either higher correlations with the DCAFl site scores, more ecological relevance, or were less difficult or costly to calculate or measure. The four fish community metrics selected for the IEI were the average standard length of all Lepomis, the number of insectivore taxa, the relative abundance of green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus Rafmesque) and orangespotted sunfish (Lepomis humilis Girard), and the sum of lengths for aU black bass (Micropterus spp.). Three of the metrics had positive relations with ecological integrity; however, one metric-the relative abundance of green sunfish and orange potted sunfish-had an inver e relation with ecological integrity. Collectively, the four metrics measure aspects of relative abundance, trophic guilds, and tolerance (to disturbance). Individual cia sification by the four fi h metrics of the two sites selected (the ites having the least degraded and most degraded water chemi try for all sites) from each a priori classification (table 7) varied in a manner similar to water quality at the six ites (table 8) .

Spatial variability and temporal variability for one of the metri cs, the sum of lengths for aJI black bass, were hi gh (spatial CY = 0.43, temporal CY = 0.79) relative to the other three biological metrics . The fact that some CY values were hi gh may be related to the small number of multiple-reach and multipleyear samples collected during this study. Of 138 macroinvertebrate metrics evaluated nationally for NAWQA, the average CY for 34 metrics collected at less than 40 multiple-reach sites was 0.99, whereas the average CY for 104 metrics collected at more than 40 multiple-reach site wa 0.34 (Tom Cuffney, U.S .

A comparison of the centering and ranking scoring methods indicated that the methods provided prac-tically the same results (Spearman's rho -0.98, p < 0.001; fig. 7 ). The centering method was selected over the ranking method for the IEI because the centering method had slightly higher correlations to selected chemical and physical variables (table 10) , and because the ranking method cannot be used to identify skewed data.\nIEI cores ranged from 16.87 to 89.83 (table 11 ) . Metric values for the 36 sites are provided to facilitate modification of the IEI if metric values at future test sites are higher or lower than values at these 36 sites. As a conservative and straightforward means of eparating the sites into three ecological categories, the range of IEI scores was divided by four; sites scoring in the first category (with an IEI score lower than 35 .11 ) were considered most degraded; site scoring in the fourth category (with a IEI score higher than 71.59) were considered least degraded; sites between the first and fourth category were considered moderately degraded (table 11, fig. 8 ). All six of the streams in the least degraded category are located east of Crowleys Ridge. The seven streams in the most degraded category are located in Louisiana and Mississippi.

Sites that had the highest lEI score had the lowest percentages of Holocene deposits (compact alluvial clays that were deposited after the last glacier, fig. 9 ) and the lowest cotton insecticide use rates (fig s.  10 and 11 ).\nOf the 21 pe ticide u e rate hav ing the high t correlations to lEI score (absolute value for Spea rman 's rho> 0.60 p < 0.001 ), 13 wer cotton insecticides and 7 were cotton herbicides (table 12) . Profenofos, a cotton insecti cide that ha been linked to everal fi h kill in Loui iana and Mi ssi sippi (McPherson , 1996; Missi ippi Department of nvironmental Quality, 1996) , wa used to compare in cticide use rate to lEI cores. The amount of profenofos used per basin was highl y correlated to lEI score (Spearman 's rho = -0.7 1 ). To reduce vari abili ty associated with basin size (more insecticide generally would be applied in larger basins), the amount of profenofos used per hectare was calculated for all basins and then was compared to lEI scores (Spearman 's rho= -0.78; fig. 10 ). The amount of profenofos u ed in each basin was also compared to the percent of cotton in each ba in (fig. 11 ). Both comparisons indicate that profenofo use rates were higher for basin in Louisiana and Missis ippi that had the lowest lEI cores, compared to basins in the two remaining a priori ciasifications that had higher IEI scores. Because the relation between the chemical and physical variables in the index and the percentage of Holocene deposits and cotton pesticide use rates was uncertain, sums of the centered scores of the four biological metric were correlated to the percentage of Holocene deposits in the basin , to the amount of profenofos applied per hectare in the basin, and to the amount of profenofos applied per hectare of cotton in the basin . Results indicate that the biological metrics alone had strong relations to the landscape variables (table 13).

Macroinvertebrate communities seem to be good indicators of habitat qu ality in agri cultural basin (Petersen, 1992) ; however, fi sh communitie do not alway re fl ect habitat quality (Shie ld s and others, 1995). Thi s would suggest that a lack of microhabitats mi ght be more limiting to the macroinvertebrate community than to the fi sh community. One apparent di ffe rence between macroinvertebrates and fi hi that macroinvertebrates cling to habitat whereas fis h are free wimmin g, and some fi sh are pelagic in nature. Whereas the integrity of both the fi sh and macroinvertebrate communities varies in re lation to habitat qu ali ty the ex tent of thi s variation probabl y differ .\nTurbidi ty and mean total ammonia plus orga nic nitrogen we re used as metri cs in thi s lEI for several reaon , the most important of which was that both metrics were ecologically re leva nt. Turbidity integrate di ffe rent aspect of instream and riparian habitat characteri sti c uc h as the qu a lity of vegetatio n a lo ng the strea m banks and in the bas in , bank and ubstrate stabili ty, and so il characte ri sti cs in the ba in .\nAlthough it could be unique to the MAP, mean total amm oni a plus orga ni c nitrogen also seems to integ rate different a pects of in strea m and ripari an habitat characteri tics. One could antic ipate that all nitrogen con tituents wo uld be highe tin areas with the hi ghest fe rtili zer application rate . However, concentration s of total ammoni a plu orga nic nitrogen, as we ll as other nitrogen co n ti tuent , were consistentl y hi gher in the outh ern part of the MAP (in Loui iana and Miss issippi , where applicati on rate are the lowest) th an in the northe rn part of the MAP (i n Arkansa and Mi ssouri , whe re nitrogen u e rate are hi ghest; Battaglin and Gool by, 1995) . Total ammoni a plus organi c nitrogen is a measure of both ammoni a and the total partic ul ate and di s o lved organic ni trogen, but orga nic nitrogen comprised mo \u00b7t of the meas urement at all 36 ite .\nDecompo ing partic ul ate and d is ol ved detritu s are major source for organi c ni trogen (Wetzel and Likens, 199 1 ) . Data from thi tudy, a well as agricultural fi eld runoff data collected by the USGS in southern Arkana (Bark and others 2002) indicate that total organic nitrogen could be a surrogate for agricultural runoff potenti al in the MAP. The exac t connection between row crop agriculture and total orga ni c nitrogen i not certa in \u00b7 however, one pos ibility is that inorga nic nitrogen taken up by pl ants in the fie ld is converted to organic nitrogen, whi ch ca n be tran ported to the tream in the form of organic nitrogen as pl ant deco mposition begins.\nThe addition of chemi cal and phys ica l metric that can integrate effects of other ecological factors would be ex pected to account for more variability th an an index u ing biologica l metri cs alone. However, a di advan tage as ociated with u ing chemical and physical metri cs in indice i that multiple sampl e are needed to compen ate for temporal variability (re ults from three mea urements were ave raged for thi tudy).\nThere are advantage and di sadvantages to both the centering and ranking coring method . For regions that lack reference condition s, however, no scoring method have been establi hed and , in thi s case, the advantage of these scoring method would obviou ly outwe igh the di advantage . Advantages of the two scoring method include (a) low co t beca use the need to collect data from a large number of ca ndid ate reference sites is eliminated, (b) no scoring criteri a need be e tabli shed to class ify metric performance, (c) the centering a nd ra nking me thod s a re m o re sens iti ve tha n th e tri section method (observed fi rst by Ganasan and Hughes, 1998) because the range of the centerin g method and the ranking meth od (1-10) exceeds the range of the tri ecti on method (1-5, Barbour and others, 1999) , and (d) sequence gaps (the trisection method as igns a core of 1, 3, or 5, leaving 2 and 4 as sequence gaps) are not problemati c becau e both methods use a continuou scoring system. Di advantages of the centering and rankin g scoring methods are that (a) an origin al data set mu st be used to evaluate new test sites, (b) a relative ly large number of sites, representing the range of condition in the region , mu st be am pled , and (c) scores for all metri cs have to be recalculated if metric scores of test sites are outside the range of the origina l data set. A problem unique to the ranking method is that the method will not identify skewed metric data."}, {"section_title": "28", "text": "An Index of Ecological Integrity for the Missis~ippi Alluvial Plain Ecoregion: Index Development and Relations to Selected landscape Variables"}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION OF LANDSCAPE VARIABLES CORRELATED TO THE lEI", "text": "Individual fami li ar with pecific ecoregion and related ecological processe can rationally develop ecological expectation for most land scape variables. Such expectations can then be used to eva lu ate the effectiveness for new ly developed indi ce (Ha lliwell and others, 1999) . The IEI was high ly correlated to two land scape variables that could influence the potential for contaminant to enter MAP stream : the percentage of Holocene de posits in the basin and insecticide use rates. Stream basin s ea t of Crowleys Ridge and stream basin in Arkansas we t and south of Crowleys Ridge having the highest (best) IEI scores, consistently had a lower percentage of Holocene depo its and lower cotton in ectic ide use rates than stream ba ins in Loui iana and Missi s ippi , which had the lowest IEI scores ( fig . 9 , 10, and 11 ).\nDifferences in geo logic propertie of stream basins in the MAP probably influence how clay particle and contaminants in agricultural runoff are physica lly removed (o r filtered) and chemicall y altered . Areas in the MAP with hi gh percentages of Holocene deposits tend to be more turbid , have higher nutrient and pe ticide concentration in water, have hi gher concentrations of organochlorine pesticides in fish ti sue, and have biological communitie that are more impaired than area with hi gh percentages of Ple itocene deposit (K le i s and other , 2000) . As indi cated by data co llected in thi tudy geologica l propertie are a major con ideration fo r how the MAP (ecoregion) is being further ubdivided (Jim Omern ik, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, written commun ., October 2002).\nRetrospective analysis indi cate that numerous fi sh kill have occurred as are ult of in ecticide application in both Louisiana and Mis i ippi (M i sis ippi Departme nt of Environmental Quality, 1996; McPherson, 1996) . Thi information , coupled with the strong re lation between IEI core and cotton insecticide use rate , sugges t that cotton in ecticide use may also influence ecolog ical integrity of MAP tream , particularly in these two States. During the pa t few decades there has been a shift in use from insecticides that persist in the environme nt (o rganochlorine compounds) to le per istent forms (organopho phate and synthetic pyrethroid compound ); however, mo t insecticide , regardle s of the form, rem ain toxic to fish and other biota at low concentrations. The short half-life of mo t insecticides in use today make it diffi c ult to quantify the ecological effects of in e ticid on MAP tream ; however, it i known that in ecticide-induced fi h kill often occur when in c tic ide ar app lied in mid-urnmer immediately prior to rain event . In 1994 the Miis ippi Department of E nvironmental Quality investigated five fi h kills in the MAP whe re the cotton insecticide, profenofo , wa detected in d ad fi h and was su pected to have ca u ed the kill (Mi i sippi Department of Environmenta l Quality, 1996) . In 1996, the Louisiana Department of Agriculture documented 11 fish kills in the MAP that were a s iated with peticides and found that the cotton in ecti cide profenofos (7), en do ulfan (2), and azinopho methyl ( I ) contributed to 10 of tho e fi h kill (McPherson, 1996) . Three of the 16 fi h kill that were as ociated with insecticide u e in Louisiana and Mi i ippi in l 94 and 1996 occurred on streams amp led for thi tudy. The number of fi h killed during one of tho e three event was esti mated between 150 000 and 200,000.\nIt is unknown if cotton in ectic ide u e is hi ghe r inLoui ianaand Mi si sippi becau eofclim aticdifferences (pe ts would be more prevalent in the wann , subtropical climate) or because of diffe rence in farm in g practice . Regard less of why in ecticide u e rate arc higher in the so uthern MAP, the fact that rates are highe r in this area could partially explain why ites in Loui iana and Mis issippi generally have much higher concentrations of DDT in fish tis ue than site in Arkansas and Mis ouri (Kle is and other , 2000).\nThe effects of cha nnelization on fi h communities in MAP strea m within Arkansa have been documented (Mauney and Harp, 1979; Holt and Harp 1993 ; Bill Keith , Arkan as Department of E nvironme ntal Quality, written comm un. , 2000), and one would expect that ecological integrity in the MAP would be related to habitat quality. Habitat variable mea ured in this large-sca le study were not well corre lated to the IEI, although habitat quality did va ry within the three a priori c la ifications. Only nine of the 36 stream tudied had a majority of the ir strea m channe ls unchannelized, and six of those treams were in Arkan a west and south of Crowleys Rid ge. Streams west and outh of Crowley 's Ridge also had more bottomland hardwoods adjacent to the stream channels than other MAP tream . Given these differences, it i probable that differences in habitat were also partially re ponsible for ecological diffe rences be tween site in Arkan as west and south of Crowley's Ridge and ites in the two other a priori classifications."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Landscape Variables Correlated to the lEI 29", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "A multimetric index was developed using data collected at 36 sites in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain Ecoregion (Omernik, 1987) , an area where few ecological studies have been conducted.
