Results: We identified 10 studies with 11 datasets suitable for inclusion, including 378 patients with aMCI and 435 healthy controls. This meta-analysis identified significant ReHo alterations in patients with aMCI relative to healthy controls, mainly within the default mode network (DMN) (bilateral posterior cingulate cortex [PCC], right angular gyrus, bilateral middle temporal gyri, and left parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus), executive control network (right superior parietal lobule and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), visual network (right lingual gyrus and left middle occipital gyrus), and sensorimotor network (right paracentral lobule/supplementary motor area, right postcentral gyrus and left posterior insula). Significant heterogeneity of ReHo alterations in the bilateral PCC, left parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus, and right superior parietal lobule/angular gyrus was observed. Exploratory meta-regression analyses indicated that general cognitive function, gender distribution, age, and education level partially contributed to this heterogeneity. Conclusions: This study provides provisional evidence that aMCI is associated with abnormal ReHo within the DMN, executive control network, visual network, and sensorimotor network. These local functional connectivity alterations suggest coexistence of functional deficits and compensation in these networks.

Individuals with aMCI are at a high risk for developing Alzheimer's dementia (AD), which is the most common type of dementia in the elderly and has been a growing public health problem worldwide [2, 3] . Understanding the neurobiology of aMCI may therefore have implications for early diagnosis and preventive interventions of AD.\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a promising imaging technique to investigate regional neural activity and large-scale brain networks [4, 5] . Rs-fMRI allows for exploring complex cognitive processes in vivo without application of a task and has been extensively used to study the pathophysiology of AD and aMCI [4, 6, 7] . Regional homogeneity (ReHo) is a reliable rs-fMRI analytic algorithm to explore local functional connectivity that measures the similarity of the resting state time series between one given voxel and its neighbor voxels [8, 9] . Over the past decade, many rs-fMRI studies have reported aberrant ReHo in patients with aMCI relative to healthy controls. ReHo can be applied to distinguish patients with aMCI from healthy controls with an accuracy of 90.32% (sensitivity 86.21% and specificity 93.94%) by employing a support vector machine-based approach [10] . In addition, ReHo alterations have been observed to correlate with cognitive and memory impairment in patients with aMCI [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, despite considerable progress in the better understanding of aMCI pathophysiology, the findings from ReHo studies have been less consistent than expected. For example, ReHo alterations in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus in patients with aMCI relative to healthy controls have been controversial. Decreased ReHo, increased ReHo, or null findings in this region have been reported. Thus, it is of keen interest to overcome such inconsistency and characterize ReHo alterations in patients with aMCI by quantitatively pooling these studies. However, no such study has so far been conducted.\nOur primary objective of the present study was to identify the consistent ReHo alterations in aMCI across studies via a meta-analytic approach. Seed-based d Mapping (SDM), a fully-validated technique for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies [15] [16] [17] , was utilized to quantitatively synthesis the whole-brain ReHo results in a voxel-wise manner. Additionally, we aimed to conduct meta-regression analyses to explore the potential impact of relevant demographic and clinical variables on ReHo changes in patients with aMCI."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Literature search and study selection", "text": "The electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were systematically searched up until 14 July, 2017, using the following keywords and combinations: (\"mild cognitive impairment\" or \"mci\") AND (\"regional homogeneity\" or \"ReHo\" or \"local connectivity\"). Reference lists from relevant studies were further reviewed to detect additional suitable articles. The search was updated on 8 May, 2018.\nStudy selection was according to the following inclusion criteria: 1) Patients enrollment met the diagnostic criteria for aMCI; 2) the study employed rs-fMRI to measure ReHo differences between patients with aMCI and matched healthy controls; 3) the study utilized a voxel-based statistical analysis at the whole-brain level; 4) three-dimensional stereotactic coordinates in either Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space were explicitly reported; and 5) the study was an original article that was peer-reviewed and published in an English-language journal. Studies were excluded if they enrolled patients with non-aMCI. Studies were also excluded if they limited their analyses to specific regions of interest (ROIs), or used two-dimensional analyses, or did not report peak stereotactic coordinates. Only one study was selected in the final meta-analysis in case that two or more published studies had the same first author and data acquisition methods, and similar patient demographic characteristics, clinical variables, data analysis, and imaging results. Only pre-treatment or baseline data were included in case of longitudinal studies.\nWe used a 20-point checklist (Additional file 1), which was based on previous neuroimaging meta-analyses to evaluate the quality of each eligible study. Our study was performed in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines [18] .\nThe systematic literature search yielded 305 titles and abstracts. Of these results, we identified 10 studies with 11 datasets suitable for final inclusion (378 patients, 435 controls) [10, [12] [13] [14] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . The detailed study selection process for the meta-analysis is shown in the flowchart Fig. 1 .

However, an unbalance of gender distribution between the aMCI samples and HC groups (relative risk = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.40, z = 2.69, p = 0.007) was observed. All the studies included except for the study by Cha [32] matched for sex. In addition, the aMCI groups had significantly lower mean MMSE scores than that of the HC groups (SMD = \u2212 1.70; 95% CI = \u2212 2.26 to \u2212 1.15, z = 6.00, p = 0.000).

The SDM approaches have been widely applied in neuropsychiatric disorders and the processes have been described in detail elsewhere [15, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Peak three-dimensional stereotactic coordinates and their effect sizes of ReHo differences between patients with aMCI and healthy controls were firstly extracted from each study [19, 22] . A standard MNI map of ReHo changes for each study was then separately recreated with an un-normalised anisotropic Gaussian kernel (full width at half maximum [FWHM] = 20 mm) [19, 22, 23] . Of note, this Gaussian kernel is not used to smooth any image but to assign indicators of proximity to reported coordinates [20] . The mean map was further generated by voxel-wise calculation of the mean of the study maps. A random-effect model was applied, which takes into account the sample size, intra-study variability, and between-study heterogeneity [19, 22, 23] . The following thresholds were used to obtain the final SDM statistical map: uncorrected p < 0.005, peak height Z \u2265 1, and cluster extent \u226520 voxels.

This meta-analysis identified significant brain ReHo alterations in patients with aMCI relative to healthy controls, mainly within the default mode network (DMN) (bilateral PCC, right angular gyrus, bilateral middle temporal gyri, and left parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus), executive control network (right superior parietal lobule and DLPFC), visual network (right lingual gyrus and left middle occipital gyrus), and sensorimotor network (right paracentral lobule/supplementary motor area, right postcentral gyrus and left posterior insula). It should be noted that significant heterogeneity of ReHo alterations in the bilateral PCC, left parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus, and right superior parietal lobule/angular gyrus was observed in the meta-analysis. The subgroup meta-analyses revealed that MR field-strength and sex partly affected the overall results. Further meta-regression analyses indicated that some confounding factors, such as general cognitive function, gender distribution, age, and education level could partially contribute to the heterogeneity across studies. This voxel-wise meta-analysis identified significant decreases of ReHo in the bilateral PCC, right angular gyrus, and bilateral middle temporal gyri and increases of ReHo in the left parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus in patients with aMCI relative to healthy controls. These regions of ReHo alterations are critical hubs of the DMN [33] . The DMN, which is implicated in self-referential and memory processing, is the most studied brain cognitive network in aMCI and AD because it is preferentially susceptible to neurodegeneration and involves early in the AD pathophysiology [33, 34] . Convergent evidence suggests that remote functional connectivity in the DMN in AD and aMCI is reorganized, which correlates with cognitive impairments [33] [34] [35] . Our findings in alterations of local functional connectivity within the DMN yielded complimentary insights, which contribute to the modeling of brain functional connectomes of aMCI. Functional connectivity alterations in the DMN have been reported as a predictor of conversion from aMCI to AD [36, 37] . Even more importantly, the DMN has been gaining attention as a potential target of non-invasive brain stimulation for AD [33] . Both decreases and increases of ReHo were found in the DMN. This coexistence of functional deficits and compensation in aMCI was also suggested by previous studies [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . The parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus located in the medial temporal lobe, where the hallmark of pathological changes in AD, are critical structures responsible for mnestic functions. Increased ReHo in the parahippocampal gyrus/ hippocampus observed in this meta-analysis may serve to compensate for its neurodegeneration underlying memory impairments in patients with aMCI. It has been proposed that a U-shaped curve of the medial temporal lobe activation takes place early in the course of prodromal AD [44] . However, to what extent of the compensation of local functional connectivity in the aging-aMCI-AD continuum, further longitudinal studies are warranted to calcify this question.\nRecent studies have shown that aMCI is associated with an aberrant topological organization of large-scale functional brain networks beyond the DMN [41, 45, 46] . Apart from the regions within the DMN, our meta-analysis identified other regions of ReHo alterations in patients with aMCI, mainly involving the executive control network, visual network, and sensorimotor network. Regions of decreased ReHo in right DLPFC and superior parietal lobule are the components of the executive control network, which is implicated in initiating and modulating cognitive control. Despite the cardinal deficits in memory, patients with aMCI also exhibited impairments in executive functioning [47] [48] [49] [50] . The decreased ReHo in the executive control network suggested the reduced executive control ability in patients with MCI. Additionally, our meta-analysis identified increased ReHo in the right lingual gyrus and left middle occipital gyrus. These regions are important nodes of the visual network, which is crucial for the visual information processing relating to visual cognition. Previous functional MRI studies suggested that the visual network in MCI was less affected than that in AD [41] . Impairment of visual cognition is pronounced in AD but not in aMCI [51, 52] . Thus, increased ReHo in the visual network may be interpreted as a compensatory Fig. 4 Meta-regression analysis of ReHo alterations against the mean MMSE scores across studies. Lower mean MMSE score in the aMCI sample was associated with lower ReHo in the right angular gyrus/supramarginal gyrus (a), right DLPFC (b), and left inferior temporal gyrus (c). The color bar indicates the maximum and minimum SDM-Z values. Each study is labeled as a dot, with larger dots symbolizing larger sample sizes. Abbreviations: ReHo, regional homogeneity; MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examination; aMCI, amnestic mild cognitive impairment; DLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; L, left; R, right; SDM, Seed-based d Mapping process in patients with aMCI. We also observed consistent ReHo alterations within the sensorimotor network. Pathological or structural changes in the sensorimotor cortices were found to be least affected in aMCI and relatively preserved in AD [53] [54] [55] . Increased ReHo within the sensorimotor network might be compensated to disruptions of other functional networks.\nOf note is that significant heterogeneity of ReHo alterations in the bilateral PCC, left parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus, and right superior parietal lobule/ angular gyrus was observed in the meta-analysis. The subgroup meta-analyses indicated that MR field-strength and sex had confounding effects on the overall results of ReHo alterations. Exploratory meta-regression analyses revealed that this heterogeneity was attributed to some confounding factors, such as general cognitive function, gender distribution, age, and education level. Such moderators on brain structure or function have been well documented [39, [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Of interest, we observed significant association between ReHo alternates in the left PCC/precuneus and left pre/postcentral gyrus and female gender. Sex differences in brain ReHo [63] , resting-state functional connectivity [64] , and restingstate networks [65] in healthy subjects have been described. Although there are no statistically significant sex differences in the prevalence or incidence of aMCI [66] ; however, epidemiologic studies indicate that women patients with MCI have greater longitudinal rates of cognitive and functional progression than men [67] . In postmortem investigations, women showed more extensive senile plaques deposition throughout the brain than men at early neurofibrillary tangle stages [68] . Variability in brain ReHo in patients with aMCI due to sex differences is not well understood, which should be carefully studied in future studies. Although analyses of patient characteristics might help explain the heterogeneity observed across studies, they were far from sufficient. Other potential confounding factors, such as pathological heterogeneity underlying this disorder, genetic status, neuropsychological characteristics, administered medications, acquisition parameters of MRI, and preprocessing and analytic approaches, might also contribute to the heterogeneity. Unfortunately, it was not possible to conduct separate subgroup and meta-regression analyses to systemically examine these moderating effects because of insufficient information available from the original studies, but these confounding effects merit future investigations.\nSeveral limitations in the present study should be noted. First, we observed some publication biases in the bilateral PCC and left parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus. In order to increase the quality of the meta-analysis, only peer-reviewed articles using a whole-brain analysis published in English were included in this meta-analysis. Thus, studies published in other languages, unpublished materials, or studies performing with ROI and two-dimensional analyses were excluded. In addition, of the 11 datasets included in the meta-analysis, eight were from China (280 patients with aMCI), two from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (64 patients with aMCI), and one from Korea (34 patients with aMCI). Due to these factors, publication bias might be not avoidable. Hence, an additional research need exists for future comprehensively pooling big neuroimaging data from worldwide populations. Second, although patients with aMCI are heterogeneous in etiology, the ReHo findings in our meta-analysis may represent a common pattern of functional changes underlying aMCI. However, limited by the cross-sectional design of the original studies included, further clinical outcomes of patients with aMCI that convert to AD or remain stable or improve can vary considerably. Our study could not disentangle the ReHo differences between them. In addition, the cross-sectional design of the studies could not elucidate the causality of the alterations in ReHo and aMCI. Further longitudinal follow-up designed studies are highly warranted to clarify these issues. Third, as already mentioned above, many confounding factors might influence ReHo alterations on aMCI. However, not all studies made enough adjustment for these confounders. To reduce heterogeneity and provide more conclusive findings, larger and better designed studies in homogenous patients are needed. Finally, the coordinate-based metaanalysis approaches are important for identifying the anatomical convergence of neuroimaging studies. However, they mainly relied on published coordinates and their effect sizes, not on original imaging data, which may bias the results."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This voxel-wise meta-analysis provides provisional evidence that aMCI is associated with abnormal ReHo within the DMN, executive control network, visual network, and sensorimotor network.
