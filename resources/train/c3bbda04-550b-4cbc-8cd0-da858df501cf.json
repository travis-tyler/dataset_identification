[{"section_title": "", "text": "for population-scale test and trace operations. Genotyping is a rapid, high-throughput and 23 low-cost alternative for screening positive SARS-CoV-2 samples in many settings. We have 24 designed a SNP identification pipeline to identify genetic variation using sequenced SARS- 25 CoV-2 samples. Our pipeline identifies a minimal marker panel that can define distinct 26 genotypes. To evaluate the system we developed a genotyping panel to detect variants- 27 identified from SARS-CoV-2 sequences surveyed between March and May 2020-and tested 28 this on 50 stored qRT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples that had been collected 29 across the South West of the UK in April 2020. The 50 samples split into 15 distinct 30 genotypes and there was a 76% probability that any two randomly chosen samples from our 31 set of 50 would have a distinct genotype. In a high throughput laboratory, qRT-PCR positive 32 samples pooled into 384-well plates could be screened with our marker panel at a cost of < 33 \u00a31.50 per sample. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of a SNP genotyping panel to 34 provide a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable way to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating 35 in an outbreak. Our analysis pipeline is publicly available and will allow for marker panels to 36 be updated periodically as viral genotypes arise or disappear from circulation. 37 Introduction 38 In March 2020 the World Health Organisation characterised the global outbreak of COVID- 39 19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a 40 pandemic (1). A huge global effort followed to learn more about the virus, how it is 41 transmitted and the disease it causes, in order to prevent and control outbreaks and find 42 effective treatments and vaccines. 43 Since the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was released in January 2020, tens of 44 thousands of genome sequences have been shared online in public databases (2, 3). Access 45 to sequence data is crucial for researchers to identify novel mutations, design diagnostic 46 tests and vaccines, and to track outbreaks; allowing researchers to follow the transmission 47 of SARS-CoV-2 both locally and globally. 48 As with all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 accumulates random mutations during replication. The viral 49 replication complex has proof reading activity which may at least partially explain the 50 relatively low rate of accumulated mutations (4). It has been estimated that SARS-CoV-2 51 accumulates on average about one to two mutations per month (5) which is about half the 52 rate reported for the influenza virus that does not have a proof reading mechanism and 53 likely has different structural constraints on its own proteins (6, 7). 54 Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, distinct lineages have formed as viruses circulating 55 in particular regions evolved and increased in frequency. Consortia were galvanised to 56 sequence a large number of positive SARS-CoV-2 samples to track both the evolution and 57 geographic movements of the virus (3, 8) and a nomenclature for SARS-CoV-2 lineages was 58 suggested to enable clear communication between research groups (9). 59 Contact tracing procedures that utilise genomic tools have been shown to reduce the size 60 and duration of an outbreak (10); these tools also yield detailed information about lines of 61 transmission. To date, SARS-CoV-2 lineages have been determined by sequencing positive 62 SARS-CoV-2 samples. While thorough, this approach is costly and only a small proportion of 63 positive samples have been assigned to a lineage. Our research aims to address this issue by 64 developing a high-throughput, low-cost genotyping panel to identify circulating SARS-CoV-2 65 variants as genotypes (Fig 1) . We use the term genotype here as opposed to lineage as our 66 system is designed to separate samples from a local outbreak into distinct groups rather 67 than attempt to infer their phylogenetic relationships with other samples. Concordance between genotyping and sequencing 207 The two SARS-CoV-2 isolates GBR/Liverpool_strain/2020 and hCoV-19/England/02/2020 had 208 been sequenced, enabling a comparison with our genotyping data ( Bris\uf044S deletion probes). Within the 50 PHE clinical samples assayed, seven were found to 264 have the deletion (Fig 3a) . All seven samples appeared to contain only the Bris\uf044S deletion 265 and no wt spike sequence. for testing laboratories and very low cost per sample. Testing laboratories may also consider 393 designing their own marker panels based on regional or national datasets (the latter in our 394 case) to maximise the fit between sample SNP frequencies and the test panel. Our primer 395 design pipeline is freely available for this purpose. The advantage of RT-PACE technology is 396 that the SNP panel can be modified at low cost on a regular basis: in a medium to high-397 throughput laboratory the cost of new primer sets would not be a significant factor. The 398 only real limitation of our approach is that it is not necessarily possible to assign samples to 399 a specific named lineage in the way that full sequence data allows. We have shown, 400 however that there is a high probability (>75%) of being able to separate any two samples 401 into distinct genotypes using our marker panel, and in many settings this will be sufficient to 402 identify or rule out transmission routes and thus inform public health policy to minimise the 403 spread of the virus. 404 "}]
