[{"section_title": "Introduction 40", "text": "The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks have grievously 41 impacted the world by threatening lives and impeding human activity in a short period. Understanding the 42 factors that govern the severity of a pandemic is of paramount importance to design better surveillance 43 systems and control policies [1] . In the case of COVID-19, three variables play a critical role in its spread 44 and severity in a country: the nature of the pathogen, genetic diversity of the host population, and 45 environmental factors such as public awareness and health measures provided by governments [2] . 46 SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein plays an integral role in the viral transmission virulence [3] . The S 47 protein contains two functional subunits S1 and S2 cleaved by FURIN protease at the host cell [4] . The S1 48 subunit contains the receptor binding domain and facilitates interactions with the host cell surface receptor, 49\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [5, 6] . The S2 subunit, activated by the host Transmembrane 50\nSerine Protease 2, harbors necessary elements for membrane fusion [7] . S protein mutations may induce 51 conformational changes leading to increased pathogenicity [8] . We were pioneers to report the perspective 52 role of S protein D614G (23403A>G) variant located at the S1-S2 proximal junction. The D614G mutation 53 generates conformational changes in the protein structure which renders the FURIN cleavage site (664-54 RRAR-667) flexible and thus enhances viral entry [9] . Currently, the D614G mutation has become the 55 focus of several recent studies for the use in prospective drug targeting strategies [10] . Furthermore, studies 56 on understanding the genetic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging [11] . Admixture 57 analyses have been conducted to understand the evolution of Beta-coronaviruses and in particular the 58 diversification of SARS-CoV-2 [12] . Haplotype analysis have also indicated that frequencies of certain 59 haplotypes correlate with virus pathogenicity [13] . 60\nHere we extended our study by analyzing the population genetics aspects within genome sequences of 61 SARS-CoV-2 to understand the contiguous spread of SARS-CoV-2, its rapid evolution, and the differential 62 severity of COVID-19 among different continents. We analyzed 2341 viral sequences deposited in GISAID 63 (https://www.r-project.org/). 88"}, {"section_title": "Protein Structural Analysis 89", "text": "The crystal structures of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, PDB ID: 6M71) [25] and the 90 S protein (PDB ID:6VSB) [26] were used as model proteins for the structural analysis.

This clustering in Europe and North America is probably associated with a founder effect 113 where a single mutation was introduced and subsequently transmitted. This suggestion is corroborated by 114 the fact that the collection date of the founder strain is prior to that observed in the European and the North 115\nAmerican clusters (S1 Fig) . Then, in order to estimate the ancestral allele frequencies and admixture proportions for each SARS-CoV-117 2 sample, admixture analysis was implemented.

We did this analysis because continental 172 datasets of Africa (n=25), Oceania (n=69), and South America (n=24) were very small to infer high 173 confident LD blocks from respective datasets alone. Hence, we first compared LD blocks obtained from 174 the combined dataset and then observed LD among the same variants in each continental dataset. The 175 second way of analysis was by directly estimating haplotype blocks in each continental dataset with large 176 sample size such as Asia, Europe, and North America. 177\nFrom the first analysis, we observed that LD block, obtained from the combined dataset, varies among Table 2 shows MAF of 18 variants involved in 181 haplotype block of combined dataset in each continental dataset. These differences called for the second 182 approach of estimating haplotype blocks and the extent of LD between variants directly from each 183 continental dataset having large sample size. Surprisingly, we observed different sets of variants in 184 haplotype blocks, different length of haplotype blocks, and differences in nonsynonymous composition in 185 haplotype blocks among the three continents datasets (Fig 4) .

Wrapp et al. recently solved the cryo-EM structure of the S protein with 3.5 \u00c5 resolution 196\n[26] (Fig 5 A) . The S protein has many flexible loop regions that were not visible in the structure, including 197 the RRAR cleavage site. Therefore, we modeled-in the cleavage site and the undetected flexible regions 198 using the cryo-EM structure PDB ID: 6M71 as a scaffold [27] . Fig 5 B shows the overlay of the S protein 199 from PDB ID:6VSB with the modelled S protein, with an RMSD of 0.25 \u00c5. As shown in the overlay figure,  200 there are more loops present in the modelled structure that were not detected by Cryo-EM. The RRAR 201 cleavage site (Fig 5 C) shows a high surface accessible region, where the viral protein can attach to the host 202\nprotein. As such, any mutations on the S protein especially close to RRAR site might alter its activity. 203 D614G is a mutation believed to increase SARS-CoV-2 virulence [9]. One possibility is that the change 204 from a negatively charged aspartate to a non-polar glycine may modify the structure and therefore the 205 D614 is in close vicinity to T859 of the adjacent monomer's S2 (Chain B) where they can form a H-bond 210 (Fig 6) through both sidechains. In addition, backbone H-bonds can be formed with A646 of the same 211 chain. It was documented that S2 domains alter their structure after FURIN site cleavage [31] . Therefore, 212 the mutation of D614 to G might weaken the stability of S2 and make cell entry more aggressive. It is 213\nprobably the loss of the H-bond between D614 (S1/Chain A) and T859 (S2/Chain B) that stops the hinging 214 of the S2 domain making it more flexible in the transition state when interacting with the host cell receptor. 215\nAnother possibility would be that the mutation to G and the loss of the H-bond to the adjacent chain made 216 the protein more flexible. A thermodynamic analysis showed that D614G mutation resulted in slightly 217 destabilizing the protein with a \u0394\u0394G: -0.086 kcal/mol and in increasing in vibrational entropy \u0394\u0394SVib 0.137 218 kcal.mol -1 .K -1 as seen in Fig 7 A where the red parts indicate more flexibility.

Furthermore, the flexibility observed in the ribosomal binding domain region (Fig 7) may 222 facilitate the binding of ACE2 to the S protein [26] . 223 P314L mutation. ORF1a and ORF1b produce a set of non-structural proteins (nsp) which assemble to 224 facilitate viral replication and transcription (nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12) [32] . The nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) 225 entry site and the nascent RNA strand exit paths has positively charged aa, is solvent accessible, and is 226 conserved in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 8) . P314L mutation is positioned on the interface domain of the RdRp (or 227 nsp12) between A250-R365 residues. Previous studies have shown that the interface domain has functional 228 significance in the RdRp of Flavivirus. In addition, when polar or charged residue mutations were 229 introduced into these sites, viral replication levels were significantly affected [33] . Thus, mutations on 230 nsp12 interface residues may affect the polymerase activity and RNA replication of SARS-CoV-2. Proline 231 is often found in very tight turns in protein structures and can also function to introduce kinks into \u03b1-helices. 232\nIn Fig 9, we investigated the proposed intermolecular bonds that P314 can make, where the backbone COO -233 group of proline can form H-bonds with the backbone NH groups of T and S or the OHgroup of S side 234 chain. Whereas the pyrrolidine forms hydrophobic interactions with the W268 and F275. The mutation to 235 leucine tightens the structure and reduces the flexibility with an increase in \u0394\u0394G: 0.717 kcal/mol and a 236 decrease in vibrational entropy to \u0394\u0394SVib ENCoM: -0.301 kcal.mol -1 .K -1 (Fig 10) . Furthermore, leucine 237 possesses a non-polar side chain, seldomly involving catalysis, which can play a role in substrate 238 recognition such as binding/recognition of hydrophobic ligands. L314 backbone COO-forms a H-bond 239 with the sidechain OH-group of S325, in addition to a hydrophobic interaction with W68 and L270. L270 240 is positioned on top of the flexible loop region, therefore forming a hydrophobic interaction, displacing any 241 possibility of water molecules entering the looped region thus making it more compact. The overall 242 improved stability of RdRp can make it more efficient in RNA replication and hence increasing SARS-243\nCoV-2 virulence. 244 .

Presence of an un-admixed block pattern of strong LD between strains suggests that 270 LD sites are not broken by significant recombination seen in these two continents. This is either due to their physical 271 distance or natural selection. On the contrary, weak LD sites have shown clear admixture between strains. Strikingly, 272 each continent is dominated by different set of nonsynonymous clusters such as Africa by C4, Asia by C1, Europe 273 by C2, North America by C3, Oceania by C5, and South America by C2. This is also evident from the allele 274 frequency variation seen in each continent. 275\nFurther, continental-wise haplotype block estimation enabled us to identify variation of linked nonsynonymous and 276 synonymous sites in Asia, Europe, and North America. Although selection primarily acts on variation that undergo 277 amino acid change, many synonymous variants were observed in haplotype blocks. This suggests that these 278 synonymous sites hitch-hiked along with nonsynonymous variants due to their physical proximity. Another 279 observed interesting feature was the variation in the number of nonsynonymous sites between Asia, Europe, and 280\nNorth America. Asian haplotype block carried three nonsynonymous variants, Europe haplotype block carried ten 281 nonsynonymous variants, and North American haplotype block carried seven nonsynonymous variants. This 282 suggests that the initial strain which originated and travelled from Asia had less functional sites whereas coinfection-283 led recombination in Europe and North America enriched functional sites in strains. 284\nOur preliminary structural analysis of the European strain main mutations, D614G located in the spike gene 285 and P314L located in the RdRp gene, showed that the first mutation will render the FURIN cleavage site 286 more accessible while the latter would increase protein stability. 73% of the European samples have both 287 mutations segregating together; while in Africa only 11% of the sequenced viral samples have them. This 288 is probably the reason behind the elevated mortality rates in Europe. This points out to the fact that the virus 289 has evolved at an alarming rate by introducing two mutations that increase its chances of survival. The 290\nEuropean strain harbors additional mutations, notably the hotspot mutations R203K and G204R that cluster 291 in a serine-rich linker region at the RdRp. It was suggested that these mutations might potentially enhance 292 .

It is imperative that more comprehensive studies should 297 be conducted as more patient data emerges from different parts of the world. We also realize that our 298 analysis focuses only on the early spread samples and that we have to keep analyzing the viral sequences 299 to determine if recombination is occurring between other strains and identify any new mutations specially 300 since the world is currently fighting the second wave of the virus. Our data highlight the urgent need to 301 correlate patients' medical/infection history to the viral variants in order to predict in a more accurate and 302 personalized way how different viral strains are influencing this pandemic. 303 .
