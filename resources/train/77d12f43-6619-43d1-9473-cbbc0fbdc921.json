[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The US continues to face a rising epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD), with over 47,000 people dying of opioid overdose in 2017. 1 Major efforts are underway to expand treatment access, in particular to buprenorphine, which reduces mortality and can be prescribed in office-based settings. 2,3 In order to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD, clinicians are required to be able to refer patients to psychosocial counseling, but referrals are not mandatory. 4 Psychosocial interventions (PIs) encompass numerous modalities, including brief supportive counseling, specialized addiction counseling, community recovery supports (e.g., 12 step meetings), psychotherapy for comorbid mental health disorders, and importantly should be individualized based on each patient's needs. 4 However, not all forms of PIs may be available in different areas and an often-cited barrier to offering buprenorphine treatment is the lack of available psychosocial services in communities. 5,6 Given that PIs can be a recommended part of OUD treatment, it is critical to further understand their use by active buprenorphine prescribers and perceived barriers or challenges. Prior studies of buprenorphine prescribers have found the majority of prescribers offered counseling within their practice settings and others refer patients to counseling in the community. 7,8 Furthermore, in a small sample of buprenorphine prescribers in New York City, 62% of respondents considered PIs to be of at least high importance for patients. 9 In addition, patients value psychosocial interventions, including brief counseling delivered by the prescriber, though some also believe PIs should not be a mandatory requirement of treatment. 10 Further data on perceived importance by prescribers and barriers to use in a large national sample of prescribers would better elucidate current practices and needs in delivering buprenorphine treatment. In addition, because buprenorphine can be prescribed in general outpatient settings, a spectrum of prescribers, including physicians with specific training in addiction treatment and psychiatry, primary care physicians (PCPs), and other physicians are delivering buprenorphine treatment. 11 Use of psychotherapy for mental health disorders has been shown to be lower for patients treated by PCPs than by psychiatrists, 12,13 which may be related to both differences in access and other barriers to use and differences in perspectives on psychotherapy treatment. Understanding how PCPs differ in use or perceived importance of PIs when compared to addiction or mental health specialists, who may have more training and more resources in their settings, is also important in OUD treatment. The current study addresses these gaps in a national survey of active buprenorphine-prescribing physicians across specialties by assessing perceptions and use of PIs."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "All US physicians with a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine were identified using the May 2014 issue of the DEA Active Registrants database. Methods have been described in detail previously. 14,15 In brief, physicians were randomly sampled within states. To be eligible, physicians were required to be actively treating at least one patient with OUD with buprenorphine. Telephone screening yielded 3,553 eligible physicians, who were mailed a study packet (i.e., survey, consent forms, postage-paid return envelope). Participants received $100. Participation was encouraged with a postcard reminder, follow-up telephone call, and a second packet mailed to non-respondents. From July 2014 to January 2017, 33.0% (n=1,174) of eligible prescribers participated. Because of our focus on current prescribers, physicians with the 100-patient waiver were far more likely to be eligible, and these physicians were more likely to respond (36.5% response rate) than physicians with the 30-patient waiver (29.3% response rate). Our sampling strategy resulted in respondents being well-distributed across the nation. All procedures were approved by the University of Kentucky's Institutional Review Board. Physicians were classified into three mutually exclusive categories: primary care (including family medicine and internal medicine), addiction/psychiatry (addiction medicine, addiction psychiatry, or psychiatry alone), and all others (reference group). The following physician characteristics were also assessed: age, gender, race, US Census region, years of prescribing buprenorphine, metropolitan versus non-metropolitan location, waiver type (i.e., 30-patient limit or 100-patient limit) and payment type for office visits. Non-metropolitan versus metropolitan location was determined using the zip code of the practice location and the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) published by the US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. 16 Physicians with missing data on specialty were excluded (n = 25). The survey included questions assessing prescriber perceptions of PIs encompassing broadly \"counseling\" and psychosocial support resources (e.g. 12-step groups), and responses were dichotomized as \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" (=1) versus all others (=0, including neither agree or disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree). Please see item wording of survey questions in Table 2. Physicians were asked to indicate the percentage of patients who received counseling from different sources. Chi-square tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare these measures of PIs by medical specialty. For dichotomous measures that were significant, bivariate logistic regressions were conducted to isolate pairwise differences. Finally, adjusted analyses using logistic regression for dichotomous measures and negative binomial regressions for the percentages of patients receiving counseling were estimated while controlling for physician characteristics that varied significantly across the three specialty groups."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Among this US sample of active buprenorphine-prescribing physicians, 39.6% (N=455) were primary care, 48.7% (N=560) were addiction/psychiatry, and 11.7% (N=134) were categorized as other. Table 1 summarizes their characteristics. There were no differences in waiver type (30-patient limit or 100-patient limit) across physicians. PCPs on average had slightly fewer years of prescribing compared to addiction physicians/psychiatrists and a higher proportion accepted Medicaid compared to both other physician groups. On average 93.3% of all buprenorphine prescribers believed patients would benefit from counseling with no significant difference across prescriber specialties (Table 2). However, only 36.4% (n=414) believed there are adequate numbers of counselors in their community who can provide counseling to buprenorphine patients. The majority of prescribers reported most of their patients would benefit from 12-step groups, but 30.6% (n = 346) perceived 12step groups in their communities may be unwelcoming towards patients on buprenorphine, with no significant differences across prescriber specialties. More addiction/psychiatry physicians (42.2%, n=233; odds ratio, OR=1.51, p=0.002) perceived there were adequate numbers of counselors in their area compared to PCPs (32.7%; N=147). A much larger proportion of addiction physicians/psychiatry physicians (75.9%, n = 416, OR=7.68, p<0.001) compared to PCPs (29.1%, n = 130) reported they had adequate resources to care for patients with complex psychiatric needs but only a minority in both groups reported adequate resources to address complex social needs. PCPs reported fewer patients received counseling from the prescriber or other clinicians in the practice and more patients receiving outside counseling than addiction/psychiatry physicians. Prescribers across specialties report only a small minority of patients did not receive any counseling. Results were largely the same after adjusting for differences in prescriber characteristics across the three specialty groups, except PCPs no longer reported a significantly smaller percent of patients receiving counseling from them compared to addiction/psychiatry physicians (see Appendix Table 1)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study of US buprenorphine prescribers, we find PIs are highly recommended by prescribers of all specialties, but many prescribers felt there were an inadequate number of counselors in their area. Prior work indicate lack of availability of PIs is a barrier to physicians initiating buprenorphine treatment. 5,6 In our study of active buprenorphine prescribers, we confirm most buprenorphine prescribers highly value PIs, but use a variety of approaches to deliver PIs including delivering counseling themselves, working in conjunction with other clinicians who deliver therapy or referring patients to outside resources. These findings are notable in part because the evidence for PIs as a whole is unclear. A number of RCT's have not shown effectiveness of adjunctive psychotherapy interventions for patients receiving buprenorphine. [17][18][19][20][21] These trials were rigorously designed and generally compared a formal psychotherapy intervention delivered by a therapist plus medical management versus medical management alone. Medical management is a basic treatment approach including brief supportive counseling and monitoring of substance use and medication adherence, typically delivered by the prescriber. 17 There is also some evidence indicating benefits of attending 12-step groups on buprenorphine treatment outcomes in non-randomized studies, though mandatory attendance was not beneficial. 22,23 In the current results, some prescribers had concerns about whether 12-step meetings in their community were accepting of patients receiving buprenorphine treatment, a concern that has also been raised by patients. 24 In addition, it is important to note that buprenorphine prescribers are required to be able to refer patients to PIs, but referrals are not mandatory. 4 The contrast we see between limited evidence on PIs to date and the importance prescribers place on PIs and their utilization may reflect the need by prescribers to address comorbid psychiatric and other substance use disorders, which are highly prevalent in this patient population. 25 Future studies should continue to develop and test PIs as adjunctive treatments to buprenorphine, but may want to focus on interventions for those with higher treatment needs, such as those with comorbid mental health and other substance use disorders. In addition, we found a number of differences in perceptions of PI availability and use across prescriber specialties. Fewer PCPs reported adequate number of counselors in their area and adequate resources in their setting for patients with complex psychosocial conditions. A number of factors may contribute. PCPs report a higher proportion of patients receiving Medicaid, which may magnify access challenges to PIs, but findings persisted after adjusting for differences in prescriber characteristics. Specialists in addiction/psychiatry, on the other hand, may have better referral processes or be more likely to work in settings with on-site availability of psychotherapy, which is consistent with the results showing addiction/ psychiatry physicians report almost double the percent of patients receiving counseling from clinicians in their practices. These data indicate there is variability of resources to deliver PIs across practice settings and across prescriber specialties. Specialists may have more resources within their practice settings to treat more complex patients, which is consistent with the success of hub-and-spoke models of buprenorphine treatment in some communities. 26,27 Future work developing novel treatment models, such as integrated behavioral health in primary care or telemedicine, may increase access to PIs for more complex patients receiving buprenorphine in primary care. 28,29 Importantly, PCPs also report delivering counseling themselves to about half of their patients. Medical management, which incorporates brief counseling, can be delivered effectively by non-specialty trained physicians and other clinicians and may be a key part of buprenorphine treatment. 17 The survey results indicate that a substantial proportion of prescribers report delivering medical management or other PIs to many of their patients, though further data is needed to understand intensity and type of services provided. This study has several limitations. All data rely on physician self-report of practices and not on actual treatment provided. However, there is limited data on buprenorphine prescriber perceptions and comparison of prescriber self-reported perceptions and use of PIs across physician specialties provides important insights. Survey questions did not specify or differentiate types of PIs (e.g., different psychotherapy modalities, group versus individual PIs, other social support groups besides 12-step, etc.) and there may be differences in how prescribers interpret what constitutes counseling. Finally, the limited response rate in this study may limit generalizability, though this is a common challenge in national physician surveys. 30,31 There is a clear and pressing need to increase the number of prescribers delivering buprenorphine treatment to patients with OUD. As we encourage more prescribers, both generalists and specialists, to adopt treatment, it is critical to consider additional treatments that may be needed for some patients in this population. Novel models incorporating psychosocial services that be delivered in primary care and other settings and a better understanding of models current prescribers use in their practices to overcome access challenges may help support prescribers to deliver optimal care to their patients with OUD."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material."}, {"section_title": "Highlights", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "\u2022", "text": "93% of prescribers think most buprenorphine patients would benefit from counseling \u2022 36% of prescribers report there are adequate number of counselors in their areas\nPrescribers vary in delivering counseling vs. having patients see other counselors \u2022 Specialists report more resources for patients with complex psychiatric problems Table 1.
