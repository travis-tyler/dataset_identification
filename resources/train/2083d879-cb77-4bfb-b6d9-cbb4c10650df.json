Lizarraga, et al., Effect of age, ethnicity, sex, cognitive status and APOE genotype on amyloid load and the threshold for amyloid positivity, NeuroImage: Clinical, https://doi.\nThe threshold for amyloid positivity by visual assessment on PET has been validated by comparison to amyloid load measured histopathologically and biochemically at post mortem. As such, it is now feasible to use qualitative visual assessment of amyloid positivity as an in-vivo gold standard to determine those factors which can modify the quantitative threshold for amyloid positivity. We calculated quantitative amyloid load, measured as Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVRs) using [18-F]florbetaben PET scans, for 159 Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants, who had been classified clinically as Cognitively Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Dementia (DEM). PET scans were visually rated as amyloid positive (A+) or negative (A-), and these judgments were used as the gold standard with which to determine (using ROC analyses) the SUVR threshold for amyloid positivity considering factors such as age, ethnicity (Hispanic versus non-Hispanic), gender, cognitive status, and apolipoprotein E \uf0654 carrier status. Visually rated scans were A+ for 11% of CN, 39.0% of MCI and 70% of DEM participants. The optimal SUVR threshold for A+ among all participants was 1.42 (sensitivity = 94%; specificity = 92.5%), but this quantitative threshold was higher among E4 carriers (SUVR= 1.52) than non-carriers (SUVR= 1.31). While mean SUVRs did not differ between Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants;, a statistically significant interaction term indicated that the effect of E4 carrier status on amyloid load was greater among non-Hispanics than Hispanics. Visual assessment, as the gold standard for A+, facilitates determination of the effects of various factors on quantitative thresholds for amyloid positivity. A continuous relationship was found between amyloid load and global cognitive scores, suggesting that any calculated threshold for the whole group, or a subgroup, is artefactual and that the lowest calculated threshold may be optimal for the purposes of early diagnosis and intervention."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Among cognitively normal (CN) individuals, the frequency of amyloid positivity increases progressively with advancing age (Aizenstein et al., 2008; Wolk and Klunk, 2009) . Fewer than 5% of participants 50 to 60 years, 10% of those 60 to 70 years, 25% of those 70 to 80 years, and more than 50% of those 80-90 years of age have been found to be amyloid positive (A+) on Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (A\u00df-PET). Amyloid positivity is also associated with greater cognitive impairment (Johnson et al., 2013) . Among cognitively healthy elderly individuals, those destined to become A+ may begin to have progressive increases in amyloid load as much as 12 to 20 years before reaching the threshold which is known as a positive amyloid scan (Perani et al., 2014; Rowe et al., 2010; Villemagne et al., 2011) . APOE\uf0654 genotype carriers (APOE\uf0654+) have higher amyloid loads than non-carriers, at all ages and at all levels of cognitive impairment (Li et al., 2017; Rowe et al., 2007) . Further, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (DEM) have higher amyloid tracer retention than cognitively normal (CN) individuals, primarily because a higher proportion of cognitively impaired individuals are likely to have Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to be APOE\uf0654+ as well (Jack et al., 2013) . Sex has not been found to have a significant effect on amyloid load (Murphy et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2015) . The risk for AD associated with APOE\uf0654 varies across ethnic groups with Whites Americans showing a higher risk compared to Hispanics (Campos et al., 2013) and African Americans (Tang, et al., 1998) . This association has been inconsistent in ethnic minority groups. While the number of copies of the e4 allele in some studies has not been associated with risk or age-of onset of LOAD (Evans, et al., 2003; , Murrell, et al., 2006; Tycko et al., 2004 ) , other studies have observed such effect .\nQualitative methods for determining amyloid positivity on amyloid PET scans are based on an expert reader's ability to make accurate binary visual assessments (presence or absence) of the amyloid binding tracer in the cerebral cortex, in one or more brain regions. These binary visual ratings have high inter-rater reliability and have been validated by demonstration at postmortem; there is a high correspondence between amyloid burden in PET scans and histopathological and biochemical evidence of amyloid plaques at autopsy (Ikonomovic et al., 2008) . Quantitative methods for establishing amyloid positivity require the determination of a threshold level of amyloid load antemortem, which corresponds to the presence and density of amyloid plaques A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T assessed histopathologically at autopsy (Johnson et al., 2013) . In the case of the PET amyloid ligand, [18-F] florbetaben, the semi-quantitative threshold for amyloid positivity, validated histopathologically in patients with terminal diseases, has been reported to be 1.48, measured in standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) normalized to the gray matter of the cerebellum (Sabri et al., 2015) .\nMore recently, A\u00df-PET scans, visually rated as A+ or A-, have been used as a \"gold standard\" of amyloid positivity, instead of histopathological validation of amyloid positivity. All of the currently available amyloid tracers have received approval from governmental regulatory bodies only after histopathological validation at autopsy. The use of \"imaging validation\" of amyloid positivity eliminates the requirement for performing A\u00df-PET scanning on terminal patients and following them to autopsy and facilitates the determination of the threshold of amyloid positivity in much greater numbers of living subjects, of varying ages, ethnicities and levels of cognitive impairment, including in cognitively normal individuals (Yeo et al., 2015) . Using \"imaging validation, and the cerebellar gray matter as the reference region, the optimal threshold for amyloid positivity for [18-F] florbetaben amyloid PET scans among a group of cognitively normal and AD patients, was determined to be an SUVR of 1.43 (Bullich et al., 2017) .\nIn this study we used the \"imaging validation\" of amyloid positivity (i.e., a binary visual reading as the gold standard) as described by Bullich et al (2017) , on [18-F] florbetaben PET scans, so as to calculate the optimal quantitative SUVR threshold that distinguished A+ from A-scans.\nThe study was conducted using data obtained from participants in the 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (1Florida ADRC) who were cognitively normal, as well as patients impaired to varying degrees, as seen in a typical clinical practice. Our primary goal was to determine the quantitative threshold of amyloid positivity considering factors such as age, ethnicity (Hispanic versus non-Hispanic), sex, severity of cognitive impairment, and APOE genotype. Ethnic groups, other than non-Hispanic Whites at risk of AD, are genetically understudied (Reitz & Mayeux, 2014) and this study contributes to closing this gap."}, {"section_title": "ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T MRI scans were performed using a Siemens Skyra 3T MRI scanner at Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach.

In addition, the use of visual assessment as the gold standard for amyloid positivity is a strength, which avoids the limitations of being dependent on autopsy studies to serve as the gold standard for amyloid positivity. These added strengths allow for larger numbers of patients, who are younger, less impaired and more diverse to also be studied. One limitation in this study is the relatively modest number of subjects included in the study thus far, considering the number of interactions and variables included in the analyses. Longitudinal analyses of this cohort will be important for elucidating the relationship between different amyloid thresholds and the impact on rate of progression to more impaired cognitive states.\nIn conclusion, we found that although mean SUVRs were influenced by age, cognitive status and APOE\uf0654 carrier status, only APOE\uf0654 carrier status had an impact on the optimal threshold for amyloid positivity. Nevertheless, we provide a rationale for using the lowest optimal threshold that can be identified for a particular ligand, for classification of A+ or A-, given that brain amyloid accumulation appears to be a continuous process."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods:", "text": "2.1. Recruitment, Clinical Evaluations, and Diagnoses. Participants (N=159) were recruited into the 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (1Florida ADRC) longitudinal study between mid-2015 and the end of 2017. This study was approved by the Mount Sinai Medical Center IRB and all participants and their study partners provided informed consent. The participants were between the ages of 50 and 90 years, and had completed an extensive medical, neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological evaluation, including all the elements required by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set, version 3.0 (Beekly et al, 2004 (Beekly et al, , 2007 .

Region-of-interest (ROI) boundaries were defined manually using the structural MRI for anatomical reference, and criteria that have been proven to provide highly reproducible outcomes (Desikan et al., 2006) . This registration process ensured that the florbetaben PET/CT image had the same accurate segmentation and parcellation as in the MRI scan. Atrophy correction was not used because of the additional noise-error added to quantification of regional counts in the PET images.\nThe average activity was calculated in the ROIs corresponding to cerebellar gray matter and cerebral cortical regions. A composite SUVR was calculated by the ratio of the mean volumeweighted SUVR of 5 cortical regions (frontal, temporal, parietal, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex regions, each region summed from left and right hemispheres) to the cerebellar gray matter (Rowe et al., 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "APOE Genotyping", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "Samples were genotyped for the APOE E2, E3 and E4 alleles using predesigned TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays for SNPs rs7412 and rs429358 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) on the QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, California, USA)\nfollowing the manufacturer's protocol.\nof APOE\uf0654-participants was outside the bootstrapped confidence limits for APOE\uf0654+ participants, and the optimal threshold for APOE\uf0654+ participants was outside the bootstrapped confidence limits for APOE\uf0654-participants, thereby confirming a statistical difference in the optimal thresholds. Figure 2 shows the distribution of composite SUVR scores by APOE\uf0654 carrier status and binary visual read status, with the optimal thresholds and confidence intervals superimposed.\nUsing a multiple regression analysis, with mean SUVR as the dependent variable, and age, ethnicity, MMSE scores and APOE genotype as the independent variables (Table 5) , MMSE score (p=.001) and APOE genotype (p=.001) predicted SUVR (i.e., lower MMSE scores and ApoE4+ status predicted higher SUVR), but there were no significant effects observed in relation to age or ethnicity. However, a significant interaction between ethnicity and APOE genotype was identified, such that SUVRs were higher among Non-Hispanics than Hispanics who were ApoE4+, but lower among non-Hispanics than Hispanics who were ApoE4-(Table 5; Figure 1 ).\nComposite SUVR correlated significantly with scores on the MMSE (r=-0.46; p<.0001) ( Figure   3 ), Category Fluency test (r=-0.36; p<.0001), HVLT-delayed (r=-0.38; p<.0001) and Trails B (r=0.38; p<.0001). Optimal SUVR thresholds (shown as dashed lines) to discriminate amyloid positive and amyloid negative, as determined by visual reads, were computed using Youden's criterion for ApoE \uf0654 positive and negative subjects (Youden, 1950) . The 95% confidence intervals for the Youden's index (shown as shaded regions) were generated by 1000 bootstrap samples using a bias-corrected and accelerated method. Optimal thresholds and confidence intervals are superimposed. \ncorrespondence between the visual reads of amyloid positive PET scans using [18-F] Florbetaben as the ligand, and the presence of moderate to frequent neuritic plaques, as opposed to no or sparse neuritic plaques. The sensitivity of this correspondence was in the range of 81.8%\nto 90%, and the specificity was in the range of 85.7% to 95%. Bullich et al (2017) used these findings to justify an \"Optimized classification of 18F-Florbetaben PET scans as positive and negative using an SUVR quantitative approach and comparison to visual assessment\". We have also used the findings by Sabri et al. to provide the justification for using the visual read as a gold standard for amyloid positivity/negativity. There are certain limitations which apply to the study by Sabri et al. , which would also be applicable to other comparisons of in vivo \u00df-amyloid PET imaging with post-mortem histopathology [22, 23] . These limitations include the fact that end-stage individuals have medical illnesses, which could affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the ligand uptake in the brain, as well as pronounced brain atrophy, which makes visual assessment of the PET scans challenging. These limitations negatively bias the association between the PET and histopathology data. However, these limitations, cited by Sabri et al., do not apply to the current study, which includes participants who were either cognitively normal, had MCI or mild dementia. Hence, we would argue that our approach, which uses binary visual reads (amyloid positive versus negative), comes closer to a gold standard for determining amyloid positivity, than was the case in the Sabri et al and similar studies, with respect to the correspondence of the PET data to the frequency of amyloid plaques in the brain .\nUsing binary visual ratings of [18-F] florbetaben A\u00df-PET scans as the gold standard, we found an optimal quantitative threshold for amyloid positivity (SUVR=1.42) (approximately 31 to 33 in centiloid units) for the entire cohort of 159 participants. This threshold, using cerebellar gray matter as the reference region, was similar to the threshold obtained for amyloid positivity (SUVR= 1.43) in a prior study (Bullich et al., 2017) , which also used visual rating of PET scans as the gold standard. In comparison, the threshold for amyloid positivity for [18-F] Florbetaben obtained by Sabri et al (2015) was 1.48, using post mortem histopathology as the gold standard and antemortem PET scans in non-demented and demented cases, many of who were severely cognitively impaired. This somewhat higher SUVR threshold for florbetaben may be related to the inclusion of individuals with severe dementia who were terminal at the time they underwent amyloid PET scans (Sabri et al., 2015) .\nVisual ratings of amyloid positivity, which was used in this study as the gold standard against which to determine the threshold of amyloid positivity, is a direct, accessible, and nonquantitative method of identifying the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the brain. In the current study the visual reading of amyloid positivity required that at least one region in the brain had an area of gray matter uptake equal to or greater in intensity than the adjacent white matter uptake (Bullich et al., 2017) . Among patients with dementia, visual readings of A\u00df-PET scans are generally reported to show pronounced uptake in many brain regions and are largely dichotomous in distribution, i.e., clearly positive or negative (Jack et al., 2013; Jack et al., 2010) ,\nwhereas, among patients with MCI, A\u00df-PET scans are generally read as moderately positive (RCTU score of 2) in a limited number or only one region (Wolk and Klunk, 2009) A quantitative (SUVR) threshold for amyloid positivity, is calculated for a particular ligand, so as to optimally distinguish the presence of amyloid plaques (Thal phase 3 or greater) from the absence of amyloid plaques (Thal et al., 2015) . A quantitative threshold is likely to be less sensitive than a visual rating method, which allows for determination of amyloid positivity by identifying only one unilateral brain region (Grothe et al., 2017) to be moderately positive (Mountz et al., 2015) . While amyloid load is greater among participants who have amyloid positive visual reads, as compared to amyloid negative reads (Table 1) , the visual read itself is based on qualitative criteria and is not directly comparable to the amyloid load in various brain regions.\nDemographic, genetic, and methodological factors may account for differences in estimates of amyloid positivity in different studies (Chetelat et al., 2013; McDonough, 2017) . In this study, we found the frequencies of amyloid positivity by visual rating to be numerically higher in older participants versus younger, in the cognitively more impaired versus less impaired, and in those A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T who were APOE\u03b54+ versus APOE\u03b54- (Table 3 and Figure 2 ). Our findings of positive amyloid scans among 11% of CN, 39% of MCI and 70% of DEM subjects are within the range of 0-47% for CN subjects, 37-72% for MCI, and 68-100% for AD reported by Chetelat et al. (2013) . We did not find any differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants, in the frequency of visually rated positive scans (Table 3) . Across all demographic groups and diagnoses (CN, MCI or dementia) the amyloid load, independent of the visual reading of amyloid positivity or negativity, was found to be greater among APOE4+ than E4-participants, as is evidenced by the mean SUVRs for APOE4+ and E4-participants (Table 3) .\nAmong our participants there was no significant difference in APOE\u03b54 frequency between Hispanics and White non-Hispanics (Table 2 ). Contrary to our results, lower APOE\u03b54 frequencies and lower risk for Alzheimer's disease associated with APOE\u03b54 genotype among Hispanics, as compared to white non-Hispanics have been previously reported (Campos et al., 2013) , which may possibly be explained by the fact that participants in the study by Campos et al were Mexican Hispanics, whereas our Hispanic participants are primarily from such countries as Cuba, Colombia and Venezuela. .\nWe did find an interaction between ethnicity and APOE genotype, such that APOE\u03b54+ non-Hispanic subjects tended to have higher SUVRs than APOE\u03b54+ Hispanics, whereas APOE\u03b54-Hispanics tended to have higher SUVRs than non-Hispanics (Table 4 and Figure 1 ). Genetic studies on Hispanics suggest that the effect of APOE\u03b54 on AD risk may be less than that in Caucasians (Farrer et al., 1997 , Tang et al., 1998 , Ertekin-Taner, 2007 . Our findings of a weaker influence of APOE\u03b54 on Abeta load in Hispanics, combined with the reportedly greater prevalence and risk for AD among Hispanics, as compared to white non-Hispanics (Alzheimer's Association, 2018) appears to be consistent with these earlier genetic data, and may suggest that there is a greater risk for clinical dementia by non-APOE\u03b54 genetic or non-genetic factors than that for non-Hispanic Caucasians.\nFew studies have investigated thresholds for amyloid positivity in subgroups of participants classified by demographic or biological characteristics, due to limitations imposed by requiring validation of amyloid content in the brain by histopathology. We did not find differences in the optimal quantitative threshold for amyloid positivity as a function of age, sex, ethnicity (Hispanics versus non-Hispanic), or in relation to cognitive status of the group. However, the A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T threshold for amyloid positivity was found to be substantially lower among APOE\uf0654-(SUVR = 1.31) than APOE\uf0654+ participants (SUVR=1.52).\nIt is well known that APOE\uf0654+ status, older age and cognitive impairment are associated with higher average SUVRs on A\u00df-PET and lower cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b2 protein levels (Head et al., 2012; Li et al., 2017; Reiman et al., 2009) .. In a histopathological study of non-demented individuals, APOE\uf0654 carriers had greater amyloid load than APOE\uf0654 non-carriers, even though there was no difference between the two groups in AD pathology (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) (Caselli et al. 2010 ). Among APOE\uf0654+ carriers, the increased risk for developing AD, as well for developing AD at an earlier age, appears to be related to earlier and greater A\u03b2 accumulation, in the brain . Cognitively normal APOE\uf0654+ carriers have been found, on average, to become A+ at 56 years of age, whereas APOE\uf0654 non-carriers become amyloid positive on average, at about 76 years of age (Fleisher et al., 2013) . It is likely that our findings of a higher optimal threshold for amyloid positivity among APOE\uf0654 carriers is related to the association of APOE\uf0654 carrier status on amyloid load, independent of the effect of coexisting AD, greater age, more impaired cognitive status and ethnicity. In fact, the higher amyloid load among APOE\uf0654 carriers, as compared to non-APOE\uf0654 carriers appears to be superimposed on the effects of other factors associated with increased amyloid load, such as aging and cognitive impairment (Li et al., 2017; Rowe et al., 2007) .\nIn the present investigation, quantitative measures (SUVRs) show a continuous increase of amyloid load in relation to cognitive test performance (Figure 3) , spanning the range from CN to mild to moderate dementia, with SUVRs ranging from clearly A-to the higher levels seen in AD.\nIn longitudinal studies using amyloid imaging, the increase in amyloid load in CN elderly has been about 1% per year (Villain et al., 2012) , with about 3% of CN subjects progressing from Ato A+ per year, with a higher progression rate (7%) in APOE\uf0654 carriers (Vlassenko et al., 2011) .\nA relationship between cognitive performance and amyloid load across the spectrum of CN and cognitively impaired individuals has been reported previously, and is detectable well before the threshold of amyloid positivity is reached (Pike et al., 2007; Chetelat et al. 2010) . In their study, Chetelat et al (2010) demonstrated a strong relationship between measures of cortical and hippocampal atrophy and \u03b2-amyloid deposition very early in the disease process (i.e., even\namong those with subjective memory complaints). A strong relationship between impaired episodic memory performance and amyloid tracer retention has been reported recently in elderly normal subjects, using highly sensitive memory tests ( Loewenstein et al., 2016; Loewenstein et al., 2015) . Other AD biomarkers (such as regional brain atrophy and regional cerebral glucose metabolism) were also found to correlate with gradually increasing amyloid load in cognitively healthy elderly individuals, over a decade or more prior to reaching the threshold for amyloid positivity (Insel et al., 2016) . These findings suggest that any categorical cut point to discriminate between A+ and A-cases must be arbitrary, and dependent on the population being studied.\nWhile the calculation of the optimal threshold for amyloid positivity is independent from the amyloid load itself, the difference in thresholds reflects the fact that APOE4+ individuals are more likely to have greatly elevated levels. In fact, across all demographic groups and diagnoses (CN, MCI or dementia) the amyloid load, independent of the visual reading of amyloid positivity or negativity, was found to be greater among APOE4+ than E4-participants, as is evidenced by the mean SUVRs for APOE4+ and E4-participants (Table 3 ). Our findings demonstrate that the quantitative threshold (SUVR) level for amyloid positivity is influenced by APOE\uf0654 carrier status, which could provide evidence for using different thresholds based on an individual's APOE\uf0654 carrier status. This point is clearly illustrated in Figure 2 , which shows the distribution of cases which are E4 + and E4 according to whether they were found to be amyloid positive or negative by visual reads. The lack of overlap in the 95% confidence intervals between the calculated thresholds for E4+ and E4-cases is also clearly demonstrated in the figure. However,\ngiven that there is a continuous relationship, from a CN state to dementia, between SUVR, cognitive measures and, presumably, biomarkers of neurodegeneration, any calculated threshold for the whole group, or a subgroup, is likely to be artefactual. The results of studies by Chetelat (2010), Villeneuve (2015) and Insel et al (2017) strongly suggest the biological impact of amyloid load are present well before the quantitative threshold of amyloid positivity is reached.\nIn this study the optimal SUVR threshold for amyloid positivity for all 159 participants in this study (florbetaben SUVR = 1.42) expressed in centiloid units, is 30.25. The conversion for the optimal threshold for APOE4-participants (florbetaben SUVR = 1.31) is 18 centiloid units. As such, it would seem appropriate to use the lowest level of amyloid load that corresponds to a positive visual read, as the threshold for amyloid positivity, regardless of the E4 status. which"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "Group differences in demographic measures among the diagnostic categories were compared using both t-tests anda series of one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.\nStatistically significant results (p<.05) from the ANOVA analyses were followed by post-hoc analyses using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test. Measures of effect size were calculated for means (eta-square) and proportions (Cramer's V). Receiving Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC) analyses were performed to determine the optimal cut-offs for florbetaben SUVR positivity that best discriminated between A+ and A-groups identified via amyloid scan visual reads. Strength of discrimination was assessed via the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Youden's criterion (sensitivity + specificity -1) was used to identify the optimal threshold of amyloid positivity to best discriminate between groups (Youden, 1950 (Table 3) . Among Hispanics and non-Hispanics the mean SUVRs and percentage of A+ by visual reads were not significantly different, and optimal thresholds for amyloid positivity were similar between the groups. Among younger participants (<70 years) the mean SUVR was 1.36 \u00b1 0.28 and visual reads were A+ in 29%. Among older participants (\u226570 years), the mean SUVR was 1.42\u00b1 0.31 (t=1.35; p=0.18) and visual reads were A+ in 43% (\u03c7 2 =3.28; p=.07). The optimal thresholds for amyloid positivity among older (SUVR =1.42) and younger (SUVR=1.37) participants were not different using the 95% confidence interval of Youden's index. Similarly, among participants with MMSE scores \u226527, the optimal threshold for amyloid positivity was 1.34, which was not different from that for participants with MMSE scores < 27, who had an optimal threshold of 1.36. specificity of the three ROCs, although the CI for AUC in the MCI group was fairly wide and fell outside the limits of the other two groups. The mean, bootstrapped optimal thresholds and confidence intervals showed that: (1) mean thresholds for the CN and DEM groups did not differ;\n(2) mean thresholds for the CN group fell marginally below the confidence intervals for the MCI group;\n(3) the MCI mean threshold fell within the CN and DEM confidence intervals, suggesting that the three mean optimal thresholds were not reliably different. Table 4 . Visual reads were A+ in 62% of APOE \uf0654+ and 24% of APOE\uf0654-participants (\u03c7 2 =22.7; p<.0001); APOE\uf0654+ subjects also had a higher mean composite SUVR (1.56\u00b10.32 versus 1.30\u00b10.25; t=5.37, p<.0001).

In a review of several studies Pontecorvo and Mintun (2011) concluded that \"the threshold for detection of amyloid on the A\u00df-PET scan appears close to the levels of neuropathology typical for a diagnosis of AD\". In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) Study, amyloid positive individuals were twice as likely as amyloid negative individuals to have worsening on CDR scores over a 4-year period ( Donohue et al., 2017) . It is therefore important for clinical purposes, as well as to determine eligibility for clinical trials, to be able to identify an accurate and consistent threshold level of amyloid load in the brain which can distinguish individuals who are A+ from those who are A-.\nThe threshold for amyloid positivity has major diagnostic and prognostic implications and has been studied extensively in the last several years. Villeneuve et al. (2015) , described several different methods to obtain thresholds for amyloid positivity, each yielding different thresholds.\nMethodological as well as biological factors, may contribute to this variability in thresholds. As The gold standard which has been used to obtain FDA approval of amyloid PET ligands has been the visual read, referenced to pathological findings at autopsy. The study by Sabri et al (2015) demonstrated that in four brain regions (middle frontal gyrus, occipital cortex , anterior cingulate gyrus and posterior cingulate/precuneus regions), which are required for the histopathological diagnosis of AD using CERAD criteria, there was a high degree of"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M", "text": "A N U S C R I P T"}]
