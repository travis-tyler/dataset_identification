[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "News reports frequently discuss the shortage of elementary/secondary teachers in the United States. Increasing enrollments, particularly in the elementary grades; increasing rates of retirement among teachers; and the efforts of states and localities to reduce class size may well have contributed to many of these shortages (Johnson 2001). In recent years, enrollments in public and private elementary and secondary schools have grown considerably, and most expect that they will continue to climb through 2005, after which they are expected to drop slightly through 2010 (Gerald and Hussar 2000). Nevertheless, shortages may well continue since the proportion of teachers who retire each year is expected to rise (Goodnough 2000). As experienced baby-boomer teachers retire, they are likely to be replaced by young and inexperienced teachers, whose attrition rates are higher than those of mid-career teachers (Archer 1999;Grissmer and Kirby 1997).' Many researchers and policymakers attribute the higher attrition rate among new teachers to their working conditions (e.g., Baker and Smith 1997). Therefore, to encourage new teachers to remain in the profession, many states and localities have launched programs to support them (Archer 1999;Cooperman 2000). Policy analysts have also 'Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) data from  indicate that about 8 percent of teachers who had taught less than 4 years left the profession since the previous school year, and that about 7 percent of teachers with 4 to 9 years of experience did so (Whitener et al. 1997). In contrast, between 4 and 5 percent of teachers with 10 to 24 years of experience left between 1993-94 and 1994-95. Other SASS estimates indicate that approximately 30 percent of new teachers leave the profession within the first 5 years of entry (Ingersoll as cited in Archer 1999). recommended that schools and districts professionalize teaching to improve retention (Kanstoroom and Finn 1999;Holmes Group 1986; National Commission on Teaching and America's Future (NCTAF) 1996(NCTAF) , 1997. Such policy initiatives may help new teachers become better teachers more quickly and may increase occupation stability among all teachers; however, they do not address other possible reasons for attrition among new teachers. Although such attrition has received considerable research attention over the years (Darling-Hammond 1984;Murnane et al. 1991), whether new teachers are more likely than college graduates beginning careers in other professions to change occupations has not yet been addressed. High attrition from initial occupations may be endemic to new college graduates' entry into the labor market, regardless of occupation, as new graduates learn about the workplace and about their strengths and weaknesses as well as what they like and dislike about their jobs. In addition, interest or aptitude for a field in an academic setting may not always translate into satisfaction in a related occupation. Particularly among graduates who majored in academic, rather than applied, fields of study, information about the kinds of work available to them and their affinity for it may be limited. If new college graduates change occupations at similar rates regardless of their early occupations, reducing attrition among new teachers may be as much a matter of helping college students and new graduates choose, plan, and prepare for their careers as supporting new teachers and professionalizing teaching. iii 7 Executive Summary This research examines the occupation stability of bachelor's degree recipients during the first 4 years after receiving the bachelor's degree. The analyses address the following question: were graduates who were teaching in 1994 more or less likely than those in other occupations to leave the work force or work in a different occupation in 1997?"}, {"section_title": "Data and Methodology", "text": "The 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal 'Study (B&B:93) provided the data for these analyses. NCES first surveyed a nationally representative sample of about 11,200 students who received bachelor's degrees between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1993 in the spring of 1993, and then again in 1994 and 1997. These analyses are based on the 83 percent of the original sample, about 9,300 graduates, who participated in all three B&B survey administrations. The B&B data provide an important opportunity to compare the behavior of a significant proportion of new teachers to that of their nonteaching peers. However, results from these analyses cannot be generalized to all new teachers in 1994 or 1997 because many new teachers do not begin teaching immediately after completing a bachelor's degree. These analyses are based largely on composite variables developed from graduates' reports of what they were doing during both April 1994 and 1997.

NCES first surveyed a nationally representative sample of about 11,200 students who received bachelor's degrees between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1993 in spring 1993, and then again in 1994 and 1997. These analyses are based on about 9,300 graduates, or 83 percent of the original sample, who participated in all three B&B survey administrations. These data provide an important opportunity to compare the behavior of a significant proportion of new teachers to that of their nonteaching peers. Results from these analyses cannot be generalized to all new teachers in 1994 or 1997 because many new teachers do not begin teaching immediately after completing a bachelor's degree. In 1993-94, 29 percent of newly hired teachers in public schools and 21 percent in private schools were newly prepared teachers, i.e., first time teachers who were attending college or had completed their highest degree the previous year (Broughman and Rollefson 2000). These newly prepared teachers are analogous to B&B:93 sample members who taught for the first time in April 1994. In 1993-94 delayed entrantsi.e., individuals who engaged in other activities between completing their teacher training and teaching at the K-12 levelmade up 17 percent of newly hired teachers in public schools and 21 percent in private schools. These new teachers are not among those studied in this analysis of the B&B:93/97 data. Graduates were asked whether they were enrolled in school and whether they were employed during April of both 1994 and 1997. Although the B&B:93 surveys collected information on graduates' employment and enrollment status during each month following their graduation, the surveys collected more detailed informationincluding occupation, industry, employer, career potential, and whether a degree was required to obtain their jobon the jobs they held in April of both years. These analyses are based largely on composite variables developed from graduates' reports of what they were doing during both April 1994 and 1997. Composites were created to summarize graduates' major activities (e.g., working, studying, or both) in 1994 and 1997, whether their major activities differed between April 1994 and April 1997, and whether their occupations changed between the two years. For April 1994 and 1997, variables describing graduates' employment status (B2EM9404 and B2EM9704) were crossed with variables describing graduates' enrollment status (B2EN9404 and B2EN9704) to create variables describing graduates' main activities during April 1994 and1997 (ACT94 andACT97). Graduates who lacked data on either their employment or enrollment status were not assigned a valid value on these variables. ACT94 and ACT97 include the following categories of graduates: For the purposes of this report, the categories of these variables were combined into larger categories as follows: 1. Graduates who were employed more than they were enrolledcategories 1-3 above were classified as \"primarily working\"; 2. Graduates who were employed and enrolled equal amounts of timecategories 4-5 abovewere classified as \"working and studying equally\"; 3. Graduates who were employed less than they were enrolledcategories 6-10 above were classified as \"primarily studying\"; 4. Graduates who were unemployed and not enrolled were classified as \"unemployed\"; and 5. Graduates who were not in the labor force and not enrolled were classified as \"out of the labor force.\""}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Teaching and Teacher Attrition Among 1992-93 Bachelor's Degree Recipients In April 1994, 80 percent of 1992-93 graduates were primarily working,2 and another 3 percent combined study and work equally.

This category includes graduates who were working full time and either not enrolled or enrolled part time and graduates who were working part time and not en- in April 1997. Among those employed full time as K-12 teachers in April 1994, 88 percent were primarily working, 3 percent were working and studying equal amounts, and 3 percent were primarily studying in April 1997 (figure C). Among those employed part time as K-12 teachers in April 1994, 85 percent were primarily working, 5 percent were working and studying equal amounts, and 3 percent were primarily studying in April 1997. Among those who were employed as full-time K-12 teachers in April 1994 and who also worked in April 1997, 82 percent were still teaching in April 1997 (figure D). Furthermore, none of the other occupation categories proved more stable than teachers. In particular, K-12 teachers were as likely as those who worked in health occupations; engineers, scientists, and lab and research assistants; and several other white collar occupation categories to work in the same occupation category in both 1994 and 1997. Somewhat fewer of those who were working part time remained in teaching. Among April 1994 part-time K-12 teachers who worked in April 1997, 67 percent worked as K-12 teachers in April 1997. Nevertheless, among graduates who worked in April 1997, graduates who worked part time in April 1994 as K-12 teachers were more likely than those who worked part time as computer or technical workers, sales/service representatives, bluecollar workers, business owners or other managers, or clerical workers to work in the same occupation in April 1997. In other words, part-time K-12 teachers were as likely as graduates who worked part time in the remaining occupations to work in the same occupation in both time periods. In addition to perceptions that the overall new teacher attrition rate is high, policymakers and researchers fear that, among teachers, those who major in fields other than education, particularly mathematics and the natural sciences, are more likely than education majors to leave the profession. The B&B:93/97 data indicate that among those who were primarily working in April 1994, there were no differences between teachers with majors in education and those with majors in engineering, mathematics, or the natural sciences in the proportion who were primarily working in April 1997. However, among K-12 teachers in Executive Summary   Figure CPercentage distribution of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were employed as K-12 teachers in April  1994 according to main activity in April 1997, by April 1994 employment status   Full-time K-12  April 1994 who were working in April 1997, 70 percent of those who had majored in engineering, mathematics, or the natural sciences were teaching at the K-12 level in April 1997, compared with 86 percent of education majors. Thus, this analysis indicates that among 1992-93 college graduates who worked in April 1994, approximately a year after they had completed their bachelor's degrees, those who taught at the K-12 level were among the most stable of all employed graduates with respect to their occupations 3 years later. Relatively few teaching graduates had different main activities or different occupations in April 1997 than they did in April 1994. Graduates who worked in other occupations for which employees train as undergraduates (e.g., engineering and health occupations) also had relatively low rates of attrition. Moreover, these occupations also tended to have higher professional status than the occupations in which graduates were more likely to change occupations between 1994 and 1997. Therefore, this report also examines whether two additional variablesgraduates' perceptions of the relationship between their postsecondary fields of study and occupations and their views about the professional status of their occupationsvary with occupations and are associated with changing occupations between April 1994 and April 1997.\nIn April 1994, 80 percent of 1992-93 graduates were primarily working,3 and another 3 percent combined study and work equally. The remaining graduates were primarily studying (11 percent), were not enrolled and either unemployed (3 percent), or were out of the labor force (3 percent) (figure 1). Kindergarten through 12th-grade teachers made up 10 percent of graduates who were working full time in April 1994 (figure 2). In addition, approximately 16 percent of full-time employed graduates worked in sales or service positions, another 16 percent in business support or financial services positions, 11 percent as business owners and other managers, and 10 percent 3Graduates who were primarily working were working for pay full time or part time, but they were working more than they were studying. This category includes graduates who were working full time and either not enrolled or enrolled part time and graduates who were working part time and not enrolled. as other instructors or human services professionals, such as social workers and religious leaders. The remaining 37 percent of graduates who were employed full time worked as engineers, scientists, or lab/research assistants; in health occupations; as computer or technical workers; in clerical or blue-collar jobs; as editors, writers, or artists; in law enforcement or the military; or in a legal occupation. Four-fifths of graduates who worked as K-12 teachers in April 1994 worked full time. This proportion was lower than that among business support or financial services personnel; law enforcement or military personnel; business owners and other managers; and engineers, scientists, or lab/research assistants; however, it was comparable to that among employees in all other occupation categories (figure 3). Among graduates who worked part time, 14 percent worked as K-12 teachers (figure 4). Whether they .were employed full time or part time, most graduates who worked as K-12 teachers in April 1994 were also employed in April 1997. Among those employed full time as K-12 teachers in April 1994, 88 percent were primarily working, 3 percent were working and studying equal amounts, 3 percent were primarily studying, 1 percent were not enrolled and unemployed, and 4 percent were not enrolled and out of the labor force in April 1997 (figure 5). Among those employed part time as K-12 teachers in April 1994, 85 percent were primarily working, 5 percent were working and studying equal amounts, 3 percent were primarily studying, 3 percent were not enrolled and unemployed, and 5 percent were not enrolled and out of the labor force in April 1997. Furthermore, among graduates who were employed full time as teachers in April 1994 and who were also working in April 1997, relatively few changed occupations. Among those who were full-time K-12 teachers in April 1994 and who also worked in April 1997, 82 percent remained in this occupation in April 1997 (figure 6). Among graduates who were working in April 1997, those who worked full time as K-12 teachers in April 1994 were as likely as those who worked in a health occupation; in law enforcement or the military; as engineers, scientists, or lab/research assistants; or as legal support personnel or legal professionals to work in the same occupation in April 1997.4 4There were relatively few graduates working in a legal occupation in April 1994 (see figure 2). Therefore, the standard error for the estimate of the percentage of these graduates who worked in the same occupation category in April 1997 is relatively large. This large standard error may account for the fact that no significant difference was found between the proportions of full-time K-12 teachers and legal support or professional personnel who worked in the same occupation category at both points in time.  In contrast, graduates who worked full time in April 1994 in any other occupation category were less likely than full-time K-12 teachers to still be in this occupation category in April 1997. Although one might expect such differences between K-12 teachers and clerical or blue-collar workers, K-12 teachers were also more likely than business support/financial services personnel; editors, writers, and artists; computer and technical workers; other instructors and human services personnel to work in the same occupation category in both 1994 and 1997. Somewhat fewer of those who were working part time remained in teaching. Among April 1994 part-time K-12 teachers who worked in April 1997, 67 percent worked as K-12 teachers in April 1997 (figure 7). Among graduates who worked in April 1997, graduates who worked part time in April 1994 as K-12 teachers were more likely than those who worked part time as computer or technical workers, sales/service representatives, blue-collar workers, business owners and other managers, or clerical workers to work in the same occupation in April 1997. In other words, part-time K-12 teachers were as likely as graduates who worked part time in the remaining occupations to work in the same. occupation in both time periods. Thus, 1992-93 college graduates who worked as K-12 teachers in April 1994 were less likely than graduates in many other occupation categories to be working in another occupation, studying primarily, not enrolled and unemployed, or not enrolled and out of the labor force in April 1997. However, this analysis examines graduates' activities and occupations at only two points in time: April 1994 and April 1997. Graduates who had taught in April 1994 may have been more likely than graduates in other occupations to leave teaching after April 1994in order to work toward a teaching certificate or master's degree, for exampleand return by April 1997. The data illustrate this point to some degree. Among graduates who were primarily working and employed full time in April 1994, those who worked as K-12 teachers were more likely than most others to have enrolled at any postsecondary or graduate level between completing the 1992-93 bachelor's degree and April 1997 (figure 8).5 Such higher rates of postsecondary enrollment among teachers may reflect school district salary schedules, which commonly reward teachers for earning postsecondary education units.6 Finally, in addition to perceptions that the overall new teacher attrition rate is high, policymakers and researchers fear that, among teachers, those who major in fields other than education, particularly mathematics and the natural sciences, are more likely than education majors to leave 5Elementary/secondary teaching graduates were no more likely than graduates who worked full time in April 1994 as other instructors or human services personnel or those in legal occupations to enroll at either level after completing the bachelor's degree. 6These data do not completely address the question of whether new teachers were more likely than those in other occupations to leave and return within the three year period between April 1994 and April 1997. Those who did enroll at a postsecondary institution, as well as those who did not, may have continued working in their April 1994 occupation, changed occupations, or stopped working completely for any or all of the period between April 1994 and April 1997.\n\nTo assess whether graduates who perceived their 1994 occupations to be related to their undergraduate fields of study were more likely to work in a different occupation in April 1997, a new variable was created to measure occupation change. This variable compared the April 1994 occupation category with that in April 1997: if the two were identical, the graduate was defined as \"not having changed occupations.\" The variable also took into consideration that in many occupational areas, employees may change occupations but remain in a career path within a field. For example, if in April 1994 a graduate worked as a research assistant, and in April 1997 as a scientist or researcher, that graduate was defined as \"not having changed occupation.\" Similarly, graduates whose April 1994 occupation was classified as business support or financial services and whose April 1997 occupation was classified as financial services professional were defined as \"not having changed occupation.\" However, K-12 teachers were required to fall in the same occupation category at both points in time to be defined as \"not having changed occupation.\" Appendix A provides more detail about which combinations of occupation categories were defined as \"changes.\" Compared with those who reported that their April 1994 occupations were not at all related to their undergraduate fields of study, graduates who reported that their 1994 occupations were somewhat or closely related were considerably less likely to work in a different occupation in April 1997. Whereas 37 percent of graduates with jobs related to their field of study worked in a different occupation 3 years later, 67 percent of those with unrelated jobs did so (figure 13).\n"}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between April Occupations and Postsecondary Fields of Study", "text": "Among those working as K-12 teachers in April 1994, nearly all reported that their jobs were related to the field they studied as undergraduates (97 percent among full-time teachers and 96 percent among part-time teachers).

Therefore, although education researchers have developed a considerable body of research on teachers' careers, it has not been clear whether or how teachers' careers differ from the career paths of other college graduates. The 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93) provides a unique opportunity to study such questions. B&B:93 has surveyed a sample of 1992-93 college graduates three times: in 1993, 1994, and 1997.

For example, consumer sciences teachers in particular (Zehr 1998b) and vocational education teachers in general (Zehr 1998a) have been in short supply in many districts, and special education teachers are chronically difficult to hire (Sack 1999). In addition, particular states and localities are finding it harder than others to staff elementary/secondary classrooms (Archibold 1999;Steinberg 1999;Wilgoren 1999), and often these shortages occur in selected fields rather than across fields (Bradley 1999). Increasing enrollments, particularly in the elementary grades; increasing rates of retirement among teachers; and the efforts of states and localities to reduce class size may well have contributed to many of these shortages (Johnson 2001). In recent years, enrollments in public and private elementary and secondary schools have grown considerably, and most expect that they will continue to climb through 2005, after which they are expected to drop slightly through 2010 (Gerald and Hussar 2000). Nevertheless, shortages may well continue since the proportion of teachers who retire each year is expected to rise (Goodnough 2000). As experienced babyboomer teachers retire, they are likely to be replaced by young and inexperienced teachers, whose attrition rates are higher than those of mid-career teachers (Archer 1999;Grissmer and Kirby 1997).2 Many researchers and policymakers attribute the higher attrition rate among new teachers to their working conditions (e.g., Baker and Smith 1997). New teachers generally assume the same responsibilities that experienced teachers have and, unlike many other professions where new professionals are supervised by a more experienced colleague, often do so without the support of a mentor or supervisor. In addition, conventional wisdom maintains that new teachers receive the most difficult assignments (Archer 1999), which is consistent with data indicating that Introduction teachers in schools serving large proportions of poor children have less experience than teachers serving more affluent children (Henke, Choy, Chen, Geis, and Alt 1997). To encourage new teachers to remain in the profession, many states and localities have launched programs to support them. New Jersey, for example, created an alternative teacher preparation track, which provided new teachers with support from principals and experienced teachers (Cooperman 2000). Teachers who participated in this program left teaching at a rate of about 4 percent annually between 1984 and 1990, whereas teachers in the traditional teacher preparation track, which did not provide such support, left at a rate of 16 percent. In California, the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) Program has grown dramatically in recent years as the state attempts to improve its rate of retaining new teachers. BTSA provides new teachers with mentorsexperienced teachers who help new teachers solve problems, self-assess their weaknesses, and improve their teaching skills in the first 2 years of teaching. Some local BTSA programs are reporting retention rates of 85 to 90 percent (Archer 1999). Policy analysts have also recommended that schools and districts professionalize teaching to improve retention (Kanstoroom and Finn 1999;Holmes Group 1986; National Commission on Teaching and America's Future (NCTAF) 1996(NCTAF) , 1997. Specific measures to professionalize teaching include giving teachers more responsibility for school governance, creating career ladders for teachers, and increasing teacher salariesparticularly among experienced teacherseither across the board or according to merit. Since educators and analysts have noted that teachers with better preservice preparation are more likely than others to remain in the profession, many have proposed improving teacher preparation as a way to reduce teacher attrition and improve the quality of instruction. Such policy initiatives may help new teachers become better teachers more quickly and may increase occupation stability among all teachers; however, they do not address other possible reasons for attrition among new teachers. Although such attrition has received considerable research attention over the years (Darling-Hammond 1984;Murnane et al. 1991), whether new teachers are more likely than college graduates beginning careers in other professions to change occupations has not yet been addressed. High attrition from initial occupations may be endemic to new college graduates' entry into the labor market, regardless of occupation, as new graduates learn about the workplace and about their strengths and weaknesses as well as what they like and dislike about their jobs. In addition, interest or aptitude for a field in an academic setting may not always translate into satisfaction in a related occupation. Particularly among graduates who majored in academic, rather than applied, fields of study, information about the kinds of work available to them and their affinity for it may be limited. Introduction Furthermore, occupation attrition among new college graduates may be a function of graduates' perceptions of their early jobs in relation to their anticipated career paths, and certain occupations may serve as way stations for uncertain college graduates. For example, graduates who begin their work lives as teachers may be more or less likely than those in other occupations to perceive their job as a temporary one on the path to graduate school and a long-term career in another occupation. Examining the attrition rates of new college graduates who simultaneously begin their careers in various occupations will provide contextual information that may help policymakers reduce attrition among new college graduates who become teachers. If new college graduates change occupations at similar rates regardless of their early occupations, reducing attrition among new teachers may be as much a matter of helping college students and new graduates choose, plan, and prepare for their careers as supporting new teachers and professionalizing teaching. This research examines the occupation stability of bachelor's degree recipients during the first 4 years after receiving the bachelor's degree. The analyses address the following question: were graduates who were teaching in 1994 more or less likely than those in other occupations to leave the work force or work in a different occupation in 1997?"}, {"section_title": "25", "text": "In addition, because the 1994 occupation coding scheme differed substantially from that used in 1997 and because discrepancies in coding were identified in the 1997 occupation code variable, both the occupation variables were recoded.

The B&B:93/97 data indicate there was no difference between teachers who majored in education and those who majored in engineering, mathematics or the natural sciences in the proportion who were primarily working in April 1997 (figure 9). However, among graduates who worked as K-12 teachers in April 1994 and who were working in April 1997, 70 percent of those who had majored in engineering, mathematics, or the natural sciences were teaching at the K-12 level in April 1997, compared with 86 percent of education majors (figure 10). Thus, this analysis indicates that among 1992-93 college graduates who worked in April 1994, approximately a year after they had completed their bachelor's degrees, those who taught at the K-12 level were among the least likely of all employed graduates to work in a different profession 3 years later. Relatively few K-12 teaching graduates had different main activities or different occupations in April 1997 than they did in April 1994. Attrition rates among teachers varied with major, however: April 1994 K-12 teaching graduates who had majored in engineering, mathematics, or the natural sciences were less likely than those who had majored in education to be teaching in April 1997.

Graduates' perceptions also were related to their occupations. Multivariate techniques allow researchers to disentangle some of this covariation.

In fact, no occupation category was more stable than teachers. Graduates' perceptions of their April 1994 job's professional status and of the relationship between their undergraduate field of study and their April 1994 job were, independently, related to whether they worked in the same occupation category at both points in time. Graduates who perceived their April 1994 job as unrelated or somewhat related to their undergraduate major field of study were less likely than those who perceived a close relationship to work in the same occupation in 1997 as in 1994. Compared with graduates who reported that a degree was not required to obtain their April 1994 job, graduates who reported that a degree was required were more likely to work in the same occupation category at both points in time.

In addition to these variables related to the type of job graduates were doing, their employment status was associated with the likelihood that they changed occupations, after adjusting for covariation of employment status with the remaining variables in the model.

This analysis examined whether 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who taught at the elementary/secondary level in 1994 were less likely to work in the same occupation in 1997, compared with their peers in other occupations. The data indicate that K-12 teachers among 1992-93 college graduates were among the least likely to work in different occupations in 1997 compared with 1994. Among graduates who were employed in April 1994 and April 1997, K-12 teachers (i.e., graduates who taught in 1994).were as likely as graduates who worked in other white collar, professional occupations to work in the same occupation category in April 1997. Specifically, approximately four-fifths of graduates who taught in April 1994 were also teaching in April 1997, and similar proportions of graduates who worked as health occupations professionals; engineers, scientists, lab/research assistants; in legal occupations; in law enforcement or the military; or as business support/financial services workers worked in their respective occupation categories in both April 1994 and April 1997. Graduates who worked in other occupation categories in April 1994 were less likely than K-12 teachers to work in the same occupation category at both points in time. Moreover, this result occurred in spite of the fact that teachers were held to a higher standard. Teachers were defined as not changing occupations if they worked as K-12 teachers at both points in time, whereas graduates who worked in other occupations were defined as not changing occupations if they worked in the same occupation categories or, in some cases, related occupation categories. Those who taught at the K-12 level part time in April 1994 were less likely than their fulltime counterparts also to work as K-12 teachers in April 1997. Nevertheless, among part-time workers in April 1994, K-12 teachers were among the most likely of all occupation categories to work in the same occupation category in April 1997 as in April 1994. Graduates' perceptions of whether their April 1994 occupations were closely related to their undergraduate field of study and of the professional status of the April 1994 occupation were related to whether they worked in the same occupation category in both April 1994 and April 1997. Graduates who reported that their April 1994 occupations were somewhat or closely Conclusion related to their undergraduate fields of study were considerably less likely than those who reported that their 1994 occupations were not at all related to work in a different occupation category in April 1997. As one might expect, graduates who perceived their April 1994 occupations as having professional status, defined as requiring a degree and having career potential, were less likely than those who perceived otherwise to be working in a different occupation in April 1997. Consistent with these findings, in both 1994 and 1997, 1992-93 college graduates who worked as K-12 teachers were highly likely to report that their jobs were related to their postsecondary fields of study and had professional status. There are several points to keep in mind regarding the major finding of this report: K-12 teachers were among the least likely of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients to change occupations between April 1994 and April 1997. First, the estimates regarding occupation attrition that are presented in this report include only those graduates who worked in April 1994 and April 1997. Therefore, they do not take into account attrition from particular occupations in April 1994 to nonwork (e.g., studying or child rearing) in April 1997. However, as the analysis of main activity changes between 1994 and 1997 demonstrates, most graduates, including those who worked as K-12 teachers, did work in both April 1994 and 1997. Consequently, these estimates are not likely to vary much from estimates that do take into account departures from the work force as well as changes in occupation. Second, although the estimates of attrition among new teachers reported here appear to be lower than many discussed among policymakers and in news reports, there are many potential reasons for such differences. These data do not represent all new teachers in April 1994, but only new teachers among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients. Given independent estimates of the proportion of teachers who are new college graduates, this group is likely to represent between one-half and two-thirds of all first-time teachers in April 1994. Therefore, many new teachers in April 1994 (i.e., those who received their bachelor's degrees before July 1992) are omitted from the analysis. Third, these results must also be interpreted in the context of labor market conditions of the mid 1990s and other influences associated with this point in time. For example, data from 1999-2000 graduates might support quite different findings, given the booming economy and the potential for new college graduates to earn relatively large salaries in technology related occupations. Fourth, this analysis is limited to two points in time, and does not take into account stopping out behavior between April 1994 and April 1997. Such behavior may vary among graduates 30 47 Conclusion in different occupations, and also may account for differences between these attrition rates and others calculated over different periods of time in a graduate's career. Finally, this report discusses attrition from graduates' April 1994 occupations, and not turnover within those occupations. Turnover among jobs within occupations may vary among occupations in different ways than attrition does. For example, although K-12 teachers among recent college graduates have relatively low attrition rates, they may have relatively high turnover rates compared with their classmates in other occupations. High turnover rates would also have policy implications for schools and districts, particularly if some schools were more likely than others to have high turnover rates among new teachers. In sum, the point of the analysis is not to estimate the proportion of new teachers who changed occupations but to examine their attrition rates relative to that of other college graduates who are at similar points in their careers but in different occupations. In that regard, the analysis indicates that college graduates who teach soon after completing their degrees are among the most stable in terms of occupational choice. Many new graduates did work in different occupations 4 years after completing their degrees compared with their occupation 1 year after completion. However, those who were teaching at the 1-year point were less likely, as were others in occupations that required bachelor's degrees, had career potential, and were related to graduates' fields of study, to change their professions than were those in other occupations."}, {"section_title": "q8", "text": "for estimates provided in this report can be obtained from the B&B:93/97 Data Analysis System (DAS).  Nonsampling errors occur not only in sample surveys but also in complete censuses of entire populations.

This can be misleading since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic.
