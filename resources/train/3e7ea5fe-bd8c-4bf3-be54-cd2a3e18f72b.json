We undertook a combined analysis of four genomewide association datasets (stage 1) and identified ten newly associated variants with P \u2264 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 . We tested these variants for association in an independent sample (stage 2). Three SNPs at two loci replicated and showed evidence for association in a further sample (stage 3). Meta-analyses of all data provided compelling evidence that ABCA7 (rs3764650, meta P = 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u221217 ; including ADGC data, meta P = 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u221221 ) and the MS4A gene cluster (rs610932, meta P = 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u221214 ; including ADGC data, meta P = 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ) are new Alzheimer's disease susceptibility loci. We also found independent evidence for association for three loci reported by the ADGC, which, when combined, showed genome-wide significance: CD2AP (GERAD+, P = 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ; including ADGC data, meta P = 8.6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ), CD33 (GERAD+, P = 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ; including ADGC data, meta P = 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ) and EPHA1 (GERAD+, P = 3.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ; including ADGC data, meta P = 6.0 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ).\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, with both environmental and genetic factors contributing to risk. Alzheimer's disease is genetically complex and shows heritability of up to 79% (ref. 1). Rare variants in three genes (APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2) 1 cause disease in a minority of cases, but until recently, APOE (encoding apolipoprotein E) was the only gene known to increase disease risk for the common form of Alzheimer's disease with late onset 2 . In 2009, we published a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease in a sample designated GERAD1 (Genetic and Environmental Risk in Alzheimer's Disease Consortium 1), in which we identified two new genome-wide significant susceptibility loci: clusterin (CLU: P = 8.5 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ) and the phosphatidylinositolbinding clathrin assembly protein gene (PICALM: P = 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ). We also observed more variants with P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 than were expected by chance (P = 7.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) 3 . These included variants in CR1 (the complement receptor 1 gene), BIN1 (the bridging integrator 1 gene) and the MS4A (membrane-spanning 4A gene) cluster. A second independent Alzheimer's disease GWAS 4 using the EADI1 (European Alzheimer's Disease Initiative 1) sample showed genome-wide significant evidence for association with CLU (P = 7.5 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ) and CR1 (P = 3.7 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ) and support for association with PICALM (P = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ). A combined analysis of the GERAD1 and EADI1 data yielded highly significant support for all three loci (CLU meta P = 6.7 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ; PICALM meta P = 6.3 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ; and CR1 meta P = 3.2 \u00d7 10 \u221212 ). The associations in CLU, PICALM and CRI have since been replicated in several independent datasets [5] [6] [7] [8] , have shown trends in another dataset 9 and have shown relationships with the neurodegenerative processes underlying disease 10 . In addition, members of this consortium have since reported genome-wide significant association for BIN1 (P = 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u221211 ) and support for EPHA1 (encoding ephrin receptor A1) (P = 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) 11 .\nThis study sought to identify new common susceptibility variants for Alzheimer's disease by first undertaking a three-stage association study based upon predominantly European samples (GERAD+; Fig. 1 ) and then by testing these samples for loci showing suggestive evidence for association in the ADGC GWAS 12 .\nThe first stage of this study comprised a meta-analysis of four Alzheimer's disease GWAS datasets (6, 13 and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 14 datasets. SNPs which remained significant at P \u2264 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 were then tested for replication in the second stage of this study, comprising 4,896 cases and 4,903 controls, including genotyping of the GERAD2 sample and in silico replication in the deCODE and German Alzheimer's Disease Integrated Genome Research Network (AD-IG) GWAS datasets. In stage 3, previously unidentified SNPs showing significant evidence of replication in stage 2 were then tested for association in a sample comprising 8,286 cases and 21,258 controls, which included new genotyping in the EADI2 (ref. 4) and Mayo2 samples and in silico replication in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) sample 11 . Sample descriptions and characteristics can be found in the Supplementary Note and Supplementary Table 1 .\nIn stage 1, we identified 61 SNPs associated with Alzheimer's disease at P \u2264 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 following meta-analysis of 496,763 SNPs in the GERAD1, TGEN1, ADNI and EADI1 samples (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note). Ten SNPs at newly associated loci and two SNPs at previously identified susceptibility loci that surpassed the P \u2264 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 threshold were selected for further analysis (see below). One SNP, rs610932 (stage 1 P = 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) at the MS4A (encoding membrane spanning 4A) gene cluster, surpassed the threshold for genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) 15 . We also observed strong evidence for association at ABCA7 (encoding ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 7; rs3764650; stage 1 P = 2.6 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ).\nWhen selecting SNPs for testing in stage 2, we excluded known susceptibility loci that had previously been tested in GERAD2, and we limited our analysis of BIN1 and CR1, which had not been tested in GERAD2, to the most significant SNPs at each locus (Supplementary Table 2 ). Following pruning for linkage disequilibrium (LD), 12 SNPs were taken forward for replication in stage 2 (10 SNPs, excluding BIN1 and CR1).\nFive of the 12 SNPs tested in stage 2 showed significant evidence for replication using a Bonferroni-adjusted threshold for significance of P = 4.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3 ). In addition to SNPs at BIN1 and CR1, one SNP within ABCA7 (rs3764650, stage 2 P = 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) and two SNPS at the MS4A gene cluster (rs610932, stage 2 P = 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ; and rs670139, stage 2 P = 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) showed evidence of replication in stage 2. We tested the three SNPs implicating new risk loci for association in the stage 3 sample and showed further evidence of replication (rs3764650, stage 3 P = 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ; rs610932, stage 3 P = 2.1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ; and rs670139, stage 3 P = 3.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ; Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3) .\nWe conducted an inverse variance weighted meta-analysis of data from stages 1, 2 and 3 ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3 ). This provided strong evidence for association with rs3764650 at ABCA7 (meta P = 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u221217 ) and two SNPs at the MS4A gene cluster: rs610932 (meta P = 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u221214 ) and rs670139 (meta P = 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ). When combining GERAD+ and ADGC results (after removing overlapping samples), ABCA7 had P = 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u221221 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.22). The two SNPs at the MS4A gene cluster, rs610932 and rs670139, showed P = 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u221216 (OR = 0.91) and P = 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 (OR = 1.08), respectively, in the combined analysis of the GERAD+ and ADGC results. It is noteworthy that the most significant ADGC SNP at the MS4A locus is in LD with our top SNP (rs4938933 with rs610932, r 2 = 0.62, D\u2032 = 0.86), and thus both datasets may be detecting the same underlying signal.\nThis study also provides additional independent support for association with CR1 (stage 2 P = 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) and BIN1 (stage 2 P = 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ; see Table 1 for meta-analysis.) We did not observe interaction between APOE and the new variants identified in this study, and indeed, we did not find evidence of epistasis between any of the genome-wide significant variants identified to date (ABCA7, MS4A, BIN1, CR1, PICALM, CLU or APOE) ( Supplementary Table 4a ). Likewise, adjusting for the presence of at least one APOE \u03b54 allele had little effect on the results of the analysis of the three newly associated variants (Supplementary Table 4b ). We also found no evidence for association between these loci and age at onset of Alzheimer's disease (rs3764650, P = 0.17; rs670139, P = 0.38; rs610932, P = 0.95; rs744373, P = 0.87; and rs3818361, P = 0.58).\nThis study therefore identifies two new Alzheimer's disease susceptibility loci, which replicate over a number of independent case-control samples. The first of these is the ABCA7 (encoding ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 7) locus (Fig. 2a) . The associated marker is rs3764650, which is located in intron 13. This SNP was the only variant in the gene that passed our stage 1 criterion, which is not unexpected given the low levels of LD between this SNP and others included in the GWAS. However, in a preliminary attempt to identify an associated functional variant at the ABCA7 locus, we genotyped the GERAD2 sample for rs3752246, a non-synonymous SNP in exon 32 of the gene, which showed the highest LD with rs3764650 out of all HapMap ABCA7-coding variants based on r 2 values (r 2 = 0.36, D\u2032 = 0.89). This variant (which was not genotyped in stage 1) was also associated with Alzheimer's disease (GERAD2 P = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , OR = 1.17). rs3752246 encodes a glycine to alanine substitution at position 1527 of the protein, which is predicted to be a benign change 16 and is unlikely to be the relevant functional variant. We used data from two published expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets (derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines 17 and brain 18 ) to determine if rs3764650 is associated with the expression of ABCA7. However, Figure 1 GERAD+ study design. *Data for rs744373 and rs3818361 in the CHARGE consortium have been presented elsewhere 15 , as has data for rs381861 in the EADI2 samples 4 ; as such these SNPs were not included in stage 3. l e t t e r s we observed no association (Supplementary Table 5 ). Further work will be required to identify the causal variant(s) at this locus. Second, we implicate the MS4A (encoding membrane-spanning 4A) gene cluster (Fig. 2b) . The association spans an LD block of 293 kb (chr11: 59,814,287-60,107,105) and includes 6 of 16 known genes comprising the membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A (encoded by MS4A). These are MS4A2, MS4A3, MS4A4A, MS4A4E, MS4A6A and MS4A6E. The associated SNPs are found in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of MS4A6A (rs610932) and the intergenic region between MS4A4E and MS4A6A (rs670139). rs610932 showed nominally significant association with expression levels of MS4A6A in cerebellum and temporal cortex (0.01 < P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 5) but not in the frontal cortex, pons or lymphoblastoid cell lines. The non-synonymous SNP that was most strongly associated with the genome-wide significant variants was rs2304933. This SNP was analyzed in stage 1 but showed weaker evidence for association (P = 0.006) than the genome-wide significant variant at this locus in the same sample. Figure 3 shows forest plots depicting association in the different datasets for SNPs at the ABCA7 (rs3764650) and MS4A (rs610932 and rs670139) loci.\nWe also sought to follow up four additional loci showing suggestive evidence for association with Alzheimer's disease (1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 \u2265 P > 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) from the ADGC GWAS 12 . These loci included those in CD33, EPHA1, CD2AP and ARID5B. It should be noted that evidence for suggestive association with EPHA1 and CD33 has been reported previously. Members of this collaboration were the first to report EPHA1 as showing suggestive evidence of association with Alzheimer's disease (rs11771145, P = 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ; LD with ADGC rs11767557, r 2 = 0.28, D\u2032 = 0.75) 11 , which included the GERAD1 and EADI1 samples reported on here. Similarly, researchers from another study were the first to show suggestive evidence for CD33 (rs3826656, P = 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ; LD with ADGC rs3865444, r 2 = 0.13, D\u2032 = 1.0) 19 .\nWe combined data from the GERAD+ dataset, comprising the GERAD1, EADI1, deCODE and AD-IG GWAS datasets (up to 6,992 cases and 13,472 controls), using inverse variance meta-analysis.\nWe included the TGEN1, ADNI and Mayo1 datasets in the ADGC discovery set and were thus excluded from these particular analyses. We observed support for association with CD2AP (rs9349407, P = 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , OR = 1.11), CD33 (rs3865444, P = 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , OR = 0.89) and EPHA1 (rs11767557, P = 3.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , OR = 0.90).\nWhen these data were combined with the ADGC data, we observed genome-wide evidence for association with Alzheimer's disease (rs9349407, GERAD+ and ADGC meta P = 8.6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 , OR = 1.11; rs3865444, GERAD+ and ADGC meta P = 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 , OR = 0.91; rs11767557, GERAD+ and ADGC meta P = 6.0 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , OR = 0.90). We observed nominally significant evidence of association with ARID5B (rs2588969, P = 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , OR = 1.06); however, the direction of effect was opposite to that reported by ADGC 12 and was not significant overall (GERAD+ and ADGC meta P = 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22121 , OR = 0.99). See Table 2 for results of the GERAD+ and ADGC combined analyses and Supplementary Table 6 for results of additional SNPs at these loci.\nTaken together, these results show compelling evidence for an additional five Alzheimer's disease susceptibility loci. ABCA7 encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The ABC transporter superfamily has roles in transporting a wide range of substrates across cell membranes 20 . ABCA7 is highly expressed in brain, particularly in the hippocampal CA1 neurons 21 and microglia 22 . ABCA7 is involved in the efflux of lipids from cells to lipoprotein particles. Notably, the main lipoproteins in brain are APOE followed by CLU. We observed no evidence for epistatic interactions between the three genetic loci (Supplementary Table 4a) , however, this is not a prerequisite for biological interaction between these molecules. In addition, ABCA7 has been shown to regulate APP processing and inhibit \u03b2-amyloid secretion in cultured cells overexpressing APP (ref. 23) . ABCA7 also modulates phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages mediated through the C1q complement receptor protein on the apoptotic cell surface 23 . ABCA7 is an ortholog of Caenorhabditis elegans ced-7, the product of which is known to clear apoptotic cells, and the high levels of expression of ABCA7 in microglia are consistent with such a role. \nThe genes in the MS4A cluster on chromosome 11 have a common genomic structure with all other members of the family, including transmembrane domains, indicating that they are likely to be part of a family of cell-surface proteins 24 . MS4A2 encodes the \u03b2 subunit of high affinity IgE receptors 25 . The remaining genes in the LD block have no known specific functions.\nCD33 is a member of the sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglec) family, which is thought to promote cell-cell interactions and regulate functions of cells in the innate and adaptive immune systems 26 . Most members of the Siglec family, including CD33, act as endocytic receptors, mediating endocytosis through a mechanism independent of clathrin 27 . CD2AP (CD2-associated protein) is a scaffold adaptor protein 28 that associates with cortactin, a protein also involved in the regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis 29 . It is striking that these two new susceptibility genes for Alzheimer's disease, and the recently established susceptibility genes PICALM and BIN1, are all implicated in cell-cell communication and transduction of molecules across the membrane. EPHA1 is a member of the ephrin receptor subfamily. Ephrins and Eph receptors are membrane-bound proteins which play roles in cell and axon guidance 30 and in synaptic development and plasticity 31 . However, EPHA1 is expressed mainly in epithelial tissues 32 where it regulates cell morphology and motility 33 . Additional roles in apoptosis 34 and inflammation 35 have also been proposed.\nOur study has identified variants at ABCA7 and the MS4A gene cluster associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease with replication over a number of independent case-control samples. We also provide independent support for three loci showing suggestive evidence in a companion paper 12 : loci in CD33, CD2AP and EPHA1, which, when the data were combined, showed genome-wide levels of significance. Finally, we provide further replication evidence for BIN1 and CR1 loci as Alzheimer's disease susceptibility loci. What is striking about our findings is the emerging consistency in putative function of the genes identified. Five of the recently identified Alzheimer's disease susceptibility loci in CLU, CR1, ABCA7, CD33 and EPHA1 have putative functions in the immune system; PICALM, BIN1, CD33 and CD2AP are involved in processes at the cell membrane, including endocytosis, and APOE, CLU and ABCA7 are involved in lipid processing. It is conceivable that these processes would play strong roles in neurodegeneration and A\u03b2 clearance from the brain. These findings therefore provide new impetus for focused studies aimed at understanding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Stage 1: combined analysis of four Alzheimer's disease GWAS. An inverse variance-weighted fixed effects meta-analysis was used to test for association with Alzheimer's disease in the GERAD1, ADNI and TGEN datasets. The P values from this meta-analysis were then combined with the publicly available P values from the EADI1 study using Fisher's combined probability test. The combined analysis tested 496,795 autosomal SNPs. These SNPs passed quality control in each of the GERAD1, ADNI and EADI1 GWAS. We successfully imputed 457,509 of these SNPs in the TGEN sample (which, unlike the other studies, employed the Affymetrix 500K array). In the combined analysis, 67 SNPs were associated with Alzheimer's disease at P \u2264 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (Supplementary Table 2 ). Full summary statistics were obtained from the EADI consortium for these 67 SNPs, and the analysis was repeated using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. Sixty-one SNPs remained significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease at P \u2264 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 . In selecting SNPs for replication in stage 2, we chose to exclude variants at the APOE locus (26 SNPs), as this is a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease, and also variants at the CLU and PICALM loci (1 SNP and 8 SNPs, respectively), as these data were already reported in the GERAD2 sample 3 . We restricted genotyping of CRI and BIN1 SNPs to the most significant markers at each locus, as they had not previously been tested in the stage 2 sample (6 SNPs excluded). We excluded 8 SNPs that were in high LD with the other SNPs selected for genotyping (Supplementary Table 2 ).\nStage 2, 3 and final meta-analyses. Both new genotyping data (GERAD2) and in silico replication (deCODE and Reimenschneider GWAS datasets) were included in stage 2. Data from these three samples were combined using an inverse-variance-weighted fixed effects meta-analysis (total sample of up to 4,896 cases and 4,903 controls). We employed a Bonferroni-adjusted threshold for significance, accounting for 12 tests, of P = 4.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . For the three new SNPs that showed evidence for association in stage 2 (P < 4.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ), summary data (including ORs and variances) from the EADI2, Mayo2 and CHARGE and EADI2 studies were combined in an inverse-variance-weighted fixed effects meta-analysis (total sample of up to 8,286 cases and 21,258 controls), employing a Bonferroni adjusted threshold for significance, accounting for three tests, of P = 0.0167.\nFinally, we combined full summary data (including ORs and variances) from all datasets (GERAD1 and GERAD2, EAD1 and EAD2, ADNI, TGEN, deCODE, AD-IG, Mayo2 and CHARGE) using an inverse-variance-weighted fixed effects meta-analysis (total sample of up to 19,870 cases and 39,846 controls). For meta-analyses at all stages, a Cochran's Q test was performed and I 2 was calculated to assess heterogeneity. The total sample size tested for each SNP is shown in Supplementary Table 7 . Summary statistics for all datasets are shown in Supplementary Table 8 .\nSecondary analyses. We tested the genome-wide significant SNPs for relationships with age at onset. To this end, age at onset (in years) was used as the dependent variable in a linear regression analysis, and an additive model was assumed. Covariates were included in the logistic regression analysis to allow for country of origin. We found no evidence for association between these loci and age at onset of Alzheimer's diesase (rs3764650, P = 0.17; rs670139, P = 0.38; and rs610932, P = 0.95). We also tested the SNPs for association with Alzheimer's disease while adjusting for the presence of at least one APOE \u03b54 allele within a logistic regression framework. Inclusion of presence or absence of APOE \u03b54 as a covariate had little effect on the results (Supplementary  Table 5b ). Finally, we tested for genetic interactions between all pairwise combinations of genome-wide significant SNPs in APOE, CLU, PICALM, BIN1, CR1, ABCA7 and MS4A. Logistic regression analyses were performed including terms for covariates, main effects of each SNP, and a SNP \u00d7 SNP interaction term ln(P/(1 \u2212 P)) = \u03b1 + \u03b2X A + \u03b3X B + \u03b4Y 1 + \u03b5Y 2 + \u03b6Y 3 + \u03b7Y 4 + \u03b8Y 5 + \u03b9Y 6 + \u03baX A X B where P is the probability of having the disease; X A and X B correspond to variables representing the number of minor alleles at SNPs A and B respectively; Y 1 to Y 6 correspond to the covariates included in the main analysis (country of origin and principal components); \u03b1 is a constant; and \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, \u03b7, \u03b8, \u03b9 and \u03ba are regression coefficients. We tested whether the regression coefficient that represents the interaction term, \u03ba, equals zero or not. P values for this 1-degree-of-freedom test are presented in Supplementary Table 5a. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. Expression profiles were analyzed within two eQTL datasets. The first, published by Stranger and colleagues 17 , consists of gene expression profiles generated using RNA extracted from lymphoblastoid cell lines generated from 60 unrelated European CEU HapMap individuals. Expression analysis was performed using Illumina's commercial whole genome expression array, the Sentrix Human-6 Expression BeadChip. The second eQTL dataset 18 analyzed 143 neurologically normal subjects of European ancestry. Frozen tissue samples were obtained from four brain regions (cerebellum, pons, and frontal and temporal cortices) for each subject. Genotyping was performed using Infinium HumanHap550 BeadChips (Illumina). Expression analysis was performed using Illumina HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChips. Genotype data were used as presented in the original publications 17, 18, 38 . The expression data were normalized and log transformed as described in the original papers 17, 18, 38 . eQTLs were tested by linear regression of normalized expression level on SNP genotypes (coded as the number of minor alleles at each SNP: 0, 1 or 2)."}]
