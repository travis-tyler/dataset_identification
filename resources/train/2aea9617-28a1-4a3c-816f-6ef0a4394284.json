[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: Longitudinal MRI studies are often subjected to mid-study scanner changes, which may alter image characteristics such as contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, intensity non-uniformity and geometric distortion. Measuring brain volume loss under these conditions can render the results potentially unreliable across the timepoint of the change. Estimating and accounting for this effect may improve the reliability of estimates of brain atrophy rates. Methods: We analyzed 237 subjects who were scanned at 1.5 T for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and were subject to intra-vendor or inter-vendor scanner changes during follow-up (up to 8 years). Sixty-three subjects scanned on GE Signa HDx and HDxt platforms were also subject to a T1-weighted sequence change from Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MP-RAGE) to Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo with IR Preparation (IR-FSPGR), as part of the transition from ADNI-1 to ADNI-2/GO. Two-timepoint percentage brain volume changes (PBVCs) between the baseline \"screening\" and the follow-up scans were calculated using SIENA. A linear mixed-effects model with subject-specific random slopes and intercepts was applied to estimate the fixed effects of scanner hardware changes on the PBVC measures. The same model also included a term to estimate the fixed effects of the T1-weighted sequence change. Results: Different hardware upgrade or change combinations led to different offsets in the PBVC (SE; p): Philips Intera to Siemens Avanto, \u00c01.81% (0.30; p < 0.0001); GE Genesis Signa to Philips Intera, 0.99% (0.47, p \u00bc 0.042); GE Signa Excite to Signa HDx, 0.33% (0.095, p \u00bc 0.0005); GE Signa Excite to Signa HDxt, \u00c00.023% (0.23, p \u00bc 0.92); GE Signa Excite to Signa HDx to Signa HDxt, 0.25% (0.095, p \u00bc 0.010) and 0.27% (0.16, p \u00bc 0.098), respectively; GE Signa HDx to Signa HDxt, \u00c00.24% (0.25, p \u00bc 0.34); Siemens Symphony to Symphony TIM, \u00c00.39% (0.16; p \u00bc 0.019). The sequence change from MP-RAGE to IR-SPGR was associated with an average \u00c01.63% (0.12; p < 0.0001) change. Conclusion: Inter-vendor scanner changes generally led to greater effects on PBVC measurements than did intra-vendor scanner upgrades. The effect of T1-weighted sequence change was comparable to that of the inter-vendor scanner changes. Inclusion of the corrective fixed-effects terms for the scanner hardware and T1-weighted sequence changes yielded better model goodness-of-fits, and thus, potentially more reliable estimates of whole-brain atrophy rates."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Measuring brain atrophy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a topic of significant interest in the study of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These diseases result in a range of pathological processes that lead to progressive neuronal, axonal, and dendritic degeneration, and ultimately, central nervous system (CNS) tissue atrophy . For example, a longitudinal MRI study has reported that the annualized rates of volume loss in the whole-brain (WB) and hippocampus were on average more than two-fold and four-fold higher, respectively, in AD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls (Leung et al., 2013) . Indeed, higher rates of brain volume loss in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are associated with higher rates of decline in cognitive measures (Evans et al., 2010) . For these reasons, MRI measures of brain volume change are widely recognized as markers of progression of neurodegeneration (Frisoni et al., 2010) .\nVarious technical factors can influence MRI-based brain volume change measurements, especially when calculating longitudinal changes using serial images. For example, head motion (Preboske et al., 2006) , inconsistent image contrast (Preboske et al., 2006) , different levels of noise (Preboske et al., 2006) , gradient non-linearity (Takao et al., 2010) , intensity non-uniformity (Takao et al., 2010) , inconsistent subject positioning (Caramanos et al., 2010) , number of head coil channels (Krueger et al., 2012) , and choice of image analysis methods (Nakamura et al., 2014; Popescu et al., 2016) all can affect measurement outcomes. Several single-site studies have investigated the effects of varying acquisition protocols on MRI outcomes. For example, Preboske and colleagues showed in a scan-rescan study that 1) implementing different flip angles and 2) switching from conventional to fast spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) sequence resulted in significant brain volume differences (Preboske et al., 2006) . Han and colleagues showed that the average cortical thickness variability did not change significantly across an intra-vendor scanner upgrade from Siemens Sonata 1.5 T to Avanto 1.5 T (Han et al., 2006) . However, different pulse sequences and image processing pipelines led to poorer scan-rescan reproducibility (Han et al., 2006) .\nNotably, Jovicich and colleagues assessed the effect of scanner vendor on brain volumes obtained with FreeSurfer. A scan-rescan analysis with Siemens Sonata 1.5 T and GE Signa 1.5 T showed that several structures had non-zero bias in the mean volume difference. Also, depending on the structure, the Sonata-Signa test set had bias in the mean volume difference compared to the Siemens Sonata scanrescan reference. The authors noted that these effects need to be considered in longitudinal studies in which the effects of interest can be subtle (Jovicich et al., 2009) .\nThe issue may become more significant when multiple MRI scanners are used, such as in a multi-center trial or when a significant mid-study change in the scanner occurs. For example, Kruggel and colleagues demonstrated that different 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanner platforms provide different levels of image quality, as measured by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and mutual information of the joint histogram, and that these affected brain volume measurements (Kruggel et al., 2010) . Therefore, interpretation of data from multiple scanning platforms must be done carefully since the effect of the platform change may confound the true effects of interest. Yet, despite the complexity, multi-center studies have important advantages of being able to recruit a larger number of participants across a wider range of population, and to increase the generalizability of the findings. Direct comparison of the MRI data acquired from multiple scanners, however, is likely more reliable when the data have been acquired in a similar manner using similar field strength and acquisition parameters. Recognizing this, a number of multi-center studies have implemented harmonized imaging protocols in order to reduce measurement variability due to protocol differences (Cannon et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2005; Shinohara et al., 2017) . The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study (ADNI) is a longitudinal, multi-center study that acquired MRI data using a variety of 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanners from General Electric (GE), Siemens, and Philips (Jack et al., 2015) . In particular, the study focused on designing and implementing standardized acquisition methods, as well as performing centralized image post-processing and quality control (Jack et al., 2015) . These qualities make ADNI a suitable dataset to test the hypothesis that a change in the scanning platform can bias WB volume change measurements, and estimate the magnitude of this effect between unique pairs of MRI scanners. To do this, we identified all subjects from the ADNI-1 1.5 T study who had any MRI scanner change or upgrade during the follow-up. Also, we identified a subset of subjects who had a T1-weighted sequence change during the follow-up. Then, we used a linear mixed-effects (LME) model to estimate the rates of WB atrophy, as well as the effects of different MRI scanner changes or upgrade combinations and T1-weighted sequence change on percentage brain volume change (PBVC) measurements."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data acquisition", "text": "The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W.

We considered several previous findings in building our LME model. Notably, in the case of analyzing data from multiple T1-weighted protocols, it was shown to be advantageous to include a categorical fixed-effect term for the different protocols (Jones et al., 2013) . Another study tested various forms of LME models in terms of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) goodness-of-fit measure, and demonstrated the advantage of including subject-specific random intercepts and slopes with protocol-specific residual variance (Chua et al., 2015) . Also, having protocol as a fixed effect led to a better model fit as opposed to having protocol-by-study time interactions (Chua et al., 2015) . Finally, a study of N \u00bc 713 ADNI subjects found no evidence of acceleration in WB atrophy rates over three years of follow-up (Leung et al., 2013) . Therefore, although many of the subjects in our study had more than three years of follow-up, we assumed linear time courses of atrophy.\nThe estimated PBVCs were modeled with an LME model that included subject-specific random slopes and intercepts, as well as fixed effects for the time from baseline and diagnosis groups, interaction between time and diagnosis group, MRI scanner models, and T1-weighted sequences. Scanner-specific residual variance was used.

Longitudinal PBVCs, with respect to the baseline, were measured from serial MRIs that reached up to 8 years of follow-up. An LME model was applied to model the time courses of WB PBVC while estimating the effects of inter-vendor scanner change, intravendor scanner upgrade, and T1-weighted sequence change from MP-RAGE to IR-FSPGR (subset of GE scanners only). The change of sequence from MP-RAGE to IR-FSPGR was associated with an average of \u00c01.63% change in PBVC. Artifactual changes in PBVC were found across different scanner hardware upgrade or change combinations. Inclusion of the corrective terms for scanner and sequence changes always led to a better model fit (i.e. lower AIC).\nWe first modeled the time courses of WB PBVC in the Chg-subgroup to explore rates unaffected by changes in the scanning hardware or T1-weighted sequence. The average rate of PBVC in AD patients was 1.35x higher than those of MCI patients and 2.52x higher than those of normal controls (Supplementary Table S1 ). This is in line with a previous study by Leung and colleagues, in which they reported LME model-estimated WB volume change rates over 3-years follow-up in the ADNI subjects (Leung et al., 2013) . Their model did not include terms for scanner or sequence, but these factors did not affect our Chg-group. Using a version of boundary-shift integral (KN-BSI), they found that the average rate in AD was 1.40x higher than those of MCI patients and 2.24x higher than those of normal controls. The actual rates differed due to the fact that SIENA tends to systematically give about 20% larger values compared to BSI (Smith et al., 2007) .\nThe Chg \u00fe subgroup comprised N \u00bc 237 subjects in which each was followed-up with one of the seven 1.5 T MRI scanner model combinations. These seven combinations could be broadly classified into three categories: inter-vendor scanner change (GE to Philips; Philips to Siemens), intra-vendor scanner upgrade (GE to GE; Siemens to Siemens), and T1-weighted sequence change (GE to GE). Presuming greater degrees of changes in hardware configuration lead to a larger effect on image characteristics, we hypothesized that inter-vendor scanner changes would induce greater bias on PBVC measurements compared to intravendor scanner upgrades. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the change in T1-weighted sequence from MP-RAGE to IR-FSPGR would have had a direct impact on image contrast and thus the PBVC measurements, even though the change occurred while on consistent MRI hardware platforms (GE Signa HDx or HDxt). These indeed was the case in our study. We analyzed two cases of inter-vendor scanner change combinations (Table 3) : GE Genesis Signa to Philips Intera, and Philips Intera to Siemens Avanto. Both cases represented a complete change in the hardware, including the main magnet and the coil. The average scanner change effects of \u00fe0.99% (Signa to Intera, p \u00bc 0.042) and \u00c01.81% (Intera to Avanto, p < 0.0001) were significant and were roughly equivalent to a year's worth of volume loss in MCI and AD, respectively. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 , contrast differences between images of the same subjects scanned on these different scanners from different vendors were subtle but present. When inter-vendor scanner changes occur, the bias due to the scanner change may exceed the magnitude of the main effect of interest, depending on the study.\nThere were five cases of intra-vendor scanner upgrade combinations (Table 3) : GE Signa Excite to HDx, GE Signa Excite to HDxt, GE Signa HDx to HDxt, GE Signa Excite to HDx to HDxt, and Siemens Symphony to Symphony TIM. The upgrade from Excite to HDx included both hardware (e.g. receive chain architecture) and software components, whereas that from HDx to HDxt was mainly software-related. Upgrading from Excite to HDx exerted a significant effect on PBVC (\u00fe0.33%, p \u00bc 0.0005), whereas going from Excite to HDxt did not (\u00c00.023%, p \u00bc 0.92). The average effect of a minor upgrade from HDx to HDxt was not significant (\u00c00.24%, p \u00bc 0.34). A similar pattern was observed in the group of subjects who had two upgrades from Excite to HDx to HDxt; upgrading from Excite to HDx led to a significant effect (\u00fe0.25%, p \u00bc 0.0103) whereas going from Excite to HDxt did not (\u00fe0.27%, p \u00bc 0.0978). Overall, we found no evidence that the software-related upgrade from HDx to HDxt led to a significant systematic bias on PBVC.\nThe Siemens TIM upgrade was a major hardware change that affected the gradient system, radiofrequency coil, and software. This upgrade led to a significant effect (\u00c00.39%, p \u00bc 0.0188) on PBVC, comparable to half a year's worth of normal aging in this group, and about 20% of the annual change in this population of AD subjects. Direct hardware changes led to effects with both positive and negative directions.\nIntra-vendor upgrades are the most common scenarios that occur in longitudinal studies, and our results suggest that, although the effects may differ from one upgrade to another, they may be ignorable if the rates of brain volume loss of interest are relatively large, such as in AD. Understanding the exact circumstances in which these effects are best ignored is not trivial, as it depends not only on the magnitude of the effect of interest, but also on study design factors such as the number of subjects affected by the change in comparison to the total number of subjects in the study.\nThe transition from ADNI-1 to ADNI-2/GO protocols included a change in the 3D T1-weighted sequence from MP-RAGE to IR-FSPGR in N \u00bc 63 subjects scanned on select 1.5 T GE HDx and HDxt platforms (N \u00bc 4 HDx and N \u00bc 59 HDxt). Briefly, the GE T1-weighted sequence that most closely resembled the ADNI MP-RAGE sequence was the GE product IR-FSPGR sequence, which was not available until July 2006 (https:// adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/themes/freshnews-dev-v2/documents/ mri/ADNI_MRI_Methods_Non-ADNI_Studies.pdf). Until the implementation of this sequence, the GE sites needed to use the earlier \"works-inprogress\" version of the ADNI MP-RAGE that focused on maximizing inter-vendor protocol standardization, but at the expense of replicability of the exact ADNI methods on other GE scanners. For the ADNI-2/GO phases, a complete switch was made to the GE product IR-FSPGR sequence . This would have resulted in an alteration of the SNR and CNR (Lin et al., 2006) . Fig. 3 shows example images from a single subject who had scans available from both sequences. Indeed, the T1-sequence change effect was significant in all cases with the average effect of \u00c01.63% on PBVC, p < 0.0001, estimated from the model that included all Chg \u00fe subjects (Fig. 6 ). This type of sequence change was specific to the ADNI study planning process and is unlikely to occur in a typical prospective longitudinal study. However, such changes may affect retrospective studies or studies in which standardized acquisitions are not performed. Our results suggest that the effect of sequence changes, even within the same hardware platform, may even exceed that observed in inter-vendor scanner changes and produce significant errors in brain volume measurements. Yet, it should be noted that our findings are specific to the MP-RAGE to IR-FSPGR sequence change on GE platforms, for which data were available. In general, the impact of a sequence change on PBVC would depend on the specific differences in the sequences and would need to be evaluated for each combination observed in practice.\nIt is possible that the step changes in PBVC resulted from a change in the brain-CSF boundary delineation after the scanner or sequence change, since the measurement of brain volume changes over time generally depends on the detection of edge motion between registered scans. For example, SIENA uses the derivative of the gradient across the brain-CSF boundary to estimate the brain/non-brain edge motion between two timepoints and converts the mean edge displacement into the PBVC value (Smith et al., 2002 ). An example scenario would be an improved boundary delineation (e.g. due to increased contrast or a reduction in the brain-CSF partial volume effects) which may result in an apparently reduced WB volume; in this case, the pre-upgrade volume would have been an overestimation due to the partial CSF volume being included in the brain volume.\nOur observation has important implications for longitudinal studies of brain volume change. In all cases, models with corrective terms for scanner and sequence changes yielded a lower AIC compared to those without, despite the two additional parameters being included in the model. This suggests that the atrophy rates estimated using the model with the corrective terms better represent the data, and that the rates from models without the corrective terms may be over-or underestimated, depending on the direction of the effect of the change. For example, the average model-estimated rates in the subjects who had the intra-vendor upgrade from Symphony to Symphony TIM were 10%, 6%, and 11% different for AD, MCI and normal respectively, compared to the rates estimated ignoring the changes. In the subjects who switched from Philips Intera to Siemens Avanto, these differences were 35%, 28%, and 42% for AD, MCI and normal respectively. It should be noted that the effect of scanning platform change is an aggregation of effects from various sources that contribute to image inconsistency, such as inconsistent image contrast, gradient nonlinearity, geometric distortion, intensity nonuniformity, and subject positioning. In principle, they may be corrected using site-specific living phantoms to estimate the scanner change effect and calibrate the measurements. However, this is generally not feasible and is infrequently done in practice. Whenever any scanner upgrade or changes occur, the researcher needs to identify the potential source(s) of image inconsistency and incorporate image processing schemes that may help alleviate the inconsistency. Yet, it should be recognized that the harmonized acquisition protocol and image processing steps alone may not be sufficient to remove the image variability originating from changes in scanning platforms. For example, a recent work from the North American Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis (NAIMS) Cooperative, which implemented a standardized protocol on 3T Siemens scanners, has reported significant scanner model-related variations in T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense lesions as well as brain volume measures (Shinohara et al., 2017) . Other works from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) dataset has reported significant site/scanner effects on cortical thickness as well as functional connectivity measures (Fortin et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018) . These results suggest that unwanted scanner-related non-biological variability is pervasive in many areas of brain imaging research. Additional steps, such as incorporating corrective terms into the statistical analysis model, may be necessary to attain a more reliable outcome. However, the modeling requires that there be sufficient numbers of subjects affected by any modeled change to be able to estimate the effect. This can be a challenge in some multi-center drug trials with many sites and not many subjects per site.\nStudy limitations and future directions: There were several limitations to our study. First, the ADNI study provided a valuable largescale, multi-site dataset acquired using a standardized protocol and quality control. We surveyed the data 'as-is' and could analyze seven different scanner upgrade/change combinations. This approach to subject selection inherently resulted in an unbalanced design. This issue was partially alleviated by the use of the LME model, which can accommodate unbalanced data (Fitzmaurice and Ravichandran, 2008) . Second, the average age at baseline was around 75 for our subjects, and this is when the rate of normal aging-related WB atrophy begins to accelerate (Scahill et al., 2003) . We kept the model as parsimonious as possible and did not take the potentially non-linear pattern of WB atrophy into account. Although this effect may not be apparent over the short-term (Leung et al., 2013) , it could have affected subjects who had 8 years of follow-up. Third, it is unknown whether the specific estimates of the effects for different scanner changes obtained from this study are generalizable, as various designs exist with regards to image acquisition, processing, and analysis pipeline. Yet, our study pipeline can be fairly easily replicated. The ADNI acquisition protocol is widely available and is increasingly being used in clinical trials, and our pre-processing steps and the SIENA method also have been commonly used. Whether our specific estimates apply to different image processing pipelines or atrophy measurement techniques (e.g. BSI, Jacobian Integration) needs to be further explored. Fourth, our study analyzed only 1.5 T scans, but 3.0 T systems are rapidly being adopted. In fact, newly enrolled subjects in the ADNI-2/GO have been entirely scanned at 3.0 T . Potential effects of 3.0 T scanner change/upgrade need to be investigated. Finally, there is a growing interest in measuring grey-and white-matter volumes separately, as grey-matter atrophy may be better correlated with disability progression and cognitive impairment than WB atrophy (Fisher et al., 2008) . The measurement of grey-matter change itself is technically challenging, and any scanner upgrade or change can add further complexity to the analysis. Kruggel and colleagues demonstrated significant within-subject variability of grey-and white-matter compartmental volumes (and thus, WB volume also) on different 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanners used in the ADNI (Kruggel et al., 2010) . Moreover, Nakamura and colleagues revealed that the presence of white-matter lesions can significantly bias grey-and white-matter segmentation (Nakamura and Fisher, 2009) . Further research on this important topic is warranted.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that different scanner hardware upgrades can exert different bias effects on WB PBVC. Inter-vendor scanner changes generally led to greater effects compared to intra-vendor scanner upgrades. Change in the 3D T1-weighted sequence from MP-RAGE to IR-FSPGR, within the same scanning platform, also led to a significant effect, comparable to that from inter-vendor scanner changes. Modeling brain volume loss with an LME model that includes corrective terms for scanner and sequence changes yields better model fits and more reliable estimates of WB atrophy rates."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of interest", "text": "Dr. Hyunwoo Lee reports no disclosures.
