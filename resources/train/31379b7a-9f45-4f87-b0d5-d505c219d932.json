[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "RNA viruses can show a high mutation rate [1] , which often results in fast emergence of viral quasispecies-populations of viruses differing in several genomic positions from the original virus [2] . Errors source of mutations, however in coronaviruses some of these errors can be corrected by a proofreading RNA exonuclease ExoN [3, 4] . Another source of mutations comes from RNA base editing by two classes of endogenous enzymes: adenine deaminases (ADAR) and cytosine deaminases APOBECs (APOlipoprotein B mRNA Editing Complex like polypeptides) which have a broad range of functions spanning from site-specific editing of cellular mRNAs to inhibiting viral and retrotransposon proliferation [5] [6] [7] . ADARs (ADAR1 and ADAR2) are double-strand (ds) RNA-specific enzymes converting adenine to inosine (A to I). Since inosine pairs with cytosine, this will result in A to G changes after the next round of replication. The preference of ADARs for certain deamination motifs -reflecting a combination of immediate nucleotide context and the anticipated dsRNA formed by folding-was assessed for in vitro editing of several RNA substrates. Based on these data, software was developed aimed to assign predictive ADAR deamination scores to any A position in a given RNA molecule [8] . The ADAR editing sites that were deduced in RNAs of cultured stimulated immune cells [9] agreed with the preferences defined in the in vitro study. It remains to be established whether these preferences would hold for a wide variety of RNA substrates in conditions of controlled in vivo expression of either ADAR1 or ADAR2.\nUnlike ADARs, the structure of APOBEC enzymes allow deamination only in single-strand (ss) RNA or in ssDNA. At least two APOBECs, APOBEC1 and APOBEC3A are capable of deaminating cytosine to uracil in RNA, however an RNA editing capacity of other APOBECs cannot be excluded [10] [11] [12] [13] . Cytosine deamination in RNA creates the normal RNA base-uracil, which can be then accurately copied in subsequent rounds of RNA replication. DNA deamination motifs or mutation signatures (i.e., the immediate nucleotide contexts around deaminated Cs) of several human APOBECs were first defined in model microbial systems and then found in genomic DNAs of human cancers, where they can cause hypermutation clusters [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The preferred DNA deamination motif of APOBEC3G (A3G) is nCc to nTc (n = any base; the mutated nucleotide and the resulting nucleotide are capitalized). Other APOBECs show preference for the tCn to tTn deamination motif or to a more stringently defined trinucleotide. For example, both APOBEC3A (A3A) and APOBEC3B (A3B) prefer tCa as a target, both in the yeast model and in human cancers [15] .\nAn indication of frequent RNA editing was recently found in the isolates of the hypermutated plus-strand ssRNA rubella vaccine virus from cutaneous granulomas of children with primary immunodeficiencies [20] . Altogether, genomes of six independent isolates of the hypermutated vaccine-derived viruses contained 993 mutations. Most changes were C to U in the genomic plus-strand RNA. These C to U changes showed high enrichment of a uCa to uUa RNA editing motif-a match to the characteristic A3A or A3B mutagenic motif in DNA. While the similarity between the C to U RNA editing motif in rubella virus and the DNA editing motifs strongly suggested the nature of the editing enzyme, signature motifs of APOBEC cytosine deamination in RNA are yet to be confirmed in a direct study involving expression of an APOBEC enzyme and collection of in vivo-editing spectrum data. The second most prevalent type of editing event was A to G change in the rubella plus or minus-strand, revealed as either U to C or G to A changes in the reported plus-strand sequence, respectively. These changes would be expected to result from ADAR editing. Minus-strand RNA in rubella virus as well as in Coronaviridae would often exist within completely-or partially double-stranded RNA [21, 22] , which would be the right substrate for an ADAR. This strand is a template for the multiple rounds of transcription generating many plus-strand partial-or full-size genomic RNAs. Thus, an A to G editing event in the minus-strand of dsRNA at the beginning of replication cycle would be carried as a U to C change to multiple rubella virus genomes. A to G editing events in the plus-strand of the dsRNA intermediate may directly contribute to the mutation spectrum in plus-strand viral genomes or propagate the mutation via the subsequent rounds of replication within the same cell. Besides ADAR editing, U to C (or complementary A to G) changes can result from uracil modifications by enzymes normally acting on specific uracils in tRNAs [23, 24] In summary, the previous analysis of the mutation spectrum and mutational signatures of hypermutated rubella virus genomes provided a strong indication of hyperediting by APOBEC cytidine deaminases as well as suggested editing by ADAR adenine deaminases [20] . Both rubella and Coroniviridae are positive ssRNA viruses which produce many copies of the genomic positive RNA strand and also have dsRNA intermediates in their replication cycles [21, 22, 25] , which can serve as substrates for APOBECs and for ADARs, respectively. Indeed, recent analyses suggested APOBEC and ADAR editing in SARS-CoV-2 based on an excess of C to U changes and A to G in sequencing reads from lavages of two COVID-19 patients or in genome alignments [26, 27] . Based on the similarity between the preferred RNA editing motifs in rubella virus and the APOBEC DNA hypermutation motifs, we sought to determine whether similar mutational signature motifs can be detected in a collection of 32,341 whole genome sequences of multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates that have been sequenced during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We present here the evidence indicating a similarity between the RNA editing spectra and mutational signatures between the hypermutated rubella virus isolates and the load of editing changes accumulated in this collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

For that purpose, we obtained the viral genome FASTA files and processed them to obtain unique mutation calls and the mutation signatures as outlined in Fig 1. 32,341 FASTA files were downloaded from the GISAID Initiative [34] web site (https:// www.gisaid.org/) on 06/22/2020, each containing a consensus whole genome-sequence of a SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated from a human subject and sequenced at high coverage. Based on the published analysis of the GISAID data for a subset of around 4000 of SARS-CoV-2 isolates across the world performed with the use of the Nextstrain package ( [35] and https://nextstrain. org/ncov/global?l=clock), an average lineage of SARS-CoV-2 virus successfully transmitted from one subject to another would accumulate approximately 22 base substitutions per year (12-13 base substitutions for the period of December-June, 2020); a similar estimate was also obtained in [36] ). The final FASTA sequence files of the individual isolates in GISAID represent a consensus derived from high coverage sequencing reads and contain information about the mutations present with high frequency in a sequenced viral isolate and therefore belong to viral particles capable of proliferation. We aligned each sequence against the sequence of presumably the earliest isolate of a SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512. 2) and listed each change in a separate row of a mutation annotation file (MAF) Fig 1 and S1A Table. We annotated each of 251,273 mutation events in each isolate by surrounding +/-20 nucleotides of genomic context around position of each mutation, by location in one or in several overlapping ORFs, by potential amino acid change or protein truncation effect, as well as by location of a change in self complementary area (predicted stem) or outside of such area (predicted loop) in plusstrand genomic RNA. Many independent isolates could have originated from the already mutated virus spreading the same mutation(s) into genomes of multiple (up to thousands) downstream isolates (see column \"times_refPos_mutated_inMAF\" in S1A Table) . Therefore, we also annotated each mutation in a sample by the number of different samples in which such a mutation was found. Since each genome of an individual isolate contained only few mutations and many of these mutations were identical in multiple isolates, we built our analysis to evaluate the overall spectrum of non-redundant mutation events that have accumulated in the human population through the current pandemic rather than the mutation spectra in "}, {"section_title": "PLOS ONE", "text": "Similarity between mutation spectra in SARS-CoV-2 and in hypermutated isolates of rubella virus individual isolates We de-duplicated the starting MAF and created three groups of mutations (S2A-S2C Table) . The first group contained a pooled non-redundant set with no duplicates (NoDups) that listed each individual mutation only once regardless of how many isolates contained the same mutation (total 12,156 mutation events). While the individual isolates are not listed in this group any more, it contains a set of distinct events most closely representing the spectrum of unrelated mutation events rather than a complex downstream process of distributing mutant forms in human population. However, even in the NoDups list (S2C Table) the base substitutions in many positions could be under positive or negative selection, which could skew the spectrum of the observed changes from the mechanistic mutation spectrum that accurately reflects the underlying mutagenic processes. Therefore, we subdivided this group based on whether the changes yielded functional effects in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Non-synonymous amino acid changes and changes introducing or removing stop codons were designated as functional (Func), while synonymous changes or changes outside ORFs were designated and non-functional (NonFunc). The content of NoDupsNonFunc group (S2A Table) would be the least affected by functional selection and thus, most accurately represent the impact of unconstrained mutational processes operating on the viral genome. While this group is smaller, it still contains a sufficient number of changes (4,740 mutation events) for detecting trends in the mutational patterns. The mutation spectrum of 7,416 NoDupsFunc events (S2B Table) was also analyzed. Each of the three SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectra was compared to the combined mutation spectrum (993 base substitutions) from six independent isolates originated from the hypermutated rubella-vaccine virus [20] (S3A Table) . Unlike many SARS-CoV-2 isolates, where individual mutated event could be carried from one isolate to another, each rubella virus isolate contained mutations that had occurred independently from the vaccine virus in each subject. Thus, the total of the mutational events in six rubella isolates was, at least in part, representative of the mutation spectrum. However, mutation spectra in each rubella isolate may represent an unknown level of selection. Indeed, a number of mutations was observed in more than one rubella virus isolate (see column \"times_refPos_mu-tated_inMAF\" in S3A Table) . Some level of selection was also indicated by analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in each codon [20] . Therefore, we made separate comparisons of the rubella virus mutation spectra with each of the three SARS-CoV-2 nonredundant MAFs (Fig 1) : the non-duplicated mutation events (NoDups), and its two subsetsthe non-duplicated mutation events with potential of functional significance (NoDupsFunc) and the non-duplicated non-functional mutation events (NoDupsNonFunc).\nAll mutations are reported based on the plus (genomic) strand of the virus. We started from conventional comparisons of all possible single base substitutions and the mutation preference for potential loop or stem parts of ssRNA secondary structure. Unlike in our previous analysis of the mutation spectrum and signatures in the genomes of hypermutated rubella virus isolates, where we followed only a limited set of motifs based on specific hypotheses, we used here an \"agnostic\" approach analyzing all 192 possible trinucleotide-centered mutation motifs for enrichment in the viral genomes. We also used existing software to calculate ADAR editing scores [8] . Overall, our methodology allows to detect the mutational signatures that predominate in the viral genomes. Comparisons with the hypermutated rubella genomes further demonstrated the similarities in the mutational processes operating on both viral genomes.\nSimilarity between mutation spectra in SARS-CoV-2 and in hypermutated isolates of rubella virus other similar plus-strand RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2. The large-scale sequencing efforts producing genomes of tens of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 isolates allowed us to accurately identify mutations, build a mutation catalog for this virus, highlight similarities with hypermutated rubella and reveal unique features of SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis (summarized in Table 1 ).\nIn agreement with the previous analyses performed separately for rubella [20] and for SARS-CoV2 [26, 27, 36, 37] comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and hypermutated rubella strains demonstrated that the base substitution spectra correlate between the two viruses. Two types of base substitutions-C to U (and its complementary G to A) and A to G (and its complementary U to C), expected from endogenous mutagenesis by APOBECs and ADARs, respectively, prevailed in both viruses (Fig 2) .\nSince RNA can form secondary structures, any mutagenic processes active upon ssRNA would preferentially be formed in the loop regions of the secondary structures. Analysis of A to G and U to C substitutions consistent with the biochemical specificity of ADARs did not reveal any preference for mutagenesis in loops versus stem regions. ADARs are known to act on dsRNA substrates. Thus, if ADARs did in fact contribute to induction of these substitutions, they should be acting on a dsRNA form, wherein we do not expect RNA to fold into secondary structures. We also found in SARS-CoV-2, but not in rubella, statistically significant enrichment of the nAu to nGu mutations along with its reverse complement aUn to aCn. While these could reflect adenine deamination by one of the ADARs in either strand of a dsRNA intermediate, these motifs are different from the motif preference revealed by in vitro editing of artificial dsRNA substrate [8] . Also, there was no increase in ADAR scores in the SARS-CoV-2 A to G or U to C mutations (S1 Fig and S1 Data) , thus indicating that ADARs may not be the primary source of these changes. If A to G or U to C changes are really stemming from ADAR activity, it is possible that these enriched motifs are preferred by ADARs in SARS-CoV-2 but not in RNA substrates used to generate the editing consensus in [8] . Alternatively, A to G and U to C changes could be caused by one or more mechanisms unconnected to ADARs.\nUnlike A to G changes, in-depth analysis of C to U substitutions revealed that they were predominantly present in the RNA plus-strands of both viruses and demonstrated a preference for loops versus stems in the RNA secondary structure (Fig 3 and S5 Table) . This phenomenon \nis similar to the preference of ssDNA and mRNA editing in loops by the APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase [39, 43] , which so far is the only RNA-editing APOBEC explored for this feature. Agnostic analysis of enrichments in all 192 possible trinucleotide mutation motifs highlighted statistically significant excess of uCa to uUa motif in rubella, however these changes were not prevalent in SARS-CoV-2. Mutations in plus-strands of both viruses showed statistically significant enrichments with uCg to uUg and uCu to uUu motifs (Fig 4A and 4B ). These motifs belong to a group uCn to uUn (tCn to tTn in DNA) which is characteristic of several APOBEC cytidine deaminases ( [15] and references therein). We note that although these signatures were enriched in the non-functional mutations (NoDupsNonFunc), they did not pass the 0.05 FDR threshold in filtered datasets that included mutations with potential functional effects (NoDupsFunc). These differences in the mutation signatures between SARS-CoV-2 and rubella may be due to different APOBEC family members performing editing or due to the confounding presence of other sources of C to U mutagenesis, such as spontaneous cytosine deamination that frequently occurs in ssDNA [44] or oxidative mutagenesis capable of generating C to T mutations in ssDNA in vivo [45, 46] . In support of the role of oxidative damage in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, is the increased prevalence of G to U substitutions which is consistent with the oxidation of guanines in the RNA plus-strand (Fig 2) . G to U changes could be caused by an increased level of oxidative damage generating 8-oxoG in viral RNA within cells or during sequencing library preparation [47, 48] . Frequent copying of 8-oxoG with A, would show up as G to U changes in the strand, where 8-oxoG was present. However, since we analyze the consensus sequences of the viral genomes and not individual reads, errors during library preparation would most likely be filtered out and would not be represented in the viral genome sequence. We also note that the recent study [27] indicated the overall low chance of sequencing errors reflected in SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences in the dataset analyzed in that work.\nOn the other hand, G to U changes were present only at low density in hypermutated rubella genomes indicating physiological differences between the two viruses. There were two more groups of trinucleotide mutation motifs involving C to U (and complementary G to A) substitutions in plus RNA strand specifically enriched for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4A and 4B) . The aCn to aUn (reverse complement nGu to nAu) group of motifs may represent a preference previously unknown for APOBECs in RNA or just a mutagenic mechanism yet to be defined. The cGn to cAn group of motifs seen in the plus-strand may be in fact due to mutations of the reverse complement motif nCg to nUg in the minus-strand. nCg to nTg (CpG to TpG) germline and somatic mutagenesis is universally present in DNA of species with 5-methylcytosine and is generated by systems specialized to mutagenesis in methylated CpG sequences. However various studies have demonstrated that CpG to TpG mutagenesis can occur independent of cytosine methylation [49, 50] . Several studies have shown that CpG dinucleotides are depleted in the genomes of SARS viruses indicating functional selection and/ or increased frequency of cytosine deamination in these viral genomes [51-54]. Our study shows with high statistical confidence that nCg to nUg (CpG to UpG) mutagenesis in the minus strand is enriched (Fig 4B) supporting the role of nCg-(CpG)-specific cytosine deamination in minus RNA strand in SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutagenesis.\nIn summary, comparison of base substitution spectra and signatures between hypermutated rubella virus isolates and the SARS-CoV-2 multi-genome dataset demonstrates both similarities and differences in the mutational processes active upon the two plus-strand RNA viruses. It is important to understand the mechanisms that contribute to mutagenesis of viral genomes, since hypermutation of even inactivated rubella vaccine virus was shown to generate reactivated viral particles [20] . We demonstrate here that the APOBEC-specific uCa to uUa changes that are highly enriched in hypermutated rubella, are much less prevalent in SARS-CoV-2. We propose that assessment of uCa to uUa signature in viral genomes can provide insights into the potential hypermutation risk of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, understanding the genomic mutational patterns is important for predicting virus evolution. Our study has highlighted several distinct features of SARS-CoV-2 mutational spectrum that, after validation with independent dataset(s) can be used to build predictive models for this and related SARS viruses.

Importantly, there was a statistically significant similarity between the distributions of base substitution densities in rubella and in each of three filtered SARS-CoV-2 MAFs as well as a similarity in several prevailing types of base substitutions (Fig 2 and S4 Table) .\nIn both viruses, there was a very high frequency of the C to U changes, consistent with the hypothesis of cytidine deamination in the plus-strand (genomic) RNA. C to U changes in the minus-strand, which would be reported as G to A in the plus-strand, were less abundant in both viruses. Another class of highly abundant changes in both viruses were U to C changes in the plus RNA strand which could originate from A to G changes caused by ADAR adenine deaminase in the minus-strand. The corresponding A to G changes in the plus-strand were less abundant in rubella but were comparable with the C to U changes in SARS-CoV-2.\nA prior study of hypermutated rubella genomes found small, but statistically significant increase in ADAR scores (calculated as described by [8] ) in U to C and A to G ADAR-like base substitutions compared to two other types of substitutions in U or A nucleotides [20] . However, no statistically significant increase in ADAR scores was found for the U to C and A to G changes in the SARS-CoV-2 dataset analyzed in a similar way (S1 Fig and S1 Data) . Since the ADAR score tool was developed based on in vitro deamination of a perfectly paired dsRNA substrate, there could be a difference in sequence preferences between this substrate and the actual substrate of in vivo editing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Alternatively, abundant U to C and A to G ADAR-like editing could be due to mechanisms not involving ADARs.\nThe only apparent discrepancy between the two viruses was in a high density of the G to U changes in the plus-strand of SARS-CoV-2, while they were nearly absent in rubella. We note that the density of G to U changes in minus-strand (reported as the complementary C to A changes in plus-strand in Fig 2) was similar to other low abundant changes in both viruses.

Recently it was revealed that APOBEC3A has a preference for deaminating cytosines in regions prone to forming loops in ssDNA secondary structure [39] . Therefore we annotated all positions in the SARS-CoV-2 and rubella genomes for either preference for loop or stem location in potential secondary structure formed by the RNA plus-strand ([33] S1B and S3B Tables and Methods). We then compared mutation counts in loop vs stem for each type of base substitutions (Fig 3 and S5 Table) .\nIn both viruses there was a highly significant preference for loop location with C to U changes in plus-strand. The second type of base changes prevalent in both SARS-CoV-2 and in rubella, the U to C changes in plus-strand (corresponding to A to G changes in minusstrand) did not show statistically significant differences between loop and stem. If the U to C (A to G) changes were to come from ADAR adenine deaminase acting on dsRNA, secondary structure effects of ssRNA intermediate folding would not be expected. Alternatively, these changes could be not ADAR driven. The only other type of changes showing statistically"}, {"section_title": "Fig 2.

Same as for the base substitution spectra, this outstanding feature of the G to U changes showed up in SARS-CoV-2, but not in rubella (see above)."}, {"section_title": "Mutational motif preferences in SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus genomes suggest APOBEC cytidine deaminases as a source of C to U base substitutions in the plus RNA strand", "text": "Since base substitution spectra in SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus are correlated, it is likely that they also shared common mechanisms which generated these changes. It is well established that several mechanisms of mutagenesis in DNA of tumors and normal cells can have not only distinctive base substitutions spectra but also diagnostic preference for trinucleotide mutation motifs [30, 40, 41] . Currently there is very little information about motif preference in RNA editing or mutagenesis. Therefore, we assessed enrichment using all possible 192 trinucleotide mutation motifs (96 in plus and 96 in minus RNA strand) of each virus. Enrichment values for each motif were calculated based on counts of mutations in a motif normalized for the motif content in the genomic background (see Methods). Statistical evaluation of enrichments showed significance for several motifs even after FDR<0.05 correction to individual P-values was applied (S6A-S6C Table) . However, base substitutions for the most-enriched motifs were present in low numbers, so these results require validation in independent studies (also see Discussion). Therefore, we concentrated on the motifs representing the most abundant types of base substitutions present in both viruses, i.e., on the C to U and their complement G to A, as well as U to C and their complement A to G changes. For statistically-significant enriched trinucleotide motifs containing one of these four base substitutions, we calculated the minimum estimates of mutation load (MutLoad) that can be assigned to mechanism(s) with preference for a significantly enriched motif (Fig 4, S6A -S6D Table and Materials and methods).\nThe only revealed similarity between statistically-significant enriched motifs in rubella virus and in SARS-CoV-2 was for the uCn to uUn changes, consistent with the tCn to tTn ssDNA mutagenesis specificity of a subgroup of APOBEC cytidine deaminases. However, even within the APOBEC-like group of motifs there was a difference between strong enrichment with uCa to uUa motif in rubella and the lack of statistically significant preference for this motif in SARS-CoV-2. There were also three groups of motifs significantly enriched in SARS--CoV-2, but not in rubella (see Table 1 and Discussion for possible mechanistic assignment of these motifs).\nWe also assessed the potential loop vs stem preference for trinucleotide motifs containing C to U and G to U single base substitutions that showed overall loop vs stem preference. None of trinucleotide motifs containing C to U base substitutions showed loop or stem preference in selection-free SARS-CoV-2 NoDupsNonFunc filtered dataset and in rubella (S2 Fig and S7A and S7D Table) . Several C to U containing trinucleotide motifs in SARS-CoV-2 datasets, where functional selection cannot be excluded, showed statistically significant bias towards mutations in loops (S2 Fig and S7B and S7C Table) , however more data accumulation is required in order to exclude the confounding effects of functional selection in specific sites. No loop vs stem preference was detected in trinucleotide motifs containing G to U substitutions either in SARS-CoV-2 or in rubella (S3 Fig and S8A -S8C Table) . visualize overall parallelism between rubella and each filtered MAF.
