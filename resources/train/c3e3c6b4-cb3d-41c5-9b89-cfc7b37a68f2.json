However, this difference was significantly higher in both women and men with central obesity than in their counterparts (women: 5.9 \u00b1 4.5 vs. 3.6 \u00b1 3.7 cm; men: 6.0 \u00b1 4.5 vs. 3.6 \u00b1 3.7 cm; P < 0.0001 for both).

In both women and men, we found a linear positive relationship between WC and the difference between subtracted TD and subtracted TD TC , confirming the hypothesis of an overestimation bias of TD (Figure 2a ) and consequently PWV (Figure 2b ) with wider WC in both sexes. Interestingly, for each unit increase of WC, the overestimation of TD (and therefore PWV) appeared to be generally higher in women than men (beta coefficients for female sex in the overall model including WC predicting the difference in TD = 1.63 cm, SE = 0.33, P < 0.0001; predicting the difference in PWV = 0.27 m/sec, SE = 0.06, P < 0.0001) (Figure 2 ).

Of note, each of these 3 parameters also had a high significant correlation with WC (correlation coefficient >0.75 with P < 0.0001 for all). No association was found between the difference in TD or PWV and body height or age (Table 2 ).

All of these measures of adiposity showed significant association with PWV calculated using the distance measured over the body surface. However, none of them, except visceral fat, demonstrated a significant association with PWV calculated using TD from CT scout images (Table 3) . Thus, despite accounting for the overestimation in TD due to central obesity, the association of subtracted PWV CT with visceral fat remained significant ( Table 3 ). The association with visceral fat remained significant also when PWV was calculated using 80% of straight carotid-femoral distance recently recommended by the expert consensus 14 or in women when estimating TD from body height ( Table 3 ). The strength of the association with visceral fat decreased by about one-third when using subtracted TD CT or 0.8 \u00d7 direct TD CT or estimated TD to calculate PWV as compared with subtracted TD from body surface (Table 3) .

For the same increase in WC, women generally displayed higher increase in TD and consequently in PWV. Interestingly, when correcting PWV for the effect of central obesity using TD estimates from CT images or body height, the association between PWV and different quantification of body fat disappeared, except for visceral fat.\nErrors in PWV estimation can be introduced in calculating the TD between pulse assessment points. 14, 24 To date, a variety of methods have been used by different groups, which could lead to differences in TD values of up to 15 cm 20 and consequently in PWV values as high as 30%. 13 Consensuses within the field believe that part of these differences are due to the impact that large abdomen and/or breast size may have on the TD measured by tape measure, especially in obese people. 1, 14, 24 However, no community-based study has yet investigated this issue in a large population with prevalent obesity. Huybrechts and colleagues, in a small study, compared the \"real TD\" measured within the aorta by magnetic resonance imaging with 11 different estimates of TD obtained using a tape measure and showed a small impact of body mass index, even when considering the recommended 80% straight carotid-femoral distance. 20 A more recent paper from the same group and study population compared straight magnetic resonance imaging and tape measure carotid-femoral distance and found significantly longer distances when using a tape measure only in women. 15 However, only 5% of the 98 Pulse wave velocity, PWV PWV using subtracted TD, m/sec 7.4 \u00b1 1.7 8.1 \u00b1 2* PWV using subtracted TD CT , m/sec 6.6 \u00b1 1.5 7.4 \u00b1 1.9* PWV using 0.8 \u00d7 direct TD CT , m/sec 9.5 \u00b1 2 10.4 \u00b1 2.6* PWV using estimated TD, m/sec 8.6 \u00b1 1.9 9.4 \u00b1 2.4* Data are mean \u00b1 SD or percentage.

Furthermore, in accordance with previous findings, 15 this overestimation appeared to be generally higher in women at all values of WC. Sagittal abdominal diameter, weight, and body mass index were also significant correlates of the difference in TD. These findings shed light on previous reports from our group 2-4 and others [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] showing a significant association between PWV and WC, which, interestingly, was generally stronger in women. Indeed, most of these studies measured the TD following the contours of the body and passing through the sternum and the umbilicus and subtracting the carotid-suprasternal distance, as recommended by prior expert consensuses. 1, 19 At the same time, some studies failed to demonstrate an independent association of WC with PWV, regardless whether TD was measured in a straight line 28 or following the body contours. 29, 30 Beyond the method used to estimate TD, differences in sample size and characteristics, study protocol, and statistical analysis may be responsible for some of the heterogeneity in these results.\nOur findings support the most recent recommendations to measure the straight carotid-femoral distance using a sliding caliper or infantometer, 14 particularly in women. 15 Valid alternative estimates may be obtained from body height, 14, 24 and this method would be particularly useful to be tested in previous longitudinal studies. 2, 10, 31 Our findings are also particularly relevant to diet-intervention studies that report the effect of weight loss on PWV using carotid-femoral distance measured over the body. 32, 33 Indeed, the decrease in PWV over time shown in these studies may simply be the result of a reduction in carotid-femoral distance estimation due to the achieved decrease in body weight, WC, and/or body mass index. 32, 33 In our study, PWV obtained using TD measured over the surface of the body was associated with WC and various expressions of body fat, including total body fat by DEXA and different component of abdominal fat quantified by CT, as previously shown. 16, 17, 34 However, after calculating PWV using linear distances obtained from CT scout images or from body height, only the association with visceral fat remained consistently significant in univariable analysis. Interestingly, the same result was observed when using 80% of the straight carotid-femoral distance recommended by a most recent consensus document. 14 These findings support the notion of a specific effect of visceral fat on arterial stiffness.

Otherwise P not significant.\nScant evidence exists in the literature regarding a causeeffect relationship between visceral fat and arterial stiffness. Some previous studies exploring the association between PWV and visceral fat in humans likely suffered from the limitation of measuring TD following the body contours explored in this analysis. 16, 17, 34 Nevertheless, studies using alternative measures of arterial stiffness not affected by TD estimation (such as carotid elastic modulus 1 ) have confirmed the association of PWV with visceral fat [34] [35] [36] and showed that the degree of arterial stiffening with weight gain was determined by the amount of abdominal visceral fat gain, independently of the amount of total body fat gained. 37 Accordingly, a decrease in visceral fat was likely responsible for the effect of weight loss on PWV reported in 2 studies, which estimated PWV using magnetic resonance imaging 38 or maintaining TD constant throughout the course of the study. 39 Several mechanisms have been proposed by which visceral fat may promote arterial stiffening, including the secretion by adipocytes of peptides such as angiotensin, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, 40 leptin, and adiponectin. 17 Furthermore, visceral obesity is associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, 41 which may serve as part of the link between increased visceral adipose tissue and stiffening of the aorta. 16 PWV measurements have been made in the BLSA measuring the TD over the body surface since 1988. We acknowledge that recent literature has been increasingly suggesting taking the carotid-femoral distance in a straight line and using 80% of this distance as a new standard, 14 instead of the subtraction method used in this study and recommended in previous consensus documents. 1, 19 However, because a definitive agreement is still lacking, to date we have been keen not to introduce any change in methodology that would produce a period shift in our longitudinal data. The straight tape measure carotid-femoral distance was not available in our study, but we used the straight distance from CT scout images as a proxy to calculate the 80% TD recommended by most recent guidelines and to test its association with different fat depots. Because of the likely imperfect overlap between our radiological and over-the-body landmarks, we anticipated that a difference of at least \u00b13 cm between the two distances within the same individual would be due to measurement error (assuming \u00b11 cm for each different point of reference; i.e., manubrium of the sternum on body surface vs. on x-ray image, umbilicus vs. L4, and femoral artery vs. femoral neck). The actual location of the femoral pulse, which we assumed at the level of the femoral neck, may also vary significantly in obese individuals 23 who tend to accumulate fat tissue at the groin. 19 For these reasons, we performed sensitivity analyses, which resulted in removing, first, participants with a CT-derived distance greater than the one measured over the body (n = 47 women and 58 men, with a maximum difference of \u22122.8 and \u22122.6 cm, respectively) and, second, potential outliers (n = 77, with studentized residual <\u22122 or >2). After excluding these persons, the results did not differ for either men or women (data not shown). In addition, if the analyses were restricted to participants who underwent PWV examination with the Complior device, the significance of the results did not substantially change (data not shown). Finally, our method did not account for larger bust size in women, which is likely to have contributed to the higher overestimation in carotid-femoral distance and PWV observed in women.\nAlthough a general consensus is still lacking, our study findings demonstrate the important bias introduced when measuring the carotid-femoral distance over the body surface using a tape measure, especially in individuals with larger WC, and strongly support the most recent recommendations to use 80% of the straight carotid-femoral distance (preferentially measured with a sliding caliper or infantometer) as the standard TD for clinical practice. 14 The specific association between visceral fat and PWV demonstrated in this study, together with other data in the literature, [34] [35] [36] [37] emphasizes the role of visceral adipose tissue as a major contributor to arterial stiffness, which certainly deserves further basic and clinical investigation."}]
