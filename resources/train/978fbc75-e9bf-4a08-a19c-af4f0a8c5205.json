making payments\ufffd In selecting a repayment period, if the borrower picks a 10-year repayment term rather than 20 years, the monthly payments are higher but the total amount of interest paid is less\ufffd Some borrowers choose graduated repayment plans, in which they make interest-only payments in the first two years of repayment\ufffd The following estimate of student debt burden shows
