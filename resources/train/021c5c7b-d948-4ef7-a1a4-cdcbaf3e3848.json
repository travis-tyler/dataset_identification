[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Eighteen years after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China (WHO) and eight years after the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia [1] , a novel coronavirus pandemic of animal origin emerged in late 2019 [2] . The disease, referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 , is caused by a novel Betacoronavirus named SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3] [4] [5] . The virus was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, where pneumonia cases of unknown origin were observed in mid-December 2019 [6] . By the end of January 2020, about 20 other countries reported COVID-19 cases internationally, and at the time of writing, Viruses 2020, 12 approximately 69 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed globally, with over 1.5 million deaths. Italy was the first European country to experience a major COVID-19 epidemic, with a first wave of transmission characterised by a relatively high number of deaths. As of 6 December 2020, 1,709,991 cases and 59,514 fatalities have been reported in Italy (WHO update, 8 December) [7] . The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy were reported on 30 January 2020 in Chinese tourists in Rome. This rose to nine confirmed cases by 22 February (WHO situation report 33) and 76 by 23 February (WHO situation report 34) [8, 9] . Due to this alarming rise, the Italian government imposed a partial lockdown across 11 municipalities on February 22 in the two hotspot areas-Lombardy and Veneto [10] . This consisted of restrictions on individual mobility, social distancing, and closure of all non-essential services. Nevertheless, the number of confirmed cases rose exponentially, with 1128 total cases confirmed on 1 March. In response to this growing number of cases, the emergency lockdown measures were extended to the whole country on March 8. Notably, the majority of cases occurred in northern Italy in the region of Lombardy (Figure 1 ).\nViruses 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 11 January 2020, about 20 other countries reported COVID-19 cases internationally, and at the time of writing, approximately 69 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed globally, with over 1.5 million deaths. Italy was the first European country to experience a major COVID-19 epidemic, with a first wave of transmission characterised by a relatively high number of deaths. As of 6 December 2020, 1,709,991 cases and 59,514 fatalities have been reported in Italy (WHO update, 8 December) [7] . The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy were reported on 30 January 2020 in Chinese tourists in Rome. This rose to nine confirmed cases by 22 February (WHO situation report 33) and 76 by 23 February (WHO situation report 34) [8, 9] . Due to this alarming rise, the Italian government imposed a partial lockdown across 11 municipalities on February 22 in the two hotspot areas-Lombardy and Veneto [10] . This consisted of restrictions on individual mobility, social distancing, and closure of all non-essential services. Nevertheless, the number of confirmed cases rose exponentially, with 1128 total cases confirmed on 1 March. In response to this growing number of cases, the emergency lockdown measures were extended to the whole country on March 8. Notably, the majority of cases occurred in northern Italy in the region of Lombardy (Figure 1 ). Previous studies have reported that the first cases reported in Lombardy were not related to those detected in Rome at the end of January, but rather derived from infections linked to Shanghai, China and Munich, Germany [12] . SARS-Cov-2 has been divided into two main lineages, A and B, each containing a number of sub-lineages [13] . Both lineages likely separated early during the Wuhan outbreak, with lineage B now being more widely distributed. A study investigating cases in the Lazio region (around Rome) reported that the majority of the analysed sequences belonged to the B.1 lineage, and dated the origin of the Italian epidemic to early February [10] . SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1 contains an amino acid substitution at site 614 of the spike protein (D614G) that increases infectivity in cell assays in vitro and is proposed to enhance viral transmissibility in nature [14, 15] . The earliest sequence detected carrying this genetic variation was sampled in Italy on 20 February, and became more common throughout Europe shortly after [16] .\nUsing genomic epidemiology, we aimed to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in time and space within and between geographic regions in Italy during the first epidemic wave (between January to July 2020), focusing on the diversity of viral lineages present in the country before and after lockdown was imposed on 8 March 2020, and how they spread around the country, particularly the connections to the main disease hub in Lombardy. We focused on the central Italian region of Abruzzo for which we conducted virus sequencing. In Abruzzo, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 27 February, in a male patient who travelled as a tourist from Lombardy and arrived in Abruzzo shortly before the nation-wide lockdown was implemented across Italy. As per 6 December, 30,274 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed in Abruzzo, representing <2% of cases in Italy [17] ."}, {"section_title": "Ethics", "text": "The testing and sequencing of suspected COVID-19 cases and contacts in the Abruzzo region was conducted within the official surveillance program established by the Italian health authorities, and is exempt from ethical approval."}, {"section_title": "Specimen Collection", "text": "Samples were collected from the respiratory tract of individuals who were either hospitalized, screened through contact-tracing purposes, or tested via the framework of the screening programs for individuals working at the national health care system (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, SSN).

Some of these libraries were enriched using a myBaits Expert Virus-SARS-CoV-2 kit (Arbor Biosciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).

Because of the major sampling biases between individual regions, we combined genome sequences into larger geographical clusters: North Italy (71% of sequences; representing the Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Trentino Alto Adige, Val D'Aosta and Veneto regions), Central Italy (21% of sequences; from Abruzzo, Lazio, Marche, Tuscany), and South Italy (8% of sequences; from Basilicata, Campania, Molise, Puglia, Sardinia).\nTo place the Italian sequences in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, they were compared against all available non-Italian SARS-CoV-2 genomes using Blastn. The top 50 hits for each Italian sequence were extracted in addition to 500 randomly selected global sequences and two early Wuhan sequences representative of viral clades A and B [13] -GISAID sequences hCoV-19/Wuhan/WH04/2020|EPI_ISL_406801|2020-01-05 and hCoV-19/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019|EPI_ISL_402125|2019-12-31 (Sequence IDs for all global sequences are provided in Table S1 ). This enabled us to obtain sufficiently informative sequences for phylogenetic analysis without generating a data set so large to be computationally intractable."}, {"section_title": "Phylogenetic Analysis", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 sequences were aligned using MAFFT implementing the L-INS-I algorithm, and the alignment was manually inspected in Geneious 11.1.3 (https://www.geneious.com). Sequences that were shorter than 95% of the complete genome, missing the day of sampling, contained at least 5% of ambiguous nucleotides, or that which displayed abnormally long branch lengths were excluded. Identical global sequences were also excluded. Nucleotide positions 6867 and 6868 (according to SARS-Cov-2 isolate Whuhan-Hu-1, NCBI accession MN908947) were removed from the alignment due to a potential sequencing error in some of the samples processed here. Accordingly, the final data set comprised 2373 sequences; 1722 global sequences, 651 sequences from Italy, of which 192 were created in this study here, and was 29,569 nucleotides in length. The sequences from Italy were sampled between 29th January to 20th July 2020, whereas the global sequences were sampled between 30th December 2019 and 29th July 2020.\nSARS-CoV-2 were classified using the Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool v2.0.7 (https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/). A maximum likelihood tree of these data was estimated using IQ-TREE v1.6.12 [20] , as described previously [21] using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano nucleotide substitution model with a gamma distributed rate variation among sites (HKY+\u0393) [22] , an ultrafast bootstrap method (1000 repetitions) and a minimum branch length for optimization at -blmin 1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 nucleotide substitutions per site (subs/site). The tree was rooted between lineages A and B. A time tree was estimated using the maximum likelihood IQ-TREE approach, implementing a least-square dating algorithm (LSD) [23] with a fixed evolutionary rate of 8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 subs/site, as estimated previously [21] , and 1000 parametric bootstrap replicates to obtain confidence intervals in node ages. The genome sequence hCoV-19/Wuhan/WH04/2020|EPI_ISL_406801|2020-01-05 was used as an outgroup, as it falls in a basal position with respect to lineages A and B and it results in a reasonable estimate of the time of emergence (time to the most recent common ancestor, tMRCA). The tMRCA for the global data was between mid-November to late December, which is consistent with other studies and the first reported cases in Wuhan, China [2, 24, 25] . Only clusters with sufficient branch support (SH-aLTR >0.9 or bootstrap >70%) were considered for their tMRCA [26] . Importantly, we validated our estimates of node ages by analysing a subset of the data in BEAST 1.10 [27] . In this case, we used the same substitution model and outgroup as in the maximum likelihood analyses. We chose an exponential coalescent tree prior, with priors on population size and growth rate as in [24] , and an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with an underlying lognormal distribution. The exponential coalescent tree prior matches the expectation that the number of infected individuals overall was growing exponentially, and our choice of the relaxed molecular clock is based on previous studies that found strong statistical support for this model using Bayes factors [24] . To make our analyses comparable to those in LSD, we fixed the mean rate of to the same value used in LSD, while allowing rate variation among branches. We ran a Markov chain Monte Carlo of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 steps sampling every 5000 steps, and we determined sufficient sampling from the posterior by verifying that all parameters had effective samples sizes of at least 500.

A total of 191 viral genomes covering the time period around 29 January to 20 July 2020 have successfully been sequenced and are included here. An additional 460 Italian genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available on GISAID were also included in the analysis. Hence, compared to the UK, from which over 118,000 genomes have been obtained, the genomic data from Italy is extremely limited, and represents only <0.1% of confirmed COVID-19 cases.\nOverall, 62% of all Italian sequences were from Lombardy (n = 406), while 16% (n = 102) were from Abruzzo (Table S1 ). The remaining sequences were scattered across other Italian regions ( Figure 1 ).

Lastly, 12 sequences were available that were sampled after the lockdown restrictions were eased on 3 June. Eight of these (67%) were from infections in Central Italy (Abruzzo).\nPhylogenetic analysis revealed that all but one Italian sequence fell into SARS-CoV-2 lineage B: 50% were classified as lineage B.1 and 40% as B.1.1. Of the remaining sequences, 4% were B.1.5 and another 4% were a mix of numerous other B lineages (Figure 2A) . One sequence was classified as A.2. This was isolated from an infection reported in Lombardy, although no epidemiological data or travel history was available via GISAID (EPI_ISL_542346). One B.2 sequence was sampled as the first locally acquired case in Rome (GISAID EPI_ISL_412974) and the remaining seven B.2 sequences were all from tourists who travelled from Hubei in China and visited Rome [28] .

In particular, we showed that the epidemic started via multiple introductions and the time-scale of these events, particularly that new transmission clusters may have initiated even during the period of nationwide lockdown.\nDespite the limited sequence data available, we identified multiple transmission clusters of Italian sequences scattered across the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny that are indicative of approximately 124 independent introductions into Italy from this limited sample size, including 14 independent introductions into Abruzzo. Similarly, the large number of phylogenetic singleton sequences are also likely indicative of multiple introduction events. Evidence of multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Italy were reported as early as March 2020 [28] , with initial positive cases reported in Rome that were linked to Wuhan but that did not lead to further infections, with the Italian epidemic eventually triggered by a distinct clade with links to other European countries, most likely Germany [12] . This was supported by a subsequent study that showed multiple introductions into North and Central Italy followed by the emergence of clade B.1 [29] . According to our estimates, the tMRCA for the Italian B.1 lineages was between 15-30 January 2020.\nThe majority of the Italian sequences sampled to date represent lineages B.1 (50%) and B.1.1 (40%), with the remaining sequences covering 14 other lineages, most at low frequency. Indeed, 92% of all transmission clusters comprised lineages B.1 and B.1.1. Thus, the overall genetic diversity represented in the Italian sequence data is limited, and it is likely that the rapid and strict lockdown enforced in the Viruses 2020, 12, 1438 9 of 11 country led to a marked genetic bottleneck and lineage extinction. Indeed, only three lineages were present overall after the lockdown restrictions were eased (B.1, B.1.1, and B.1.1.1) , all of which were already present during the lockdown period. Notably, three large clusters (containing 24-37 sequences), all from Lombardy in North Italy, consisted of mainly identical sequences that were sampled within 35 days, implying large-scale local transmission. Similar limited genetic diversity has been described in Iceland with higher sequence coverage, with only seven lineages within their infected population which may reflect the rapid containment by the public health authorities [30] . In contrast, New Zealand reported over 30 lineages and strong evidence for infections linked to travelers rather than community transmission [21] . Although New Zealand similarly implemented a strict lockdown and limited travel to the islands, it is possible that the greater diversity of viruses reflects the fact that it received travelers, and their viruses, from diverse global locations, whereas the Italian outbreak was likely largely seeded from neighbouring European countries. This will need to be confirmed with more sequence data and individual linked travel histories.\nWe found numerous independent transmission clusters scattered across different geographic regions within Italy, suggesting that there were multiple entries of genetically similar lineages and that these were the dominant ones circulating in the source populations at the time early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, we observed that transmission occurred throughout the lockdown period and between the North, Central, and South regions. Notably, for the cluster in Central Italy, the earliest infection was not sampled until 7 April, some 35 days after the estimated tMRCA date on 3 March. Thus, we likely missed infections linking the cluster to earlier transmission events. It is known from case reports that the first positive case in Abruzzo was sampled on 27 February among a tourist visiting from the Lombardy region. Unfortunately, no virus sequence is available for this case. It has also been reported that numerous residents returned to Central Italy from Lombardy and surrounding regions before the nation-wide lockdown was imposed, and we found multiple clusters containing infections from North and Central Italy, indicative of cross-region transmission between these localities (although only one had sufficient support to accurately estimate the tMRCA)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We reported on the limited but ongoing within-region transmission during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy, that the epidemic was seeded by multiple introductions of similar virus lineages into the country, that viruses travelled from North to South on multiple occasions, and that sequences from infections sampled after the lockdown period was eased were sometimes linked to infections from during the lockdown. These features are indicative of ongoing transmission throughout the lockdown period, rather than re-introduction of novel lineages past lockdown. However, it is critical to acknowledge the extremely limited amount of genomic data from Italy compared to many other localities that clearly impacted the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn here. It is therefore vital that Italy build better structures for effective genomic epidemiology prior to any future major outbreaks of emerging infectious disease.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/12/1438/s1, Figure S1 : Phylogenetic analysis of the Italian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in a global context.
