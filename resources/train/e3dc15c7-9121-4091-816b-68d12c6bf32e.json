[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The size of the tropical cyclone (TC) wind field has been used to describe the dimensions of both the inner and outer near-surface wind field (e.g., Brand and Guard 1979;Liu and Chan 1999;Kimball and Mulekar 2004). Despite the similar terminology, discriminating between outer and inner TC size is crucial given their differing variability resulting from differences in their physics and dynamics (e.g., Emanuel 2004;Smith et al. 2009;Chavas et al. 2015). Specifically, inner TC size encompasses the strongest winds and convection near the TC center, which can be approximately characterized as an air-sea flux-driven heat engine modified by the deleterious impacts of environmental vertical wind shear and dry air (e.g., Emanuel 1986;Tang and Emanuel 2010;. In contrast, outer TC size is measured at radii where convection is minimal, and the atmosphere is approximately in radiative-subsidence balance (Emanuel 2004;Chavas et al. 2015;Chavas and Lin 2016).

Supplemental information related to this paper is available at the Journals Online website: https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0630.s1. our understanding of the variability of outer size and the factors that control it remains limited. The present study examines the lifetime evolution of outer TC size and structure for North Atlantic (NA) and western North Pacific (WNP) TCs using data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR; Saha et al. 2010) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) High-Resolution Forecast-Oriented Low Ocean Resolution model (HiFLOR; Murakami et al. 2015). Despite several recent studies of outer size, our current understanding of its lifetime evolution remains uncertain. Specifically, prior work has noted substantial interbasin and intrabasin variability in outer TC size (e.g., Merrill 1984;Chavas and Emanuel 2010;Chan and Chan 2015). These differences in outer size may begin at genesis, with genesis outer size hypothesized to be set by both the outer size of the TC-precursor disturbance (e.g., Rotunno and Emanuel 1987;Cocks and Gray 2002;Lee et al. 2010) and the TC genesis environment (e.g., environmental angular momentum; Merrill 1984;Chan 2012, 2013). However, there have been no prior observational studies of genesis outer size or the factors that may influence it. Moreover, prior work has suggested that most TCs exhibit increases in outer TC size following genesis, but there are inconsistencies in their conclusions ranging between small increases confined to the first two days of the TC lifetime to nearconstant, large increases throughout the TC lifetime (e.g., Merrill 1984;Cocks and Gray 2002;Chavas and Emanuel 2010;Knaff et al. 2014). Near the end of the TC lifetime, prior work has suggested that outer size may exhibit a variety of different changes likely dependent on the storm environment (e.g., environmental baroclinicity; Cocks and Gray 2002;Kimball and Mulekar 2004;Kimball 2006), although there has yet to be a study specifically focused on outer size evolution during the end of the TC lifetime. Even during extratropical transition (ET) or, more generally, TCs that encounter baroclinic environments, prior studies have noted increases in outer size, albeit with substantial interstorm variability that has not been well constrained (Brand and Guard 1979;Hart et al. 2006;Evans and Hart 2008;Maclay et al. 2008). Moreover, many of these prior ET studies have been exclusively confined to the NA and utilized small sample sizes, limiting the broader applicability of their results (e.g., Brand and Guard 1979;Hart et al. 2006). The uncertainties in the lifetime evolution of outer TC size arise from several factors, including 1) the absence of a consistent outer size metric used among studies, which makes it challenging to intercompare results; 2) the use of limited sample sizes; 3) a focus upon specific TC subsets; and most importantly, 4) the shortage of observational studies focused on the lifetime evolution of outer TC size (Merrill 1984;Cocks and Gray 2002). The lack of observational studies is due to the inability of observational datasets to homogenously sample the TC wind field or uniformly sample outer TC size throughout the storm lifetime for a large quantity of storms (e.g., ;30% of TCs sampled by scatterometers; Brand and Guard 1979;Liu and Chan 1999;Chan and Chan 2012). Moreover, several of the previously used datasets are derived partially from subjective analyses, which may introduce a priori biases in outer TC size estimates (e.g., Brand and Guard 1979;Merrill 1984;Kimball and Mulekar 2004). Given these uncertainties, there is a need for an analysis that utilizes a relatively large, observationally constrained, objective dataset to investigate the lifetime evolution of outer TC size and structure. The present study utilizes an outer size dataset derived from a reanalysis (NCEP CFSR) for all observed TCs, which has been shown to strongly agree with observationally based outer TC size data (Schenkel et al. 2017). The advantages of this CFSR-derived outer TC size dataset compared to earlier studies include 1) spatiotemporal homogeneity in data coverage over the entire TC wind field for observed TCs, 2) consistent representation of TCs in time because of the use of a fixed global numerical weather prediction model and data assimilation system that assimilates historical observations (Thorne and Vose 2010;Bosilovich et al. 2013;Parker 2016), and 3) availability of at least 30 years of data with 6-h temporal resolution. We complement our CFSR dataset with one derived from a high-resolution current-climate model simulation (GFDL HiFLOR) containing a realistic representation of TC frequency, intensity, and structure (Murakami et al. 2015(Murakami et al. , 2016. Specific complementary advantages of HiFLOR over the CFSR include 1) a larger TC sample size (i.e., 55% more years of data), 2) the absence of potential spurious behavior in reanalyses introduced by spatiotemporal changes in the observing system (e.g., Manning and Hart 2007;Thorne and Vose 2010;Parker 2016), and 3) finer grid spacing (i.e., HiFLOR horizontal grid spacing is half of CFSR). The HiFLOR simulation also has its deficiencies, namely, the absence of a strong observational constraint on TC activity and the large-scale atmosphere resulting in nontrivial biases in TC intensity, frequency, and track (e.g., Murakami et al. 2015). However, it is unclear how, if at all, these biases feed back onto the HiFLOR outer TC size distribution. Specifically, the biases in HiFLOR TC intensity likely do not impact outer TC size given that the two do not vary strongly with one another (e.g., Merrill 1984;Chavas and Emanuel 2010;Chavas et al. 2016). Moreover, while outer size does vary with both TC latitude and longitude (e.g., Merrill 1984;Chavas and Emanuel 2010;Chan and Chan 2015), it is unclear which physical mechanisms govern these spatial variations and, hence, how TC track biases may impact the distribution of the outer wind field structure and size in HiFLOR. In contrast to HiFLOR, the strong observational constraint imposed by the data assimilation system of the CFSR provides a complementary benefit over this weakness of HiFLOR (Saha et al. 2010). Despite the absence of assimilated observations, HiFLOR can provide a reasonable representation of TC structure for the present climate (e.g., Murakami et al. 2015Murakami et al. , 2016. Together, agreement between these datasets provides substantially greater confidence in our analysis compared to analyzing these datasets in isolation from one another given their respective biases. Leveraging the large sample sizes from the NCEP CFSR reanalysis and the GFDL HiFLOR simulation, the present study provides a statistical examination of the lifetime evolution of outer TC size and wind structure in the NA and WNP. Considering the uncertainties in prior work, this study will address the following questions: d How does outer TC size at genesis compare to that during the rest of the TC lifetime? d How does outer TC size evolve to its peak, and how does it change thereafter? d How does outer TC size evolve during ET? d Is the lifetime evolution of outer size different between NA and WNP TCs? This study will address these questions by examining outer TC size and structure during three lifetime milestones to facilitate intercomparing TCs with different lifetime durations (Cocks and Gray 2002;Chan and Chan 2012): 1) genesis, 2) time of lifetime maximum outer size, and 3) end of TC lifetime. This work provides the foundation for follow-up statistical modeling of the evolution of outer size and analysis of potentially influential environmental variables. The remainder of this manuscript is divided into three parts. Section 2 describes the data and methods used, section 3 presents the results, and section 4 provides a discussion and conclusion."}, {"section_title": "Data and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "a. Best track TC data", "text": "Best track data are employed to locate TCs in the CFSR. The present study examines NA and WNP TCs from 1979 to 2010 in version 3, revision 9, of the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS; Knapp et al. 2010). National Hurricane Center data are used for NA TCs, while Joint Typhoon Warning Center data are used for WNP TCs. NA and WNP TCs are chosen based on prior work demonstrating that reanalysis TC intensity, track, and outer TC structure are sufficiently well represented in these two basins (e.g., Schenkel and Hart 2012;Murakami 2014;Hodges et al. 2017;Schenkel et al. 2017) and to avoid the greater uncertainty of IBTrACS data in other TC basins (e.g., Landsea et al. 2006). Only those storms with a maximum azimuthal-mean 10-m azimuthal wind y max * greater than or equal to 15 m s 21 are examined, with y max * defined as (Chavas and Lin 2016)  where V max,IB is the IBTrACS maximum 10-m wind speed, and V trans,IB is the IBTrACS TC translation speed. The variable y max * is used instead of V max,IB for two reasons: 1) to exclude weak TCs embedded in strong environmental steering flows and 2) because of its greater relevance to existing TC intensity theory (Chavas and Lin 2016;Chavas et al. 2016). The analysis also excludes all 6-h IBTrACS data in which the TC is over land."}, {"section_title": "b. TC wind field datasets", "text": "To provide multidecadal estimates of outer TC size and structure, data are derived from both the NCEP CFSR and GFDL HiFLOR. Table 1 provides salient details for both the CFSR and HiFLOR. The CFSR provides outer TC size and wind field data for IBTrACS TCs. The CFSR is a 0.58 3 0.58 6-h, 32-yr (1979-2010) reanalysis dataset (Saha et al. 2010). It is chosen because of its better representation of IBTrACS TC position and intensity (Schenkel and Hart 2012;Murakami 2014;Hodges et al. 2017;Schenkel et al. 2017) and of observed outer TC size and structure, despite the underestimation of inner-core winds (i.e., radius , 300 km; Schenkel et al. 2017). Given that nontrivial position differences occasionally arise between IBTrACS and the CFSR (e.g., Schenkel and Hart 2012;Murakami 2014;Hodges et al. 2017), the 6-h location of each reanalysis TC is determined by using the IBTrACS location as a first guess before determining the final reanalysis TC location. The final TC location is calculated using the mean of the centers of mass for six different variables: mean sea level pressure; 925-, 850-, and 700-hPa relative vorticity; and 850-and 700-hPa geopotential height (e.g., Marchok 2002;Brammer 2017;Schenkel et al. 2017). CFSR TC genesis is defined, using IBTrACS data, as the first 6-h point at which y max * $ 15 m s 21 , while being subjectively classified as a TC in IBTrACS. Outer TC size data are also obtained from the HiFLOR model, which provides 50 years of 6-h data on a ;25 km 3 ;25 km grid (Murakami et al. 2015). HiFLOR is a coupled climate model forced with 1995 radiative forcing conditions and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) nudged on a 5-day restoring time scale toward a monthly varying climatological SST derived from the Met Office Hadley Centre SSTs averaged between 1986 and 2005 (Rayner et al. 2003). HiFLOR represents one of the first climate model simulations with realistic TC frequency, intensity, and structure (Murakami et al. 2015(Murakami et al. , 2016. HiFLOR does not replicate any specific historical TC but rather provides dynamically consistent realizations of TC activity given current-climate conditions. HiFLOR TCs are tracked using a combination of closed mean sea level pressure contours and upper-tropospheric temperature anomalies (Murakami et al. 2015;Harris et al. 2016;Murakami et al. 2016). Like Murakami et al. (2015), TC genesis in HiFLOR is defined as the start time of at least 24 consecutive hours of the TC attaining both an uppertropospheric warm core and y max * $ 15 m s 21 ."}, {"section_title": "c. Outer TC size metric", "text": "The outer TC size metric utilized in this study is the radius at which the azimuthal-mean 10-m azimuthal wind equals 8 m s 21 (r 8 ). In addition to being similar to previously used outer TC size metrics (Chavas and Emanuel 2010;Chavas et al. 2016Chavas et al. , 2017, r 8 is chosen because it is represented with the greatest fidelity in the CFSR compared to observations (Schenkel et al. 2017). The results for r 8 are applicable across a variety of outer size metrics [e.g., radius of azimuthal-mean near-surface azimuthal wind equals 17 m s 21 (r 17 )] as shown in a supplemental figure constructed using r 17 from HiFLOR (Fig. S1 in the online supplemental material) and implied in radial profiles of azimuthal wind shown later. The term r 8 is derived from both the CFSR and HiFLOR as follows (Chavas and Vigh 2014;Schenkel et al. 2017): 1) 10-m total wind vectors are interpolated to a TC-centered polar coordinate system; 2) the environmental wind is removed from the total wind field, with the environmental wind empirically estimated as the TC translation vector rotated 208 cyclonically and reduced by a factor of 0.55 (Lin and Chavas 2012); 3) the azimuthal-mean azimuthal wind field is computed excluding land grid points; 4) the azimuthal-mean azimuthal wind is interpolated to a uniformly spaced radial grid with a resolution that is 0.5 times the horizontal grid spacing of the input data; and 5) r 8 is extracted from the radial profile only for TCs that have missing data radially inwards of r 8 over the equivalent of two consecutive CFSR grid points (i.e., ;100 km) or less (Schenkel et al. 2017). The present study focuses on examining those TCs in which r 8 is consistently defined throughout the TC lifetime, with the corresponding sample sizes provided in Table 2."}, {"section_title": "d. ET definition", "text": "The start and end time of ET in the present study is defined using the cyclone phase space , which is computed from CFSR and HiFLOR data. In the cyclone phase space, ET start is defined as when the lowertropospheric thermal asymmetry parameter B exceeds an empirically defined value of 10 m, indicative that the TC has acquired a frontal structure (i.e., warm, moist air located to the east and cold, dry air located to the west of a poleward-moving TC), while the lower-tropospheric thermal wind parameter 2V T L exceeds 0, suggestive of a cyclone with a lower-tropospheric warm core (i.e., geostrophic wind speed decreasing with height associated with a warm, moist lower troposphere). The end of ET occurs when the lower-tropospheric warm core finally transitions to a cold core (2V T L , 0; i.e., geostrophic wind speed increasing with height associated with a cold, dry lower troposphere; Hart 2003; Evans and Hart 2003; Kitabatake 2011). The cyclone phase parameters in the CFSR are calculated from data at 50-hPa intervals from 900 to 600 hPa, while HiFLOR computations use only available data at 850 and 500 hPa, which may yield slightly earlier ET start and end times (Liu et al. 2017). The present study also employs two additional criteria when defining ET. First, the TC must continuously maintain a warm core for two days prior to ET start or from genesis to ET start for TCs with lifetimes shorter TABLE 1.

Second, reanalysis TCs that attain a lower-tropospheric cold core prior to or upon attaining frontal structure (B . 10) are not considered here, since this structural evolution is due to underresolved reanalysis TC structure rather than ET processes (e.g., Evans and Hart 2003; Kitabatake 2011; Wood and Ritchie 2014). These two criteria together with the exclusion of overland cases and the inclusion of only those cases where r 8 is continuously defined reduces the number of ET cases, which are given in Table 2. While our use of an axisymmetric framework for studying changes in the outer TC wind structure does not account for the development of wind field asymmetries during ET, prior work has shown that these asymmetries only begin to strongly manifest themselves at or after the completion of ET (e.g., Evans and Hart 2008;Loridan et al. 2014Loridan et al. , 2015, suggesting that our axisymmetric framework is suitable for studying ET cases."}, {"section_title": "Dataset", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "e.

Overview of lifetime evolution of outer TC size", "text": "Representative case studies of the lifetime evolution of r 8 are provided for the CFSR and HiFLOR in the NA (Fig. 1a) and WNP (Fig. 1b). The NA cases in both the CFSR and HiFLOR (Fig. 1a) exhibit growth in r 8 during most of their lifetimes, exhibiting peak values that are over 50% larger than their genesis r 8 . In contrast, WNP cases in both the CFSR and HiFLOR (Fig. 1b) initially grow more rapidly, with peak values occurring earlier (i.e., near the TC lifetime midpoint) before undergoing large decreases in r 8 . The WNP HiFLOR case serves as an example of the nontrivial fraction of TCs that exhibit their largest growth in r 8 during the first several days of their lifetime, similar to prior work (Chavas and Emanuel 2010;Smith et al. 2011;Chavas and Lin 2016). The composited lifetime evolution of r 8 from the CFSR and HiFLOR is plotted in normalized coordinates and binned according to normalized age for TCs with short, normal, and long lifetimes in the NA (Figs. 2a,b) and WNP ( Figs. 2c,d). Similar to the representative case studies, NA TCs with normal and long lifetimes grow throughout their life cycles and reach peak values near the end of their lifetimes in the CFSR and HiFLOR, similar to prior analyses of NA storms (e.g., Merrill 1984;Kossin et al. 2007;Knaff et al. 2014). Peak median r 8 in the NA ranges between 1.25 and 1.49 times its first quartile r 8 in the CFSR and between 1.45 and 1.65 times the first quartile r 8 in HiFLOR. In the WNP, TCs with normal and long lifetimes in the CFSR and HiFLOR grow at a faster normalized rate compared to the NA primarily during the first half of their lifetimes, reaching peak r 8 around the midpoint of their lifetimes and decreasing thereafter. Peak median r 8 for WNP TCs is smaller in normalized magnitude in the CFSR (1.15-1.33 times the first quartile r 8 ) and HiFLOR (1.30-1.46 times the first quartile r 8 ) relative to the NA. The midpoint lifetime peak in r 8 contrasts with the near-constant increase in WNP outer TC size shown by Cocks and Gray (2002), which employed subjectively derived outer size estimates. Finally, short-lived TCs in both basins exhibit marginal or even negligible changes in r 8 during their lifetimes. These results suggest that most NA TCs exhibit growth in r 8 throughout much of their lifetimes, while the majority of WNP TCs exhibit growth until a midpoint lifetime peak followed by substantial decreases. The interbasin and intrabasin differences in the lifetime evolution of r 8 may suggest the importance of the TC environment (e.g., Merrill 1984;Liu and Chan 1999;Chan 2012, 2013). Alternatively, internal dynamical factors cannot be ruled out given that the increases in r 8 coincide with TC intensification (not shown), especially during the 1-2 days following genesis (e.g., Chavas and Emanuel 2010;Knaff et al. 2014;Chavas and Lin 2016). For WNP TCs, the midlifetime maximum in r 8 appears consistent with a subtropical peak attributed to the interaction between increasing vortex inertial stability and increasing environmental angular momentum (e.g., Smith et al. 2011;Chan 2013, 2014). Moreover, the interbasin differences in r 8 evolution may be explained by stronger, lowerlatitude meridional gradients of the environmental thermodynamic variables relevant to r 8 in the WNP (e.g., relative humidity, potential intensity ;Emanuel 1986;Kimball 2006;Hill and Lackmann 2009;Chavas and Emanuel 2014). Finally, these results suggest that TC age (i.e., time since genesis) is not a strong proxy for the factors that control outer size, in contrast to Kossin et al. (2007), as supported by negligible (WNP) to weakly (NA) positive correlations in both the CFSR and HiFLOR (Table 3). b. Outer TC size evolution from genesis to maximum value The present section focuses on the interstorm variability in r 8 evolution between genesis and lifetime maximum r 8 by examining joint histograms of these two quantities from CFSR and HiFLOR TCs in the NA (Figs. 3a,b) and WNP (Figs. 3c,d). Both the variability and magnitude of lifetime maximum r 8 are larger than at genesis, with median r 8 increasing by 60% in both basins within the CFSR and HiFLOR. Such a result agrees with the higher end of r 8 growth estimates from prior work (e.g., Merrill 1984;Cocks and Gray 2002;Chan and Chan 2014). Moderate positive correlations exist between genesis and lifetime maximum r 8 (Table 3) in the NA and WNP, suggesting that genesis r 8 imparts some memory into the later stages of the TC lifetime, similar to prior work (e.g., Rotunno and Emanuel 1987;Cocks and Gray 2002;Lee et al. 2010). With regards to interbasin differences, WNP r 8 is larger and exhibits greater variability during both genesis and lifetime maximum r 8 (Figs. 3c,d) compared to the NA (Figs. 3a,b), suggesting that the previously observed interbasin differences (e.g., Merrill 1984;Liu and Chan 1999; Chavas and Emanuel 2010; Chan and Chan 2015) begin at genesis. In particular, median genesis r 8 for WNP TCs is ;35% larger in both the CFSR and HiFLOR compared to NA TCs, with similar differences found at lifetime maximum r 8 . Radial profiles of the azimuthal-mean 10-m azimuthal winds in a normalized radial coordinate system are also presented for NA (Figs. 4a,b) and WNP TCs (Figs. 4c,d) in the CFSR and HiFLOR during genesis and lifetime maximum r 8 . The wind speed is consistently greater at all radii for lifetime maximum r 8 compared to genesis r 8 . The results presented here suggest that the outer TC wind field broadens over time for most TCs in the NA and WNP. Moreover, the previously documented larger outer size of WNP TCs relative to the NA begins at genesis. The broader genesis r 8 distribution in the WNP may be reflective of the greater variety of WNP TC-precursor disturbances with differing horizontal length scales (e.g., monsoon gyre, genesis may be a response to TC translation into dynamic and thermodynamic environments supportive of larger r 8 , especially given the large quantities of angular momentum necessitated to support the expansion of the TC wind field (e.g., Merrill 1984;Smith et al. 2011;Chan and Chan 2013). Alternatively, r 8 expansion may be related to the spinup of the TC wind field following genesis (e.g., Chavas and Emanuel 2010;Smith et al. 2011;Chavas and Lin 2016)."}, {"section_title": "2) TIME SCALES OF OUTER SIZE CHANGES FROM GENESIS TO LIFETIME MAXIMUM VALUE", "text": "The time scales of these changes in r 8 are examined using joint histograms of the timing of lifetime maximum r 8 versus the difference between lifetime maximum r 8 and genesis r 8 for NA (Figs. 5a,b) and WNP TCs (Figs. 5c,d). Both basins show that a later onset of lifetime maximum r 8 is associated with larger r 8 increases in the CFSR and HiFLOR, which is also supported by moderate to strong positive correlations (Table 3). WNP TCs exhibit larger r 8 growth rates (median of 59 km day 21 in CFSR and 54 km day 21 in HiFLOR) compared to the NA (median of 37 km day 21 in CFSR and 35 km day 21 in HiFLOR), consistent with larger growth for WNP TCs despite their earlier onset of lifetime maximum r 8 . Shorter time-scale variability in r 8 is examined via box-and-whisker plots and kernel density estimates of the 1-day rate of r 8 change (dr 8 /dt) for the NA (Figs. 6a,  b) and WNP (Figs. 6c,d). The dr 8 /dt distribution is approximately normally distributed but skewed toward positive values for NA and WNP TCs, consistent with the overall growth of r 8 . Compared to the NA, the WNP exhibits dr 8 /dt that is more positive with a broader range. These results suggest that WNP TCs grow more rapidly over a shorter period of time than NA TCs. The earlier onset of lifetime maximum r 8 for WNP TCs compared to the NA may be due to their larger genesis r 8 coupled with the greater r 8 growth rate, yielding a quicker approach to the maximum r 8 supported by the environment as suggested by prior work (Chavas and Emanuel 2014;Held and Zhao 2008;Khairoutdinov and Emanuel 2013). The interbasin differences in growth rates and duration of growth may indicate that the salient physical processes may be subjected to differing degrees of forcing in each basin due to differences in the environment (e.g., meridional gradient in environmental relative humidity; Hill and Lackmann 2009;Kimball 2006;Wang 2009)."}, {"section_title": "3) ASSOCIATION OF OUTER SIZE CHANGES WITH TC TRACK ATTRIBUTES", "text": "The variability in r 8 evolution between genesis and lifetime maximum r 8 with TC track attributes is examined by comparing the box-and-whisker plots of the zonal (Fig. 7a) and meridional ( Fig. 7b) distance traveled prior to lifetime maximum r 8 and timing of lifetime maximum r 8 (Fig. 7c) for TCs that undergo the largest and smallest r 8 changes. TCs exhibiting the largest increases in r 8 traverse both greater zonal and meridional distances prior to lifetime maximum r 8 and exhibit later onsets of lifetime maximum r 8 in the CFSR and HiFLOR within both basins, with all three relationships supported by moderate-to-strong positive correlations (Table 3). Plan view plots of genesis and track density are shown for the NA (Fig. 8) and WNP ( Fig. 9) for TCs that undergo the largest and smallest r 8 changes between genesis and lifetime maximum r 8 . WNP TCs that undergo the largest r 8 changes form farther south and east of TCs exhibiting the smallest changes, while no such relationship exists for NA storms. Moreover, the TCs that exhibit the largest r 8 changes are longer lived, traverse a broader latitude band, and cluster into tracks reminiscent of recurving TCs, which is further supported by both the weak to moderate correlations (Table 3) and prior studies (e.g., Merrill 1984;Lee et al. 2010;Knaff et al. 2014). These results may suggest that those long-lived TCs with recurving track types are associated with the largest r 8 growth in both basins. Such a result may not be surprising given the slow-varying nature of outer size (e.g., Weatherford and Gray 1988;Merrill 1984;Chavas and Emanuel 2010;Chavas and Lin 2016). Recurving TCs may undergo the largest r 8 increases in response to reaching higher latitudes, which may provide the most favorable environments for outer size changes (e.g., WNP subtropics; Smith et al. 2011;Chan and Chan 2013;Chavas and Emanuel 2014;Chan and Chan 2015). Finally, the tendency for TCs exhibiting the largest r 8 growth to cluster into recurving track types may suggest that the phenomena that influence the TC track and lifetime (e.g., El The change in r 8 near the end of the TC lifetime is examined using joint histograms of lifetime maximum r 8 versus the end-of-lifetime r 8 for NA (Figs. 10a,b) and WNP TCs (Figs. 10c,d).

(2014; objective size estimates), such a result contrasts with increasing outer size at the end of the TC lifetime for most TCs shown in Cocks and Gray (2002; subjective size estimates). TCs with large lifetime maximum r 8 also remain at the larger end of the r 8 distribution at the end of the TC lifetime (and vice versa) in both datasets within each basin, as shown through moderate-to-strong positive correlations (Table 3). However, larger lifetime maximum r 8 values are also associated with larger decreases in r 8 during the end of the TC lifetime (and vice versa) in both basins, as shown through weak to moderate correlations (Table 3). This relationship is consistent with NA and WNP end-of-lifetime r 8 being comparable despite r 8 being larger for WNP TCs during the earlier stages of the TC lifetime. To supplement Fig. 10, radial profiles of the azimuthalmean 10-m azimuthal wind in normalized radial coordinates are shown during lifetime maximum r 8 and FIG. 6.

In both basins, azimuthal winds decrease during the end of the TC lifetime at outer radii, especially between 0.5 # r/(lifetime maximum r 8 ) # 1.5, suggestive of a spindown of the entire TC wind field at lifetime end. Together, these results suggest that TCs in both basins exhibit nontrivial end-of-lifetime decreases in r 8 associated with the weakening of the TC wind field. Assuming poleward movement of the TC, the decrease in r 8 prior to their end of lifetime may be forced by the increasing inertial stability of the vortex and associated reduced efficiency of environmental angular momentum fluxes in changing outer size, which occurs poleward of subtropical latitudes (e.g., Smith et al. 2011;Chan 2013, 2014). Alternatively, r 8 decreases could be attributed to decreases in relative humidity as TCs move into the subtropics and midlatitudes. Perhaps because of larger TCs exhibiting greater decreases in r 8 at the end of the TC lifetime, genesis r 8 appears to have little bearing upon end-of-lifetime maximum r 8 as shown through weak positive correlations between the two quantities (Table 3), which contrasts with prior work (e.g., Rotunno and Emanuel 1987;Cocks and Gray 2002;Lee et al. 2010)."}, {"section_title": "2) TIME SCALES OF OUTER SIZE CHANGES FROM MAXIMUM VALUE TO END OF LIFETIME", "text": "The time scales of the change in r 8 between its maximum value and end of lifetime is shown using joint histograms of r 8 change versus the time of change for NA (Figs. 12a,b) and WNP TCs (Figs. 12c,d). TCs that exist for longer durations following lifetime maximum r 8 undergo larger decreases in r 8 , which is also supported by weak to moderate correlations between the two quantities in the CFSR and HiFLOR in both basins (Table 3). During the end of lifetime, the rate of r 8 change is larger for WNP TCs (mean 237 km day 21 in CFSR and 239 km day 21 in HiFLOR) compared to NA TCs (mean 227 km day 21 in CFSR and 223 km day 21 in HiFLOR). In both basins, these rates of r 8 decay are smaller in magnitude than growth rates of r 8 that occur prior to lifetime maximum r 8 . WNP TCs also exhibit a longer duration of r 8 decreases than NA TCs in both the CFSR and HiFLOR. Finer time-scale variability is also provided by examining the distribution of dr 8 /dt (1-day rate of r 8 change) during the end of the TC lifetime (Fig. 6). On this short time scale, the vast majority of dr 8 /dt values are negative in both the NA and WNP for CFSR and HiFLOR TCs. Compared to the NA, values of dr 8 /dt for WNP TCs are shifted toward more negative values. These results suggest that WNP TCs exhibit decreases in r 8 that are both larger in magnitude and longer lived than their NA counterparts following lifetime maximum r 8 . In the NA, these decreases in r 8 occur near the last few days of the TC lifetime as shown in the representative case studies discussed earlier (Fig. 1a) but not in the composited lifetime plots of r 8 (Figs. 2a,b) because of the relatively large temporal bin width used. These interbasin differences in end-oflifetime r 8 decreases may reflect stronger, lowerlatitude meridional gradients of potential intensity and its component variables in the WNP (e.g., Emanuel 1986Emanuel , 1987Chavas and Emanuel 2014), which have been linked to outer size changes. Further differences in the environmental forcing for r 8 may be demonstrated by the stronger baroclinic growth rate and its FIG. 7. Box-and-whisker plot of the (a) meridional distance (km) and (b) zonal distance (km) traveled between lifetime maximum r 8 and genesis r 8 and (c) onset of lifetime maximum r 8 (days since TC genesis) for NA CFSR, NA HiFLOR, WNP CFSR, and WNP HiFLOR TCs in the lower and upper tercile of the difference between lifetime maximum r 8 and genesis r 8 .

Last, the longer duration of r 8 decreases in the WNP may be partially reflective of their larger lifetime maximum outer size compared to the NA, which may result in longer dissipation times upon reaching an unfavorable environment for intensification (e.g., Chen et al. 2011;Carrasco et al. 2014).

Outer TC size evolution during ET", "text": "The final results section examines r 8 changes during ET, starting with joint histograms of r 8 during the day prior to ET versus centered on the end of ET for NA (Figs. 13a,b) and WNP TCs (Figs. 13c,d). In the NA, both the CFSR and HiFLOR show negligible changes in r 8 during ET, while disagreement exists regarding WNP r 8 evolution between the CFSR (small decreases in r 8 during ET) and HiFLOR (no change). The absence of r 8 changes during ET in the NA and, to a lesser degree, the WNP may be partially attributable to the short duration of ET in both the NA (median of 1 day in CFSR and 1.50 days in HiFLOR) and WNP (median of 1.50 days in CFSR and 1.25 days in HiFLOR), consistent with prior work (e.g., Evans and Hart 2003;Kitabatake 2011), coupled with the slow response of the outer wind field to environmental forcing (e.g., Weatherford and Gray 1988;Merrill 1984;Chavas and Emanuel 2010;Chavas and Lin 2016). Both the CFSR and HiFLOR show that WNP TCs are larger than NA TCs prior to ET onset. Radial profiles of the azimuthal-mean 10-m azimuthal wind in normalized coordinates are provided prior to the start and at the end of ET for NA (Figs. 14a,b) and WNP TCs (Figs. 14c,d). NA TCs exhibit marginal increases in azimuthal winds during ET at outer radii [r/(pre-ET r 8 ) . 0.75] in both the CFSR and HiFLOR, although these increases in azimuthal winds are not associated with statistically meaningful changes in r 8 for NA ET cases in either the CFSR or HiFLOR. Consistent with the r 8 results for WNP TCs, the CFSR shows decreased azimuthal winds at almost all radii [r/(pre-ET r 8 ) . Together, these results show that NA TCs exhibit little change in outer structure during ET, while WNP TCs either exhibit a spindown of the TC wind field or no change, depending on the dataset examined. These results disagree with prior assertions that outer size increases for most TCs during ET (e.g., Brand and Guard 1979;Hart et al. 2006;Evans and Hart 2008), although FIG. 10. As in Fig. 3, but for lifetime maximum r 8 (km) vs end-of-lifetime r 8 (km). these prior studies contain uncertainties associated with the absence of statistical testing and small ET sample sizes. Indeed, only a small fraction of cases exhibit their peak r 8 during ET in the NA (17% in CFSR and 33% in HiFLOR) and WNP (5% in CFSR and 10% in HiFLOR). Also, for NA TCs, neither r 8 nor its rate of change for ET cases is larger relative to non-ET cases at the end of their lifetimes for both the CFSR and Hi-FLOR. WNP ET and non-ET TCs, however, show differing results between the CFSR and HiFLOR, with the CFSR showing no differences between ET and non-ET storms and HiFLOR suggesting that ET r 8 is larger and its rate of change is less likely to be negative at the end of their lifetimes compared to non-ET cases. The lack of r 8 growth during ET may be due to outer TC size at ET start being comparable, or even larger (e.g., WNP CFSR TCs), than extratropical cyclone outer size (e.g., Nielsen and Dole 1992;Simmonds 2000;Rudeva and Gulev 2007) or that statistically meaningful changes in r 8 only begin to occur following the ET end (e.g., Brand and Guard 1979;Hart et al. 2006;Evans and Hart 2008). The absence of increases in r 8 during ET may not be surprising given that the Rossby radius of deformation should decrease during ET (assuming poleward TC motion) because of increases in planetary vorticity, decreases in the depth of the troposphere, and the spindown of the inner-core circulation of the TC (e.g., Hart and Evans 2001;Jones et al. 2003;Hart et al. 2006). The absence of increases in r 8 during ET may suggest that the structural changes that occur during ET (e.g., development of warm conveyor belt; Evans and Hart 2008) are no more efficient at importing angular momentum and spinning up the outer TC circulation than the secondary circulation of the TC (e.g., Merrill 1984;Smith et al. 2011;Chavas and Emanuel 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Summary and discussion", "text": "The present study examines the lifetime evolution of outer TC size (r 8 ) and structure for NA and WNP TCs using reanalysis data (CFSR) to represent IBTrACS TCs and high-resolution climate model data (HiFLOR). The analysis examines representative case studies followed by the composite lifetime evolution of r 8 . The interstorm variability of r 8 and outer structure is also examined during three milestones of TC lifetime: genesis, the onset of lifetime maximum r 8 , and end of lifetime. Specific focus is placed on examining the time scales of these r 8 changes and their association with certain TC track types as proxies for environmental factors. Finally, we examine the evolution of the outer TC wind field during ET. We find that r 8 substantially increases throughout most of the TC lifetime for the majority of NA TCs. In comparison, WNP TCs exhibit greater r 8 growth rates, an earlier lifetime peak in r 8 , and larger decreases in r 8 at the end of the TC lifetime. In both basins, TCs with short lifetimes exhibit marginal or negligible changes in r 8 . These results contrast with prior work suggesting small increases in outer size (Merrill 1984;Chavas and Emanuel 2010) or increases in outer size throughout the entire TC lifetime (Cocks and Gray 2002). Compared to the NA, WNP TCs are systematically larger until the end of their lifetimes. More specifically, increases in r 8 following genesis in both basins are symptomatic of an expansion of the TC wind field. TCs with a later onset of their peak r 8 tend to be larger TCs. The longest-lived TCs in both basins, especially those recurving TCs, also exhibit the largest growth in r 8 . These results may suggest some inherent predictability of r 8 given the large-scale environmental controls on TC genesis and track features. The decrease in r 8 following lifetime maximum r 8 in both the NA and WNP is associated with the contraction of the outer TC wind field. In addition to exhibiting more rapid decreases in r 8 compared to the NA, these declines occur over a longer duration in the WNP. While genesis outer size imparts some memory upon FIG. 12. As in Fig. 3, but for difference between onset of end of lifetime and lifetime maximum r 8 (days) vs the difference between end-of-lifetime r 8 and lifetime maximum r 8 (km). The black solid line denotes the simple linear regression equation between the two quantities with the corresponding equation given in each joint histogram. outer size during the early parts of the TC lifetime, it has relatively little bearing on the end-of-lifetime outer size, which disagrees with previous studies (e.g., Rotunno and Emanuel 1987;Cocks and Gray 2002;Lee et al. 2010). Finally, we have shown that ET is not associated with substantial changes in r 8 in the NA, while WNP ET cases either exhibit decreases or negligible changes in r 8 . These results contrast with the increases in outer size during ET noted in prior work (e.g., Brand and Guard 1979;Hart et al. 2006;Evans and Hart 2008). The absence of outer size changes during ET suggests that the ET processes are no more efficient at broadening the outer TC wind field than purely tropical processes. Together, these results provide one of the first comprehensive analyses of the lifetime evolution of r 8 and its variability within and among basins. The strong agreement between the two independent datasets used in this study instills greater confidence in our results compared to examining each dataset in isolation from one another and suggests that their respective biases do not impact our results. However, the environmental factors that influence the lifetime variability of outer size remain unclear. The more rapid changes in outer size along with the earlier lifetime peak at lower latitudes in the WNP compared to the NA (e.g., Chan 2012, 2015;Chavas and Lin 2016) may reflect interbasin differences in their large-scale environment. Moreover, the variability in the lifetime evolution of outer size may be reflective of several environmental factors simultaneously influencing outer size (e.g., angular momentum, relative humidity; Merrill 1984;Hill and Lackmann 2009;Chan and Chan 2013), similar to the evolution of TC intensity (e.g., SSTs, vertical wind shear; Emanuel 1986;Tang and Emanuel 2010;. Ongoing work is leveraging these results to address these outstanding issues.
