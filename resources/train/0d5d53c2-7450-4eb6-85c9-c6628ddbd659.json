[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Recent cooperative theoretical literature has focused on membership heterogeneity in understanding cooperative sustainability long-term [1]. Despite the significance of membership heterogeneity in advancing the theoretical understanding of cooperative sustainability, the empirical attention has not been comparable. This is in part due to lack of data on cooperative membership heterogeneity and/or limited empirical methods that can advance our understanding. An ideal dataset to conduct an empirical examination of cooperative membership heterogeneity on cooperative performance is not presently available. However, demographic and financial information on farm producers who reported they received a cooperative patronage or had equity in a cooperative has been collected in the USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) since 1996. Additionally, the ARMS survey collects a number of other variables that have been largely posited to be associated with cooperative membership heterogeneity that would affect cooperative sustainability [2]. Moreover, recent developments in machine learning methods have enabled researchers to examine high dimensional data, and make accurate statistical inferences concerning variables with low explanatory power due to aggregation issues [3][4]. Specifically, random forest ensemble methods have been found to be substantially more powerful in understanding treatment effect heterogeneity compared to classical methods [5][6]. We aim to use random forest methods to understand the treatment effect to cooperative membership heterogeneity on cooperative sustainability if membership heterogeneity was more or less. Using random forests, we can better account for the interactions, non-linearities, and hidden effects that membership heterogeneity may have in predicting cooperative sustainability long-term --particularly in the presence of irrelevant and strongly relevant covariates. We used annual aggregated data at the state level due to the limited availability of more detailed data on cooperatives and their membership makeup. We combined multiple farm and socioeconomic variables of cooperative membership and non-cooperative membership heterogeneity at the state level from the ARMS data with the long historical series of farmer cooperative membership, gross business volume, and number of cooperatives headquartered in a state that is maintained by the USDA-Rural Development [7]. We employed the random forest method to draw statistical inferences of variables associated with membership heterogeneity in order to advance our understanding of the effects to cooperative sustainability at an aggregated level. We aim to understand: 1) the effects to cooperative sustainability due to heterogeneity of cooperative membership, 2) changes to cooperative members and participation due to membership heterogeneity, and 3) assess the effect of membership heterogeneity on long-term cooperative sustainability. We included other variables that may have an equal impact on cooperative sustainability long-term. These variables include changes in prices for farm products, food and feed products, consumer products, and data on the amount of value added by industry derived by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in estimating U.S. state GDP [8]. The findings of our study in general show that membership heterogeneity plays a lesser role compared to regional variables in understanding cooperative gross business volume at the state level. This may be in part due to cooperatives have established themselves in industries and regions for providing goods and services at competitive prices. Furthermore, we find that value addition at the farm is correlated with greater cooperative business volume at the state level. However, we draw no conclusions on causality in this analysis. The correlation is consistent with the theoretical notion that cooperatives are able to return greater value to the farm than would be expected in oligopsony or oligopoly markets. The finding is also consistent with the notion that cooperatives are sustainable long-term despite the potential for intra-cooperative issues. We do find stronger evidence that membership heterogeneity plays an important role in understanding the future makeup and number of cooperatives long-term. For example, the model that was generated indicates that farmer cooperative member mean socioeconomic (SES) status is inversely related to the number of cooperative members and the number of cooperatives headquartered in a state. Indeed, states where cooperative members have greater mean socioeconomic status we observe greater degrees of cooperative consolidation and cooperative member declines. Moreover, cooperative members SES diversity was found to be inversely related to the number of cooperative members and cooperatives headquartered in the state. Additionally, the coefficient of variation in cooperative membership age class was found to also be inversely related to the number of cooperatives headquartered in the state and the number of cooperative members. Contrary to the notion that diversity makes collective action more difficult, the random forest model that was generated showed expectations that there would be more cooperatives and cooperative members as age and socioeconomic diversity of cooperative members increased. This finding may be counterintuitive to the theoretical notion that cooperative membership heterogeneity decreases the likelihood of cooperative action. However, the finding may be consistent in explaining that in the presence of greater cooperative membership heterogeneity, consolidation and acquisition of cooperatives has been less rapid. The findings of this study seem to suggest that intra-cooperative issues associated with membership heterogeneity expectedly play a role in cooperative consolidation and cooperative extent. At the same time, intra-cooperative issues may not be as important in understanding the long-term sustainability of cooperatives business volume and market share of cooperatives in the agri-food industry. The findings of this study can (i) further our understanding of emerging cooperative issues, (ii) draw implications on the long-term sustainability of cooperatives due to changes to cooperative member heterogeneity, and (iii) reconcile the recent theoretical focus on intra-Preprints (www.preprints.org) | NOT PEER-REVIEWED | Posted: 2 April 2018 doi:10.20944/preprints201804.0022.v1 Peer-reviewed version available at Sustainability 2018, 10, 2048; doi:10.3390/su10062048 cooperative issues that is consistent with observations of cooperative survival over long periods of time. Our empirical study supports a continued focus in understanding intra-cooperative issues for advancing our understanding of cooperative sustainability, membership makeup, and cooperative extent at a micro level. At the same time, the study provides a reason to why a focus on intra- The second approach describes cooperative sustainability as maintaining a coalition with a common interest, yet potentially diverse incentives. Much of the literature in this approach implicitly concedes the need for the cooperative, and/or collective action institution in general, to address market inefficiencies from externalities. The second approach is largely framed in the tragedy of the commons context--where cooperatives can provide a second-best contractual solution to market failures [12]. However, the second approach highlights the inevitable influence problem and horizon problems that can result, and lead to a similar inefficiencies that exists without a collective action solution. Horizon and influence problems can be exacerbated by membership heterogeneity that would diminish the common interest of the coalition and create greater instability of cooperative equilibriums long-term. The frameworks rely primarily on game theory and draw largely from public choice [13] and collective action frameworks [14]. The second approach defines sustainability of the cooperative as making optimal governance decisions despite membership heterogeneity. In all three approaches, membership heterogeneity plays an important role in determining the sustainability of cooperatives overtime."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "To analyze the relationship of cooperative membership heterogeneity on cooperative sustainability we obtained annual cross sectional data from the USDA-ARMS survey on U.S. farm producers and data from the USDA-Rural Business Development on cooperatives. We combined these datasets by aggregating the ARMS data to the state level and joining the data with USDA-Rural Business development data on farmer cooperative members that is made publically available at the state level. Since 1996, the USDA-ARMS data has annually surveyed a sub sample of farm producers (approximately 10,000 to 30,000 a year) in each state, across all types of farms, to collect financial and demographic information on farm businesses and households to maintain suitable farm benchmarks. In each survey, they ask the respondent to indicate the amount of cooperative patronage and cooperative equity they have received in that year or possess as a part of their financial and asset information. We coded each producer who reported receiving patronage or possessing equity as a cooperative member and ones who didn't as a non-cooperative member. We then estimated the mean and variance of cooperative members in each state compared to non-cooperative members over a number of other variables that are in the ARMS dataset. The variables chosen have all been previously identified in the cooperative literature as being important for understanding membership heterogeneity issues with cooperatives. Hohler and Kuhl [2] quantified the number of publications that identify different dimensions of membership heterogeneity as being important in understanding impact to cooperative sustainability. The most cited dimensions they found were farm size, type of product, age, location, and education in that order. In our study, we estimate farm size and diversity by the mean farm asset value (C1_ATOT_mean) and coefficient of variation of asset value by cooperative members (C1_CV_ATOT). We also estimate farm size by the mean (C1_Acres_mean) and coefficient of variation acres (C1_CV_Acres) that is operated. We estimate diversity of farm type by two survey questions, one whether the farm is reported to be primarily grain or livestock ( Forestry, Farming and Fishing Industry is 3, thus our coded variable for value added in this industry in the dataset is \"Ind_va_3\". Values for the farms alone (Ind_va_4), and food and kindered products (Ind_va_20) are available as well. We included the quantity indexes estimated by BEA as \"Ind_q_\" and value added per quantity as \"Ind_va_q_\". To calculate the variables means and variances, and to measure the socioeconomic factor we used SAS 9.4. We then used the randomForest package in R (see Appendix for R code) ( to be used in a node split, thus the tree may consist of a split based on the number of farms alone. In random forest prediction, the final prediction is the mode of the predictions of many distinct, decision trees generated, and the confidence in the prediction is indicated by the frequency the set of decision trees result in the same prediction relative to the total number of decision trees generated. After we omitted observations from our dataset with missing data, the number of observations we were left in the analysis was approximately 580 cross sectional observations of cooperative numbers, business volume, and attributes related to cooperative membership heterogeneity, and other control variables. To generate a number of uncorrelated decision trees, but also maintain stability in our importance and main effects of variable rankings, we generated 800 trees to make up the random forest model. The number of observations from our data that we randomly drew from at each tree to train the regression trees was 200. We restricted the number of variables that were randomly selected to optimally split a node in the tree to be 4. The selections of the number of trees, training data, and number of variables to try at a node split is somewhat arbitrary, though there are general rules of thumb given the number of variables and number of observations being analyzed. As the number of trees that are generated increase, the predictions and accuracy is expected to converge. Thus importance rankings and marginal effects are not expected to be sensitive to the preliminary selections, but may affect values of the measures used to rank the variables including the percent of accuracy increase in the mean square error and the gini node purity index [4][5].

Specifically, do indicators of membership heterogeneity provide a significant main or interaction effect to cooperative numbers in a state? In the case of number of cooperatives headquartered in a state we find that socioeconomic status (SES) of cooperative members and the coefficient of variation of the age class of cooperative members appears to be relatively important. Perhaps even more important than the diversity of farm size-measured by acres-of cooperative members (c1_cv_acres), for example.

"}, {"section_title": "Prediction of the Number of Cooperatives Members in a State", "text": "The number of farmer cooperative members have also decreased in a similar fasion to the number of coopertives that are headquaretered in a state (See Figure 5). The decreasing trends in cooperative members have closely followed trends of larger, more consolidated farms and greater labor productivity from technical advances in agricultural production. However, in some regions cooperative members have been more resistent to the declining trend. For example, in the New England region, cooperative membersship has not declined at the rapid rate observed in the Mountain region. When we predicted cooperative membership by state in the random forest model we found the most important variables were similar to the variable importance rankings when we predicted cooperative headquarters. Theese included included regional variables and the number of farms in the state overall (See Figure 6). Again, the variables associated with membership heterogeneity that improved prediciton performance the most in the random forest model was the mean socioeconomic (SES) status of the cooperative members in the state, and coefficient of variation of age class (C1_cv_agecls). One variable that was was more predictive in cooperative membership than was predictive in the headquarters model was the standard deviation of acres of noncooperative members (acres_stddev). Similar to the number of cooperatives headquartered in a state, when socioeconomic status of cooperative members was below average, the model expected more cooperative members. Specifically, a mean cooperative member socioeconomic status of negative one was expected to Preprints (www.preprints.org) | NOT PEER-REVIEWED | Posted: 2 April 2018 doi:10.20944/preprints201804.0022.v1 Peer-reviewed version available at Sustainability 2018, 10, 2048; doi:10.3390/su10062048 increase state cooperative membership by approximately 8,000 members cetaris paribus (See Figure   7). Other important variables for predicitng cooperative membership in the state can be observed 349 in Figure 8. Notably, cooperative membership is expected to particularly high in the North Central regions of the U.S., and when ratio of net income to gross cash sales is particularly low.   "}, {"section_title": "Predicted Deflated Cooperative Gross Business Volume in a State", "text": "Unlike the decreasing trends seen in cooperative headquarters and cooperative members per state, the deflated cooperative gross business volume has seen a revival in recent years. Specifically, in the East North Central Region, the West North Central Region, the West South Central Region, the Mountain Region, and the Pacific region have shown a\"U\" shaped pattern to gross business volume (See Figure 9). Peer-reviewed version available at Sustainability 2018, 10, 2048; doi:10.3390/su10062048 membership heterogeneity were found to be less important in predicting deflated gross business volume in the state relative to their importance in predicting the cooperative numbers and members (See Figure 10). Perhaps the most interesting finding in predicting gross business volume was the importance of the amount of value added dollars by the farm industry (Ind_va_4). Specifically, value added by farms was ranked third in importance under both measures (mse and node purity) in improving the understanding of cooperative gross business volume at the state level (See Figure 10). Indeed, the amount of value added the farm industry contributes can have a strongly significant impact on the amount of cooperative business volume that exists according to the random forest model. Specifically, as the farm industry expects to add value to the state GDP in the order of 5 billion current U.S. dollars, the corresponding expected value of deflated (1982 based) cooperative gross volume at the state level increases to 10 million dollars (See Figure 11). The variables mostly associated with membership heterogeneity appeared to play a lesser role in understanding cooperative gross business volume at the state level overall. Though in certain regions, the mean level of socioeconomic status (SES) of cooperative members appears to play a slight role in increasing gross business volume (See Figure 12) .    Panel (4c).

We found that membership heterogeneity was expected to affect the number of cooperatives headquartered in a state and the number of cooperative members. However, membership heterogeneity was found to be less important in understanding cooperative gross business volume at the state level. The findings of this empirical work reconciles the notion that cooperatives can be sustainable in the long-term despite much of the recent focus of cooperative literature on intra-cooperative issues that may arise due to cooperative membership heterogeneity. Moreover, we find that cooperative member heterogeneity may play an important role in decreasing the rate of consolidation and acquisition of cooperatives in the U.S. This finding raises new questions about what is efficient, and more sustainable long-term, and whether cooperative membership numbers and number of cooperatives should be the objective measure of cooperative sustainability. Future research should continue to pursue a greater theoretical and empirical understanding to intracooperative issues related to membership heterogeneity. More detailed data sets and new empirical methods may allow us to parse the effect of cooperative membership heterogeneity on cooperative sustainability more precisely. This study provides an initial expectation and understanding of how membership heterogeneity may affect cooperative sustainability long-term."}]
