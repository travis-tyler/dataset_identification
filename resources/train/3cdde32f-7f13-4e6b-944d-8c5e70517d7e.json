[{"section_title": "", "text": "As computers become more prevalent and computer skills more necessary, there continues to be a \"digital divide\" between those with computer access and skills and those without. These differences are less pronounced in skills where children's access to computers and the Internet are more prevalent. Noting that few studies have focused exclusively on kindergartners' and first-graders' access to and use of computers in different settings, this report details examination of data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to assess children's access to and use of computers in their schools, classrooms, and homes as they begin formal schooling. Data were drawn upon to answer'10 questions pertaining to access to and use of computer resources. Findings indicated that almost all young children had access to computers, either at home or in their classrooms, and schools. However, kindergartners' access differed by the types of school they attended: public schoolers had greater access to school and classroom resources, whereas private school children had greater access to home computer resources. For the most part, young children's access to school computer resources did not differ greatly by child and family characteristics. However, in kindergarten some minority children and those from lower-SES families were less likely to attend schools that provided Internet access. In first grade, children from the lowest SES group continued to have less access to the Internet in comparison to firstgraders in the highest SES group. Kindergartners and first-graders in the lowest SES group were also less likely to have a computer area in their classroom. Socioeconomic status also predicted access to computers at home. Findings related to children's use of computers indicated that the majority of young children in public schools were in classrooms where computers were used for instructional purposes on a weekly basis. The most frequent classroom uses were to learn reading, writing, and spelling; to learn math; and for fun. Public school children with access to home computers used them an average of 3 to 4 days a week; frequency of use did not tend to differ by child or famil characteristics. Over 86 ercent used t. e purposes. Finally, young children's classroom computer use in public schools did not differ based on whether children had home access. The report concludes by suggesting additional analyses and future research. The report's two appendices include standard error tables for the main text and supplementary tables and standard errors.

All comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance to ensure that differences are larger than might be expected, due to sampling variation. All differences reported were significant at the .05 level!' Young Children's Access to Computers Almost all young children had access to computers, either at home or in their classrooms and schools. However, kindergartners' access to computer resources differed by the type of school they attended (tables 3, B-1, and B-2). Public school kindergartners had greater access to school and classroom resources, whereas private school children had greater access to home computer resources. Focusing on public school children, the findings showed that children's access to most computer resources at school and home increased from kindergarten to first grade (figure A, table 5). Changes in children's access to computer resources may be due not only to the change in grade level but also to the general growth in computer resources from the Spring of 1999 to the Spring of 2000. School computer resources. For the most part, young children's access to school computer resources did not differ greatly by child and family characteristics (tables B-4, B-6, B-7, B-8, and B-9). However, in kindergarten some minority children and those from lower-SES families were less likely to attend schools that provided Internet access to students than other children. In first grade, children from the lowest SES group continued to have less student access to the Internet in comparison to first-graders in the highest SES group. Classroom computer resources. Kindergarten and first-grade children in the lowest SES group were less likely to have a computer area in their classroom than children in the highest SES group (tables B-7 and B-11). In kindergarten, access to computer areas in the classroom and to teachers who had attended computer/technology workshops did not differ by children's race/ethnicity. In contrast, Hispanic first-graders were less likely than White first-graders to have a computer area in their classroom, and were less likely than White and Black first-graders to have teachers who had attended a computer/technology workshop during the school year. 4Not all statistically significant differences are discussed in this report. Due to the large sample size, many differences (no matter how substantively minor) are statistically significant. Thus, only differences of 5 percent or more between groups are reported, unless an activity is very infrequent (e.g., Internet use) or a resource is rarely available (e.g., Internet access). ix Home computer resources. In kindergarten and first grade, children from low-SES families were least likely to have access to home computers. Black and Hispanic kindergartners and first-graders were less likely to have home computer access than White and Asian/Pacific Islander children (tables 4 and 6). The same patterns were detected for kindergartners' home access to the Internet. Also, in first grade, children with disabilities were less likely to have access to home computers than children without disabilities. Relationship between home and school computer resources. For the most part, young children's access to school and classroom computer resources did not differ by their level of home computer resources. However, a higher percentage of kindergartners who had access to x"}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE and used computers and the Internet at home attended schools that provided Internet access for students, compared to kindergartners without home computer resources (figure 3, table B-8). Young Children's Use of Computers Classroom computer use. The majority of young children in public schools were in classrooms where computers were used for instructional purposes on a weekly basis. The most frequent classroom uses for computers were to learn reading, writing, and spelling; to learn math; and for fun (figure B). Classroom Internet use for young children was not prevalent; 4 percent of public school kindergartners and 9 percent of public school first-graders accessed the Internet on a weekly basis in their classes. Young children's use of computers in the classroom for different instructional purposes tended to vary by teacher and classroom characteristics (tables 8, B-13, and B-14). For instance, kindergartners participating in full-day kindergarten programs and those with computer areas in their classrooms were more likely to be in classes that used the computer on a weekly basis for reading, writing, and spelling; mathematics; social studies; keyboarding instruction; art creation or music composition; and fun than children in part-day kindergarten programs and those without computer areas in their classrooms. Also, kindergartners whose teachers participated in computer/technology workshops and those whose teachers did not spend more than half of the instructional day in teacher-directed, wholeclass activities were more likely to be in classes that used the computer on a weekly basis for these purposes than kindergartners whose teachers had not attended computer/technology workshops during the school year or those whose teachers spent more than half of the instructional day in teacher-directed, whole-class activities. These patterns were consistent for first-grade children as well. Home computer use. Public school children who had access to home computers used them an average of 3 to 4 days a week (tables 9 and 11). Over 85 percent of young children with home computers used them for educational purposes. The frequency with which kindergarten and first-grade children used home computers did not tend to differ by child or family characteristics; however, the purposes for which young children used computers at home varied by children's sex, race/ethnicity, and SES. For example, family SES was positively related to children's use of home computers for educational purposes overall and for those children who had access to home computers. In kindergarten, girls who had access to home computers used them more often for art or drawing programs than boys did. Also, White kindergartners with home computer xi access were more likely than Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander kindergartners to use them to play with educational programs, and more likely than Black or Hispanic kindergartners to use them for art or drawing programs. In the summer prior to first grade, few public school children used computers in structured summer programs (table 12). However, almost three-quarters of children used home computers in the summer on a weekly basis to play games5 or for educational purposes (table 14). The percentage of public school children using computers for different purposes in the summer also 5Parents were asked how often their child used the computer for games like Nintendo or Sega over a 1-week time period. No definition of \"computer\" was provided to respondents; thus, it is possible that some parents may have included other noncomputer game devices (e.g., handheld or TV game systems) when responding to the item. xii 13 BESTCOPYAVAILABLE varied by children's sex, race/ethnicity, and SES. In the summer, a higher percentage of boys than girls, and a higher percentage of White than Hispanic children used home computers. Family SES was also positively related to children's summer computer use. Relationship between home and classroom computer use. Young children's classroom computer use in public schools did not differ based on whether children had home access to computers or the Internet (table 15). In addition, there was no significant relationship between the frequency of home computer use and the frequency of classroom computer use for different instructional purposes for young children attending public schools (tables B-16 and B-17)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Although almost all young children had access to computers, at home or in their classrooms and schools, the differences in the amount of access varied according to children's school type, race/ethnicity, and family SES. Public school kindergartners tended to have greater access to school and classroom computer resources, whereas private school kindergartners had greater access to home computer resources. Young children's access to most computer resources in public schools did not differ greatly by child and family characteristics; however, in kindergarten some minority children, those from lower SES families, and those without home computer resources were less likely to attend schools that provide student access to the Internet. In terms of classroom computer resources, kindergartners and first-graders from the lowest SES group were less likely to have a computer area in their classroom than children in the highest SES group. In first grade, public school Hispanic children were less likely to have access to computers in their classrooms than White children, and Hispanic first-graders were less likely to have teachers who had attended a computer/technology workshop than White and Black firstgradersfindings that did not occur in kindergarten. In terms of home computer resources, public school children's access varied by race/ethnicity and family SES, with minority and disadvantaged children being less likely to have home access to computer resources in kindergarten and first grade. Public school children's access to computer resources at school and home tended to increase as they moved from kindergarten to first grade. Over half of all public school children attended classrooms where computers were used for various instructional purposes at least once a week. Young children's use of computers in their classrooms differed, however, by several classroom characteristics, including kindergarten program type (part day vs. full day), teachers' attendance at computer/technology workshops during the school year, presence of a computer area in the classroom, and the proportion of time classes spent in teacher-directed, whole-class instruction. For those public school young children with access to home computers, all children used their home computers an average of about 3 to 4 days each week. However, the purposes for which young children used home computers during the school year and over summer vacation (e.g., to access the Internet, play educational games) varied by children's sex, race/ethnicity, and SES. The ECLS-K provides a wealth of information on children's cognitive, socioemotional, and physical development from kindergarten through fifth grade across multiple contexts, including the home, classroom, school, and community. Since this report shows differences in computer access and use between public and private school children, additional analyses could focus on child and family characteristic differences within private school settings. Based on the findings from this report, future research could also examine the relationships between children's access to and use of computers in different settings with their academic achievement over time. Also, information on computer resources and use could be further explored at the school and classroom level to identify differences based on characteristics of the schools that young children attend. For example, children's access to school computer resources could be examined in terms of school size, grade range, federal program participation, urbanicity, and region. xiv   Percentage distribution of the frequency that public school kindergartners used computers in their classrooms for different instructional purposes: Spring 1999 26 xvi List of Text Tables   Table 1.

Percent of public school first-graders who used a home computer in the past summer for various purposes, by selected child and family characteristics: Fall 1999  (Newburger 1999;Newburger 2001). Students' use of computers at school also increased from 61 percent in 1993 to 71 percent in 1997 (Newburger 1999). In addition, more children are being introduced to computers at a young age than ever before. For instance, prekindergarten and kindergarten children's use of home computers nearly doubled from 16 percent in 1993 to 30 percent in 1997, and school computer use for this age group increased from 26 percent to 36 percent in the same time period (Snyder and Hoffman 2002). As computers become more prevalent and computer skills more necessary, there continues to be a \"digital divide\" between those with computer access and skills and those without. Already, gaps exist across racial/ethnic groups and family income levels with respect to computer ownership and Internet usage (Economics and Statistics Administration 2000). In 2000, 43 percent of Black, non-Hispanic children (ages 3-17) and 37 percent of Hispanic children had a computer in their home, compared to 77 percent of White, non-Hispanic children. In terms of Internet usage in the same year, there was a 21 percentage point difference between Internet access rates for both Blacks and Hispanics compared to the nationwide average (Newburger 2001). Such differences are less pronounced in schools, where children's access to computers and the Internet are more prevalent. In a 1999 U.S. Department of Education study, almost all public school teachers (99 percent) indicated that computers were available in their schools, and the nationwide ratio of students to instructional computers was about 6 to 1 (Smerdon et al. 2000). The Department also reported that 95 percent of all public i no schools had access to the Internet in 1999, compared with only 35 percent in 1994 (Snyder and Hoffman 2002). This report describes the computer resources available to children as they begin formal schooling. The computer resources identified in this report include access in schools to computer labs, CD-ROMs, local area networks (LAN), and wide area networks (WAN)/Internet; access in classrooms to computer areas and teachers trained in using computers and technology; and access in homes to computers and the Internet. The report also looks at the ways in which young children use computers at home and school. For example, information is provided on children's frequency and types of home computer use, and on the frequency with which children use computers in their classrooms for different instructional purposes. Children's access to and use of computers in their schools, classrooms, and homes are examined overall and in relation to certain child and family characteristics. In addition, children's use of computers for various instructional purposes is compared by several characteristics of their teachers and classrooms. Details on the child, family, teacher, and classroom characteristics used in this report are included in the Measures section of the Introduction."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "Data from the ECLS-K are used to examine 10 questions related to young children's access to and use of computers. 10. Do children who use computers more often at home also use them more often in their classrooms?"}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "The ECLS-K selected a nationally representative sample of kindergartners in the Fall of 1998 and is following these children through the spring of fifth grade. The study collects information directly from the children and their families, teachers, and schools. The full ECLS-K base-year sample is comprised of approximately 22,000 public and private school children who attended over 1,200 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year. Data for this report are from the ECLS-K kindergarten and first-grade waves of data collection. 6 Tables 1 and 2 show the sample sizes and population counts for the children included in this report. Tables 1, 2, 3, B-17, B-2, and B-3 present data for children attending public and private schools. The data in these tables show significant differences in the computer resources available in the two school sectors, as well as differences in the characteristics of children who attend each type of school. For example, almost three-quarters (74 percent) of public schools with kindergartens had Internet access for students, compared with 41 percent of private schools with kindergartens (table B-1). Also, a higher proportion of Black and Hispanic kindergartners attended public schools than private schools (table 1). As a result, it was decided to only report findings for public schools in the remainder of the report, so that any variations found in computer access and use related to child and classroom characteristics would not be confounded by school sector. Thus, the majority of this report is based on 14,666 Spring 1999 public school kindergartners and 11,456 Spring 2000 public school first-grade children.6 6Data for kindergarten children are weighted by the round 2 parent cross-sectional weight, C2PWO; data for summer computer use prior to first grade are weighted by the round 3 parent cross-sectional weight, C3PWO; and first-grade data are weighted by the round 4 cross-sectional parent weight, C4PWO. 7Tables beginning with a B are located in Appendix B. 'Children who repeated kindergarten while in the study were not included in the analysis of first-grade data. Approximately 5 percent of kindergartners were not promoted to first grade by the second year of the ECLS-K data collection. For the most part, the findings in the report use the child as the unit of analysis. This was done to provide information on the percentage of kindergartners who had opportunities to use different computer resources, as opposed to information on the percentage of schools or teachers that made such resources available for their students. In the first part of Section 11 of the report, summary information is provided on the percentage of schools and teachers that provide various computer resources to kindergartners (tables B-1 and B-2). These results were consistent with the child-level findings (table 3), so tables at the school and teacher level of analysis are not included elsewhere in the report. The findings of this report are organized into the two sections identified by the research questions. Part one describes parents, teachers, and school administrators' reports of young children's access to computer resources in their schools, classrooms, and homes. Results are presented for the population of kindergarten and first-grade children, and in relation to child and family characteristics. Part two describes ways in which young children were reported to use computers in their classrooms and homes, and also examines the frequency of classroom computer use for different instructional purposes. Results in this section are presented for the population of kindergarten and first-grade children, and in relation to child, family, teacher, and classroom characteristics. All comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance to ensure that differences are larger than might be expected, due to sampling variation. All differences reported were significant at the .05 level.9 9Not all statistically significant differences are discussed in this report. Due to the large sample size, many differences (no matter how substantively minor) are statistically significant. Thus, only differences of 5 percent or more between groups are reported, unless an activity is very infrequent (e.g., Internet use) or resource is rarely available (e.g., Internet access).  1\u00b0The original set of items on computer use for instructional purposes included separate items on using the computer to create art or to compose music. The response pattern for these two items was consistent, so a decision was made to combine the two categories into one variable for this report. Children's value on the composite variable was equal to the value of the variable (art or music) with the higher reported frequency. \"Many of these variables are composite variables in the ECLS-K Electronic Codebook (ECB). Information on the creation of these composites can be found in Chapter 7 of the  (Smerdon et al. 2000). Teachers' use of computers with their classes may also be related to their instructional practices, such as the way they set up their classroom and the way they group children for instruction. This report looks at children's classroom use of computers in relation to whether the teacher had a computer area set up in the classroom. Also, the emphasis teachers placed on teacher-directed, whole-class instruction (whole-class instruction for half of the day or less, whole-class instruction for more than half of the day) is included as a variable for study when examining children's use of computers in their classes.  (Kleiner and Farris 2002). However, 1999 and 2000 estimates from other studies are presented in this report because they reflect the same timeframe as the ECLS-K estimates. schools that provided student access to local area networks (LANs) and the Internet, had kindergarten teachers who attended a computer/ technology workshop in the past year, and had home computers that they used. Kindergartners' access to school, classroom, and home computer resources tended to vary by the type of school they attended. Although the apparent difference between the percentage of public and private school kindergartners with computer labs in their schools was not statistically significant, kindergartners in public schools had greater access to resources such as LANs, CD-ROM drives, and the Internet than private school kindergartners. In addition, public school kindergartners had greater access to computers in their classrooms, and a higher percentage of their teachers had attended computer/ technology workshops during the school year than private school 14 33 BESTCOPYAVAILABLE kindergartners. However, only about half of public school kindergartners had access to computers in their home, compared with almost three-quarters of private school kindergartners. When the data were analyzed at the school and teacher level, the findings were consistent with child-level data (tables B-1 and B-2). At the school level, a smaller proportion of private schools with kindergartens had computer labs or student access to LANs, CD-ROM drives, and the Internet than did public schools with kindergartens (table B-1). Also, private school kindergarten teachers were less likely to use computers with their classes, to have a computer area in the classroom, and were less likely to have attended a computer or technology workshop in the past year than were public school kindergarten teachers (table B-2). In sum, significant differences were found between public and private school kindergartners' access to computer resources at home and school. As a result, the remainder of this report focuses on public school children's access to and use of computers so that differences found by child, family, and school characteristics are not confounded by school control differences. Approximately 85 percent of kindergartners attended public schools in the 1998-99 academic year (table 1). Public school kindergartners' access to computer resources at school was also examined in terms of the school's child/computer ratio that is, the number of children enrolled in the school divided by the total number of computers in the school and the percent of classrooms in the school that had various computer resources available for student use ( "}, {"section_title": "36", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE Home computer resources.

In the kindergarten year, children from economically disadvantaged homes and those from some minority groups were less likely to have access to the Internet in their schools, computer areas in their classrooms, and computer resources in their homes. Also, a lower percentage of kindergartners without home computer access attended schools with student Internet access, compared with kindergartners who had home computer access. Thus, this report examines whether the overall increases in computer resources helped to equalize access to these resources for all first-graders or if disparities in computer access still existed for some groups of young children."}, {"section_title": "40", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE School computer resources. Consistent with kindergarten findings, no differences were detected with first-graders' access to school computer labs, CD-ROM drives, and LANs in their schools when compared by child and family characteristics. In first grade, children from the lowest SES group continued to be less likely to attend schools with student access to the Internet than first-graders in the highest SES group (tables B-9). However, no significant difference was detected in the percentage of first-graders who had school access to the Internet relative to their level of home computer access (table B-10). This finding differed from the kindergarten data, which showed that children without home computer access were less likely than kindergartners with home computer access to attend schools that provided student access to the Internet (  (table 4). In first grade, children with disabilities were less likely to have access to home computers than children without disabilities. were less likely to use computers at home than students from higher income families (Snyder and Hoffman 2002).

The study found that teachers who had more computers or Internet access in the classroom were more likely to use such technologies with their students than those with fewer resources. Also, teachers who spent more time in professional development in technology reported feeling better prepared to use computers and the Internet in their classrooms, and were more likely to use computers with their students."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": "How frequently do kindergartners use computers in their classrooms and homes, and for what purposes? Classroom computer use. Public school kindergarten teachers reported the frequency that they used computers in their classes for different instructional purposes on a sixpoint scale, ranging from \"no use\" to \"daily use\" for a given purpose. For this report, the frequency of computer use categories were collapsed to three groups: no use, less than weekly use, and weekly use (figure 4). The most frequent uses for computers in kindergarten were to learn reading, writing, and spelling; to learn math; and for fun; at least 60 percent of public school kindergartners' teachers reported that all of these activities were done on at least a weekly basis. The least frequent use for computers in kindergarten was for Internet/LAN access, with only 4 percent of public school kindergartners' classes using them on a weekly basis for this purpose.  mathematics; social studies; science; keyboarding instruction; art creation or music composition; and for fun differed significantly by teachers' computer/technology workshop attendance, the presence of a computer area in the classroom, the proportion of time teachers spent in teacher-directed, whole-class instruction, and the kindergarten program type (part day vs. full day). Kindergartners whose teachers participated in computer/technology workshops and those with a computer area in their classroom were more likely to be in classes that used the computer on a weekly basis for these instructional purposes than kindergartners whose teachers had not attended computer training during the school year or those without computer areas in their classrooms. Also, kindergartners whose teachers spent half of the instructional day or less in teacher-directed, whole-class activities and those participating in full-day kindergarten programs were more likely to be in classes that used the computer on a weekly basis in these areas than those whose teachers spent more than half of the instructional day in teacher-directed, whole-class activities or were enrolled in part-day kindergarten programs. Since only 4 percent of kindergartners were in classes that used computers on a weekly basis to access the Internet or local area networks, few significant differences in use were detected by classroom characteristics. Public school kindergarten teachers' certification areas were also related to the frequency that computers were used for some instructional purposes16 (table 8). Kindergartners whose teachers held early childhood certification were more likely to be in classes that used computers on a weekly basis for math instruction compared with children whose teachers who held neither an early childhood nor elementary education certification. Also, more children whose teachers held either an early childhood and/or an elementary education certificate were in classes that used computers to learn keyboarding skills, compared with those whose teachers held neither teaching certificate. I6Teachers' area of certification was related to the level of certification teachers held (i.e., less than regular certificate, regular certificate) and their years of kindergarten teaching experience (table B-12). Over 90 percent of public school kindergartners' teachers who were certified in early childhood education or elementary education held a regular certificate, compared with 68 percent of kindergartners' teachers who were not certified in either area. Also, 39 percent of public school kindergartners' teachers with neither certification had been teaching for less than 3 years, compared with 21 percent of kindergartners' teachers who held early childhood education certificates.  Home computer use. For those public school kindergartners with access to home computers, all children used their computers an average of about 3 1/2 days a week. However, the way in which these children used computers varied by the children's sex, race/ethnicity, and SES (table 9). Girls who had access to home computers more often used them for playing with art or drawing programs than boys. White kindergartners with home computer access were more likely than Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander children to use them to play with educational programs, and were more likely than Black or Hispanic children to play with art or drawing programs. For kindergartners who used computers at home, family SES was positively associated with children's use of home computers for educational programs and Internet access. Also, kindergartners in the lowest SES group who had access to home computers were least likely to use their computers to play with art or drawing programs. Poverty is a function of household size and household income. Based on 1998 Census information, where a household of four with a total income below $16,655 was considered to be below poverty level. 2Children's disability status is derived from parent information on whether the child has been diagnosed by a professional as having problems with attention, activity level, coordination, speech, hearing, or vision or has participated in therapy or programs for children with disabilities. Sixty-four percent of public school kindergartners and 65 percent of public school firstgraders used computers in school on a weekly basis for reading, writing, and spelling. The most common classroom computer uses in both grades were to read, write, and spell, to learn math, and for fun. A smaller percentage of public school first-graders than kindergartners used the computer on a weekly basis to learn math, social studies or science concepts, to create art or compose music, or for fun. In contrast, weekly use of computers to access the Internet in public school doubled from kindergarten to first grade. Kindergarten to first grade increases in Internet use may be due to the change in grade level or to growth of computer resources from 1999 to 2000.   (table B-14). A higher proportion of first-graders with a computer area in their classroom and those with teachers who attended a computer/technology workshop during the school year used computers on a weekly basis across all measured classroom computer activities than first-graders without a computer area in the classroom or whose teachers did not attend computer/technology workshops. Also, those children who spent no more than half of the instructional day in teacher-directed, whole-class instruction were more likely to use computers to learn math, social studies, keyboarding skills, to create art or compose music, and to access the Internet than firstgraders whose teachers spent more than half of the instructional day in teacher-directed, whole-class activities. For the most part, public school teachers' areas of certification, years of first-grade teaching experience, percent of minority enrollment in the classroom, class size, and school low-income level were not linked to differences in children's classroom use of computers (table B-14). However, first-graders whose teachers were certified in early childhood education more often used computers for science and social studies than teachers with elementary education certificates. First-graders whose teachers held early childhood education certificates also used the computer more often to access the Internet on a weekly basis than children whose teachers held neither an early childhood nor an elementary education certificate. Home computer use. Public school kindergartners and first-graders with home computers both tended to use computers about 3 to 4 days per week (tables 9 and 11). However, Black first-graders used their home computers more often than White firstgraders (3.6 days/week vs. 3.3 days/week). Questions on the ECLS-K parent interviews related to home computer use differed from kindergarten to first grade. For instance, during the kindergarten year parents were asked whether their children used the computer to play with educational programs, to access the Internet, and to play with art or drawing programs. In first grade, parents were asked to report on the frequency with which their children used the computer for educational purposes. For this report, the first-grade item on frequency of computer use for educational purposes was recoded to serve as a dichotomous variable with a value 34 of \"yes\" or \"no\" so that it could be compared with the similar kindergarten item on whether the child used the computer to play educational games. At least 85 percent of young children in both kindergarten and first grade who used home computers played educational programs with them or used them for educational purposes (tables 9 and 11). In addition, family SES continued to be positively related to first-grader's use of home computers for educational purposes, consistent with the kindergarten findings. Poverty is a function of household size and household income. Based on 1998 Census information, where a household of four with a total income below $16,655 was considered to be below poverty level. 2Children's disability status is derived from parent information on whether the child has been diagnosed by a professional as having problems with attention, activity level, coordination, speech, hearing, or vision or has participated in therapy or programs for children with disabilities.

About half of first-graders used home computers in the summer on at least a weekly basis prior to first grade for each of these two purposes, and almost three-quarters of children used computers at home for at least one of these purposes (table 14). Children's use of computers in their homes during the summer between kindergarten and first grade was also examined by children's sex, race/ethnicity, family SES, and family poverty status (table 14). Overall, more boys used home computers on a weekly basis in the summer than girls, and more White children used computers than Hispanic children for either games or educational purposes. A greater percentage of boys than girls, and Black than White children used home computers to play games. Also, White and Black children more often used computers on a weekly basis in their homes for educational purposes when compared to Hispanic children. Family SES was positively associated with children's general use of home computers in the summer prior to first grade. As with computer use during the school year, children's summer computer use for educational purposes was positively related to SES. However, children from the highest SES group were less likely to use home computers in the summer to play games compared with children from the middle SES group.\u00b0P arents were asked how often their child used the computer for games like Nintendo or Sega over a 1week time period. No definition of \"computer\" was provided to respondents, thus it is possible that some parents may have included other noncomputer game devices (e.g., handheld or TV game systems) when responding to the item. What opportunities do children with and without home computer resources have to use computers in their classrooms? Little research has been done on the relationship between computer resources and use at home versus computer resources and use at school. Much has been written about access to and use of computers at school (Cattagni and Farris 2001;Becker 2000;Smerdon et al. 2000) and at home (Subrahmanyam et al. 2000 Do children who use computers more often at home also use them more often in their classrooms? In the ECLS-K, parents and teachers provided information on the frequency with which kindergartners used computers in their homes and classrooms. Correlations were calculated between the frequency of young children's home computer use and the frequency with which computers were used in their classrooms for different instructional purposes (tables B-16 and B-17). There were virtually no correlations between the frequency of home and classroom computer use in either kindergarten or first grade."}, {"section_title": "58", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE Approximately 23 kindergartners were selected in each of the sampled schools.

In addition to properly weighting the responses, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates were employed, because the data were collected using a complex sample design. Complex sample designs, like that used in the ECLS-K, result in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of the results. Frequently, the standard errors of the estimates are 23The approach used to develop weights for the ECLS-K is described in the ECLS-K Base Year Public-use Data Files User's Manual (NCES 2001-029) and the ECLS-K First-grade Public-use Data Files User's Manual (NCES 2002-134)."}, {"section_title": "6r,", "text": "larger than would be expected, if the sample was a simple random sample and the observations were independent and identically distributed random variables.

School child/computer ratio. The ratio of children to school computers was calculated by dividing the total school enrollment by the total number of computers in the school (i.e., S2ANUMCH / S2TOTCM). Presence of a computer lab in the school. This derived variable was based on data collected on the adequacy of school computer labs (e.g., S2COMPOK). For this report, schools were identified as having a school computer lab if their response to S2COMPOK was greater than 1 (Do not have a computer lab). Use of computer equipment in kindergarten and first grade. This derived variable was based on data collected on the adequacy of computer equipment in kindergarten and first grade (e.g., A2COMPEQ). For this report, teachers were identified as using computer equipment in kindergarten or first grade if their response to A2COMPEQ was greater than 1 (I do not use at this grade level). Frequency of home computer use. This derived variable was created by combining information from parent items on whether the child had a home computer that they used and if so, the frequency that they used the home computer on a weekly basis. The parent interview used a four-point scale to collect information on children's weekly computer use (e.g., P2COMPWK). The four point scale was recoded into a new variable as follows: 'never' was recoded to equal '0'; 'once or twice a week' was recoded to equal 50 '1.5'; '3 to six times a week' was recoded to '4.5'; and 'daily' was recoded to '7'. If the child did not have a home computer that they used (e.g., P2HOMECM = 'no'), the new variable received a value of '0' for the frequency of home computer use. Emphasis on teacher-directed, whole class instruction. Teachers were asked to indicate the amount of time the class spent in teacher-directed whole-class, small group, and individual instruction and in child-selected activities in a typical day using a five-point scale for each grouping practice (e.g., A2WHLCLS, A2SMLGRP, A2INDVDL, A2CHCLDS). For this report, teachers' responses to the five categories for each practice were recoded into new grouping variables as follows: 'no time' was recoded to '0'; 'half hour or less' was recoded to '0.25'; 'about one hour' was recoded to '1'; 'about two hours' was recoded to '2'; and 'three or more hours' was recoded to '3'.
