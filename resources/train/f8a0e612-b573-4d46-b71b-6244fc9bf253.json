Abnormal levels of Ab are associated with longitudinal cognitive decline in healthy elderly [2] and progression to AD dementia in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [3] . A verified Ab status can be used to improve the accuracy of AD diagnostics and for including participants in trials of novel AD drugs, as currently used in several clinical trials [4] . Given the devastating symptoms of AD, the high number of affected people, and the tremendous costs for society (US$ 259 billion per year for dementia in the US alone), there will be a great pressure on the health care system to identify persons with abnormal Ab deposition when disease-modifying AD treatments become available [5] .\nBrain Ab can be detected in vivo either by performing a lumbar puncture (LP) and analyzing the levels of the peptide Ab 42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or by performing a positron emission tomography (PET) scan using a ligand that binds to Ab fibrils (Ab PET). There are no significant differences between the two methods in terms of accuracy for identifying AD [6, 7] , and they are used mostly not only in research but also in clinical practice at some specialized memory clinics. However, because these methods are invasive, costly, and not available in all health care settings, a screening process to select individuals for LP or PET testing, both in clinical practice and clinical treatment trials, would be very useful. Several studies on amyloid prediction tools or blood-based Ab biomarkers exist, but due to lack of or failed validations, low accuracies, or the usage of advanced technology or extensive neuropsychological testing, none of them are being used in clinical or research settings, to the best of our knowledge [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .\nIn the present study, we aimed to develop algorithms that estimate the risk of being Ab positive using readily available and noninvasive measures and tests. Nondemented subjects with either subjective or objective cognitive symptoms were examined to provide a clinically relevant target population. The models were developed in a training cohort and validated in an independent population. In a second step, we analyzed the added value of including the plasma biomarkers tau, neurofilament light (NfL), and the Ab 42 /Ab 40 ratio. We also examined the accuracy of our models to longitudinally predict conversion to AD dementia."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants of the training cohort (BioFINDER)", "text": "The Swedish BioFINDER study (Biomarkers For Identifying NeuroDegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably) is a prospective study that focuses on identifying key mechanisms and improving clinical diagnostics of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

In the present study, we used the BioFINDER cohort of prospectively and consecutively included nondemented participants with cognitive complaints. They were enrolled between 2010 and 2015, mostly from primary care centers in the Southern part of Sweden. The inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary.

The scanning [15] and processing [13] procedures have been described previously. The weighted mean standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from a global neocortical region of interest [16] relative to a composite reference region (white matter, cerebellum and brainstem [13] ) was used to determine the Ab status. The SUVR cutoff for Ab positivity was determined using unbiased mixture modeling statistics, which is a well-validated method for determining such a cutoff [13, 17, 18] . The resulting cutoff for Ab positivity was .0.738 SUVR. LP and CSF handling followed a structured protocol [15] . CSF levels of Ab 42 were analyzed using INNOTEST ELI-SAs (Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium). The CSF Ab 42 cutoff for Ab abnormality was determined using the optimized Youden's Index against Ab PET in BioFINDER (CSF Ab 42 , 552 ng/L; sensitivity 93%, specificity 84%)."}, {"section_title": "Predictor variables of Ab positivity", "text": "Different types of predictors were examined in the primary analysis, including demographics (age, education, and sex), apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, cognitive test scores, and white matter lesions. The cognitive tests were administered by experienced research nurses who were blinded to the Ab status of the participants.\nAPOE genotypes were analyzed from blood samples, and the participants were stratified according to Ab risk into the following groups (see reference [19] for rationale): (1) \u03b52/\u03b52 or \u03b52/\u03b53, (2) \u03b53/\u03b53, (3) \u03b52/\u03b54 or \u03b53/\u03b54, and (4) \u03b54/\u03b54. APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 was the reference category. Episodic Q6 memory function was measured with the delayed recall part of the 10-word list from the ADAS-cog [20] . Cognitive function was also assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [21] . Both the total score and the score from the orientation and memory parts of the test were used. The scores from the orientation and memory parts of the MMSE were used based on previous findings showing that the orientation to time and place and 171  172  173  174  175  176  177  178  179  180  181  182  183  184  185  186  187  188  189  190  191  192  193  194  195  196  197  198  199  200  201  202  203  204  205  206  207  208  209  210  211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228  229  230  231 the three-word delayed recall parts can differentiate MCI and dementia due to AD from other causes of cognitive impairment [22, 23] . It consists of orientation to place (country, county/state, city, building/place, and floor), orientation to time (year, season, month, day of the week, and date), and three words that are being recalled after a short distraction task.\nWe also examined A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT)-color and form score, which is a sensitive test for attention and executive function to account for non-ADspecific cognitive impairment [24, 25] . AQT was used alone and as a ratio with the delayed word recall test and MMSE orientation and memory.\nMagnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 3-Tesla Siemens Tim Trio scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). T2 FLAIR images were used for rating white matter lesions according to the ARWMC scale [26] to account for the impact of cerebrovascular pathology on cognitive impairment.\nIn a secondary analysis, we added the plasma biomarkers tau, the ratio of Ab 42 /Ab 40 , and NfL, which previously have been tested as AD biomarkers [27] [28] [29] . Plasma Ab 42 and Ab 40 levels were determined using the EUROIMMUN ELISAs (EUROIMMUN, Lubeck, Germany). The total levels of Ab 42 and Ab 40 were used to calculate the Ab 42 / Ab 40 ratio. Plasma tau and NfL concentrations were measured on a Simoa HD-1 analyzer using the Human Total Tau kit (Quanterix, Lexington, MA) for tau and an in-house assay based on the same antibodies and standard protein as in the commercially available NF-light kit (UmanDiagnostics, Ume a, Sweden) for NfL [30] . All predictor variables were available in all patients, except for plasma NfL and tau (n 5 346 of 391 participants)."}, {"section_title": "Validation cohort-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "A detailed study and data description of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as well as inclusion/exclusion criteria and MCI definitions can be found on www.adni-info.org and in the Supplementary.

This selection resulted in a population of 661 participants, of which 170 had plasma biomarker data.\nAb status was based on (in order of preference) (1) Ab PET using the ligand 18 F-florbetapir, (2) Ab PET using the ligand 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), and (3) CSF Ab 42 measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX, USA) with the INNO-BIA AlzBio3 kit (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) [31, 32] .

In Table 1 , we applied Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons. P values were thus multiplied by 6 and a value of ,0.05 was considered statistically significant. To predict Ab positivity, the following variables from the training cohort (BioFINDER) were entered in a general linear model: age, gender, presence of APOE \u03b52/\u03b52 or \u03b52/ \u03b53, presence of APOE \u03b52/\u03b54 or \u03b53/\u03b54, presence of APOE \u03b54/\u03b54 (APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 was not included because it was the reference variable), total MMSE score, the score from the orientation and delayed recall (memory) parts of the MMSE, the 10-word list delayed recall from ADAS-cog (number of errors), years of education, AQT score, 10word list delayed recall/AQT, MMSE orientation and memory/AQT, and degree of white matter lesions (ARWMC score). Using Ab status as the dependent variable, the general linear model was fitted to the data using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [36] . The LASSO analysis uses a type of forward selection logistic regression that provides more robust predictors because it penalizes the absolute value of the coefficients and shrinks irrelevant coefficients to zero. The LASSO was only used for selecting predictor variables in BioFINDER (the training cohort), it could not be directly applied to the ADNI data (validation cohort) because not all BioFINDER variables were present in ADNI (ARWMC and AQT data). To increase the applicability of an Ab risk model, we also used a reduced set of variables (but the same population) where we excluded the 10-word list delayed recall, AQT, and white matter lesions assessments because these measures are not always available in all settings. In a final step of Ab risk analyses, we added plasma tau, plasma NfL, and the plasma Ab 42 / Ab 40 ratio to the two LASSO models. The selected variables from the LASSO regression (variables with nonzero estimates) were entered in a logistic regression model to calculate the intercept, the coefficients, and the resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to assess the model fit in relation to its complexity (number of variables), where a drop of 2 indicated a statistically better model [37] . The best model was considered to be the one with the highest AUC and the lowest AIC.

Hereafter, this is referred to as the \"delayed recall\" model. In a multivariable logistic regression, coefficients and intercept were established ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The resulting area under the ROC curve (AUC) based on the probabilities from the model was 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) ( Fig. 1A , Supplementary Table 1 ). Because a 10word list, grading of white matter lesions, and AQT are not always available in all settings, we also ran another LASSO regression using the same population but removed these three measures. The variables selected by the LASSO regression were then age, APOE \u03b52\u03b52/\u03b52\u03b53, APOE \u03b52\u03b54/ \u03b53\u03b54, APOE \u03b54\u03b54, and MMSE orientation and memory. This is referred to as the \"MMSE model.\" In a logistic regression, this model had slightly less AUC than the delayed recall model (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.85), and a comparison of the AICs also favored the delayed recall model (DAIC 17).\nNext, we reran the aforementioned LASSO analyses but also included the plasma biomarkers Ab 42 /Ab 40 , NfL, and tau.

This produced the best model with DAICs of 28 to 234 compared with the other models and the highest AUC of all models (0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.89) ( Fig. 1A ; Supplementary  Table 1 ). When excluding grading of white matter lesions, AQT, and 10-word list delayed recall from the LASSO model, plasma Ab 42 /Ab 40 was again selected, in addition to age, APOE \u03b52\u03b52/\u03b52\u03b53, APOE \u03b52\u03b54/\u03b53\u03b54, APOE \u03b54\u03b54, and MMSE orientation and memory. The AUC from the logistic regression was 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87), which was A vertical dashed line has arbitrarily been added at AUC 0.80 for easier comparison between the models. The delayed recall, MMSE, and plasma models were derived from the different sets of variables (but from the same population) using the LASSO analysis as the selection method.

For example, we previously found that a combination of demographics, APOE, and longitudinal cognitive testing could be used to identify Ab positivity in cognitively healthy controls [12] . Recently, age and APOE were examined as predictors of Ab positivity in MCI and subjects without objective cognitive decline [42] . The AUCs in that study were lower (0.74-0.75), and no increase in AUC was seen when MMSE was added. This might be explained by how APOE was coded (only as \u03b541/2) and that they used the total MMSE score, in contrast to the present study where we used four APOE groups based on their different contributing risks to Ab accumulation [19] and the use of only AD-specific parts of the MMSE score (orientation and memory) [22, 23] .\nA common limitation in many of the previous studies is that the Ab prediction models have not been validated in an independent population. In the present models, we only used biomarkers or measures that previously have 720  721  722  723  724  725  726  727  728  729  730  731  732  733  734  735  736  737  738  739  740  741  742  743  744  745  746  747  748  749  750  751  752  753  754  755  756  757  758  759  760  761  762  763  764  765  766  767  768  769  770  771  772  773  774  775  776  777  778  779  780   781  782  783  784  785  786  787  788  789  790  791  792  793  794  795  796  797  798  799  800  801  802  803  804  805  806  807  808  809  810  811  812  813  814  815  816  817  818  819  820  821  822  823  824  825  826  827  828  829  830  831  832  833  834  835  836  837  838  839  840  841 been shown to either be associated with Ab deposition or to predict future development of AD dementia [19, 23, 27, 41] , to reduce the risk of random inaccurate findings. The robustness of the models was confirmed by validating them in the independent ADNI population and in eight different subgroups ( Fig. 2A-D) . Note that the models performed well also in selected populations of individuals with only subjective cognitive symptoms (BioFINDER) and significant memory concerns or early MCI (ADNI), which may be of high interest in clinical trials of novel treatments. This also shows that the high accuracy of the models was not driven by the difference in cognitive status between subjective cognitive decline and MCI (BioFINDER) or early MCI and late MCI (ADNI). The training (BioFINDER) and validation (ADNI) cohorts are different in many ways, which makes it more likely that the established models are indeed generalizable. The differences include, for example, geographic locations (Sweden and North America), education levels (lower in BioFINDER, high in ADNI), cognitive tests in different languages, and the patient selection process (consecutively recruited subjects referred to memory clinics in BioFINDER; selected enrollment in ADNI). Nonetheless, we want to mention potential limitations in these cohorts. The amyloidosis is to a large extent associated with lateonset AD, and the applicability in early-onset AD remains to be tested. The models need further validation in unselected primary care populations with individuals who seek medical care due to cognitive complaints (i.e., tested in populations with lower prevalence of Ab positivity). Finally, the models should be validated in populations where the prevalence of different APOE genotypes differs from the North European/North American populations used in the present study [43] .\nOne popular aim has been to try to identify blood-based AD biomarkers. Plasma biomarker signatures of brain Ab has, however, been difficult to replicate. Voyle et al. [8] recently performed a large attempt to validated 35 different plasma proteins that had predicted Ab positivity in previous studies [38] [39] [40] 44] . Unfortunately, none of the proteins were significantly associated with neocortical Ab burden in the independent cohort. In the present study, we examined the additive effect of plasma Ab 42 /Ab 40 , NfL, and tau in our models because these biomarkers have been associated with AD [27] [28] [29] . Although levels of NfL were significantly higher in Ab-positive individuals ( Table 1) , only plasma Ab 42 /Ab 40 was an independent predictor of brain Ab in addition to age, APOE genotype, and cognitive testing. Plasma Ab 42 /Ab 40 was also the predictor with the highest accuracy in the univariate analysis ( Fig. 1B) . It increased the AUC in both the delayed recall and MMSE models ( Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table 1 ) and increased the AUC when replicated in ADNI (Fig. 2C-D and Supplementary Table 2 ). However, the clinical relevance of such a small increase in AUC is limited.\nAlso, assay-dependent differences, or possibly preanalytical factors, may have contributed to different levels in the cohorts (Table 1) . This highlights the need for an optimal unified analysis method for plasma Ab 42 /Ab 40 . Promising results with very high accuracies have been seen using mass spectrometry [45, 46] , but unfortunately this is an advanced and time-consuming technique that cannot be implemented in primary care or large screening settings in the near future.\nWe propose that the presented models could be useful in mainly two settings, clinical AD trials and primary care. In clinical trials aimed at Ab-positive subjects, amyloid risk models could reduce the number of unnecessary Ab PET scans or LPs. In Fig. 4 , we illustrate such a scenario using the delayed recall model. Here, we assume that 1000 Ab-positive subjects are to be included in a clinical trial where Ab PET is used to verify and assess the Ab burden. An amyloid risk screening process in a population similar to the BioFINDER cohort could reduce the number of unnecessary (negative) Ab PET scans by w90% and reduce the costs by .3.5 million USD [12, 47] , when using a probability cutoff of .80% for undergoing an Ab PET scan. In the trial scenario, the objective is thus to increase Ab prevalence of the eligible population (high specificity). On the other hand, in a primary care workup of cognitive impairment or in a scenario where anti-Ab drugs have become available, a high sensitivity may be preferred. Here, a probability threshold of around 30% would perhaps be more suitable to ensure a sensitivity of .90% (Fig. 4) . To facilitate such a use of the risk models, we have implemented them on http://amyloidrisk.com where age, APOE genotype, and cognitive test score can be entered to calculate the individual probability of being Ab positive. The website is only intended for research and education until further validation has been conducted, but we believe it can be a useful tool for deciding who should undergo further evaluation with LP or Ab PET to verify the presence of Ab pathology .  842  843  844  845  846  847  848  849  850  851  852  853  854  855  856  857  858  859  860  861  862  863  864  865  866  867  868  869  870  871  872  873  874  875  876  877  878  879  880  881  882  883  884  885  886  887  888  889  890  891  892  893  894  895  896  897  898  899  900  901  902   903  904  905  906  907  908  909  910  911  912  913 is providing funds to support ADNI clinical sites in Canada.

In this scenario, we assumed the same prevalence of Ab positivity as in the BioFINDER study and a trial design that required 1000 Ab1 subjects to be enrolled and Ab status verified using Ab PET (with an approximate cost of 4000 USD per PET scan [12, 47] ). The y-axis shows the total Ab PET cost, and the x-axis shows the probability of being Ab positive according to the delayed recall model (this probability output is available on http://amyloidrisk.com). The line in the graph shows the study cost as a function of the Ab probability, with the number needed to screen with the amyloid risk model on the left side (the prescreening process) and the number needed to undergo an Ab PET scan to verify the Ab status on the right side (normal trial screening process). The small costs for APOE genotyping (approximately 40 USD) and for administering the cognitive test were disregarded. The costs for verifying the Ab status using LP and CSF Ab42 analysis are approximately 10% of the costs for an Ab PET scan (in Europe) [47, 48] , so the costs on the y- "}]
