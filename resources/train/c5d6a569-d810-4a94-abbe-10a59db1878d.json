[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: A clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment is traditionally based on a single cognitive exam, but serial cognitive testing can be sensitive to subtle cognitive changes in asymptomatic individuals and inform cognitive trajectory. Objective: We evaluated the prognostic utility of identifying longitudinal neuropsychological decline along with single cognitive exam and Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in predicting dementia. We also examined brain volumetric differences based on decline trajectories. Method: Regression models quantified 12-month neuropsychological decline relative to normative expectations among nondemented older adults (N = 1,074). Progression to dementia over follow-up (18-120 months) was diagnosed using independent modes of assessment. Results: In Cox regression models controlling for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E4, and baseline cognitive diagnosis, neuropsychological decline predicted increased dementia risk, \u03c7 2 = 69.861, p < 0.001, odds ratio = 2.841, even after correction for CSF biomarkers (amyloid-\u2424, phosphorylated tau, total tau), \u03c7 2 = 26.365, p < 0.001, odds ratio = 2.283. Voxel-based morphometry analysis indicated smaller hippocampal and medial temporal volume in participants with neuropsychological decline. Conclusions: Longitudinal diagnosis of neuropsychological decline improved prognostic accuracy beyond single cognitive exam diagnoses and AD CSF biomarkers, even in asymptomatic older adults. Older adults with a trajectory of neuropsychological decline exhibit smaller medial temporal and hippocampal brain volume. Longitudinal diagnostic approaches may benefit selection and randomization procedures for AD clinical trials in asymptomatic individuals."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The vast majority of age-related dementias involve insidious cognitive decline that can be difficult to distinguish from normal aging [1] ; thus, identification of older adults at risk for dementia presents a challenge to prevention efforts. It is increasingly recognized that these insidious declines may occur even in adults with normal range cognition [2] [3] [4] [5] . Single exam diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cannot capture these subtle cognitive changes, and is an inherently unstable diagnosis that is of uncertain prognostic significance [1] .\nConsistent with recent changes to diagnostic guidelines for research, efforts are currently focused on treating individuals before symptoms emerge, underscoring the need for tools to assess subtle cognitive changes in asymptomatic individuals [6] . Detecting cognitive change within normal range performance requires serial cognitive testing, but there are several factors complicating interpretation of serial cognitive exams. Many tests show substantial practice effects that lead to improved scores on follow-up examinations [7] , and regression to the mean causes baseline scores more distal to the mean to trend toward the mean at followup [8] . Although normative-referenced scores are commonly employed to aid interpretation of raw neuropsychological scores at baseline, interpretation of serial exam scores is rarely anchored to normative data on expected serial exam performance in healthy individuals. Use of linear regression methods to determine expected change on serial exams in a robustly normal population may aid in efforts to characterize neuropsychological decline (NP decline) relative to expectations [8, 9] . Practice effects and regression to the mean would be reflected in these norm-referenced NP decline scores, making a lack of a practice effect a potential indicator of subtle decline, as suggested by prior research [10, 11] .\nNumerous studies support the value of decline on neuropsychological testing in the prediction of dementia [3, 12] , and prior work has related preclinical cognitive decline to biomarker abnormalities [13] [14] [15] . However, the vast majority of studies have focused on how biomarker-based pathological assessments influence preclinical decline [16, 17] , or have used methods that cannot operationalize NP decline in asymptomatic individuals who are performing within normal range [3, 12] . To our knowledge no studies have used a norm-referencing approach to examine whether longitudinal NP decline contributes to dementia prognosis beyond single exam cognitive diagnosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. We sought to determine whether longitudinal NP decline adds unique prognostic information and to provide a simple tool to identify older adults with and without NP decline on a standard 12-month follow-up examination. We used linear regression in a robustly normal sample to generate norm-referenced NP decline scores representing worse than expected performance at 12-month follow-up [8, 9] . These norm-referenced scores aid in the interpretation of neuropsychological performance over a one-year interval. In order to determine the value of our specific method, we also compared our results to the simpler approach of calculating norm-referenced change scores to quantify decline over 12 months. Finally, we also investigated differences in brain volumes between adults with and without NP decline in order to better understand the neuroanatomical basis for NP decline."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

Our linear regression-based approach was able to detect subtle cognitive changes that presaged ultimate risk for dementia, even in asymptomatic individuals showing normal range performance. The same approach identified pernicious cases of MCI with more rapid progression to dementia. Including longitudinal classification of NP decline in addition to baseline diagnosis and biomarker status will improve estimation of proximal dementia risk, particularly in asymptomatic cases. Notably, asymptomatic participants showing NP decline progressed to dementia at a rate similar to MCI patients showing no NP decline. This finding is consistent with the notion of a continuum of neuropsychological performance spanning the normal-to-mildly impaired range [2, 6, 25, 26] , and that the addition of quantitative information regarding longitudinal decline improves our ability to classify individuals who are performing near diagnostic thresholds.\nPrior studies have found that cognitively normal older adults who are biomarker positive for both CSF A\u2424 and P-tau are at increased risk for AD dementia [27] . According to recent research recommendations for neurocognitive staging of AD, these AD biomarker positive individuals without NP decline are Stage 1 and those with NP decline are Stage 2 [6] . The present study findings suggest that Stage 2 patients are at far greater risk for future dementia than Stage 1. Notably, older adults showing AD biomarker abnormalities are at increased risk for dementia, but the majority of that risk applies only to those who also exhibit NP decline. This may be due to the fact that current AD biomarkers do not account for a host of other co-morbid pathological factors likely contributing to overall dementia risk, including premorbid brain vulnerabilities and co-morbid brain pathologies [28] . Recent autopsy series have demonstrated that the most common form of dementia is due to multiple pathologies [29] , and over 200 different combinations of pathology were observed in a large autopsy series [30] . Cognitive reserve and other genetic, psychological and environmental factors are also known to limit the relationship between underlying pathology and its clinical manifestation [31, 32] . The resulting impact of NP decline on prognostic accuracy has enormous clinical consequences in terms of targeting treatment toward those at the greatest risk and limiting iatrogenic effects in those at low risk. As demonstrated, use of NP decline with AD biomarkers may improve prognostic accuracy in asymptomatic patients.\nThe current conceptualization of Stage 3 neurocognitive decline includes both abnormal baseline performance and evidence of longitudinal decline [6] , consistent with a tradition that makes no distinction between progressive and non-progressive forms of MCI [33] . Although an individual's absolute level of cognitive ability at baseline is likely to be a more powerful predictor of imminent dementia risk, as suggested by the greater odds ratios for baseline diagnosis versus decline status, this baseline ability presents an incomplete picture of an individual's overall risk in that it contains no information on cognitive trajectory. Premorbid cognitive ability, cultural/ethnic background, and linguistic variability limit the ability of baseline exams to optimally predict risk for dementia [34] . These factors may be less salient when evaluating within-subject variance from baseline to follow-up, suggesting NP decline may have value in evaluating more diverse populations. However, this remains an open question for future studies to evaluate using more ethnically diverse samples. There are no operationalized criteria for cognitive decline as described in the research recommendations for diagnosis and staging of neurocognitive decline in AD [6] . Subjective reports of cognitive decline are prone to errors [35] and reliable informants are not always available or able to notice subtle cognitive changes. For these and other reasons, serial neuropsychological data may be the favored method for establishing cognitive trajectories. However, the known influence of practice effects and regression to the mean makes clinical judgments based on raw score changes extremely difficult [7] . The present study demonstrates that the use of regression-based norming practices can aid in the interpretation of serial neuropsychological test data. We also provide normative regression equations and optimal cutoff values for ascertaining the presence or absence of NP decline, which may be of clinical and investigational value in patients and participants similar to those studied as part of ADNI. Although more research is needed across different populations and test batteries, the present approach provides a relatively simple framework that may be readily applied in clinical and research settings. This practice is analogous to the widely adopted method of norm-referenced demographic corrections, but adds a norm-referencing method for neuropsychological change over 12 months. Future studies may help determine whether regression, mixed modeling, simple change scores, or other approaches are the most appropriate for obtaining norm-referenced decline metrics, but the present study findings suggested regression-based methods may be superior to simple change scores.\nDespite the advantages of using neuropsychological markers as risk indicators for dementia, such an approach has also been understandably criticized for circularity since neuropsychological markers are often also used to arrive at a diagnosis of dementia. For this reason, the present study used independent modes of assessment to ascertain dementia diagnosis as the criterion measure. Thus, it is unlikely that shared methods variance alone can account for the study findings. The face validity of neuropsychological markers as indicators of cognitive impairment should not preclude their use as prognostic instruments, particularly since these markers predict progression over lengthy follow-up intervals in patients who are initially asymptomatic. Ultimately NP decline demonstrates considerable utility in predicting who will progress to dementia, indicating critical value for clinicians and scientists working with this population.\nPrior work has demonstrated correlations between hippocampal volume and both AD biomarkers [36, 37] and cognitive decline [37] during the early stages of the disease. Consistent with these findings, older adults with NP decline exhibited smaller regional baseline brain volumes than those without NP decline in a pattern that was remarkably specific to the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal regions. Although medial temporal regions are traditionally associated with memory functions and most attempts to identify preclinical decline have focused predominantly on memory measures [38] , we chose to use tests that also assessed executive function and semantic fluency. Recent studies have suggested more widespread impact of preclinical AD across neuropsychological domains [2] . Consistent with these findings, research recommendations acknowledge that AD-related cognitive impairment may involve widespread versus specific cognitive domain impairment [6, 25] . This may be particularly true for NP decline versus single exam findings since subthreshold declines may occur across domains. Increased reliability is another advantage of global composites that average scores across domains, which may improve the likelihood of detected subtle cognitive changes. Future studies should use longitudinal and multimodal imaging to identify additional structural and functional characteristics of early NP decline, improving our understanding of the neuropathology underlying progressive forms of cognitive impairment.\nSingle exam diagnosis or biomarker-only evaluations are not likely to yield accurate prediction of when an individual will progress to dementia. Inclusion of asymptomatic individuals with no NP decline in clinical trials may require much larger samples and greatly extended follow-up due to high variability in progression rates. This leads to increased costs and delayed progress toward predicting and preventing dementia, as well as exposure of low risk individuals to potentially detrimental medication side effects. If additional studies can establish widely accepted standards for establishing cognitive trajectories, trial design may be improved by adding cognitive trajectory to single exam diagnoses to further classify participant risk.\nStudy limitations include the ADNI sample being comprised of relatively highly educated and demographically homogenous individuals recruited from over 50 sites across the US and Canada with variable sampling bias and methodology, and inclusion/exclusion criteria that limited comorbid neuropathological factors. Extension of the present study findings in larger community-based samples may further support the predictive utility of NP decline as a prognostic supplement to biomarkers and baseline cognitive diagnosis. Another potential limitation was the inclusion of robustly normal participants in both the generation of NP decline prediction equations and the testing of those equations as predictors of future dementia. However, we were able to replicate the main study findings in sub-analysis that excluded the robustly normal participants used to generate the equations, alleviating concern that circularity may have influenced our results. An additional concern may be raised regarding the application of normative regression equations to both cognitively normal and MCI cases since these two groups would have different anticipated cognitive trajectories. We chose to use normative models for both groups in an effort to not only predict future dementia in patients who are initially normal, but also to improve the prognostic value of MCI diagnosis, an inherently unstable category. Future studies will also evaluate whether use of 3 time-points further improves evaluation of NP decline, determine the degree to which individual tests contribute to overall decline prediction, and further characterize heterogeneity in patterns of decline across MCI subtypes."}]
