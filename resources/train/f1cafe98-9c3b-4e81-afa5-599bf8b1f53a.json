[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. Several studies have differentiated Alzheimer's disease (AD) using cerebral image features derived from MR brain images. In this study, we were interested in combining hippocampus and amygdala volumes and entorhinal cortex thickness to improve the performance of AD differentiation. Thus, our objective was to investigate the useful features obtained from MRI for classification of AD patients using support vector machine (SVM). T1-weighted MR brain images of 100 AD patients and 100 normal subjects were processed using FreeSurfer software to measure hippocampus and amygdala volumes and entorhinal cortex thicknesses in both brain hemispheres. Relative volumes of hippocampus and amygdala were calculated to correct variation in individual head size. SVM was employed with five combinations of features (H: hippocampus relative volumes, A: amygdala relative volumes, E: entorhinal cortex thicknesses, HA: hippocampus and amygdala relative volumes and ALL: all features). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the method. AUC values of five combinations were 0.8575 (H), 0.8374 (A), 0.8422 (E), 0.8631 (HA) and 0.8906 (ALL). Although \"ALL\" provided the highest AUC, there were no statistically significant differences among them except for \"A\" feature.

The incidence of AD is strongly related with the age; therefore, AD becomes one of the major public health problems in countries with the longer life expectancy [1, 2] . To diagnose AD, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of imaging techniques which allows quantitative estimation of brain features for assessing AD in a non-invasive way [3] . Nevertheless, in routine clinical practice, subjective estimating the degree of AD by analyzing the morphological changes on MR images is very difficult and time-consuming [2] , then various computer-aided diagnosis methods for AD have been developed to assist the radiologists in evaluating MR images. Many cerebral image features have been used to classify AD patients such as cortical thickness, volume and shape of gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid and hippocampus [4] [5] [6] . In this study, the classification of AD patients and normal subjects were performed by supplying the cerebral image features obtained from MRI including hippocampus volume, amygdala volume and entorhinal cortex thickness as input to the support vector machine (SVM)."}, {"section_title": "Subjects and MR data", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org. According to ADNI, T1-weighted (MPRAGE) sequence with 1.2 mm thickness were acquired from study volunteers using standard ADNI protocols (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). In this paper, T1-weighted MR brain images of 100 AD patients (47 females and 53 males, age range: 56-89 years, mean age: 74 years) and those of 100 normal subjects (53 females and 47 males, age range: 56-89 years, mean age: 74 years) were studied. Figure 1 represents an overall scheme of proposed method. First, T1-weighted MR brain images were processed using FreeSurfer software to measure cerebral image features including hippocampus and amygdala volumes and entorhinal cortex thicknesses in both brain hemispheres. Next, the relative volumes of hippocampus and amygdala were calculated by using total intracranial volume (TIV) to normalize the effect of individual head size. Then, cerebral image features were used as input into the SVM for classification of AD patients and normal subjects.

In subcortical-based stream, FreeSurfer automatically assigned a neuroanatomical label to each voxel in MRI volume based on probabilistic information estimated from a manually labeled training set [7] . Figure 2 (a) represents an example of hippocampus and amygdala regions labeled by using FreeSurfer. To measure entorhinal cortex thickness, FreeSurfer constructed models of boundary between gray matter and white matter as well as between gray matter and pia matter overlaid on original brain volume [8] as shown in figure 2(b) . The distance between two surfaces was computed and considered as the thickness at each location of cortex.

The advantage of the proposed method is its achievably high discriminant ability. The overall process includes feature extraction and classification which can be performed automatically using open source software together with T1-weighted MR brain images. However, the limitation of this study is the relatively small number of subjects used in the classification training step. The larger number of subjects may be included for the training process in the future studies.
