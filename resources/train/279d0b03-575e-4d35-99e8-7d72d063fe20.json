Though these methods offer several advantages, manual ROI methods have limited clinical use because they do not allow for the timely analysis of regions across the entire brain or in large datasets while many whole brain approaches cannot evaluate the disease state in a single individual. More recent ROI and whole brain studies have demonstrated that automated MRI-based computational measures can successfully discriminate those MCI individuals who progress to AD from those MCI individuals who do not progress (Bakkour et al., 2009; Misra et al., 2009; Querbes et al., 2009; Vemuri et al., 2009) . However, only a handful of studies have attempted to examine the time to progress from MCI to AD and most of these have used manual ROI approaches (Desikan et al., 2009a; Devanand et al., 2007; Jack et al., 1999) .\nAdvances in image analysis algorithms have led to the development of structural MRI-based software tools that can automatically parcellate the entire brain into anatomic regions and quantify the tissue properties in these regions for a single individual (Desikan et al., 2006; Desikan et al., 2009b; Fischl et al., 2002) . In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using these automated MRI-based software tools as a predictive marker for AD. Using baseline MRI scans from 162 MCI individuals, we employed factor analyses and Cox proportional hazards models to identify a set of neuroanatomic regions that best predicted the time to progress from MCI to AD. We then examined the predictive consistency of these automated MRI measures on a second cohort of 162 MCI individuals.

The degree of clinical severity for each participant was evaluated by an annual semi-structured interview. This interview generates both an overall Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score and a measure known as the CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) (Morris, 1993) . Experienced clinicians conducted independent semi-structured interviews with the participant and a knowledgeable collateral source, which included a set of questions regarding the functional status of the participant, along with a standardized neurologic, psychiatric, and health examination. The MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975) and a complete neuropsychological battery were also conducted.\nParticipants were selected from the ADNI database if they were clinically classified as the amnestic subtype of MCI, based on the revised MCI criteria (Petersen, 2004) . These included individuals with MMSE scores between 24 and 30, a subjective memory complaint verified by an informant, objective memory loss as measured by education adjusted performance on the Logical Memory II subscale (delayed paragraph recall) of the Wechsler Memory ScaleRevised (Wechsler, 1987) , a CDR of 0.5, absence of significant levels of impairment in other cognitive domains, essentially preserved activities of daily living, and an absence of dementia. From a total of over 400 MCI individuals available from the ADNI database, 324 individuals with the amnestic subtype of MCI were selected.

A single, raw MPRAGE MRI acquisition for each participant was downloaded from the ADNI database and normalized for intensity inhomogeneities to create an image volume with high contrast-to-noise (Dale et al., 1999) . This volume was used to locate the gray/white matter boundary (white matter surface) (Fischl et al., 1999a ) and this in turn, was then used to locate the gray/CSF boundary (gray matter surface) (Fischl and Dale, 2000) . Cortical thickness measurements were then obtained by calculating the distance between the gray and the white matter surfaces at each point (per hemisphere) across the entire cortical mantle (Fischl and Dale, 2000) .\nThis cortical thickness measurement technique has been previously validated via histological (Rosas et al., 2002) as well as manual measurements from MRI (Salat et al., 2004) . The reliability of these cortical thickness measures as well as the other image analysis procedures presented here has been demonstrated across different scanner manufacturers and upgrades, varying contrast with noise ratio, and the number of MPRAGE MRI acquisitions used (FennemaNotestine et al., 2007; Han et al., 2006; Jovicich et al., 2009) .\nThe neocortex of the brain on the MRI scans was then automatically subdivided into 32 gyral-based ROIs (per hemisphere, total of 64 neocortical measures). To accomplish this, a registration procedure was used that aligns the cortical folding patterns (Fischl et al., 1999b) and probabilistically assigns every point on the cortical surface to one of the 32 ROIs (Desikan et al., 2006) . In addition, two nonneocortical regions of the brain, namely the amygdala and the hippocampus, were automatically delineated using an algorithm that examines variations in voxel intensities and spatial relationships to classify non-neocortical regions on MRI scans .\nThe anatomic accuracy of the gray and white matter surfaces as well as each of the individual ROIs was carefully reviewed by a trained neuroanatomist (RSD), with particular attention to the medial temporal lobe where nonbrain tissue, such as dura mater and temporal bone, often needs to be excluded. Of note, none of the herein presented 324 datasets required any manual editing. All the MRI scans were processed on a Linux cluster with 128 nodes, each with a two quad-core Xeon 5472 CPU (Intel Corporation, Santa Clara CA, USA) and 32 GB of RAM. Processing time for each MRI scan was approximately 11-14 hours. This cluster allows for the processing of 1,024 MRI scans simultaneously and all 324 MRI scans used in the present study were processed in one day.\nIn total, 34 neocortical and non-necortical ROIs were used in this study. For all the analyses performed here, the mean thickness (only neocortical regions) and the volume (only non-neocortical regions) of the right and the left hemispheres, for each ROI, were added together.

Methods for FDG-PET data collection and analysis using ROIs have been reported previously for this sample (Jagust et al., 2009) . In brief, FDG-PET data were first intensity normalized to a reference ROI that was comprised of the averaged pons and cerebellar vermis. For the FDG-PET analyses, ROIs were defined using coordinates from the Montreal Neurological Institute atlas. Each individual's PET scan was then spatially normalized to the SPM5 PET template, and mean FDG counts were extracted from each ROI. These ROI mean counts were then averaged to form a single \"composite\" FDG ROI that was the variable used in all FDG-PET analyses. For the purposes of the present study, we used ROIs from bilateral inferior temporal and angular gyri as well as posterior cingulate and precuneus cortices since prior studies have demonstrated significant differences between AD individuals and normal elderly controls in these regions (for details see Jagust et al., 2009 ).

First, a correlation matrix was generated using Pearson's r to determine the correlation coefficient between the individual ROI measures. Those measures with very strong relationships (r \u03fe .80) were removed from further analyses (Pett et al., 2003) . Next, the factors along with their loading coefficients and the cumulative variance of the factors were extracted from the analysis. We applied a minimum eigenvalue criterion of 1.0 together with the examination of a scree plot to determine how many factors to retain and these were rotated (varimax) to maximize the relationship between variables. The factor loadings derived from the training cohort ROI measures were then applied to the validation cohort ROI measures.\nThe automated MRI-derived factors, along with the PET and CSF measures, were further analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. These analyses tested whether specific predictors (e.g. medial temporal factor) are associated with time to a diagnosis of AD. In these models, the hazard ratio indicates the change in risk per 1 unit change in the predictor. For instance, if the hazard ratio is 0.43 for the medial temporal factor, each 1 SD decrease in the volume and thickness of this factor increases risk by 57%.\nThe primary focus of these survival analyses was time from study entry to the endpoint of interest, which was the diagnosis of AD. All proportional hazards models included age, education, gender, and APOE-4 carrier status as covariates. For the training cohort, we entered the automated MRI-derived factors into a multivariate Cox model to determine which of these measures best predicted the time to diagnosis. Then, for the validation cohort, we entered only those neuroanatomic factors that were the best predictors in the training cohort data into a second proportional hazards model and compared the respective hazard ratios derived from the training and validation cohorts for each of these measures. To determine the prediction accuracy of these neuroanatomic factors, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios individually for the training and validation cohorts.\nIn an additional set of analyses, we entered the individual CSF biomarkers and FDG-ROIs into separate Cox models to determine if these measures predicted time to diagnosis. Given the small number of combined available measurement for the CSF and PET measures (total MCI \u03ed 78, MCI-Converters \u03ed 30, MCI-Nonconverters \u03ed 48), we pooled together data from the training and validation cohorts for these proportional hazards analyses. Prediction accuracies for the combined CSF and PET measures that best predicted time to event were calculated as described above. Individual CSF and PET measures significant at the \u03fd 0.05 alpha level were combined with those automated MRIderived factors that best predicted time to event and entered into a final Cox model to determine which individual measures, in combination, best predicted time to AD diagnosis. For each of the multivariate Cox models, we descriptively evaluated the proportional hazards assumption by checking whether the negative log of survival probabilities associated with higher levels of each independent variable were constant multiples of those of the lower levels, across the entire range of event time. In addition we tested interaction terms that included the log of time to further verify the assumption of proportional hazards."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The factor analysis on the training cohort ROI measures first revealed that none of the measures demonstrated a Pearson's r of greater than 0.8 and therefore all ROI measures were included for further analyses.

To ensure that the results presented here were not subject to sample size related issues, we evaluated the four neuroanatomic factors as predictors in an independent Cox model using only those MCI individuals with CSF and PET measures (total MCI \u03ed 78, MCI-Converters \u03ed 30, MCINonconverters \u03ed 48) and found that for this smaller subsample, the medial temporal factor continued to demonstrate significant effects [HR \u03ed 0.40 {95% CI, 0.19 -0.58},\nThe probability of progressing from MCI to AD based on the value of the medial temporal factor (volume and thickness), derived from the training and validation cohorts, is illustrated using predicted survival plots based on the multivariate Cox models (Figure 3 ). Based on these models, by 3 years from baseline, an MCI individual with a medial temporal factor value at the MCI average has a 44% to 52% probability of progressing to AD. In comparison, by 3 years from baseline, an MCI individual with a medial temporal factor value 1 SD below the MCI average has a 74% to 85% probability of progressing to AD and an MCI individual with a medial temporal factor value 1 SD above the MCI average has a 22% to 28% probability of progressing to AD."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "These results demonstrate that automated MRI measurements of medial temporal cortex thickness and volume successfully predict the time to progress from MCI to AD, demonstrate robust reliability and consistency across multiple cohorts, and outperform CSF and PET measures as predictors of clinical disease progression. Taken together, these findings indicate the importance of using automated MRI-based software tools as a predictive marker for Alzheimer's disease.\nAutomated MRI measures can successfully quantify the risk associated with progressing to AD. Among MCI individuals, atrophy of the medial temporal factor regions (consisting primarily of entorhinal cortex thickness, hippocampal volume, amygdala volume, temporal pole thickness, and parahippocampal gyrus thickness) was associated with a greater than 50% risk increase in the training and validation Fig. 3 .

Based on these multivariate models, by 3 years from baseline, MCI individuals with significant atrophy of the medial temporal factor regions (1 SD below the MCI average) are three times as likely to progress to AD, compared with MCI individuals with preserved medial temporal factor regions (1 SD above the MCI average). These time to progress risk assessments are consistent with prior structural MRI studies of MCI progression using the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (Apostolova et al., 2006; Desikan et al., 2009a; Devanand et al., 2007; Jack et al., 1999; Kantarci et al., 2009 ) and demonstrate that limbic and pro-isocortical regions, such as the amygdala and temporal pole, are additionally important as predictors for the earliest stages of AD.\nThe results presented here indicate that unbiased dimension reduction approaches, such as factor analyses, can be used on a large number of automated MRI measures to derive a set of neuroanatomic factors that can successfully predict the time to progress from MCI to AD. The fact that the regions of the 1) medial temporal, 2) frontal parietal, 3) lateral temporal, and 4) frontal cingulate cortices combined together to form individual factors is consistent with the hierarchical pathology of AD (Arnold et al., 1991; Braak and Braak, 1991; Kemper, 1994) and suggests the potential of using automated MRI measures for the in vivo staging of Alzheimer's pathology. As disease predictors, though the value of the hazard ratios were comparable in magnitude, the narrow confidence intervals for the individual neuroanatomic factors, compared with the wide confidence intervals for the individual ROIs (data not presented), indicates that factor based automated MRI assessments are more precise than individual ROIs for quantifying the risk associated with disease progression.\nThe results from the multivariate proportional hazards models further illustrate that the training cohort derived medial temporal factor loadings are highly consistent and reproducible. In predicting the time to progress from MCI to AD, the hazard ratio for the medial temporal factor was similar across the training and validation cohorts indicating the reliability of this measure across multiple MCI cohorts. In contrast, the hazard ratio for the lateral temporal factor was different across the training and validation cohorts suggesting that for disease prediction this measure is not as reliable as the medial temporal factor. Furthermore, when the medial temporal factor regions were used for estimating survival, a similar number of MCI individuals from the training and validation cohorts progressed to AD at 1, 2, and 3 years from baseline. This shows that the training cohort derived medial temporal factor loading values are clinically applicable and can be used for predicting disease progression in populations other than that from which the training cohort were drawn.\nAs a predictor of clinical disease progression, atrophy of the medial temporal cortex outperforms cellular measures of pathology and metabolic assessments of the cerebral cortex. Though CSF-based A\u2424 1-42 and PET-based metabolic measurements from the inferior temporal cortex individually predicted progression to AD, when combined with the neuroanatomic factors, these measures could not predict clinical decline as successfully as the medial temporal factor. These findings are in accordance with prior MCI studies demonstrating better disease prediction with structural neuroimaging markers than either CSF (Vemuri et al., 2009) or PET measures (Walhovd et al., 2009) , although a recent meta-analysis did find that PET is a slightly better disease predictor than MRI (Yuan et al., 2009) . Given the high negative predictive value of 92% and the low negative likelihood ratio of 0.13, these findings suggest the potential for using CSF and PET measures as a potential screening tool. However, given the comparable AUC and positive predictive value for the combined CSF, PET and MRI measures compared with the MRI measures alone (both for the training and validation cohorts), our results suggest that further studies are needed to determine whether the diagnostic benefits of using multiple modalities outweigh the costs.\nWhy do morphometric measures of atrophy better predict disease progression than cellular or metabolic markers of pathology? One explanation may involve the temporal evolution of the AD disease process where A\u2424 and metabolic changes precede gray matter disturbances (Frisoni et al., 2010; Jack et al., 2010) . Recent studies have shown that amyloid deposition is present before the onset of cognitive decline ) and potentially contributes to metabolic and network-wide disruptions within cerebral cortical regions (Buckner et al., 2005 Hedden et al., 2009 ). As such, A\u2424 and FDG-PET measures are likely more useful earlier in the disease process, possibly as a screening tool, than as a late predictive marker of MCI progression. Another explanation could be that automated MRI-based measures are a more stable indicator of long-term neuronal injury than CSF or FDG-PET markers. Structural MRI measures are not subject to diurnal variation, unlike proteins measured from the cerebrospinal fluid (De Leon et al., 2002) and likely reflect neuronal loss better than metabolic measures, which largely indicate fluctuations in synaptic activity and action potential propagation (Attwell and Laughlin, 2001) .\nThe methods described here can be implemented in a clinical setting as a predictive marker for AD. Using these software tools a single volumetric baseline T1-weighted MRI scan can be completely processed, with minimal manual intervention. The factor loadings presented here can then be applied to the final output values of entorhinal cortex thickness, hippocampal volume, amygdala volume, temporal pole thickness, and parahippocampal gyrus thickness to quantify the 1, 2, and 3 year probability of a single individual progressing from MCI to AD.\nThe present study has limitations. This study was conducted on a carefully examined cohort of MCI individuals selected using criteria for inclusion in clinical trials. As such, these results need to be validated on a larger, community-based, volunteer cohort that would be more representative of a clinical setting. A second limitation is the relatively short follow-up times, which could have resulted in including individuals with a greater degree of impairment thus increasing the likelihood of finding significant differences. Prior work from our group has shown that MRI measures can successfully predict progression to AD in milder MCI individuals with longer follow-up times (greater than 5 years) (Desikan et al., 2009a) . Considered together, these results suggest that MRI measures have significant value as a predictive marker both in the early and later stages of disease progression. Another concern is that the smaller sample size of MCI individuals with PET and CSF measures may contribute to decreased power and nonsignificant effects for these two measures compared with the medial temporal factor. In an independent Cox model using only those MCI individuals with PET and CSF measures, the medial temporal factor continued to demonstrate a significant effect, comparable in magnitude (Hazards Ratio of 0.40) to the risk noted in the larger training (Hazards Ratio of 0.43) and validation cohorts (Hazards Ratio of 0.44) indicating that the main findings from this study are likely not subject to sample size related issues.\nThe early identification and prediction of those cognitively impaired individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease is of significant importance as therapies for altering the course of the illness or delaying dementia onset are developed. The results from this study demonstrates that automated MRI-based neuroanatomic measures can identify individuals in the earliest stages of the disease process and have promise in the clinical setting as a biomarker for tracking Alzheimer's disease progression."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "The authors have no actual or potential conflicts of interest."}]
