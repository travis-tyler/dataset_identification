Latest data from the United States (US) Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that as of 24 th September 2020, a total of 23,222 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 have been reported in the US alone 2 .\nWhile the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy and pregnant women are still not fully understood, studies based on other respiratory infections including influenza, pneumonia and middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) have indicated that changes in normal physiological and immunological functions, as well as hormonal levels during pregnancy may heighten the risk of severe illness [3] [4] [5] . Recent studies have shown that despite having relatively milder symptoms than the general population 6 , pregnant women with COVID-19 are at increased risk of hospitalization and admission to intensive care units 7 .\nThere are however, some unanswered issues of concern. First, there is a lack of evidence on whether pregnant women who were hospitalized had underlying conditions that made them more susceptible, as compared to those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 but not hospitalized. Second, the use of medications among pregnant women in the management of COVID-19 is also a topic of concern. While the efficacy and safety of many therapies are being actively evaluated in clinical trials, pregnant women are often excluded from these trials due to safety concerns, meaning there is a paucity of evidence around drug use in this vulnerable population. Third, with the simultaneous circulation of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza, it is also crucial to understand how the clinical manifestations and outcomes differ between COVID-19 and influenza patients to facilitate differential diagnosis and improve clinical management.\nWhile the number of publications on COVID-19 in pregnancy has increased rapidly over time, most of these published studies are single center case reports, case series and observational studies with small sample sizes. A recent living systematic review among pregnant women with COVID-19 showed that of the 77 studies included, only 4 studies had a sample size of >1000 6 .\nIn our study, we aim to bridge existing gaps in the literature by describing the baseline sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, presenting symptoms, 30-day use of medications and outcomes of pregnant women diagnosed with and hospitalized for COVID-19. We also compare these with symptoms and outcomes seen amongst pregnant women diagnosed with influenza as a benchmark, in view of how many professional bodies are currently advocating pregnant women to receive their influenza vaccine with urgency 8, 9 . .

Other symptoms such as dyspnea and malaise were similarly common in COVID-19 diagnosed and COVID-19 hospitalized patients (Figure 3a) . When compared across all databases, the three most common symptoms amongst pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 were cough (from 1.2% [SIDIAP] to 13.3% [HV]), dyspnea (from 3.5% [CUIMC] to 8.0% [IQVIA-OpenClaims]), and fever (from 0.9% [SIDIAP] to 8.7% [HV]) respectively (Supplementary Figure 1a) .

Spontaneous abortion or miscarriages were similar in both cohorts (1.6%). The percentage of stillbirth was 0.1% in the COVID-19 diagnosed cohort (Figure 5a ). Similar risks were observed in Optum (Supplementary Figure 2a) . Compared to influenza, those diagnosed with COVID-19 in IQVIA-OpenClaims had a modestly higher proportions of livebirths (15.8% vs. 10.8%), cesarean-section (4.4% vs 3.1%), and preterm deliveries (0.9% vs 0.5%), but not of spontaneous abortion (1.6% vs 1.9%). The proportion of stillbirth was similar in both cohorts (0.1%) (Figure 5a ).\nMaternal complications in pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 (all from IQVIA-OpenClaims) included: pneumonia (12.0%), ARDS (4.0%), chest pain/angina (2.2%) and sepsis (2.1%).

Use of systemic corticosteroids was high, and could be partially attributable to pregnancy-related indications such as accelerating fetal lung development in pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery, or to maternal disease e.g. asthma exacerbations. In addition, nearly 1 in 4 hospitalized pregnant women were on antithrombotics, most likely as a prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism. Use of immunoglobulins was also high (nearly 1 in 5), although due to the nature of our study, we did not have the granularity in data to determine if they were anti-D immunoglobulin (used to neutralized Rhesus D positive antigens that may have entered the mother's blood during pregnancy), or for the off-label use in the treatment of COVID-19. Use of famotidine was also high, possibility for the treatment of COVID-19 19, 20 , and also for the treatment of heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease in pregnancy, or for the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in hospitalized patients. Approximately 1 in 4 hospitalized pregnant women were also on azithromycin. The safety on the use of azithromycin in pregnancy is debatable as some studies have found a higher risk of birth defects 21 , while others have reported no increased risk [22] [23] [24] . While azithromycin may been prescribed for pneumonia, there is also a possibility that azithromycin was prescribed in combination with hydroxychloroquine, due to alleged antiviral efficacy against COVID-19. Despite the widespread use in the initial stage of the pandemic, we now know that this combination is not effective and potentially harmful 25 . Our study has added insight to prescribing patterns among pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, especially in the early months of the pandemic when it was not well understood which medications were truly effective. Our findings should however, be interpreted with caution as we were not able to determine the specific indication of these medications (i.e. prescribed for COVID-19 treatment or other pregnancy-related indication), or the stage of pregnancy at which these medications were administered.\nIn terms of 30-day pregnancy-related outcomes, our study findings were consistent with other published literature 6 . Overall, the proportion of cesarean-section and preterm births was higher in the hospitalized cohort than the diagnosed cohort, but this could in part be explained by hospital-based pre-scheduled cesarean-sections and preterm births leading to testing and hence COVID-19 diagnosis. This matches the baseline characteristics from this study, where the highest percentage of COVID-19 in the diagnosed and hospitalized cohorts were in the third trimester. The proportion of stillbirth was very low, consistent with a recently published systematic review 6 . Although rare in our study, women diagnosed with COVID-19 had slightly higher proportions of caesarean section and preterm births but similar proportions of stillbirth compared to pregnant women with influenza.\nThe proportion of various maternal complications varied across databases, though pneumonia and ARDS were consistently reported as the most common outcomes, seen in 2% to 12% and 1% to 4% of COVID-19 diagnosed women, respectively, across databases. While the magnitude of our findings was lower than that reported in previous studies, the most common maternal complications identified were identical 6 . Fatality was negligible (<5 women died in any of the participating databases), in line with a recent systematic review 6 . Age (mostly <40) and the modulating and anti-inflammatory actions of estradiol and progesterone have been proposed as the key reasons underlying the observed low COVID-19 fatality in pregnant women 26 . As expected, outcomes were worse amongst women diagnosed with COVID-19 who needed hospitalization: 1 in 4 developed pneumonia, 1 in 8 ARDS. When comparing pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 and with influenza, maternal outcomes were worse in the former, with almost double risk of hospitalization, a 6-fold higher risk of pneumonia, >10-fold higher risk of ARDS, 3-fold higher risk of sepsis, 6-fold higher risk of AKI, and a 4-fold higher risk of arrhythmia, heart failure, .

Most pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the US were in the age range of 20-39 years old, while France and Spain reported a high proportion of women 40 or older. The pattern is consistent with trends from other published literature. One recent CDC study reported approximately onefifth of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the US were in the 35-44 age range 7 , while in France, approximately one-third of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 were above 35 14 , and in Spain, approximately half of the pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 were above 35 15 16 . We are however, unable to determine whether our finding is a reflection of the baseline age range difference during pregnancy between countries, or whether because these women were older and pregnant which placed them at greater risk of being infected with COVID-19.\nRegarding previous comorbidities, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes were more prevalent in our hospitalized cohort, in line with previous literature 6 . Renal impairment and anemia were also more common in the COVID-19 hospitalized cohort, again indicating higher disease severity or worse outcomes than the COVID-19 diagnosed cohort. Anxiety was highly prevalent amongst pregnant women with COVID-19 in our study, which aligned well with another COVID-19 study, conducted in Canada by Lebel C et al 17 . The study reported that pregnant women suffered high rates of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, in part due to social isolation, concerns about availability of prenatal care, relationship strains, and concerns about threats of COVID-19 and associated therapies and outcomes to their baby 17 . Back pain was also common among our diagnosed COVID-19 cohort, which are usually occurring during normal pregnancy.\nWhile there is heterogeneity in the presentation of symptoms across databases, there is a consistent appearance of cough, fever and dyspnea on index date in both the COVID-19 diagnosed and COVID-19 hospitalized cohorts. Our findings are consistent with previous studies 6, 7 . The frequency of reported symptoms in our study is generally lower than in other studies, suggesting an underestimation in the coding of symptoms in the form of structured data in busy actual care settings. It is also possible that many of those diagnosed (or hospitalized) may have been seen for pregnancy-related issues (e.g. prenatal visit, preterm delivery or contractions), with COVID-19 being diagnosed due to standard screening procedures, therefore increasing the proportion of asymptomatic diagnoses. We compared symptoms and outcomes of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 with those diagnosed with influenza for benchmarking purposes. Cough, fever and myalgia were more commonly reported in pregnant women with influenza, which is not surprising, as these are well-known flu symptoms. One key finding in our study is that, while the percentages are small, symptoms such as dyspnea and anosmia were more common in COVID-19 diagnosed pregnant women than in pregnant women diagnosed with influenza, which aligns with what is known about COVID-19. This information is clinically relevant for differential diagnosis especially during the influenza season when COVID-19 and influenza may coexist. In addition, this information is also essential from an epidemiological perspective, as COVID-19 is known to remain contagious for a longer period of time after a positive test than influenza 18 .\n.

Firstly, the use of routinely collected data (EHR and claims) consistently leads to an underestimation of absolute risks due to incomplete recording of symptoms and potentially some comorbidities 22 . Secondly, the lack of information on or misclassification of indication for a given therapy makes it difficult to differentiate medications used for the treatment of COVID-19 vs the treatment of pregnancy-related indication. Corticosteroids are an example of a prescription commonly observed in our data that could be the consequence of respiratory distress due to COVID-19 but also potentially for the acceleration of fetal lung development in women at risk of preterm delivery. Similarly, hospitalization is reported primarily as a consequence of COVID-19 diagnosis, but it is also likely to be concomitant with a COVID-19 diagnosis. For example, in the US, many centers began universal screening of all pregnant women presenting to the hospital regardless of reason (i.e. spontaneous labor, schedule cesareans, or evaluation of other pregnancy related condition) or presence of symptoms after early reports from New York cited asymptomatic COVID-19 positive testing rates of 14-66% 28, 29 . Finally, disparities in data sources due to different countries and healthcare settings may result in important differences in coding practice, making comparisons between databases difficult and increasing ranges in the observed frequencies for comorbidities, symptoms and outcomes. However, comparisons versus influenza were done in a single, very large database, which reinforces internal validity of these comparisons.\nThis study also has strengths. The use of a common data model, centrally developed programs and a distributed network strategy allowed us to consistently harmonize and analyze the largest dataset on pregnant women with COVID-19 to date, including almost 8,600 women from three countries in two continents. Such large sample size allows greater power to capture less common events, including organ failure (e.g., AKI) and VTE events. Another strength is the relative speed with which such a large study was completed, which is key in a rapidly evolving public health crisis. The use of routinely collected data allows for a realistic characterization of actual practice in busy clinical settings through the minimization of selection bias and Hawthorne effects 30 . In addition, the use of existing data is efficient, maximizes the value of readily available information and enables inclusion of wider populations compared to primary data collection studies that tend to focus on academic and specialized treatment 31 ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this large international cohort of pregnant women with COVID-19, previous renal impairment and anemia appeared associated with hospitalization. Anosmia and dyspnea were indicative symptoms of COVID-19, potentially helpful for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in pregnant women. Regarding their management, we listed multiple medications used to treat inpatient pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, many of them with low evidence of antiviral efficacy. As more data becomes available, we hope to see a shift to use of treatments that are demonstrated to be safe and effective in pregnant women, a population vulnerable to adverse drug reactions.
