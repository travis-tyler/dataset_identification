The lava level ranged between 30 and 75 m below the floor of Halema'uma'u Crater and tracked summit tilt ( fig. 4). The lake surface consisted of black crustal plates separated by narrow incandescent cracks, and the plates normally moved from north to south. Small collapses occasionally occurred in the crater, often involving sections of the lava veneer (sometimes building an inner ledge) that fell from the crater walls into the lake when the lake level dropped during large deflation-inflation (DI) events. Relatively small collapses of the Overlook crater rim and upper wall occurred sporadically throughout the year, producing minor enlargement of the Overlook crater dimensions. Based on a structure-from-motion model built from overflight images captured on December 18, 2014, the Overlook crater size was 220 m by 170 m, which is only a minor enlargement (about 4 percent, in terms of linear distance) since the last lidar measurement on December 17, 2013 (when the Overlook crater was about 212 m by 164 m). The 220 m dimension is measured from the northwest rim to the southeast rim, below the Halema'uma'u Overlook, where the rim is irregular and overhanging; thus the measurement is slightly subjective. Adding the extra span beneath the overhang increases the long axis of the crater to about 225 m."}, {"section_title": "Changes in Lava Level", "text": "Fluctuations of the level of the lava lake spanned several timescales. Over minutes to hours, gas piston events (driving spattering and non-spattering transitions) caused the lake level to change by a few meters. Over days to weeks, the lava level followed summit tilt closely, and often exhibited changes related to DI events. During June and August, however, there was a DI event that was not expressed by the lava level ( fig. 4). This lack of correspondence is unusual and deserves further study. We suspect that it was related to the possible small intrusion that occurred in early May into K\u012blauea's upper Southwest Rift Zone, or perhaps an adjustment of the summit to the new East Rift Zone vent elevation for the June 27th flow. At its lowest, the lava level was 75 m below the Overlook crater rim, and at its highest it was 30 m below the rim ( fig. 3). Overall, there was no long-term trend to the lava level during 2014."}, {"section_title": "Spattering and Lake Surface Motion", "text": "Spattering was common in the summit lava lake but could abruptly terminate when the lake entered non-spattering phases. We previously called the non-spattering periods \"inactive\" phases, with the spattering periods called \"active\" phases, but \"inactive\" is a misleading characterization of the lake in this context. As usual, the non-spattering phases corresponded to greatly reduced tremor and a very weak, wispy plume, presumably due to a decrease in lake outgassing. Observations from the Halema'uma'u Overlook found that rockfalls impacting the lava lake-even those too small to produce an obvious seismic signal-could initiate a transition from a non-spattering to a spattering phase. This shows that Figure 1. The lava lake in the Overlook crater on February 1, 2014. The lava level is about 50 m below the Overlook crater rim (that is, below the floor of Halema'uma'u Crater).

The blue lava level data represent hourly manual measurements from the HTcam images that have been converted to absolute elevation using laser rangefinder measurements (red dots). rockfalls, even when too small to be observed or resolved from the seismic records, are nevertheless capable of influencing lava lake dynamics. During spattering phases, the spatter source was most commonly located along the southeast margin of the lake ( fig.  1), but spattering could also appear in other sections of the lake, particularly when lava veneer would collapse into the lake (which was common during dropping lava levels associated with deflation). In all cases, the surface crust in the area around the spattering tended to be drawn towards the spatter source, where it would be consumed and sink. During 2014, the typical lake surface motion was roughly from north to south ( fig. 5). The upwelling area is along the north margin of the lake, as shown by the velocity vectors in figure 5. The preponderance of gas slugs to burst through the crust in this general area, perhaps representing gas rising directly from the deeper conduit, also suggests that upwelling occurs mainly on the north margin of the lake. During typical behavior, the lake surface velocity, measured from the geometrically corrected webcam images, was around 0.3 m/s. Lake motion sometimes changed, however, based on the location of spattering. For instance, when small collapses of the lava veneer triggered spattering along the north margin, the lake surface motion could completely reverse and could also slow down considerably in the process. The typical behavior was invariably reestablished within minutes to hours, suggesting that these divergences from the usual circulation direction were controlled shallowly. "}, {"section_title": "Collapses and Explosions", "text": "Small collapses occurred occasionally in the Overlook crater, most often associated with small sections of the juvenile lava veneer (sometimes forming an inner ledge around the lake margin) on the Overlook crater walls collapsing into the lake when the lake level dropped. When these sections impacted the lake they commonly triggered sloshing and agitation, and often a very-long-period seismic signal. They also sometimes triggered spattering that persisted for minutes to hours and temporarily changed the flow direction of the lake surface (the surface crust would tend to flow towards the areas of spattering). Two larger collapses triggered small explosive events, and these involved collapses of the lithic walls of the Overlook crater. The first was at 10:11 HST (Hawaii Standard Time) on July 23, 2014 ( fig. 6), when a slice of the east rim of the Overlook crater collapsed. The ejected spatter coated the nearby section of the Halema'uma'u Crater floor, leaving a thick deposit on the Overlook crater rim. Ash-sized particles, ragged lapilli, and spatter bombs up to 70 cm in length blanketed the ground around the overlook immediately above the crater. Small bombs landed up to 1 km downwind from the vent, distributed along a narrow corridor. Similar to other explosive events, the juvenile tephra had small debris of lithic material incorporated into the lava. The second explosive event was at 01:15 HST on October 19, when a section of the south rim of the Overlook crater, which forms the wall of Halema'uma'u Crater immediately beneath the Halema'uma'u Overlook, collapsed into the lake. This triggered an explosion that was smaller than the July event-the spatter landed only around the immediate area of the Halema'uma'u Overlook.

The source of the flow was a vent at the northeast edge of Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d's crater that overflowed in May 2013 to form the K2 flow. The flow generally advanced at a rate of only 30-50 m/day, which was relatively slow compared to other flows in recent years. Progress was further hindered by large DI tilt events reducing (or possibly severing), then restoring, magma supply in January, April, and May, which caused the front of the flow to stall. When the flow recovered after each event, the movement of its distal active edge restarted from a new location that was as much as a few kilometers behind the previous front position. Despite these perturbations, the flow reached a maximum distance of 8.8 km from the vent before terminating in June. "}, {"section_title": "Pu'u '\u014c'\u014d Activity During the K2 Flow", "text": "Early 2014 saw the continuation of the monotonous behavior seen at Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d over the previous several months. There were four spatter cones on the crater floor, which we referred to as the N, NE, S, and SE spatter cones ( fig. 8A), and the crater floor was only apparent by the remnants of the original tephra cone bounding the north and south rims of the crater. Otherwise, the crater was actually a low composite shield with high points at the four spatter cones. Each of these cones fed occasional brief flows. The NE spatter cone-the source of the K2 lava flow northeast of Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d-often held a small, gently pistoning lava pond. Small overflows during pistoning events generally sealed the opening above the pond over a period of a day or two. Invariably, the cap over the pond would fail, perhaps in response to an unusually large drop in the lava level hidden beneath the crust during gas pistoning, and the pond surface would be exposed again. Activity at Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d changed in late April, when large flows from the N and S cones exited the east and west ends of the crater and overtopped the crater's south rim. The flows ceased during a large DI event in early May. Inflation over the next several weeks led to flows from the NE and N spatter cones that also exited both ends of the crater.  "}, {"section_title": "June 27th Breakout and Flow", "text": "The heightened activity at Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d in late June culminated in a new eruption on the northeast flank of Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d on June 27 (called the June 27th flow; episode 61e) ( fig. 9A). Lava erupted initially from four fissures, forming several short-lived channelized flows, but within a few days activity focused on the lowest fissure (fissure D) and a perched lava pond began to form (fig. 9B). The ~200-m-diameter pond eventually became elevated to about 30 m higher than the fissure D vent. On July 10, the lava's static pressure head that had developed in the magma system caused the eruption to shift to the next higher fissure (fissure C), and the perched pond was abandoned. A fast-moving channelized flow coursed downslope from fissure C. Confined between the Kahauale\u02bba flows and the episode 58 perched channel, the flow traveled up to several hundred meters per day (maximum measured rate was about 600 m/day) to the northeast, eventually extending beyond the eastern edge of the Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d flow field. On August 18, the flow intersected a deep ground crack (crack 1), which captured the flow and directed it toward the northeast. Though hidden within the crack, the flow's advance was marked by an ever-lengthening line of steam along the crack. Lava overflowed the crack about 1.3 km downslope on August 24, forming a short flow bounded by fault structures (lava pad 1), and entered a second crack (crack 2) that likewise carried the flow forward underground. Lava emerged from crack 2 farther downslope on August 29, forming another short flow (lava pad 2) that cascaded into yet another ground crack (crack 3) that soon began to steam. The third crack was filled on September 3, and lava spilled out to form three new flows (lava pads 3-5) as close as 1.2 km from the Kaohe Homesteads subdivision. The westernmost of these three new flows (lava pad 3) captured the entire flow volume and the lava began to advance toward the north, where it intersected another ground crack (crack 4). This time, the lava traveled back to the southwest within the crack, but when the crack was filled, the flow continued on toward the north from near the point at which it entered the crack. Figure 10 shows the arrangement of cracks and flows utilized by lava during this period of the eruption. Over the next several weeks, the flow advanced relatively steadily to the northeast, bypassing the inhabited part of Kaohe Homesteads, until the flow front stalled on September 22. The flow recovered slowly over the next several days and began to progress forward again in early October. After advancing another kilometer, the flow slowed to a crawl in mid October. Within a few days, however, the nearly stalled front was bypassed by a narrow breakout that became confined within a shallow drainage and began to race forward. The rapidly advancing lobe crossed Cemetery Road just south of the P\u0101hoa Solid Waste Transfer Station on October 25. From there it continued downslope through the P\u0101hoa Japanese Cemetery and onto the property of Melvin Sugimoto on the outskirts of P\u0101hoa. On October 30, just when the destruction of houses seemed inevitable, the flow stalled. It was a mere 155 m from P\u0101hoa Village Road, the main street through P\u0101hoa ( fig. 11). Though the flow had stopped advancing, breakouts continued just upslope. Over the next two weeks, flows spilled onto the transfer station property (though only a fence and access road were affected) and a nearby farmhouse was destroyed. In addition, another narrow, relatively fast-moving flow began to advance past the north side of the transfer station, following a drainage that put it on a course toward the Pahoa Marketplace. However, the flow was subsequently beheaded by a large breakout upslope on November 14 and the distal flow front stopped advancing over the next few days before additional damage could occur. The November 14 breakout that shut down the lower flow field occurred from the tube adjacent to Puu Kahaualea. Over the next few days after the breakout, the tube was gradually reoccupied, forming a downstream progression of breakouts. The last breakout in the series started on November 18 on lava pad 2 within the ground crack system, and lava began to advance rapidly toward the north along the west edge of the earlier flow. Within a few weeks, the flow had diverged from the edge of the previous flow and formed a new flow branch that turned toward the northeast and headed straight for the Pahoa Marketplace and Highway 130 ( fig. 12). The flow reached to within 530 m of the marketplace before stalling December 30. Many breakouts remained active just behind the front, though, maintaining the threat to the area through the end of the year.      Figure 13.

Pronounced crater subsidence started on July 5 and continued through the end of that month, until the crater was 20-25 m deep. There was minor crater subsidence thereafter through the end of the year. Brief overflows from the vents in the crater pits occurred occasionally, and the lava ponds within the pits eventually crusted over (some sooner than others). The last lava pond was seen at the southern edge of the crater during the first week of November, and the conditions at Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d were uneventful and fairly monotonous thereafter."}, {"section_title": "Appendix B-1.

HVO has operated seismometers of various types since 1912, and has been producing a modern seismic catalog since October 1, 1959 (Klein and Wright, 2000). Some of the first prototype electromagnetic seismometers, built and tested at HVO in the late 1950s, had dramatically improved sensitivity compared to seismometers in use at the time (Okubo and others, 2014). The first telemetered seismograph was also pioneered at HVO. HVO followed the computer revolution, switching to new computer processing systems in 1970 (punchcards), 1979 (Eclipse/HYPOINVERSE), 1985 (CUSP), and 2009 (AQMS) (Okubo and others, 2014). Finally, the seismic network was entirely converted to digital recording and telemetry between 2011 and 2013 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The conversion to digital recording improved signal fidelity and dynamic range over previous analog systems. Along with the digital conversion, several new broadband and strong motion sensors replaced existing short-period instruments, allowing the seismic network to better record a range of amplitudes and frequencies of both large tectonic earthquakes and small volcanic earthquakes. The HVO summaries have been published in various forms since 1956. Summaries before 1974 were issued quarterly, but cost, convenience of preparation and distribution, and the large quantity of data necessitated an annual publication, beginning with Summary 74 for the year 1974. Since 2004, summaries have been identified simply by year, rather than by summary number. Summaries originally issued as administrative reports were republished in 2007 as Open-File Reports. All the summaries since 1956 are available at http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1316-1345/ (last accessed January 29, 2013).

The data set of well-recorded, located earthquakes in that region is nearly complete above magnitude 2.0 with nearly all earthquake solutions having gone through a formal review ( fig. 11). All events above magnitude 3.0 have been formally reviewed. Many earthquakes smaller than magnitude 2.0 are locatable in the K\u012blauea region because of the dense instrumental coverage. Substantial effort is made to locate earthquakes elsewhere within the Hawaiian Archipelago, and although such coverage cannot be as complete as it is in southern Hawai'i, nearly all events above magnitude 3.0 are located with limited precision. Events greater than M2.95 are listed in the appendix. Despite the presence of automatic solutions in the catalog, the errors in those locations are largely within the ANSS standard for areas with a high seismic hazard ( fig. 12).  Earthquake hypocenters are computed within a onedimensional velocity model (table 2). Velocity at any depth above a homogeneous half-space is given by linear interpolation between points. Two empirical sets of station delays or corrections are used in the HYPOINVERSE locations. The delay models are separated by a circle of radius 34 km, centered at 19\u00b022\u2032 N and 155\u00b010\u2032 W. Delay model 1 is used for epicenters occurring within a circle of radius 31 km from the center. This region includes K\u012blauea and its south flank. A combination of both delay models is used for epicenters that fall in a 6-km-wide transition zone around this 31-km circle. Delay model 2 is applied to the rest of the island and to offshore earthquakes. For a detailed description, refer to the documentation for HYPOINVERSE-2000 (Klein, 2002). Magnitudes for events are computed using either a local magnitude or a duration magnitude. Both types of magnitude are calculated as part of the real-time processing, but the local magnitude-if it can be calculated-is preferred in the automatic solutions because it is more reliable. Reviewed solutions using Jiggle also include calculated local magnitude and duration magnitude. The preferred magnitude is chosen at the discretion of the analyst.

Seismic activity on Mauna Loa was focused around three locations: ~10 km west of the summit at depths of 7 to 13 km, beneath Moku'\u0101weoweo Caldera from 0 to 5 km depths, and beneath the Southwest Rift Zone in an area centered around Sulfur Cone typically from 2 to 5 km depths. Earthquakes occurred within different parts of the volcano throughout the year and there is some indication of a temporal relation between each series of events, but a source mechanism for each or a cause-and-effect relation between them is not clear. The area west of the summit experienced high levels of seismicity in April and September. These swarms were located in the same place as those observed in September 2013 as well as the pre-eruptive swarms in 1984 and 1975, though the earthquakes recorded in 2014 were much smaller in magnitude than the pre-eruptive sequences. Activity in the upper Southwest Rift Zone near Sulfur Cone and in the summit caldera of Mauna Loa was above the background levels customary since 1984. While both those areas experienced an overall increased rate of seismicity, the activity on the west flank of the volcano is more swarm-like in nature. However, the energy release during the current period of Mauna Loa unrest is significantly less than that preceding the eruptions in 1975 and 1984. In addition, several deep long period (DLP) earthquakes occurred in two zones-the first centered at approximately 13 km depth and the second between 40 and 50 km depth. These types of earthquakes are often attributed to magmatic processes. The number of DLP earthquakes in 2014 was the highest since the previous period of deformation at Mauna Loa, between 2002 and 2005. The increase in seismic activity has been accompanied by deformation in the upper Southwest Rift Zone and summit region as detected by Global Positioning System (GPS) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Deformation"}, {"section_title": "K\u012blauea", "text": "Activity at K\u012blauea was generally low compared to other years since the summit eruption began in 2008, except in the Southwest Rift Zone. Tremor was a ubiquitous feature of the seismicity at the summit, with amplitudes modulated by the presence or absence of spattering in the lava lake within Halema'uma'u. Seismicity along the Southwest Rift Zone was above the long-term average in 2014. Swarms of activity occurred in late March/early April and in May. Between March 25 and April 9, seismicity in the southern part of the summit caldera increased substantially. This occurred along with inflation in the caldera as measured by the tiltmeter at station UWE. Seismicity increased in the southern part of the caldera about May 1. Events were of the same type and at similar depths as those that occurred in late March and early April. Tilt initially showed weak deflation in the presence of a generally high lava-lake level. Beginning around May 7, discrete very long period (VLP) and long period (LP) events were recorded in greater number. On May 10 at 16:25 UTC (06:25 HST) a VLP/LP swarm began, consisting of overlapping VLP codas. Subsequently the LP event rate increased and was replaced by tremor and rapid deflationary tilt. Earthquakes in the south caldera/upper Southwest Rift Zone increased dramatically once deflation commenced. Such an increase in seismicity in the south caldera area is highly anomalous during a steep deflation in the caldera (it is more often associated with magma movement into the East Rift Zone). Though not constrained by the geodetic data sets, the seismic evidence is consistent with an intrusion into the south caldera or farther afield into the Southwest Rift Zone. Earthquake rates in the Southwest Rift Zone remained high for more than 3 weeks after the activity in the caldera on May 10. Earthquakes gradually decreased in areas to the south and west of the caldera, except for one area of seismicity southwest of Maunaiki. A swarm of events near Maunaiki also occurred between July 26 and July 29. The distribution of seismicity immediately after the activity on May 10 further supports an intrusion in the south caldera, but exactly how far this intrusion may have propagated into the Southwest Rift Zone, if at all it, is not clearly explained by the temporal or spatial patterns in seismicity. On June 27 at 16:53 UTC (6:53 HST), a sudden deflation in tilt near Pu'u '\u014c'\u014d culminated in a lava breakout (informally called the June 27th lava flow) from the north-northeast flank of Pu'u '\u014c'\u014d cone. Tremor associated with the acceleration of deflation (and breakout) was recorded on seismic stations closest to Pu'u '\u014c'\u014d. In the hour before the tremor started, several high frequency earthquakes were recorded at two stations. Similar earthquakes happened immediately before the breakout in August 2011, but in much larger numbers.

As fissures opened on the northeast flank of the cone, dramatic tilt and motion towards the crater occurred ( figs. 1, 2). The deflationary tilt and horizontal motion continued, at a lower rate than the initial deformation, until August. From then to the end of the year, exceptionally little deformation was recorded at Pu'u '\u014c'\u014d. Stations at the summit showed no immediate reaction to the start of the June 27th flow, but the variable-rate inflation of K\u012blauea that had been ongoing since 2010 ceased shortly afterward. From July to August, there was no net change in extension across the caldera or vertical signal at GPS sites in the summit area, although the tiltmeter at U\u0113kahuna still showed tilt away from the caldera (figs. 1, 3, 4). Slight subsidence and contraction were recorded by GPS data from August to mid-September. From then to the end of the year, there was no net change at the summit, but approximately month-long cycles of inflation and deflation were recorded that appear to be originating at a shallow source beneath the southeastern edge of Halema'uma'u. These cycles are not unusual-they have been frequent, but not regular, in at least the past couple of years at the summit-but the process that causes them is not yet clear. The cycles are not evident at Pu'u '\u014c'\u014d. The very common, short time-scale, moderate magnitude deflation-inflation (DI) events that we observe mainly in the tilt data continued in 2014.

The multiple scattering effects of gases and particles on incoming radiation have contributed to significant errors in calculated K\u012blauea summit SO 2 emission rates since 2008. Since that time, our analysis methods have evolved significantly and the improved methods have been incorporated into our operational procedures. We pursued several approaches that resulted in constraining a more accurate summit emission rate. For campaign road-based measurements, we have incorporated a more flexible SO 2 column path calculation algorithm by upgrading our FLYSPEC hardware and software, and, since April, have used the new dual fit window (DFW) FLYSPEC software. This allows more accurate quantification of low SO 2 column pathlengths (such as for the east rift plume) and very high column pathlengths (such as for the dense, opaque summit plume). Although the transition to the FLYSPEC version 3 hardware and version 5 software represents an improvement over the FLYSPEC 2 configuration, we suspect that the absolute accuracy of the road measurements may still be compromised due to the proximity to the summit vent and the high plume column density. Changes in lava lake activity continue to be reflected in these near-vent road-based measurements. Beginning in 2014, we discontinued the single, short-fit window data collection/processing. We have continued to reprocess our road-traverse data, using Christoph Kern's (of the Cascades Volcano Observatory, or CVO) Simulated Radiative Transfer (SRT)-DOAS code (Kern and others, 2012). We use a refined SRT-DOAS algorithm that incorporates several improvements over previous versions, including a faster table-search algorithm, which makes it feasible to use the code operationally. In addition, a higher resolution look-up table, more spectral data in the look-up table (300-340 nm rather than 300-325 nm), an optimized wavelength fitting range (312-338 nm rather than 309-324 nm), and a better high pass filter for measured optical densities were included. By year's end we had reprocessed select SO 2 summit data from 2008-2014 using the DFW and SRT-DOAS algorithms. The subset of reprocessed data includes only spectra that are unsaturated with light and have a plume location along the road so that a reasonably perpendicular cross section could be measured ( fig. 1). During periods of low SO 2 emissions (<1,000 t/d) the SRT and DFW data consistently agree within the error of the measurement; the scatter in the data increases with emission rate (fig. 2). These data are subject to revision, as some refinement of the data will occur over the coming year. The SRT-DOAS-modeled and DFW-calculated SO 2 emission rate data from 2008-2009 are in much better agreement with recent estimates from space-based platforms (Beirle and others, 2014) than our original emission rate estimates from that period."}, {"section_title": "FLYSPEC Array: Measuring a More Dispersed and Optically Thin Plume", "text": "Data capture from the upward-looking FLYSPEC array, located ~2.8 km from the summit Overlook crater emission source, improved greatly this year thanks to power system and communications upgrades made over the past two years. By February 2014, the FLYSPEC array software had incorporated the DFW algorithm for calculating column path values, which should improve the accuracy of the reported emission rates. Although we are measuring nearly 3 km from the source, where the plume is more dispersed and optically thin, the column amounts are still thousands of ppm-m-beyond the threshold associated with accurate fitting using the traditional 305-315 nm range. The 319.5-338 nm fit window used in the DFW software results in better signal-to-noise ratio and more accurate spectral fits.

In order to calculate an accurate CO 2 emission rate, one must be able to constrain the SO 2 emission rate, as well as a representative CO 2 /SO 2 ratio for the degassing area of the caldera: CO 2 emission rate = (CO 2 /SO 2 ) \u00d7 (SO 2 emission rate) \u00d7 (CO 2 molecular weight/SO 2 molecular weight) To calculate CO 2 /SO 2 we measure ambient concentrations (in parts per million, ppm) of each species as we drive through the grounded plume along Crater Rim Drive. Calculating the area beneath the curve for plots of CO 2 and SO 2 gas concentration with distance along the traverse provides the respective plume crosssectional areas (in ppm \u00d7 m), which are then used to calculate the ratio, CO 2 /SO 2 , in the above formula. The lofting summit plume from the Overlook crater is the main source of SO 2 , so accurately quantifying SO 2 concentration and a representative SO 2 plume cross-sectional area is difficult from the earth-bound vehicle. In contrast, the majority of the CO 2 is released quiescently from an area to the east of the eruptive vent; the configuration along the road for this ground-hugging plume has been consistent since CO 2 monitoring began in 1995. While the calculated CO 2 emission rate is dependent on accurately quantifying both CO 2 and the challenging SO 2 cross-sectional plume areas, the CO 2 area by itself provides an independent measure of relative CO 2 release. For 2014, road-based CO 2 data were collected on October 10 and analyzed using the average dual-fit window SO 2 emission rate and the maximum SO 2 cross-sectional area for the day's collection to calculate CO 2 emission rates for each traverse through the plume ( fig. 8). As noted above, the plotted raw CO 2 areas (black symbols) provide an independent measure of CO 2 release. The decrease in observed CO 2 , beginning in 2005, has been followed by a leveling-out of CO 2 emissions that continued through 2014. In 2014, we examined CO 2 release using an alternate method. In collaboration with Cindy Werner and Christoph Kern, CO 2 was measured from the summit of K\u012blauea using an eddy covariance technique as well as a multi-gas sensor system designed by staff at CVO (figs. 9, 10). In July, eddy covariance measurements were made at 14 locations in the area of diffuse emissions, and we recorded elevated fluxes that generally ranged from 500 to >5,000 g/m 2 /d. The eddy covariance instrument was then deployed until mid-October, when the threat of high winds associated with Hurricane Ana necessitated the retrieval of the sensitive instrument. These data help us better understand the spatial distribution and temporal variability of CO 2 release from the summit caldera. Multi-gas measurements of the CO 2 and SO 2 concentration in air at 1 m above the ground identified approximately seven areas of elevated area of CO 2 degassing in the caldera. Areas of highest CO 2 concentration correlated with the areas of highest flux using the eddy covariance method were found near the middle of the caldera approximately 1 km northeast of the active vent (Werner and others, 2014).

This is roughly equivalent to emissions reported in 2013, and among the lowest recorded since the East Rift Zone eruption began in 1983 ( fig. 13).

The calculated weight fraction of SO 2 along with the SO 2 emission rate can then be used to quantify the amount of magma that has degassed. Using C/S ratios measured on the East Rift Zone from 2011-2013 that take into account summit pre-eruptive degassing, and current SO 2 emissions data produced effusion rates similar to concurrent estimates using very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic geophysical techniques and other methods.
