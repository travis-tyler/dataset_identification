[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background and Purpose: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are frequently encountered in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Focal grey matter atrophy has been linked to NPS development. Cerebrovascular disease can cause focal lesions and is common among AD patients. As cerebrovascular disease can be detected on MRI as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), this study evaluated WMH burden in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD and normal controls and determined their relationship with NPS. Methods: NPS were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and grouped into subsyndromes. WMH were measured using an automatic segmentation technique and mean deformation-based morphometry was used to measure atrophy of grey matter regions. Results: WMHs and grey matter atrophy both contributed significantly to NPS subsyndromes in MCI and AD subjects, however, WMH burden played a greater role. Conclusions: This study could provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of NPS in AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A majority of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) also suffer from neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) . NPS can reduce quality of life, contribute to caregiver burden and lead to institutional care (Kaufer et al., 1998) . Moreover, NPS can be difficult to treat (Ryu, Katona, Rive, & Livingston, 2005) . Some studies suggest that NPS may worsen cognitive symptoms and functional decline and have associated these symptoms with accelerated mortality (Palmer et al., 2010) . Recent work has attempted to identify the incidence and prevalence of these symptoms during the progression of AD(Constantine G. Lyketsosa, Maria C.\nCarrillob, J. Michael Ryanc, Ara S. Khachaturiand, Paula Trzepacze, Joan Amatniekf, Jesse Cedarbaumg, Robert Brashearh & Milleri, 2012) . However, very little is known about the underlying pathophysiology and neuroanatomical correlates of NPS in AD.\nNPS are known to exist even in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)(Constantine G. Lyketsosa, Maria C. Carrillob, J. Michael Ryanc, Ara S. Khachaturiand, Paula Trzepacze, Joan Amatniekf, Jesse Cedarbaumg, Robert Brashearh & Milleri, 2012; Geda et al., 2008) . They have been found to occur before cognitive decline (Lanct\u00f4t et al., 2017) , and some studies have suggested that specific NPS may be useful as early predictors of AD or dementia (Geda et al., 2008) . NPS have also predicted faster progression from MCI to AD (Peters et al., 2015) .\nMoreover, cognitive impairment and NPS may have distinct neuroanatomical deficits in AD (Bruen, McGeown, Shanks, & Venneri, 2008; Shinno et al., 2007) . For example, abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortex were observed in AD patients with delusional thinking compared to those without delusions, and these markers were found to be unrelated to cognition (Shinno et al., 2007) .\nReduction in grey matter (GM) volume in discrete cortical and subcortical regions has been associated with specific NPS in AD patients. Bruen et al.(Bruen et al., 2008) used voxelbased morphometry (VBM) to evaluate differences in regional grey matter density associated with NPS in mild AD. They found delusions, agitation and apathy related to cortical atrophy, particularly in the right hemisphere compared to the left, and in the anterior region. Irritability, anxiety and aberrant motor behaviour have been related to atrophy of the amygdala in early AD (Poulin, Dautoff, Morris, Barrett, & Dickerson, 2011) , while apathy has been related to atrophy in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate areas, and the caudate and putamen (Bruen et al., 2008; Hahn et al., 2013) . These studies suggest that NPS, particularly depression, apathy and delusions, are most frequently associated with changes in the frontal and subcortical regions of the brain. Nevertheless, atrophy alone has not been sufficient to account for NPS in AD and other dementias (Berlow et al., 2010) .\nWhite matter hyperintensities (WMH) are white matter lesions in the brain that appear as high signal intensity regions on T2-weighted MRI. They have a number of possible pathological substrates including blood-brain barrier leakage, hypoperfusion, ischemia/hypoxia, inflammation, neurodegeneration and amyloid angiopathy (Gouw et al., 2011) . WMHs that result from small vessel disease (SVD) have been associated with vascular risk factors, like hypertension (Shim et al., 2015) . WMH load has been associated with AD pathology (Alosco et al., 2018; Dadar et al., 2018) , and a relationship between SVD and WMH lesions in AD has been reported in other studies (Shim et al., 2015) . WMHs of presumed vascular origin have also been associated with NPS in various populations, including AD (Berlow et al., 2010; Dadar, Maranzano, et al., 2017) . However, there is limited research on the contribution of WMH burden to changes in NPS over time in patients with MCI and AD.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate WMH burden and regional GM atrophy in MCI and AD and determine their contribution to NPS over time, using longitudinal data from a large multi-center database from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Anonymized data and materials have been made publicly available at the ADNI repository and can be accessed at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/."}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Participants were from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative archives.

Louis Collins, Neelin, Peters, & Evans, 1994) . T1w scans were registered to the ADNI template in stereotaxic space (D L Collins & Evans, 1997) . Concatenating the two transformations, the other contrasts were also registered to the ADNI template. Using a previously validated automatic WMH segmentation technique and a library of manual segmentations from ADNI dataset, WMHs were segmented for all longitudinal timepoints (Dadar et al., 2018; Dadar, Maranzano, et al., 2017; Dadar, Pascoal, et al., 2017) . Quality of segmentations was assessed and verified by an expert (MD). Total WMH volumes (cm3) were calculated, normalized for head size and logtransformed to achieve normal distribution. DBM analysis was performed using MNI MINC tools. Pre-processed images were linearly (using a 9-parameter rigid registration)(D. Louis Collins et al., 1994) and then nonlinearly warped(D. Louis Collins, Holmes, Peters, & Evans, 1995) to the ADNI template. The local deformation obtained from the non-linear transformations was used as a measure of tissue expansion or atrophy. Mean DBM values were calculated for 116 GM ROIs based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) .

Subjects with MCI were significantly younger than normal controls and AD participants (p<.01).\nAges ranged from 55-94 years. There were no differences in sex between groups. NPI total scores were significantly different between groups, with higher values for MCI and AD groups, respectively (p<.001).\nCombining all groups, age was not significantly associated with NPI total scores (\u03b2=.02, p=.50) (Figure 2, left) but was significantly associated with greater WMH load (\u03b2NC=0.43, \u03b2MCI=0.51, \u03b2AD=0.61, p<.001) (Figure 2 , center). Relationships with age were examined using the following models: a) NPI Factor ~ 1+ Age + Cohort + (1|ID) + (1|Modality) and b) WL ~ 1+\nAge + Cohort + (1|ID) + (1|Modality).\nWMH load was a significant contributor to NPI total scores in MCI and AD cohorts, but not in the normal controls (\u03b2NC=0.00, p=.95; \u03b2MCI=0.16, p=.02; \u03b2AD=0.24, p=.008) (Figure 2 , right). This relationship was observed using the following model: NPI Factor ~ 1+ WL * Cohort + (1|ID) + (1|Modality).

DBM analysis identified ROIs where GM was significantly associated with NPS subsyndromes, p<.05 after FDR correction (Table 2, Figure 3 ). The relationship between NPS with GM atrophy in these ROIs and WMH volume were examined independently. Longitudinal mixed-effects models found AD and MCI cohorts and GM of specific regions to be significantly associated with all four NPS subsyndromes, while sex and age were not significantly associated with any NPS factors (Model 1). WMH volume was also significantly associated with all four NPS subsyndromes (Model 2, Figure 4 ). Both GM and WMH were then included together as predictors, to assess which one is a more significant contributor to NPS. WMH volume was found to be a significant contributor to NPS subsyndromes while GM DBM values did not remain significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (Model 3). Please see Appendix B, Table II for results of models 1 and 3 before FDR correction, and Table III for results for model 2.\nThere was a marginal correlation between total vascular risk factors and WMH load (r=0.077, p=.048).

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our findings indicate a significant association of GM atrophy and WMH burden to worsening NPS over time in MCI and AD, with WMH having the greater contribution to NPS.\nHigher number of vascular risk factors had a significant although minimal effect on worsening psychosis and affective NPS subsyndromes.\nThe AD cohort showed a higher incidence of NPS compared to MCI and normal control cohorts. This finding is consistent with a majority of studies that have found NPS to be more frequent in AD compared to MCI populations (Geda et al., 2008) . Moreover, NPI scores were associated with WMH load in AD and MCI but not with age (despite an age range of 54-94 years in our subjects), suggesting a relationship with disease severity. Although atrophy, as in our study, is associated with NPS and partially explains the increased NPI scores in AD, our findings suggest that WMH burden may also explain increased NPS scores as we found a significant association between WMH load and all four NPS subsyndromes. Our results that WMH burden increases with age are consistent with previous findings (Gouw et al., 2011) . Compared to controls, WMH load was greater in AD and MCI subjects and although WMH load is known to increase during healthy aging, this effect appeared to be exaggerated in our AD group as their age was similar to our control group.\nCerebrovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of WMH. In the current study, there was only a small correlation between total vascular risk factors and WMH load. This is likely because we did not examine the severity of these risk factors and were only able to examine mild cerebrovascular effects as people with significant cerebrovascular risk factors were excluded from ADNI1 (Petersen, 2010) . There may also be other contributors to the WMH including nonischemic causes such as enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces (Gouw et al., 2011) .\nFrontotemporal GM atrophy was implicated in NPS. Psychosis was associated with lower GM DBM values in the right middle temporal gyrus and left Heschl's gyrus. Heschl's gyrus, which contains the primary auditory cortex, is involved in acoustic processing while the middle temporal region has been implicated in a number of functions, including semantic memory, audition and language (Xu et al., 2015) . Functional connectivity studies have shown that a fronto-temporal language network is impaired in individuals with psychosis(Sol\u00e9-Padull\u00e9s et al., 2017), while others have also implicated frontoparietal networks (Baker et al., 2014) . Anor et al. reported greater delusions with right frontal WMH volume in AD. Delusions have been associated with later Braak staging V/VI (Ehrenberg et al., 2018) suggesting that these symptoms are more likely to present in the late stages of AD. GM atrophy and WMH burden in these regions may contribute to the disruption of connectivity in frontotemporal networks.\nThe right inferior temporal region was also related to hyperactivity and has been implicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Zhao et al., 2017) . Apathy and hyperactivity were related to lower GM DBM values in the left middle frontal cortex and apathy alone was associated with bilateral superior frontal regions. Apathy is frequently associated with abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia in volumetric and functional studies (Bruen et al., 2008; Hahn et al., 2013) . Ballarini et al.(Ballarini et al., 2016) identified a relationship between hyperactivity and NPI scores with increased glucose metabolism in predominantly left frontal and limbic structures while apathy scores were negatively correlated with bilateral orbitofrontal and dorsolateral frontal cortex metabolism. Bilateral involvement of brain regions with apathy, and involvement of left hemisphere regions with hyperactivity, was similarly observed in this study. The authors also noted bilateral frontal and limbic involvement with affective symptoms while we did not find any significant regions associated with this subsyndrome.\nThere were no forebrain or midbrain regions associated with the affective subsyndrome in this study. However, previous reviews of functional and structural MR studies have identified regions associated with depression including the dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and insula (Pandya, Altinay, Malone, & Anand, 2012) , and anxiety with frontoparietal networks and the left ventrolateral prefrontal and superior temporal regions(Pic\u00f3-P\u00e9rez, Radua, Steward, Mench\u00f3n, & Soriano-Mas, 2017). Our lack of findings may be due to inhomogeneity in the affective subsyndrome group or greater complexity in the regions and networks involved in depression and anxiety. Another possibility is that the NPI is an informant-based questionnaire and so we do not know the actual patient state.\nAtrophy in AD follows a pattern from temporal and limbic regions, to frontal and eventually occipital areas of the brain (Thompson et al., 2003) . Here, we observed psychosis, apathy and hyperactivity NPS associated with lower GM DBM values in the temporal and frontal regions in subjects with MCI or early AD, suggesting deficits may result from atrophy associated with an early neurodegenerative process.\nWe found reduced GM DBM values of the left cerebellum crus2 associated with all NPS subsyndromes and the right crus2 with psychosis and hyperactivity. Left cerebellar region 7b was associated with psychosis while the right cerebellar region 7b was associated with hyperactivity. These regions, part of the inferior semilunar lobule, were related to emotion in a study on pain processing (Diano et al., 2016) . The authors identified three clusters involved in processing pain: cluster V (vermis IV-V, hemispheres IV-V-VI) was associated with sensorymotor areas, cluster VI (hemisphere VI, crus1, crus2) with cognition and cluster VII (7b, crus1, crus2) with emotion. The role of these regions in NPS may further depend on their functional connectivity with other brain regions and networks involved in regulating emotion and behaviour.\nWe found WMH burden to be a greater contributor to NPS compared to GM atrophy. The effect of WMH on NPS may be independent of other factors, however it is more likely that a combination of underlying AD and vascular neuropathology contributes to NPS. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are common in subcortical structures early in AD pathogenesis and these regions (i.e. brainstem, hypothalamic nuclei) are known to be involved in the regulation of NPS (Ehrenberg et al., 2018) . The presence of subcortical WMH suggests that SVD may further contribute to damage caused by accumulation of NFTs. SVD may even be involved early in the disease process by accelerating amyloid deposition in AD as a result of impaired perivascular drainage of amyloid-\uf062 (Grimmer et al., 2012) . Similarly, a recent study found that higher volume of ante-mortem WMH volume predicted greater odds of having autopsy-confirmed AD neuropathology, suggesting SVD may contribute to the severity and progression of AD (Alosco et al., 2018) . They identified brain regions where lower GM DBM values were related to higher WMH load, indicating atrophy and CVD pathology may act synergistically in contributing to NPS in MCI and AD.\nThe importance of WMH in MCI and early AD suggests WMH load is not secondary to AD pathology but an important contributor to NPS during early stages of disease.\nNeuropsychiatric function may be based on connectivity between brain regions, and therefore the disruption of connectivity by ischemic lesions could have a greater effect than GM atrophy. In addition, genetic and environmental factors may contribute to NPS development and expression.\nThis study was limited by ADNI protocol exclusion of subjects with psychotic features, agitation or behavioural problems within 3 months prior to screening as this would interfere with study compliance. It is also possible that participants with higher NPS may have been lost to follow-up. In addition, a Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS) cutoff of 4 was used as part of ADNI selection criteria. As HIS scores greater than 7 suggest vascular involvement, this cutoff may have excluded patients with severe WMH burden making the results here even more compelling.\nBy combining symptoms into subsyndromes, we may have masked relationships with specific NPS such as depression and irritability. Also, although there is evidence for clustering of NPS, there is large variation and overlap of symptoms. Moreover, this study did not take into consideration the use of medication to treat NPS, such as antidepressants and stimulants, and these could have affected the frequency and severity of symptoms reported in the NPI. Although This study identified WMH load as a significant contributor to NPS in AD and MCI using longitudinal data from the large multi-center database of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. CVD is a common comorbidity of AD and is thought to be the major underlying cause of WMH. Since CVD has a number of modifiable risk factors, such as lowering blood pressure and controlling diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, interventions that aim to reduce vascular disease may prove beneficial in preventing NPS."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "text": "1 "}]
