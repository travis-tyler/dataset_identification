In this work, that impaired 5.3 million people worldwide. No cure has the features are extracted from predefined ROIs using yet been found for Alzheimer's disease but early Harvard-Oxford Atlas. In each individual ROI, the detection of AD is vital for early treatment [1] . Positron suitable feature is extracted by averaging the intensity Emission Tomography (PET) has the capacity to of voxels within the ROI. After that, principle distinguish mild common symptoms of AD such as component analysis (PCA) is used to extract most amyloid plaques and impaired glucose metabolism. discriminative regions (or features). Finally, support Therefore, extracting the features from brain using PET vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to evaluate neuroimaging provides useful hallmarks to discriminate the accuracy of proposed methods in AD diagnosis. normal control (NC) from AD [2] .\nThe obtained results demonstrated high performance Voxel-wise based approaches, which are widely used outcome in compare to traditional ROI-based method in AD and use voxels as features, have a major problem using AAL Atlas, which was previously reported in namely the dimensionality [3] . In voxel-wise analysis, the literature [4] . number of features is very large compared to the number of available training samples. To overcome such problem, PCA and SVM Classifications: PCA is one of the most voxel grouping using regions of interest (ROIs) are effective methods in pattern recognition. The aim of PCA performed [2] . ROIs are determined using some labeled is to reduce the dimension of the data and is used to omit Atlases, such as Harvard-Oxford Atlas and Automated redundant data for feature extraction. PCA depends on Anatomical Labeling (AAL) Atlas. The Harvard-Oxford eigenvector method and is designed to model linear Atlas includes 48 cortical structural regions [4] . The AAL variations in large dimensional data. This technique Atlas has been applied in AD [5] and in this study the projects the original n-dimensional data to k-dimensional potentiality of Harvard-Oxford Atlas is evaluated.\n(k<<n) linear subspace [6] .\nSVM creates an optimal hyperplane using binaryages 55 to 90 years, to participate in the research, labeled training data by maximizing the margin between approximately 200 cognitively normal old individuals two classes [4] . SVM maps linearly or nonlinearly the followed for 3 years; 400 people with MCI followed for input data into a high-dimensional feature space through 3 years and a group of 200 people with early AD followed a suitable kernel function. The mapping is performed to for 2 years. alleviate the classification problem in the high dimension Normalization into a standardized coordinate system feature space. The SVM classification method has was the first step on preprocessing. Normalization maps previously been applied in AD [7] . Because of high the voxels in different images into the same anatomical performance of SVM compared to other classifiers, this positions in the brains. Each individual PET image was approach is widely used in AD diagnosis [8] . A detailed automatically spatially normalized into the PET description of the PCA and the SVM algorithms are Montreal Neurological Imaging (MNI) template through available in literature [6] .\n12-parameters affine model. on AAL Atlas and Harvard-Oxford Atlas without any Data used in preparation of this article were obtained feature extraction. The last approach listed in Table 1 is from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative the proposed method based on Harvard-Oxford Atlas (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu). ADNI was launched with PCA feature extraction. To evaluate the performance in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the of different classification experiments, 10-fold crossNational Institute of Biomedical Imaging and validation was performed. Since subjects were randomly Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug divided into 10 subsets in 10-fold cross-validation, 100 Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies random 10-folds were calculated. Finally, the classification and non-profit organizations, as a 60 million Dollars, experiments were evaluated based on all those 10-folds. 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been tested whether serial magnetic resonance RESULTS imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers and clinical and Table 1 shows the classification accuracy of the neuropsychological assessment can be combined to proposed method, the method previously applied on measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment Atlas by other researchers [5] and the method (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In addition, Figure 1 of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD plots the corresponding ROC curves of different progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians classification methods.
