[{"section_title": "ABSTRACT", "text": "Sixty tables are presented, which examine the test achievement of a national probability sample of eighth graders in public and private schools. Statistics were obtained from the base-year student survey of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). The NELS:88 monitors the transition of a national sample of young adults as they progress from junior high to senior high school and on to postsecondary education and/or work. Its purpose is to provide policy-relevant data concerning the effectiveness of schools, curriculum paths, special programs, variations in curriculum content, and/or mode of delivery in bringing about educational growth. The NELS:88 test battery includes four tests: (1) reading comprehension; (2) mathematics; (3) science; and (4) history/citizenship/government. This report is a tabular summary of achievement test scores for approximately 25,000 eighth graders from slightly more than 1,000 schools. Results are grouped into: student background variables; parental involvement variables; and school characteristics and school climate. Reading and mathematics tables contain, in addition to mean scores, the percentage of each group scoring at each proficiency level and the standard error of the percentage estimate. Effect sizes are included to compare group differences. Technical notes on survey design, response rates, variables in the tables, significance testing, and methods for estimating standard errors and effect sizes follow the tables. ---1*- ....7.21 a ,.....,,1 71,... ,74.1...4TiNia c.,4,,,,tvil.m.

Statistics were obtained from the base year student survey of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). The NELS:88 study is the latest longitudinal study sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and is designed to monitor the transition of a national sample of young adults as they progress from junior to senior high and then on to postsecondary education and/or the world of work. The primary purpose of the NELS:88 longitudinal study is to provide.policy relevant information on the effectiveness of schools, curriculum paths, special programs, variations in curriculum content, and/or mode of delivery in bringing about educational growth. Among the more important educational indicators that will be monitored at the 8th, 10th, and 12th grade is the achievement test battery. The NELS test battery is composed of four separate tests Reading Comprehension, Mathematics, Science, and History/Citizenship/Government. The NELS:88 test battery is critical to the measurement of growth in educational achievement that vill take place during the last four years of secondary schooling. This report consists of a tabular summary of the achievement test scores based on the NELS:88 base year sample of approximately 25,000 eighth graders who were sampled from slightly more than 1,000 schools. Test scores were tabulated by selected variables that have been shown to be related to achieving the skills and knowledge necessary to become a productive member of society. In addition to presenting mean test scores, the reading and mathematics tables also show the percentage of the group scoring at each proficiency level described above, and the standard error of the percentage estimate. The effect size shows the mean difference in terms of standard deviation units. The use of effect size contrasts (which are not tested for statistical significance) in addition to the usual means allows one to compare mean differences between groups on different tests when the tests are on different scales. While many contrasts may be statistically significant given large sample sizes, only a few many be practically significant. Effect sizes below .3 of a standard deviation are considered small and only approaching practical significance. See the Technical Notes for a detailed discussion of use of effect sizes in comparing group differences. Technical notes concerning the survey design, response rates, variables used in the tables, significance testing, and methods for estimating standard errors and effect sizes follow the tables. It should be noted that the estimates presented here are based on a preliminary data file which differs slightly from the public use tape. Some revisions were made in categorizing several background variables. All comparisons cited (t tests) in the text were done using student's t tests with Bonferroni adjustments to multiple comparisons. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are significant at the .05 level.

The NELS:88 study is a survey of 24,599 (93 percent of the targeted sample) eighth grade students, their parents, teachers, and school administrators. The students were selected from 1,035 schools representing each of the fifty states and the District of Columbia. The sample includes students from both public and private schools. Asian and Hispanic students were over sampled for this survey. Sample data can be used to make inferences to the population of about three million students in the eighth grade in the United States. Detailed information on the sample can be found in the NELS:88 Base Year Sample Design Report (Spencer, B., Frankel, M., Inge ls, S., Rasinski, K., andTourangeau, R., National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988: Base Year Sample Design Report. Washington, DC, NCES, 1990).\nEnglish Proficiency (BYENGPRO) was taken from Teacher Questionnaire responses. BYT11 and BYT12 were used to determine Limited English Proficiency, Language Minority, or Both. This variable was cross tabulated with Student Questionnaire items BYS27A and BYS27B to construct the categories presented in the table. Note that teacher categorizations of language proficiency were not available for a majority of the students."}, {"section_title": "DATA LIMITATIONS", "text": "The population of schools in the NELS:88 base year survey was restricted to \"regular\" public and private schools in the United States. Excluded from the sample were Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools, special education schools for the handicapped, area vocational schools that do not enroll students directly, and schools for dependents of U.S. personnel overseas. Students who are educated at home or in private tutorial settings, and those who have dropped out of school prior to reaching eighth grade, also fall outside of the NELS:88 base year sample. These exclusions have implications for national inferences based on NELS:88 data, although their impact is believed to be small. For certain groups (for example, American Indians) the impact of these exclusions may be larger, and the users of the data should take this fact into account. It should be kept in mind that due to the small number of American Indians and large standard errors, our ability to detect differences between this group and other groups is limited. Information from various sources indicates that about ten percent of American Indian children attend schools that are affiliated with the BIA and those operated by American Indian communities under contract to the BIA. Other sources indicate that fewer than 10,000 eighth graders attend Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DODDS) serving dependents of U.S. personnel overseas. Exclusions were also made within schools. The population of students was defined to exclude those who had substantial language difficulties, who had disabilities that would make participation in the survey difficult, or who were chronic truants or dropouts. Seven ineligibility codes were employed at the time of student sample selection: A. attends this school only on a put-time basis, primary enrollment at another school. E. does not have English as the mother tongue and has insufficient command of English to complete the NELS:88 questionnaires and tests. F. has transferred out of the school since roster was compiled. G. is deceased. An analysis of eighth graders in the 1,035 schools included in the NELS:88 base year sample shows that of the 201,917 eighth grade students in these schools, 10,853 (5 percent) of them were excluded because they were judged to fall into one of the previously mentioned ineligibility categories. The majority of exclusions were made by a school administrator prior to sampling from the school roster. A small number of students who were missed in this process were designated as excluded by the survey administrator on the day that survey data was collected in the child's school. It is possible that the exclusion of mentally and physically handicapped students and most limited-English-proficient students may affect the estimates presented here in someway. The true effect of excluding these students is unknown, but a study is currently in progress which will attempt to ascertain the degree to which such exclusions affect estimates."}, {"section_title": "COGNITIVE TESTS", "text": "The Reading test included 21 items that measured students' abilities to reproduce detail, comprehend, and make inferences and evaluations of text in four areas (literature, science, poetry and biography). The Mathematics test included 40 items measuring skills in simple arithmetic operations, in using decimals, fractions, and percentages, in understanding the relationships among these operations, and in solving problems. The Science test was composed of 25 items testing the students' factual knowledge, conceptual understanding, and problem-solving skills in the areas of life science, earth science, and chemistry/physical science. The History/Citizenship/Government test, containing 30 items, measured students' knowledge of historical facts, structure of the U. S. government, and influence of geographic and economic conditions on history. For all four tests, the IRT formula score was used to calculate means and standard deviations. This section provides definitions for the variables used in the tables. While the possible number of cross-cuts that could be carried out is almost limitless, we have chosen to emphasize those variables that have been shown to be related to students failing to complete their education with an adequate level of skills (cf., Slavin & Madden, 1989). Pallas et al. (1989) argue that some of the main factors in putting students \"at risk\" of not achieving an acceptable level of skills are poverty status, race/ethnicity, family composition, parents' education, and language background. Variables that were either direct or indirect measures of any one of these predictors of a student's degree of risk were emphasized in the following analysis. Some of the categories are defined by single items in the student or school questionnaires, others are based on sums or composites of several items or groupings of categorical responses. In some instances, parent and teacher data has been incorporated. Questionnaire item numbers are referenced as data sources, and names of composite variables are included in parentheses if they exist on the public use files. The variables presented here are based on a preliminary file, and in some cases, composite variables are different from those in the public use user manuals and files. Comparison of definitions below with descriptions of composites in the user manuals will clarify any possible discrepancies. Student SexRace/Ethnicity. SES and Birth Year: Sex (SEX) was taken first from the Student Questionnaire (item 12). If this source was missing, or not available, then the sex variable from school rosters was used. Any records with this variable still missing had sex imputed from the respondent's name. In the small number of cases, where this imputation was impossible, the value for SEX was randomly assigned. Race/Ethnicity (RACE) was also constructed from several sources of information. The first source was the student's self report (item 31A through 31D). Secondly, if the student information was missing, data from the Parent Questionnaire (item 10a through 10c) were used. Students who reported the American Indian category, but whose parents responded \"White, not Hispanic\" were recoded to \"White, not Hispanic\" after a subsample of the parents were interviewed to verify the student's report. For additional detail on which groups are included in different categories, see the Base year Student User Manual (Inge ls, et al, 1990). SES Socioeconomic Status (BYSESQ) was constructed using the following data from the NELS:88 Parent Questionnaire: father/male guardian's educational level (item 30), mother/female guardian's educational level (item 31), father/male guardian's occupation (item 34b), mother/female guardian's occupation (item 37b), and family income (item 80). Occupational data were assigned values using the Duncan SEI. Each non-missing component was standardized and non-missing components were averaged to yield the SES composite. For cases where all parent data components were missing, (8 percent of the participants), student data were used. These first four components from the student data are the same as those from the parent data. The family income component was replaced by an index created from a list of household items (Student Questionnaire items 35a-p). Student data were used to construct SES if all components based on parent data were missing and at least one component based on student data was not missing. Otherwise, SES was set to missing. For this report, SES is divided into quartiles using weighted percents.

This weight is not available on the public use file. Originally, multiple weights were calculated, including a test + questionnaire weight. However, in order to simplify longitudinal analysis, it was decided to include only the BYQWT on the public use file. However, the Base Year Questionnaire weight, BYQWT, should produce estimates very similar to those in this report. Complex sample designs, such as the one used in the NELS:88 survey, often employ stratification, clustering, and unequal selection probabilities. These designs require procedures for estimating sampling variability that are markedly different from the ones that apply when the data are from a simple random sample. In general, such complex designs yield statistics with larger sampling errors than those from a simple random sample. The impact of the sample design on the sampling error of a given statistic is often assessed by the design effect, which is the ratio of the actual error variance of the statistic to the variance that would have been obtained for the statistic had it been based on a simple random sample. Standard errors and design effects were calculated for the four NELS:88 tests. The average design effect across these tests was 2.24. The standard errors which are reported in these tables have been adjusted for the overall design effect.

The effect sizes show the mean differences in terms of standard deviation units. Effect sizes are calculated by subtracting mean 1 from mean 2 and dividing by the total standard deviation. All effect sizes are based on contrasts with a single reference group. In the tables, the reference group is those individuals in the cell with the lowest mean score within each category. While any group could serve as the reference group for the effect size contrasts, the group in the table having the lowest mean was selected so that all the effect size contrasts would be positive. The reference group can always be identified as the group with an effect size of 0.0."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "The use of effect size contrasts in addition to the usual means allows one to compare mean differences between groups on different tests when the tests are on different scales. In addition to allowing for scale free comparisons, the effect size yields an estimate of the size of the difference that is unaffected by the sample size. While many contrasts will be statistically significant given the sample sizes, only a few may reach practical significance. Effect sizes in the .10 to .20 of a standard deviation range are considered to be small but only approaching practical significance. Effect sizes between .3 and .5 of a standard deviation are considered to be in the \"medium\" effect size range and to be practically significant (Cohen and Cohen, 1975, Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences. New York: John Wiley). Effect sizes that approach a full standaid deviation are considered quite large effects. The actual sample size along with the standard errors are shown in each cell in order to give the reader some guidance with respect to the relative stability and accuracy of the cell means. The cell with the lowest mean serves as a reference group only and thus provides a basis for effect size comparisons, but would probably not be the only contrast that one would be interested in statistically testing. Since the standard errors for the cell means are present in the Tables, the reader can construct simple statistical tests of any contrast of interest. The estimates with their standard errors may be used to construct confidence intervals, which are ranges that are estimated to include the population percentages with a specified probability or level of confidence. For example, using the sample percent and its standard error, a confidence interval could be constructed that would have a 95 percent probability of including a population percentage within its bounds. The user of the following descriptive tables might follow a two step proccdua; in evaluating meaningful differences. First, the user would select variables and contrasts of interest. If any of the selected contrasts' effect sizes differ by .2 or more (\"medium\" size effect) then he or she might wish to go to a next step -that of using the standard errors in a formal statistical test. To compute a confidence interval, the user can multiply the standard error for each group by 1.96 (.05 level) or 2.58 (.01 level). Add and subtract that number from the mean to get a range or confidence interval for each group. Then, the user can verify whether the two confidence intervals overlap."}, {"section_title": "READING AND MATHEMATICS PROFICIENCY LEVELS", "text": "Each proficiency score level was marked by four items, which were chosen as having similar difficulty and content. Success, or \"passine a level, was defined as answering at least three of the four items correctly. As described in the text of the report, two such levels were defined for Reading, and three for Mathematics. A description of the skills required to pass each item cluster appears below, along with samples of typical items that might mark each level."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "Advanced Students who are proficient at this level have mastered the two lower proficiency levels and are able to successfully solve simple problem solving tasks. Unlike the basic and intermediate levels, which require rote application of rules, performance at this level requires conceptual understanding and/or the development of a solution strategy. \"Basic\" level items require the ability to successfully carry out simple arithmetical operations on whole numbers. A typical item format might be to present two quantities and ask the student if the first or the second is larger, if they are equal, or if the size relationship cannot be determined from the information given. The quantities presented might contain arithmetic operations, simple algebraic representations, money or measurements. Some examples of two quantities that could be compared: Simple word problems may also be used, such as number sentences (John has 20 balls. Sue has 45. How many more balls does Sue have than John?). Intermediate questions require the same basic competencies, plus the addition of mastery of simple operations with decimals, fractions and roots. The \"quantitative comparison\" format described above might be used, or simple word problems. Examples: 19.823/5.734 . . 4 How many pencils are needed to give y pencils to each of 3 students? Advanced level incorporates the ability to successfully master simple problem solving tasks. Unlike the other levels, which require the rote application of rules, performance at this level requires conceptual understanding and/or the development of a solution strategy. Solutions may require some experience with geometry, algebra, or a logical process. Typical word problems might ask: To give a statement about the area of a particular geometric figure, given the length of a part, such as a radius or side. To simplify an algebraic expression by combining or canceling terms. To determine whether quantities expressed in different terms, such as decimals, fractiors, and percents, are equivalent. (e.g., 5/5, 1.00, 100%) Assigning students to one of three proficiency categories for Reading (less than basic proficiency, basic level, and advanced level) and four analogcs categories for Mathematics was a straightforward process for the majority of test-takers. Most students answered all, or nearly all, of the 21 Reading items and the 40 Mathematics items. Even if a student had omitted one or more items in a 4-item cluster, a pass/fail determination could be made as long as the remaining three items had been answered correctly, or at least two were answered incorrectly. On the Mathematics test, a substantial number of students, about 14%, could not be categorized, the majority because they had omitted some of the items necessary to identify level of proficiency. For about half of these students, it was possible to obtain estimates of the students' skills, using evidence provided by the marker items that were present, as well as responses to other items in the rest of the test. This procedure was not applied to reading proficiency, since the amount of missing proficiency level data on this test was relatively small. Another condition complicating the assignment of proficiency levels was the presence of \"reverse' patterns for a small number of students. That is, a student might answer three out of four items at the advanced level correctly, but fail to do so at the basic level that was assumed to underlie higher-level skills. Such a reversal pattern might be a result of a few careless mistakes combined with a few lucky guesses, or could be related to lack of motivation. In any case, it would be inconsistent with the buildingblock assumption of the proficiency level model. Students with reversal patterns (about 1% for reading, 5.5% for mathematics) were not included in the summary statistics. Comparison of mean test scores for the \"reversal\" students with those for the sample as a whole indicated that the missing scores were unlikely to have introduced a systematic bias into the national estimates reported in the text.
