[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to create a comprehensive list of the vascular plants of Shenandoah County, Virginia. Specimens were collected from the field during the 2011 growing season, from March 21 to October 27, and part of the 2012 growing season, from March 22 to May 30. Local herbaria of James Madison University (JMUH), Bridgewater College (BDWR), Eastern Mennonite University (HAVI) and Lord Fairfax Community College (LFCC) were searched for preexisting specimens. The results of the study were compared to records of the Digital Atlas of the Virginia Flora, which currently maps the distribution of vascular plants in Virginia. The combined list based on field collections, pre-existing herbarium specimens, and the Digital Atlas comprises a total of 1,296 species in 568 genera and 142 families. Of these, 57 species are ferns and fern allies, 8 are gymnosperms, 911 are dicots, and 320 are monocots. The records represent 1,009 species native to Virginia, 271 introduced, 12 of uncertain native status, and 2 species believed to occur in both native and introduced populations. Of the 271 introduced species, 61 are considered invasive to some degree. Forty-one species are considered rare in Virginia, and one is endangered at the federal level. This survey resulted in 53 county records, 2 of which also represent state records. Voucher specimens of new field collections are housed in JMUH."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In the mid-16th century, colonial botanists were beginning to explore the eastern portions of North America, and Virginia in particular. These discoveries led to significant contributions to the existing floristic knowledge. One such contribution came from Virginia botanist John Clayton, whose collections and manuscripts culminated in 1739 with the first published Flora of the new world, Flora Virginica (Gronovius 1739) . While earlier studies would generally cover a large geographic range, botanical endeavors in more recent times have become more thorough and often focus on localized areas. For instance, Earl J. Grimes and his wife studied the entire Virginia Peninsula, and their work culminated in 1924 with the publication of Flora of the Peninsula of Virginia (Erlanson 1924) . A number of other botanists also specialized in distinct habitats or regions: H.A. Allard focused on Bull Run Mountain and areas of northern Virginia, Lena Artz studied the flora of Massanutten Mountain, and Lloyd Carr made collections around the ponds and wetlands of Augusta County. In 1961, A.B. Massey published Virginia Flora, a catalog that accounted for Virginia's flora as a whole (Massey 1961) .\nSeveral surveys have been conducted in specific counties throughout the state as well, including nearby Rockingham County, recently updated by Peters, McMullen, and Hill in Noteworthy Additions to the Vascular Flora of Rockingham County, Virginia (2005) . However, a formal survey of Shenandoah County has never been performed. Much of what is known about the county's floristic composition comes from the Atlas of the Virginia Flora (Harvill et al. 1992) . The fourth edition of this document is available online as the Digital Atlas of the Virginia Flora (Virginia Botanical Associates 2012). This resource is frequently updated and provides distribution records for known Virginia ferns and fern allies, gymnosperms, monocots, and dicots. Most recently, the Flora of Virginia (Weakley et al. 2012 ) was published, making available the first official state Flora since Flora Virginica in 1739.\nAccording to records from the Digital Atlas of the Virginia Flora, there were already between 1,240 and 1,250 vascular plants known to occur in Shenandoah County (Virginia Botanical Associates 2012). The goals of the current survey were to supply new data from field collections and from existing specimens found in local herbaria. The purpose behind these objectives was to compile a comprehensive record of the vascular plants of Shenandoah County, Virginia, contribute to the knowledge of the Virginia flora, and to provide baseline data for other branches of research. Voucher specimens from new field collections are housed in the James Madison University Herbarium (JMUH)."}, {"section_title": "THE STUDY AREA", "text": "Shenandoah County is part of the Shenandoah Valley on the northwestern edge of Virginia. It is bordered by Frederick County to the north, Warren and Page Counties to the east, Rockingham County to the south, and Hardy County, West Virginia to the west. Generally elongated in a northeast to southwest direction, the county is approximately 58 km long and 24-27 km wide. The total land area is roughly 1,320 km 2 (Crater PDC 2010). Major geographical features are the Massanutten Mountain range, which lies on the eastern edge of the county and the Great North Mountain range on the western border. The North Fork of the Shenandoah River runs through the length of the county."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Setting", "text": "The diverse landscape and climate of Shenandoah County has a substantial impact on the local flora. Researchers attempting to analyze the influence of environmental factors on species diversity commonly focus on one or two features at a time; however, species richness is often better understood from a multifactor approach (Pausas and Austin 2001) . Reviewers on the topic have found that environmental factors such as topography, climate, soil and geology can all influence species diversity (Pausus and Austin 2001, Lundholm 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Topography", "text": "Shenandoah County is part of the Ridge and Valley province of Virginia. This physiographic province includes the rolling hills of the valley and the mountains of the surrounding area. The county is bordered on the east by the Massanutten Mountain Range and on the west by the Appalachians (USDA Soil Conservation Service 1991).\nThe three main components of topography are elevation, slope and aspect. Of the three, elevation is considered the most influential on vegetation patterns (Miller 1986 , Young et al. 2009 ). The lowest elevations are approximately 150 m above sea level and occur in the northwestern part of the county along the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. The highest elevation is 1,003 m at Great North Mountain on the western edge of the county (USGS 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Soil", "text": "Soils in Shenandoah County are classified into series within four main soil orders. These groups make up the Alfisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Ultisols (USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2008) . Most Alfisols contain a significant amount of clay leached from the upper surface, and are typically formed in forest or savanna. Alfisols also have a medium to high saturation of bases, and water is generally available in the soil for growth of vegetation. These combined properties make them suitable for cultivation (Soil Survey Staff 1999) . Alfisols in Shenandoah County are mainly located in the central valley area and make up nearly 13% of the soils. Some major series that make up this group are the Endcav, Chilhowie and CarboEndcav complex, all formed from calcareous shale and limestone. These three groups are generally silt loam to silty clay loam on slopes from 2-55% and can be rocky to very rocky (USDA, NRCS 2008) .\nInceptisols encompass a wide range of characteristics and environments, but are considered less developed than other soil orders from a lack of weathering; they occur on mountain slopes around newly exposed surfaces and in river valleys from recently deposited sediments (Soil Survey Staff 1999) . In the county, Inceptisols make up approximately 28% of the soils. Major series are the Wallen, Weikert-Berks complex and Berks-Weikert complex. The Wallen series is a channery sandy loam weathered from sand-stone and is found on slopes from 2-70%. The Weikert-Berks and Berks-Weikert complexes are channery silt loam soils formed from sandstone and shale on slopes from 7-70%. These three groups can be very to extremely stony (USDA, NRCS 2008) .\nMollisols are characterized by a thick, dark upper layer, and are rich in nutrients and bases. Most were formed under grasses but are known from forest areas as well (Soil Survey Staff 1999) . Mollisols collectively only make up about 2% of the soils in Shenandoah County. Located along floodplains, these soils are composed of alluvium from limestone, sandstone and shale materials. Series include Broadway, Gladehill, Massanetta, Newmarc, Nomberville, and Wolfgap. The majority of these are loam or silty loam, on slopes of 0-5% (USDA, NRCS 2008) .\nUltisols are similar to Alfisols with an accumulation of clay in the lower horizons and an adequate supply of moisture. Ultisols, however, leach a large amount of other materials and are relatively low in bases. These soils were formed in forested areas (Soil Survey Staff 1999) . Ultisols are the most common group of soils in the county at around 29%. Representatives of this group include the Laidig, Gilpin, and Unison series. Located on hills and uplands, Laidig is a channery loam formed from sandstone and shale. Gilpin may be a silt loam or a channery silt loam formed from shale, sandstone, and siltstone. Both Laidig and Gilpin can be very stony on slopes from 2-55%. Unison is a loam that may be gravelly or cobbly on slopes of 2-15%. These soils are found on stream terraces within the valley and are composed of alluvium from acid crystalline rocks (USDA, NRCS 2008) .\nOther series may form complexes that cross taxonomic orders. Lehew and Gainesboro soils together are about 2% of the county and make up a group of Inceptisols-Ultisols. The soils are derived from sandstone and shale and are located mostly in the uplands of the southwestern part of the county. The Frederick and Poplimento silt loams are found on hills and uplands in the central part of the valley and make up a group of Ultisols-Alfisols. The Frederick component of this group is derived from mostly dolomitic limestone, while the Poplimento component is derived from limestone, shale, and siltstone. These soils together are around 19% of the soils in the county. The Gainesboro-Berks complex makes up a group of Ultisols-Inceptisols and is <1% of the total soils. Small plots located on uplands near the western edge of the county are derived from weathered shale, sandstone, and siltstone (USDA, NRCS 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Bedrock", "text": "The underlying bedrock in Shenandoah County is of the Paleozoic Era and covers periods from Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian ages. Along the center of the valley between the bordering mountain ranges are units of Cambrian and Ordovician Periods. Of this period, the bedrock is primarily limestone and dolomite west of US Highway 11. The formations here include the Beekmantown Group; Conococheague Formation; Edinburg Formation, Lincolnshire, and New Market Limestones; and Elbrook Formation. To the east of this marker, the bedrock is primarily shale. The Martinsburg and Oranda Formations belong to this area. The Juniata, Oswego, Martinsburg (Reedsville and Dolly Ridge), and Eggleston Formations, which are also mostly shale, are found to the northwest of the county (Dicken et al. 2005) .\nThe mountain ranges on either side of the county are made up of Silurian and Devonian units. This bedrock is composed primarily of sandstone and shale. The formations in this section include the Brallier Formation; Chemung Formation; Hampshire Formation; Keefer, Rose Hill, and Tuscarora Formations; Mahantango Formation; Marcellus Shale and Needmore Formation; Massanutten Sandstone; Millboro Shale and Needmore Formation; and the Ridgeley Sandstone, Helderberg, and Cayugan Groups (Dicken et al. 2005 )."}, {"section_title": "Climate", "text": "The climate in Shenandoah County is classified as warm temperate and fully humid with hot summers (Rubel and Kottek 2010) . From data collected at the Woodstock station, mean annual temperature is 11.18C. The lowest temperatures occur in January with an average of \u00c00.88C, and reach a peak in July with an average of 23.18C. Groundwater is an important resource in the region. It often returns to the surface naturally by springs and interconnected channels, contributing on average 30% to the flow of waterways aboveground. Groundwater also returns to the surface by wells. Approximately 80% of the county's population relies on groundwater for daily use, and around areas of karst topography, aquifers supply enough for agricultural, domestic, and public uses. In the uplands where bedrock is mostly sandstone and shale, groundwater is less abundant and generally provides only enough for rural and domestic use (Water Resources Advisory Committee n.d.)."}, {"section_title": "Land Use", "text": "Shenandoah County is primarily rural. National land cover data from the US Geological Survey (2011) indicates that about 30.4% of the total land area is used for agriculture. However, according to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, 572 km 2 are ''land in farms,'' which is closer to 43% of the total land area. The latter statistic, though, also includes 124 km 2 of woodland. Of the total farmland, 244 km 2 are invested in crops. Forage crops are the most common, followed by corn and soybeans. A large part of the remaining farmland, 182 km 2 , is permanent pasture and rangeland, with 21 km 2 described as farmsteads, buildings, facilities, etc. (USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service 2009).\nForested land comprises about 61.6% of the total area. This area is broken down into deciduous forest (52.1%), coniferous forest (6.0%), and mixed forest (3.5%). Of the total forested land area, 36.6% is federally owned as part of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests . During these periods, field trips were taken, on average, once a week. Sites were revisited as needed to account for phenological variation.\nCollection sites were based largely on accessibility. The least restricted areas are national forest, public lands, and transportation/utilities. Combined, these areas are only a quarter of the total unincorporated land area (Shenandoah County Citizens' Advisory Committee 2005), so permissions were granted to survey Devil's Backbone State Forest and other private properties throughout the county. Transportation was also an important factor determining accessibility. The road network is extensive along the center of the valley but there is considerably less access to slopes of the mountain ridges. Many collection sites were chosen due to their proximity to roads.\nBasic shearing and digging tools were used to collect plant material. Specimens from the field were collected only when reproductive structures (such as spores, flowers, fruit, seeds, and cones) were present to ensure accurate identi-fication and the creation of useful herbarium specimens. Information about each collection was recorded in a field notebook and included the collection date, location, number, and species name. Precise locations were recorded by GPS coordinates using a Garmin GPSmap 76CSx (Garmin International Inc., Olathe, Kansas). Additional information that was sometimes included were physical plant features that would not be obvious from a dried specimen, ecological setting, and associated species if applicable. Once collected, plants were pressed, dried, and mounted using typical herbarium techniques. The resulting herbarium specimens are stored in the James Madison University Herbarium (JMUH).\nPlants were identified using fresh material in the field and/or using specimens brought back to the herbarium. (Newcomb 1977) were used as references for identifications. Documents from the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (Townsend 2012 , VDCR 2009 were used to identify rare and invasive species. Assignment of species to genera and families, scientific nomenclature, and resident status followed the Flora of Virginia (Weakley et al. 2012) , with the Digital Atlas of the Virginia Flora (Virginia Botanical Associates 2012) being consulted for nomenclature on a few subspecies and varieties.\nIn addition to the field study, local herbaria were searched for pre-existing county specimens. The four herbaria nearest to Shenandoah County are James Madison University (JMUH), Bridgewater College (BDWR), Eastern Mennonite University (HAVI), and Lord Fairfax Community College (LFCC). Bridgewater College Herbarium and HAVI both contained fewer than 5,000 specimens each. Records from BDWR were received in electronic format so this herbarium was not visited. James Madison University Herbarium and LFCC contained collections of nearly 20,000 specimens each. The identities of specimens representing new county records from all herbaria were verified before inclusion in the survey."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "In 2011, 600 field collections were made from March 21-October 27, and in 2012, 50 collections were made from March 22-May 30. Six specimens inadvertently collected outside the county boundary were removed from the survey. Overall, the 644 collections of Shenandoah County represent 516 species in 337 genera and 103 families. Herbarium searches resulted in the inclusion of 1,492 specimens. These specimens represent 726 species in 400 genera and 125 families. An additional 405 species are recognized by the Digital Atlas of the Virginia Flora (Virginia Botanical Associates 2012) as being present in Shenandoah County, the vast majority of which are also found in one or more adjacent counties. These species have been included, although the specimens upon which they are based were not annotated. The combined results of the field collections, herbarium specimens, and the Digital Atlas make up a total of 1,296 species in 568 genera and 142 families.\nOf the 1,296 total species, 57 are ferns and fern allies, eight are gymnosperms, 320 are monocots, and 911 are dicots. The most common family in the county is Asteraceae with 165 species. Other large families, including number of species, are Poaceae (119), Cyperaceae (92), Fabaceae (60), Rosaceae (57), Lamiaceae (42), Brassicaceae (37), Ranunculaceae (33), and Apiaceae (25). Considering new collections and herbarium specimens, 53 species are new records for the county. Of these, 41 species are found in at least one county adjacent to Shenandoah. The remaining species are primarily distributed throughout the state, although Solidago patula is known only from Ridge and Valley counties in the southern part of the state, and Minuartia patula has been recorded from four Ridge and Valley counties and one Piedmont county. Two of the county records also represent state records, Aesculus glabra (Sapindaceae) and Leavenworthia uniflora (Brassicaceae). The closest locality of A. glabra to Shenandoah County is in Morgan County, West Virginia, in the northern panhandle (Harmon et al. 2006) . Among the Shenandoah specimens was a large tree growing in a churchyard. This tree may have been planted, but there were several younger trees nearby that appear to have arisen from this parent tree, and at least one had reached reproductive maturity. Leavenworthia uniflora was collected from the edge of the parking lot of the same church. The nearest states where this species is known are Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee (USDA, NRCS 2012). These populations should be monitored to determine their persistence and possible spread to other locations within the county or state.\nOf all 1,296 species, 1,009 are native to Virginia, 271 are introduced, 12 are of uncertain status, and 2 species are believed to be present in both native and introduced populations. Of the 271 introduced species, 61 are considered invasive to some degree, from occasionally to highly invasive (VDCR 2009). Forty-one species are considered rare in Virginia. One of these rare species, Boechera serotina, is listed as endangered at the federal level and threatened at the state level (Townsend 2012 )."}, {"section_title": "Vegetation Patterns", "text": "Shenandoah County's environmental heterogeneity generates a diverse set of flora, and plant communities take form within several habitat types.
