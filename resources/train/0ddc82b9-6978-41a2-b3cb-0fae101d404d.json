[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Demands of molecular diagnosis to testing COVID-19 are fast growing around the world and costs and efficiency of the RT-PCR technique has been in check. In this context, different RT-PCR kits are used to identify SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients' samples are now available, using just one or multiple gene targets , (Pizzol et al. 2020 , Mathuria et al. 2020 .\nAfter six months in the covid-19 pandemic, Brazil is between major countries affected by disease (Hallal et al. 2020) . Genome vigilance of the virus is now occurring and variants of the virus genome are disposable to genomic banks permitting check of the virus specificity of the disposable tests (Candido et al. 2020) . Some studies are comparing sensitivity and specificity of different sets of probes/primers against different gene targets of the SARS-CoV-2. In this context, the conserved nucleocapsid protein gene (N) is the major target present in the disposable tests (Pizzol et al. 2020 ) and US CDC test includes two sets of primers with good sensitivity to virus detection (Etievant et al. 2020 ). In addition, recent work demonstrates some mutation in the forward primer to N gene target in Chinese CDC test, suggesting US CDC test can be more appropriate to Brazilian testing (Candido et al. 2020) .\nIn this article, we compared the fitness between both commercial N gene targets present in the US CDC panel to SARS-CoV-2 and we identified similar results using both targets. In addition, we verified that high Ct value in patient samples presents low reproducibility, suggesting that this range of Ct value can contribute to misinterpretation in the test results.\n.

The use of many targets is justified by frequency of alteration in the viral genomes that can reduce the capacity of primer sets to detect the virus, but at same way is responsible to need more sophisticated apparatus to do diagnosis (Liu et al. 2020 ). We detect no mutation in N gene in the Latin American genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the regions targets of US CDC primers set (supplementary figure 2) . In addition, we identified nonspecific amplification using both primers set (figure 2B-C), which can be explained by annealing primers in different human genome regions (supplementary figure 2). Our data suggest that traditional PCR method and acrylamide gels can alternatively be used in remote locals with poor access to molecular tools.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted December 8, 2020. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.06.20244905 doi: medRxiv preprint primers and probe sets for virus detection has been evaluated, but there are still few studies that assess the sensitivity and specificity in the critical range of detection of the RT-PCR technique (Mathuria et al. 2020 ). Among the most sensitive primer and probe sets are those for target N available by the US CDC (Vogels et al. 2020 , Etievant et al. 2020 ) , . In this study, we evaluated the performance of the two sets of primers and probes used by the CDC and identified that both presented the same diagnostic performance, suggesting that only one of the targets could be used in the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, as with other tests that use just one molecular target reducing costs (Pizzol et al. 2020 , Mathuria et al. 2020 ). Liu et al. 2020 evaluated the performance of primer and probes sets from different RT-PCR diagnostic kits for COVID-19, finding results similar to those of our study (Liu et al. 2020 ). Here, we assessed the performance of the US CDC primer set on sputum and swabs patient samples and noted a similar performance between the two N1 and N2 targets for virus detection. Some studies have compared the sensitivity between specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and identified that saliva samples may have a similar or superior sensitivity to swab samples (G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc et al. 2020 , Wyllie et al. 2020 ).\nThe RT-qPCR is the gold standard technique for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it has been used to validate alternative diagnostic methods for COVID-19 (Pizzol et al. 2020 , Mathuria et al. 2020 . However, data that assess the sensitivity and specificity of the technique for the higher Ct ranges are still scarce (Mathuria et al. 2020) . In this sense, a study evaluated the Ct value of health workers who underwent two tests and found an increase in the Ct value in an interval of 21 days between exams (Cariani et al. 2020) . Most commercial diagnostic tests recommend that Ct values below 40 be considered as the cutoff point for a positive diagnosis for coronavirus (Liu et al. 2020 , Vogels et al. 2020 , on behalf of the SARS-CoV-2 Foch Hospital study group et .

However, studies that evaluated the detection limit, as well as, our study have shown a low predictive value of RT-qPCR in samples with Ct above 35 using the US CDC protocol (Liu et al. 2020 , Vogels et al. 2020 . In this study, we found that patients with Ct samples above 33, when retested in a short period of time, may have the test result drastically altered, suggesting that high Ct values have a low positive predictive value. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing need for molecular testing, many laboratories have not been able to adequately assess the efficiency of the tests made available for use and they are using Ct value below 40 as positive diagnoses for SARS-CoV-2. We identified, by repeating two or more times the sample extraction with high Ct, that these samples have low reproducibility, suggesting the need for patient return to completely repeat the US CDC test for greater diagnostic security. We identified that the low reproducibility of samples in the Ct range above 34 for US CDC primer sets could happen for 3 reasons: (i) cross contamination of the samples during processing; (ii) low viral load in the samples due to the final or initial stage of infection (iii) presence of low viral load close to the detection limit of the technique.\nFew cases of reinfection have been reported in different countries around the world (Prado-Vivar et al. 2020 , Van Elslande et al. 2020 , Tillett et al. 2020 ).\nThe reinfection data report a case of mild infection with low viral load and high Ct value followed by a period without positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 infection and a second infection with high viral load and severe symptoms and followed by serology positive (Prado-Vivar et al. 2020 , Tillett et al. 2020 . In view of the data in this study, we consider that the authors should exercise caution in stating cases of reinfection based on high Ct values in either of the two episodes reported in the same patient. In addition, a definitive study on humoral response demonstrated a robust long-term production of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patients infected only once (Wajnberg .

Evidence of reinfection should take into account cases in which there was a clear viral load in both episodes and could rule out the presence of cross-contamination between samples during the analyzes, which could explain both the high Ct values between the samples and the genetic diversity observed. Then, any case report presented viral load below Ct value 30 in both episodes of infection should be considered reinfection (Prado-Vivar et al. 2020 , Van Elslande et al. 2020 , Tillett et al. 2020 ).\nTogether, our data show that both N1 and N2 sets of probes and primers can be used individually for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, we found that the RT-qPCR technique involving US CDC primers should be used with caution in the diagnosis of patients whenever the Ct values are close to the detection limit established by each one laboratory services. We recommend that samples with Ct above the detection limit be re-extracted and reanalyzed by an alternative protocol and in cases of doubt, a new examination must be performed on the patient before the diagnosis can be released as positive. The data from this and study has an impact on the interpretation of future data about the COVID-19 pandemic and on the conduct of sample analysis using the N gene as a target. \nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted December 8, 2020. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.06.20244905 doi: medRxiv preprint Ct >34 10,9 10,9 9,5 11,2 Ct failure** 5,1 5,3 6,7 11,2 *Data from 1029 different patient samples. **Ct failure were just one target presents amplification .
