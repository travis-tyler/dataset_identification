It is based on final data describing a nationally representative sample of undergraduates who entered postsecondary education for the first time during the 2011-12 academic year. BPS:12/14 covers the experiences of these first-time beginning students over 3 academic years, 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14, and provides information about the rates at which students completed degrees or certificates as well as the rates at which they persisted at the same institution, transferred to other institutions, or left postsecondary education without completing degrees or certificates. The findings presented in this report have been chosen to demonstrate the range of information available when using BPS data rather than to discuss all of the observed differences, and they are not meant to emphasize any particular issue."}, {"section_title": "BPS:12/14 Data Collection", "text": "The first-time postsecondary students in the BPS:12/14 study were identified in the 2011-12 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:12). NPSAS:12 is a nationally representative sample of about 95,000 undergraduate and 16,000 graduate students attending about 1,500 Title IV eligible postsecondary institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 1 Approximately 37,000 respondents were identified in the NPSAS:12 survey as potential first-time beginning postsecondary students and became the sample for the BPS:12/14 longitudinal study. The NPSAS:12 study sample represents the approximately 23 million 2 undergraduates enrolled in 2011-12, and the BPS:12/14 study sample represents the approximately 4 million undergraduates who were first-time postsecondary students in 2011-12. First-time beginners in the BPS:12/14 study participated in two interviews: in 2012, at the end of their first year in postsecondary education, and 3 years after they had started postsecondary education in 2014. In 2012, the interview covered a variety of topics, including students' enrollment characteristics during the first year, their education aspirations, and their demographic characteristics. Conducted between INTRODUCTION February and November of 2014, the second interview focused on their enrollment patterns since 2012, including any transfers to other institutions, stopout periods, attendance intensity, and certificates and degrees earned. Respondents also provided a brief employment history. The interview asked those who were still enrolled for more details about their academic and social experiences in postsecondary education and asked those who had left postsecondary education, either with or without a degree or certificate, for more detailed employment information. BPS:12/14 draws on many sources of data. Information about first-time postsecondary students' first year comes from NPSAS:12, which included a student interview and information from institutional records, federal financial aid applications, and federal student loan and Pell Grant records. Data on 2011-12 firsttime postsecondary students in 2014 are based primarily on the follow-up student interviews. The first follow-up data also integrate students' enrollment records from the National Student Clearinghouse; information from federal databases also used in the base year, such as the Central Processing System (CPS), the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS); and information from college admissions test agencies. In both study years, student interviews were distributed as web-based questionnaires that were either self-administered or conducted by a trained interviewer. In 2014, about 24,770 students completed the interview, resulting in a weighted interview response rate of 68 percent. For more information, a glossary describing the variables used in the tables is provided in appendix A. The technical notes in appendix B supply additional information about response rates, data collection, file preparation, and analysis. Publications and public access datasets for BPS studies are also available on the NCES websites http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/bps and http://nces.ed.gov/datalab."}, {"section_title": "Organization of Tables in This Report", "text": "The tables in this report present information about beginning postsecondary students' enrollment and completion from two different perspectives. The first perspective, shown in tables 1-3, is that of the student. Specifically, these tables provide information on 2011-12 beginning students' attainment and persistence anywhere by spring 2014. Attainment results include the percentage of students whose highest credential completed as of spring 2014 was a certificate, associate's degree, or bachelor's degree, regardless of where the credential was completed. Among those who had not yet attained a credential, persistence information is shown, again regardless of where students attended. Persistence results include the percentage of students who were enrolled in a 4-year institution, enrolled in a less-than-4year INTRODUCTION 3 institution, and not enrolled by spring of 2014. Table 1 shows these results for all first-time beginning students, table 2 limits the results to those who began at a public 2year college, and table 3 limits the results to those who began at a 4-year institution. Within each table, results are disaggregated by key enrollment and student characteristics. The second perspective, shown in tables 4-6, is students' attainment and retention at the first institution attended. These tables first report the percentage of students whose highest credential earned at the first institution was a certificate, associate's degree, or bachelor's degree. The tables then show the percentage who had not yet attained a credential but were still enrolled at the first institution, had left the first institution but had enrolled at another institution, or had left the first institution and had yet to enroll in another institution. Again, within each table, results are disaggregated by key enrollment and student characteristics. In considering the attainment results presented in tables 1-6, note that the normal length of time it takes for a full-time student to complete a program and attain a certificate or degree depends on the type of program. Vocational certificate programs normally take less than 2 years to complete, associate's degree programs are often completed in 2 or 3 years, and bachelor's degree programs in 4 or 5 years. The 3-year period covered in this report (from July 2011 to June 2014) is long enough for many students beginning in 2011-12 to complete certificates and associate's degrees but too short for most students to complete bachelor's degrees. The last table gives context for the statistics in tables 1-6 by providing statistics about the sample. Table 7 presents percentage distributions of the enrollment and student characteristics included in the previous tables for each of the populations examined: all first-time postsecondary students, those beginning at public 2-year institutions, and those beginning at 4-year institutions."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Attainment and persistence at any institution within 3 years (2012-14)", "text": "\u2022 Among 2011-12 first-time postsecondary students, 7 percent had completed a certificate, 7 percent had completed an associate's degree, and 1 percent had completed a bachelor's degree at any institution within 3 years (table 1).

As shown in table B5, the weights compensate for the unequal probability of selection of institutions and students in the NPSAS:12 sample and ensure that estimates generated from sample data represent the target population. The weight also adjusts for multiplicity 8 at the institution and student levels and unknown student eligibility for NPSAS:12 and for APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY B-11 subsampling, unknown eligibility, nonresponse, and population coverage in BPS:12/14. A single weight was constructed for BPS:12/14 for those sample members who had a completed or partial BPS:12/14 interview. This weight supports joint analysis of NPSAS:12 variables and variables obtained directly or derived from the BPS:12/14 interview.

NPSAS project staff conducted a nonresponse bias analysis during NPSAS:12 for each of these categories. Wine et al. (2014) provides more information regarding the institution bias analysis."}, {"section_title": "Bias Analysis: Student Level", "text": "As shown in table B-3, the NPSAS:12 weighted study response rate for students was above 85 percent overall and for all institution categories defined by control, level, and doctorate-granting status except for private for-profit less-than-2-year institutions. As shown in table B-4, the BPS:12/14 weighted response rate for students was below 85 percent overall and all categories of institution defined by control, level, and doctorate-granting status. Therefore, a student-level nonresponse bias analysis was conducted overall and within institution categories for BPS:12/14. The following variables were used for nonresponse bias analysis: 9 \u2022 control, level, and doctorate-granting status of institution (categorical); \u2022 region (categorical); \u2022 age as of NPSAS:12 (categorical); \u2022 CPS match as of NPSAS:12 (yes/no); \u2022 federal aid receipt (yes/no); \u2022 Pell Grant receipt (yes/no); \u2022 Pell Grant amount (categorical); \u2022 Stafford Loan receipt (yes/no); \u2022 Stafford Loan amount (categorical); \u2022 institutional aid receipt (yes/no); \u2022 state aid receipt (yes/no); \u2022 major (categorical); \u2022 institution enrollment from IPEDS file (categorical); \u2022 any grant aid receipt (categorical); and \u2022 graduation rate (categorical). First, for each category of the variables listed above, BPS:12/14 statisticians estimated the nonresponse bias by comparing estimates from base-weighted respondents with those of both nonrespondents and the full sample to determine if the differences were statistically significant at the 5 percent level. The two comparisons yielded identical bias estimates but not always the same significancetesting results. Second, BPS:12/14 statisticians computed nonresponse adjustments to reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for key variables included in the models. Third, using base weights adjusted for nonresponse, staff re-estimated bias and performed statistical tests to check for any remaining significant nonresponse bias. Finally, to better understand the effect of poststratification on efforts to reduce nonresponse bias, BPS 12/14 staff created two additional sets of estimates. The first, the difference between respondent means before and after poststratification, represents the effect of poststratification on nonresponse adjustments. The second, the difference between base-weighted full sample means and the poststratified respondent means, represents the cumulative effect of all weighting and adjustment steps. Bias estimates and differences derived from variable categories with fewer than 30 nonrespondents were excluded from the calculation of summary statistics displayed in tables B-6 and B-7. In total, 97 variable categories were defined from the 15 variables selected for the bias analysis. These 97 variable categories formed the basis of the nonresponse bias analysis. In general, nonresponse weight adjustments reduced nonresponse bias for estimates overall and within institution categories defined by control, level, and doctorate-granting status. As shown in table B-6, the percentage of variable categories that were significantly biased before weighting ranged from 7 percent for private nonprofit less-than-4-year institutions to 62 percent among institutions overall. After the nonresponse weight adjustment, the percentage of variable categories that remained significantly biased ranged from 0 percent for public lessthan-2-year and private nonprofit 4-year doctorate-granting institutions to 17 percent for public 4year doctorate-granting institutions.  As shown in table B-7, the mean and median absolute differences between estimated means for respondents before and after poststratification adjustment were greatest among public less-than-2-year institutions and private nonprofit less-than-4-year institutions. After the poststratification adjustment, the mean absolute differences between means for the full sample and respondents did not exceed 5, the value for public less-than-2-year institutions. The highest median was 4 percent in among private nonprofit less-than-4-year institutions. This indicates that the combined set of nonresponse and poststratification adjustments reduces bias more than the nonresponse adjustment alone. For more details on weight adjustments, please refer to the forthcoming BPS:12/14 Data File Documentation (Hill et al. forthcoming 2 Full sample is weighted using the base weight, adjusted for multiplicity and unknown eligibility. Respondents after poststratification adjustment are weighted using the base weight, unknown eligibility, nonresponse, and poststratification. 1 Respondents before poststratification adjustment are weighted using the base weight, unknown eligibility, and nonresponse. Respondents after poststratification adjustment are weighted using the base weight, unknown eligibility, nonresponse, and poststratification. NOTE: Variable categories with fewer than 30 nonrespondents were suppressed for calculations in this table.

Base weights must be used in such analysis. Comparison items should have very high response rates\u2026. This approach may be limited to the extent that items available for respondents and nonrespondents may not be related to the low response rate item being analyzed\" (U.S. Department of Education 2012). Moreover, NCES Statistical Standard 1-3-5 states: \"Item response rates (RRI) are calculated as the ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained (I x for item x) to the number of respondents who are asked to answer that item. The number asked to answer an item is the number of unit level respondents (I) minus the number of respondents with a valid skip for item x (V x ). When an abbreviated questionnaire is used to convert refusals, the eliminated questions are treated as item nonresponse\u2026. In the case of constructed variables, the numerator includes cases that have available data for the full set of items required to construct the variable, and the denominator includes all respondents eligible to respond to all items in the constructed variable\" (U.S. Department of Education 2012). The item response rate is calculated as: NCES Standard 1-3-5 also states that response rates for composite variables must account for missing inputs prior to imputation. Therefore a study member was defined as a respondent for a variable if she had data for that variable from any source, including logical imputation. Nonrespondents for variables are study members who did not have data for that variable from any source. As shown in table B-8, the weighted item response rates for items used in this report ranged from 71 percent to 100 percent overall. The weighted item response rates within the institution categories analyzed ranged from 63 percent to 100 percent.     NOTE: Weighted item response rates are calculated per NCES Statistical Standard 1-3-5 as the ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained to the number of respondents who are asked to answer that item. BPS:12/14 statisticians produced the replicate weights using a method that combines the approaches developed by Flyer (1987) and Kott (1988). The BPS:12/14 method incorporated the finite population correction factor only at the first stage (NPSAS:12 institution sampling)."}, {"section_title": "Cautions for Analysts", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sources of Error", "text": "The estimates in this report are subject to sampling and nonsampling errors. Nonsampling errors are due to a number of issues, including but not limited to nonresponse, coding and data entry errors, misspecification of composite variables, and inaccurate imputations. A study like BPS:12/14 includes multiple sources of data for some variables (CPS, institutional records, student interviews, NSC, etc.), and reporting differences can occur among data sources. Data swapping and other forms of perturbation implemented to protect respondent confidentiality can also lead to inconsistencies. Sampling errors exist in all sample-based datasets, including BPS:12/14. Estimates calculated from a sample will differ from estimates calculated from other samples even if all the samples used the same sample design and methods. The standard error is a measure of the precision of the estimate accounting for sampling error. In this report, analysts calculated standard errors using bootstrap replication procedures in PowerStats.

First, prior to NPSAS:04, institutions that only offered correspondence courses were not eligible for NPSAS. NPSAS:12, however, included such institutions if they were eligible to distribute Title IV student aid. Second, starting with NPSAS:2000, samples were limited to institutions participating in federal Title IV student aid programs. In earlier NPSAS surveys which served as the base-year for BPS (NPSAS:90 and NPSAS:96), about 1 percent of undergraduate students, mainly concentrated in for-profit less-than-2-year institutions, attended institutions that were not eligible for Title IV aid. When comparing estimates from APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY B-21 prior BPS cohorts, analysts may want to exclude cases that were sampled from an institution that was not eligible to participate in Title IV aid programs (T4ELIG) in the prior studies (BPS:90 and BPS:96). Third, prior BPS cohorts sampled institutions in Puerto Rico. There are approximately 80 institutions in Puerto Rico enrolling about 1 percent of all undergraduate students in the nation. In BPS:04/09, students attending institutions in Puerto Rico made up about 8 percent of Hispanic FTBs. Analysts wishing to compare other BPS administrations may filter on COMPTO87 to exclude Puerto Rico. Fourth, previous BPS administrations did not require that the NPSAS institution be the first institution a student attended after completing high school for the student to be eligible for the study. Therefore, the first institution a respondent attended was not necessarily the NPSAS institution. In BPS:12/14 students who reported in the eligibility section that the NPSAS institution was not the first postsecondary institution they attended after completing high school were excluded from the study sample. Nevertheless, 1 percent of BPS:12/14 respondents indicated later in the interview, in the enrollment section, that they had attended another institution 1 or more months prior to attending the NPSAS institution and during the 2011-12 academic year. Despite this discrepancy, in BPS:12/14 these respondents' first institution is defined as the NPSAS institution. Fifth, beginning with NPSAS:90, a design change was made to improve NPSAS fullyear estimates. NPSAS:90-sampled students were enrolled at four discrete points in time: summer (August), fall (October), winter (February), and spring (June). Since implementation of NPSAS in 1993, institutions have been asked to provide one list that represents students enrolled at any time during the respective financial aid award year. In NPSAS:90, those students who were initially sampled in the fall could have been enrolled for the full academic year. Finally, the BPS:12/14 analysis file contains all BPS sample members who responded to the student interview. BPS:04/06, however, made use of data from other sources, including NSC, sources to define study respondents who were not interview respondents but had sufficient data from these other sources. BPS:04/06 statisticians imputed missing data for study respondents who had not responded to the BPS:04/06 interview. In previous rounds of BPS, the interview nonrespondents appeared on the file but did not have data items and had a value of zero for the analysis weight."}, {"section_title": "B-22", "text": "APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY"}, {"section_title": "PowerStats", "text": "The estimates in this report were produced using PowerStats, a web-based software application that enables users to generate tables for most of the postsecondary surveys conducted by NCES.
