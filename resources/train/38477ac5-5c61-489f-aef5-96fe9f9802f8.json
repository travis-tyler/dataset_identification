[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a rare, nonatherosclerotic arterial disease for which the molecular basis is unknown. We comprehensively studied 47 subjects with FMD, including physical examination, spine magnetic resonance imaging, bone densitometry, and brain magnetic resonance angiography. Inflammatory biomarkers in plasma and transforming growth factor \u2424 (TGF-\u2424) cytokines in patient-derived dermal fibroblasts were measured by ELISA. Arterial pathology other than medial fibrodysplasia with multifocal stenosis included cerebral aneurysm, found in 12.8% of subjects. Extra-arterial pathology included low bone density (P<0.001); early onset degenerative spine disease (95.7%); increased incidence of Chiari I malformation (6.4%) and dural ectasia (42.6%); and physical examination findings of a mild connective tissue dysplasia (95.7%).

Currently there is no medical therapy aimed at preventing progression or treating the underlying vascular pathology. Furthermore, there are no biomarkers or defined clinical features to identify who is at risk or who has the disorder. The current hypothesis of the pathophysiology of FMD is that mechanical factors or local trauma incite aberrant vascular remodeling in genetically predisposed individuals. Histopathologic studies show that medial fibroplasia-type FMD demonstrates lesions comprised of smooth muscle cell hyperplasia in the narrowed portions of arteries, haphazard fibroblast organization, and accumulation of compact fibrous collagen (6, 7) . A paucity of inflammatory cells has been noted in FMD lesions, although whether the arterial remodeling is a sequelae of longterm inflammation or excess cytokine expression as seen in other fibrotic diseases is unknown (6, 8) . Both sporadic and familial cases have been reported. Limited pedigree studies show an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance and variable expression (9) . Lesions with similar radiological appearance have been noted in genetically mediated syndromes; however, no causative genes for FMD have been identified to date (10 -13) .\nWe undertook a deep phenotyping study of 47 individuals with FMD to evaluate relevant genetic, clinical, and anatomic features of this vascular disease."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study subjects", "text": "Individuals with a primary clinical diagnosis of FMD made at an outside clinical center and who contacted the U.S. National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging (NIH/ NIA) study center were enrolled and included in the current analysis on confirmation of the presence of medial fibroplasia-type FMD as demonstrated by arterial beading or multifocal stenosis (14, 15) on an outside angiographic imaging study (conventional angiogram, computerized tomography, or magnetic resonance angiography) done as part of each subject's routine clinical care prior to enrollment in the study.

However, systematic evaluation for clinical and musculoskeletal features has not previously been performed. Our results indicate that FMD is a systemic disease with clinical features that extend beyond arterial pathology to include low bone density, joint laxity, and degenerative disease in the spine. The major clinical manifestations of FMD in our study are related to the vascular pathology and pain often related to early onset arthritis and degenerative joint disease in the spine. Based on the constellation of findings, consistent with a mild and subclinical connective tissue dysplasia, we hypothesized that TGF-\u2424 expression alterations may drive these findings in patients with FMD. We tested this hypothesis through assays of circulating plasma and dermal fibroblasts, and we demonstrated that levels of TGF-\u2424 isoforms and other inflammatory cytokines are altered. The demographics and clinical histories of our subjects closely align with a U.S. registry of 447 patients with FMD (20) despite differences in study methodologies. We also are aware of 12 subjects enrolled in our cohort who are also enrolled in the same U.S. registry. Similar features included percentage of female sex (91.5 vs. 91.0%), mean age at presentation (44 vs. 47 yr), prevalence of hypertension (66.0 vs. 72.0% at study enrollment), headache (53.2 vs. 60.0%), current or former history of smoking (38.3 vs. 37.2%), and a history of exogenous hormone use (61.7 vs. 69.6%). However, in our study, 21.3% of our subjects had undergone surgical treatment for FMD with histopathologic confirmation, in contrast to 3.3% in the U.S. registry. A higher proportion of our cohort had experienced a cerebrovascular event (48.9%) as compared to the U.S. registry, which noted TIA in 8.7% and stroke in 6.9% of its participants. This may reflect an ascertainment bias for patients who are more severely affected in being motivated to undertake the travel requirements for participation at the NIH. Our cohort did not include any individuals with asymptomatic disease discovered incidentally, whereas the U.S. registry included 5.6% with no symptoms or signs. In our study, surveillance MRA imaging of the entire arterial tree showed that 53.2% of our study subjects had vascular disease (aneurysm, beading, stenosis, or dissection) involving \u05462 arterial beds. Multiple vascular bed involvement was noted in 26.0 -35.3% of patients with FMD in the U.S. registry who had imaging performed on additional arterial territories as clinically necessitated. Several caveats to the interpretation of our study MRA findings include that motion artifact from breathing is generally problematic for abdominal studies, previously treated arterial beds in cases of prior surgery or stent implantation could not be assessed, and we were unable to study every subject in the cohort because of contraindications to MR and/or gadolinium contrast administration. These caveats may have led to underestimating the severity and burden of systemic disease. Brain MR imaging is less susceptible to motion artifact, and we found that 12.8% of subjects had an intracerebral aneurysm. In the U.S. registry, 9 of 76 (11.8%) individuals with imaging data had a cerebral artery aneurysm, and 16 of 76 (21.1%) had carotid artery aneurysm, including both extracranial and intracranial internal carotid artery. Overall, the close alignment of demographic variables in our study as compared to the U.S. registry indicates that our cohort is a representative sample of U.S. patients with FMD, but likely with more severe clinical disease.

Samples were acid-activated prior to assaying by ELISA. B) Secreted total TGF-\u24241 and -\u24242 from cultured fibroblasts from FMD case subjects is elevated vs. healthy controls ex vivo. Samples were acid activated prior to assaying by ELISA, and secretion data are normalized to protein concentration.\nWhile subjects with FMD had findings often associated with connective tissue dysplasias, including joint laxity, scoliosis, craniofacial features, and pes planus, the findings ranged in severity, with most exhibiting mild and subclinical findings on physical examination. Unlike individuals with hypermobile EDS, FMD case subjects in our study had not come to medical attention due to recurrent dislocations, refractory joint pain, or multiple joint surgeries. Tissue fragility, hollow organ rupture, and lack of healing from surgical scars seen in the vascular form of EDS were not observed. Scoliosis and pes planus, when seen in the FMD case subjects, were much less severe than is typically seen in MFS. Although the severity of the musculoskeletal findings was mild, the pattern of these features in our FMD case subjects may be clinically relevant. Features that were similar to patients with SMAD3 mutations included degenerative or facet changes on spine MRI and spinal stenosis, and neck or back pain in our cohort was common. In addition, extravascular features associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and MFS, including dural ectasia, tonsillar ectopia, and Chiari 1 malformation, were observed (27, 28) . In the clinical setting, the diagnosis of genetic syndromes often requires the consideration of multiple clinical features simultaneously, which may present heterogeneously in individual subjects, thus necessitating the use of scores or multivariable criteria to define a syndrome (28) . In our study, while there was heterogeneity in the number of connective tissue features observed in individuals with FMD, the vast majority (95.7%) showed \u05464 of the features that have been associated with other genetically mediated connective tissue disorders with vascular abnormalities. The pattern of these features most closely resembles that of other connective tissue dysplasias with vascular phenotypes, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, MFS, or ACTA2 mutation syndromes. In terms of vascular pathology, the vascular lesion observed in medial fibroplasia-type FMD appears to be closest to disorders caused by ACTA2 and NF1 mutations, where aneurysms and stenotic lesions can be found simultaneously, rather than primary mutations in TGF-\u2424 pathway genes that typically cause aortic aneurysms and arterial dissections. To ensure that our cohort did not contain individuals with pathogenic mutations in these genes, we screened individuals for specific gene disor- Figure 4 .

No significant differences in biomarker levels were seen between FMD and control fibroblasts. Representative blots are shown; however, quantitation graphs include all samples above. Data were normalized to the loading control.\nders based on the established clinical criteria for genetic testing. We used sequencing to evaluate the target genes in case previously unreported mutations in the same genes caused a milder phenotype overlapping with FMD in our study. The yield of these analyses was low, with no pathogenic mutations identified, consistent with prior reports (21) .\nEnvironmental factors contributing to the development of FMD have been proposed and include smoking and mechanical risk factors (6). Hypercholesterolemia was not more prevalent in our patients compared to population estimates (29) . Given the preponderance of disease in women and prior data suggesting that exogenous estrogen use is higher in the FMD patient population, hormonal factors appear to play a role (30, 31) . Our data showed similar trends as prior reports, with many subjects reporting a history of exogenous hormone use. Hormonal milieu also affects joint laxity and may play a role in the musculoskeletal features of FMD (25, 32) . However, loss of bone density and arthritis are not associated with exogenous estrogen use.\nOur protein marker analyses showed evidence of systemic inflammation in subjects with FMD compared to age-and gender-matched healthy controls with elevation of circulating plasma TGF-\u24241, TGF-\u24242, MCP-1, TNF-\u2423, CRP, SAA, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 (20, 33, 34) . TGF-\u24241 and TGF-\u24242 are members of the TGF superfamily of cytokines that regulate a variety of cellular functions in the arterial wall that lead to cellular proliferation, differentiation, modulation of extracellular matrix production, and ultimately, arterial remodeling (35) . The finding of TGF-\u2424 elevation in FMD is intriguing, given the similarity of the FMD phenotype to the spectrum of disorders with altered TGF-\u2424 signaling, particularly the extravascular manifestations we identified (36 -38) . MCP-1 mediates vascular inflammatory cell adhesion and contributes to neointimal hyperplasia in the setting of arterial injury (39) . The finding of lower circulating IL-8 is surprising, but not unprecedented. IL-8 is known to play an important role in endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis (40, 41) . In addition, TGF-\u24241 inhibits IL-8 secretion during active inflammation in the vascular endothelium, (42) consistent with our findings in patients with FMD. Furthermore, it was recently shown that patients with vascular EDS similarly have reduced IL-8 and elevated circulating TGF-\u24241 (43) . Though the exact mechanism behind reduced IL-8 is unknown, a potential role in aneurysmal disorders is intriguing and warrants further study. Elevated CRP, SAA, and TNF-\u2423 are seen in acquired autoimmune disorders, although our FMD patients did not present with usual rheumatologic symptoms and signs. These findings suggest a state of systemic inflammation in FMD, although vascular lesions have not characteristically shown active cellular inflammation (6) . For comparison purposes, we evaluated the same markers in a group of individuals with MFS, a known disorder of TGF-\u2424 signaling, and we found a distinct pattern of protein markers in FMD as compared to MFS. TGF-\u24241 was elevated in both groups, but individuals with MFS did not have significant differences in TNF-\u2423 or CRP levels as compared to the healthy controls as was seen in subjects with FMD, an intriguing difference between these disorders.\nAlthough the underlying molecular defects are unknown, our protein marker findings in FMD plasma Values are presented as means \u03ee sem. P \u0545 0.05 considered significant; NS, not significant.\nand fibroblast secretion suggest a disturbance of homeostasis in the TGF-\u2424 axis (44) and other pathways involved in inflammatory signaling. Since access to vascular tissue through clinical care is limited, we utilized dermal fibroblasts to study key pathological features as has been frequently done in the study of other hereditary disorders of connective tissue with vascular features (45) (46) (47) . It is interesting and informative that the dermal fibroblast lines obtained from a large number of FMD case subjects in our study recapitulated the phenotype of increased TGF-\u24241 and TGF-\u24242 expression ex vivo despite removal from their hormonal and other potentially interacting milieu. This suggests that an intrinsic genetic abnormality may contribute to altered TGF-\u2424 expression. Since expression of downstream TGF-\u2424 biomarkers did not show clear activation patterns, the exact mechanism invoked by excess extracellular TGF-\u2424 in FMD is unclear at this time and suggests possible locus or allelic heterogeneity, requiring further study. It is also possible that increased TGF-\u2424 expression is not a primary defect leading to FMD. Rather, there may be altered downstream activation or signaling, leading to possible compensatory pathway activation resulting in elevated TGF-\u2424. The finding that TGF-\u24242 levels are associated with burden of arterial disease suggests that TGF-\u24242 may drive the extent of vascular disease, but this hypothesis needs to be formally tested, ideally in vascular tissues and in vivo given the context dependency of TGF-\u2424 effects. Fibroblasts obtained in this study have been donated to the Coriell repository and are available to the scientific community. Taken together, the results of our study show a pattern of clinical manifestations consistent with TGF-\u2424 alterations as have been observed in other hereditary vascular disorders, with specific vascular manifestations that are unique to FMD. These findings have potential clinical implications. Our data suggest that an evaluation of degenerative spine arthritis and bone density may be helpful in identifying the cause and possible therapies for musculoskeletal symptoms. The yield of genetic testing for currently known connective tissue dysplasias in the FMD population is low in the absence of features that would otherwise indicate specific genetic testing, consistent with another published study (21) . Given the rapid evolution of our understanding of vascular genetic diseases, formal genetic evaluation of patients with connective tissue features may be helpful to rule out other potentially overlapping disorders where FMD can be seen, such as vascular or type IV EDS. Finally, anecdotal evidence supports the rationale for therapy for FMD with pharmacologic agents that are known to decrease vascular TGF-\u2424 expression; (48) however, it is premature to make this treatment recommendation without a clinical trial. Further studies to identify the underlying molecular defect in FMD will be needed to clarify these issues."}]
