[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. Earthquake impacts are an inherently interdisciplinary topic that receives attention from many disciplines. The natural hazard of strong ground motion is the reason why earthquakes are of interest to others than seismologists. However, earthquake shaking data often receives too little attention by the general public and impact research in the social sciences. The vocabulary used to discuss earthquakes has mostly evolved within and for the discipline of seismology. Earthquake communication outside of seismology thus often uses suboptimal concepts that are not of primary concern. This study provides new 5 theoretic concepts as well as novel quantitative data analysis based on shaking data. A dataset of relevant global earthquake ground shaking from 1960 to 2016 based on USGS ShakeMap data has been constructed and applied. Two new definitions of earthquake location (the shaking center and the shaking centroid) based on ground motion parameters are introduced and compared to the epicenter. Furthermore, the first global quantitative analysis on the size of the area that is on average exposed to strong ground motion -measured by peak ground acceleration (PGA) -is provided."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Earthquakes receive a lot of attention from the general public as well as numerous disciplines across the natural and social sciences. With the notable exception of seismology, most of them are primarily or even exclusively concerned with the surface phenomenon and the impacts of an earthquake. However, the literature commonly uses magnitude or other suboptimal measures 15 to quantify the natural hazard of earthquakes for impact research. The physical phenomenon of strong ground motion often does not receive enough attention and the literature lacks an interdisciplinary discussion of the natural hazard of earthquake-related surface shaking.\nEarthquake risk communication is generally considered a high priority topic and many research and practice efforts are concerned with educating the public and improving preparation. The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), for 20 example, has started the Great California ShakeOut (Jones and Benthien, 2011) which has become an annual drill with millions of participants. Earthquake hazard maps are a common way to illustrate where and what strength of future earthquake shaking is likely to occur. Such maps are usually expressed in peak ground acceleration that is expected to be exceeded at a certain likelihood within a given number of years (Shedlock et al., 2000) . Technological progress has also allowed for the emergence of real-time seismology, which provides real-time information about an event during and in the immediate aftermath of an earthquake (Kanamori, 2008) . For research on earthquake impacts, an appropriate understanding of the physical hazard of past earthquake shaking as well as access to relevant data is necessary. However, earthquake communication about past events is a relatively neglected topic and many authors have to struggle with the inconsistent -and sometimes inadequate -approaches 5 in the social science literature (Kirchberger, 2017) . This study utilizes USGS ShakeMap data (Wald et al., 1999 ) -a real-time seismology product -to create a dataset of global past shaking exposure. Natural hazard exposure maps are necessary for impact research, and they also allow to spatially overlap the natural hazard with social variables such as the Social Vulnerability Index (Cutter and Finch, 2008) . This study provides a discussion and quantitative analysis of global earthquake ground shaking and variables of interest that can be calculated from such data. 10 2 Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

More sophisticated measures such as response spectra or Arias intensity (Arias, 1970) generally provide a better characterization of strong ground motion (Joyner and Boore, 1988) , but data is not as easily available as for PGA or PGV. No individual index of strong ground motion is ideal to represent 5 the entire frequency range, but peak ground motion parameters are considered to perform satisfactorily (Riddell, 2007) . This study will focus on PGA as the ground motion parameter, due to good data availability and its wide use in earthquake engineering. Expressing past shaking with PGA is also consistent with the common approach of using PGA for earthquake hazard maps.\nThe prediction, estimation, and recording of strong ground motion parameters are active fields of ongoing research and 10 technological improvements (Douglas, 2003; Denolle et al., 2014; Wald et al., 2011; Caprio et al., 2015; Kong et al., 2016) .\nSCEC, for example, has a Ground Motion Prediction Working Group. While more sophisticated approaches to calculate ground motion parameters (e.g. those employed by SCEC) than the ShakeMap model exist, USGS ShakeMaps are unique in providing consistent earthquake strong ground motion data for a large number of events on a global scale and for several decades. For this study 14608 ShakeMaps of earthquakes from 1960-2016 have been compiled to one dataset."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "In December 2016 all online available USGS ShakeMaps were collected and combined to one dataset for this study. Except for one event in 1923, ShakeMaps generally exist starting from 1960, and they are systematically available from 1973 onwards.\nThe representativeness of the sample of earthquake ground shaking in the dataset compared to all earthquake ground shaking in the time period is assessed by matching the ShakeMap data to two different earthquake lists, which allows a cross validation.\nSince not every earthquake has a ShakeMap, a reference dataset of all (or at least almost all) earthquakes since 1960 is required.\n(ii) any map of a ground motion parameter -and therefore also the shaking center and the shaking centroid -can not be as accurately evaluated as the epicenter. However, the shaking center and shaking centroid are locations of greater interest for many applications. Figure 5 . Attenuation across the world illustrated by average strong ground motion area. This map shows the average area that is exposed to at least 90 % of the maximum PGA for an earthquake with the epicenter at that location. For each 2.5 x 2.5 degree grid cell the average area is calculated for all earthquakes of the 12388 ShakeMaps with magnitude 4.5 or greater, which have their epicenter in that grid cell.\nwater and some of those events do not cause any shaking. Among the 11510 events that do cause shaking about 54 % have their epicenter in water. For the 46 % of those earthquakes, which have their epicenter on land, the average distance between the epicenter and the shaking center is 7 km. This distance increases to 53 km when the epicenter is in water. The full distribution of shaking center to epicenter distances is shown in Figure 4 . The PGA at the epicenter is on average 13 % weaker than at the shaking center, given that the epicenter is on land and experiences any shaking (5285 events)."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "For this purpose the ANSS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog (ComCat, 2017) is used. More information on the ComCat data can be found in Appendix A. Finally, the NGDC Significant Earthquake Database (National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS), 2017) is applied as an additional reference dataset and to assign impacts to events (the impact data will be used in future research). The combination of the three earthquake data sources can help to identify how representative the aggregated ShakeMap dataset is for all global earthquake ground shaking. Details on how the three datasets were linked 25 with each other are described in Appendix B.\nThe dataset can be considered to contain all relevant global earthquake ground shaking from January 1973 to October 2016, and also a reasonable sample from 1970-1972 as well as shaking from individual devastating events from [1960] [1961] [1962] [1963] [1964] [1965] [1966] [1967] [1968] [1969] . However, the sample is more complete in later years, in that it contains more weaker events. For smaller events the dataset has a bias towards North American events, which can be avoided by restricting the sample to only events with a magnitude of 5.5 or 30 greater. However, reducing this threshold to 4.5 is generally sufficient to avoid this bias. Details on the representativeness of the ShakeMap dataset can be found in Appendix C. \nAll but 152 of the 2130 significant earthquakes can finally be matched with ComCat events. An additional 16 events of the significant earthquake list that are not in the ComCat list were able to be matched with yet unmatched ShakeMaps. It is unlikely that excluding the remaining 136 events will bias the data in a problematic way. First, most of those events have relatively low magnitudes and are therefore not in the ComCat list (114 of the 136 events have a magnitude below 5.5). Second, 86 of the 136 earthquakes stem from the period 1960 -1972. This is a sign that the ComCat list for that period is not as complete as for 25 later periods, which we already expect from the data availability of the ComCat data sources. Finally, considering the impact of fatalities, 91 of the 136 events caused at least one death, but the average among those is only 11, with a maximum of 80.\nAfter 1972, the largest number of fatalities among these events is 14.\nFor the time period of January 1960 -October 2016 we have 14608 ShakeMaps that are either matched to a ComCat event (13061), or a significant earthquake list event (16), or both (1531). For those events we will use the source parameters from the\nAnother question is whether the ShakeMap coverage is comparable across years. To answer this question we first need to consider the reference data. As we already discussed before, the ComCat list is most likely not as complete for the time period 1960-1972, as for the years after that. In Figure C3 we can see that the total number of events for \"all earthquakes\" (ShakeMap events plus ComCat events without ShakeMap) seemingly increases over time. However, this should in theory not be the case.\nThe number of earthquakes per year should be more or less constant over years. Part of the variation is natural noise, but a lot The ShakeMap data is increasingly complete in more recent years and it is particularly incomplete before 1973 (and even more so before 1970). The extra ShakeMaps in more recent years, however, come from more and more weaker events receiving a ShakeMap. We can also confirm this with the distribution of magnitude for events with and without ShakeMap in Figure C4 . A bigger concern is whether the ShakeMaps have a geographic bias. Since the USGS is a North American institution, we It is advised to restrict the dataset to ShakeMaps with magnitude above 4.5 or even 5.5 for many applications to avoid the North America bias. Events with a magnitude under 5.5 can still occasionally cause severe impacts. We therefore don't want to exclude all of them, particularly since the events often have a ShakeMap if they did indeed cause significant impacts."}, {"section_title": "Past Earthquake Shaking", "text": "Past earthquake shaking can be approached from two different angles, either comparing different locations or comparing different events. First, we can consider the exposure of a location or region to past earthquake shaking of an individual event or to several events over a time period. The constructed dataset allows to visualize the global past shaking exposure. Hsiang and Jina (2014) term the average annual pixel exposure to maximum cyclone wind speeds as the cyclone climate. This representation of 5 past exposure to a natural hazard can be particularly useful in social science applications. In a similar way the average annual pixel exposure to maximum PGA could be called the earthquake shaking \"climate\". Since earthquakes are not a climate phenomenon and past exposure maps are not equivalent to future hazard maps, it is more reasonable to refer to it as the earthquake shaking history. Figure 1 illustrates the earthquake shaking history of 1973-2015, the period for which the dataset is found to be representative of overall shaking. However, some limitations of ShakeMaps become apparent in panel (a): (i) the cutoff 10 edges of the individual ShakeMaps are visible, (ii) some unrealistically high outliers might skew individual pixels, and (iii) low shaking/impact events are more likely to receive a ShakeMap when they are in areas of interest (e.g. cities in Australia). The visualization in panel (b) avoids these limitations by restricting to shaking above a PGA of 10 %g and showing the number of events above that threshold. Second, the comparison of different past events can be the main objective. Two crucial aspects of an individual earthquake 15 are the location and the area affected by the shaking. It is, however, not straightforward to define these concepts. An earthquake is caused by the rupturing of a fault segment (illustrated in Figure 2 ). The earthquake originates at the hypocenter, but waves radiate out from the whole segment of the fault that ruptures (rupture area). This results in the epicenter not being necessarily at the center of the strong ground motion area. In the figure this depends on the size of the rupture and the dip angle of the fault. Other factors such as local site conditions and water bodies also affect where strong ground shaking occurs. social science perspective the surface projection of the rupture area could actually be considered to be more relevant than the epicenter -which is the surface projection of the hypocenter."}, {"section_title": "Earthquake location", "text": "The hypocenter and the epicenter are the most commonly used and calculated points about an earthquake. However, from a strong ground motion perspective they are not necessarily the most interesting points. For many applications it is not the 5 optimal approach to use the epicenter as the surface location of an earthquake. This is particularly an issue when the epicenter is in water and doesn't experience any ground shaking itself. In such a case it can also be far away from the strong shaking region, and it is not straightforward to assign the event to a country or region. Another earthquake location is the centroid location, such as those for example calculated by the CMT project (Ekstr\u00f6m et al., 2012) . The centroid location is the average location in space and time of the seismic energy release. This study will introduce two surface points other than the epicenter, 10 which can both be considered different definitions of the earthquake surface location: the shaking centroid and the shaking center. Both definitions are formulated such that they can be applied to any ground motion parameter. Nevertheless, this study specifically applies them to ShakeMap PGA data.\nThe shaking centroid (x SCt , y SCt ) will be defined as the average location (x i , y i ) of shaking s i weighted by the squared shaking for a given ground motion parameter, only including locations that experience at least 50 % of the maximum shaking 15 s max of that event. Restricting the included locations to the area with at least 50 % of the maximum shaking is chosen for two reasons. First, it helps to avoid the problem that ShakeMaps are usually cutoff before the shaking has completely attenuated. Second, it ensures that the shaking centroid represents a location that summarizes best the strong shaking area of the particular event. The weaker shaking area is generally of less interest. The squares of the ground motion parameter are also chosen to allow for a stronger weight of the high shaking locations. Just like the epicenter, the shaking centroid could be a location that doesn't actually 5 experience any shaking (when it falls in water) or only relatively low shaking itself.\nOn the other hand, the shaking center is the point on the surface which experiences the strongest shaking for a given ground motion parameter.\nThe calculation of the shaking center provides a challenge when a ShakeMap has more than one location that share this 10 maximum value. Details on the here applied approach to handle this issue are described in Appendix D.\nFigure 3 provides an example of a ShakeMap with the three different surface locations. The shaking center and shaking centroid generally do not coincide with the epicenter. In particular when the epicenter lies in water, it will definitely be distinct from the shaking center and it will very likely also be distinct from the shaking centroid. The problems with the definitions of the shaking center and the shaking centroid are that (i) they depend on the choice of a ground motion parameter, and"}, {"section_title": "Strong ground motion area", "text": "In terms of the area affected by an earthquake, the literature so far has mainly referred to the area exposed to certain levels of a qualitative intensity scale for individual events. There has been no study on the global pattern of the area that is on average exposed to strong ground motion parameters for a given earthquake. This study provides the first summary of global earthquake area size."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "The size of the area that experiences strong ground motion from an earthquake is strongly dependent on the regional geology. Figure 5 illustrates how different the size of the area exposed to strong ground motion can be across the world. In particular it\nshows the average size of the area that is exposed to at least 90 % of the maximum PGA within each grid cell (see Figure C1 for reference of how many earthquakes are used in each grid cell to calculate the average). For example, earthquakes along the west coast of South America can generally be felt at far wider distances from the epicenter than earthquakes on the west 15 coast of North America. The west coast of South America in Figure 5 also illustrates how earthquakes close to the coast are spatially smaller, since the ocean restricts the shaking pattern to one side. Water bodies are crucial in defining the area that can experience ground motion, and therefore also for the area exposed to strong ground motion. It is well understood and straightforward to see from the data that magnitude affects the area exposed to a particular shaking threshold, but as Figure 6 shows, other factors (e.g. geology and water bodies) introduce significant noise in this relationship. A more detailed summary of average shaking areas can be found in Tables 2 and 3 . The tables provide the average area exposed to 90 % of the maximum PGA for each ShakeMap and the average area exposed to at least 10 %g PGA, separately by magnitude and maximum PGA level. The total number of earthquakes in each category that is used to calculate the average can be found 5 in Table A1 .\nA stronger magnitude event -everything else fixed -will result in larger areas exposed to any given PGA level (see Table 3 ).\nA high magnitude event having a low maximum PGA level is only possible when the epicenter is in water. It is, however, likely that a still large area is exposed to these relatively low shaking values. Such events are responsible for the very large areas exposed to 90 % of the maximum PGA in Table 2 . While an increase of the area above a fixed PGA threshold with increasing 10 magnitude is intuitive, Table 2 suggests that also the area exposed to a fixed percentage of the maximum PGA increases with magnitude. This is most likely due to the fact that large magnitude events tend to turn the large amount of energy released not necessarily into stronger shaking, but into larger areas experiencing strong shaking. A similar relationship does not seem to hold for maximum PGA and area. This can be interpreted as the size of the area exposed to a certain percentage of the maximum PGA being independent of the maximum PGA, but dependent on magnitude. Earthquake magnitude therefore contains more information about the spatial extent of an earthquake than the maximum PGA. The relationship between magnitude and the area exposed to at least 90 % of the maximum PGA could potentially affect the global pattern of attenuation illustrated in Figure 5 . However, the same figure only for earthquakes with magnitude between 5.5 and 6.5 (see Figure C2 ) confirms the overall pattern."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "This study provides a discussion of earthquake shaking for an interdisciplinary audience and with applications in earthquake impact research, particularly in the social sciences in mind. It constructs and utilizes a comprehensive dataset of global strong ground motion data to define new concepts of earthquake location as well as strong shaking area that help summarize the natural hazard of surface shaking. These concepts can help to facilitate a more effective communication of the natural hazard of earthquakes that is focused on surface shaking. The concept of a shaking center and a shaking centroid are introduced, which 10 can often be better location definitions for an earthquake than the epicenter.\nMore than 14500 individual ShakeMaps were compiled into one comprehensive dataset. The dataset can be considered to contain all relevant global earthquake ground shaking from 1/1973 to 10/2016, and also a reasonable sample from [1970] [1971] [1972] as well as shaking from individual devastating events from 1960-1969.\nThe dataset is applied to calculate the shaking center and shaking centroid for all events in the dataset. The shaking center is 15 particular useful to assign a country to an event, since it is always on land. The shaking centroid, on the other hand is generally the best representation of the overall location of shaking. It is the most reasonable choice for the assignment of an event to a general region or to use as the location in spatial regression models or other statistical tools. The CMT centroid location should also be a relatively good predictor of the location of strong surface shaking. An interesting future extension of this research would therefore be to combine the ShakeMap dataset with the CMT data to compare the shaking center and shaking centroid 20 with the CMT centroid location.\nFinally, the dataset is also applied to calculate a number of different shaking area variables. This work provides the first summary of global earthquake strong ground motion area size. The average strong ground motion area is shown to be a useful tool to visualize attenuation across different regions of the world.\nCode and data availability.

I exclude 33 events from the gcmt network for which another event within 1.5 seconds at a distance of under 3 degrees exists, since those events seem to be duplicates.\nFurthermore, I also exclude 6 events that don't fulfill these criteria, but have been manually identified as most likely duplicates.\nThere are, however, most likely more duplicate events as the representativeness analysis shows. After excluding these events,\nwe have a list of 225390 events which can be uniquely identified by the combination of the following parameters (rounded to 15 specific accuracies in parentheses): timing (to the minute), magnitude (.1), longitude (1), latitude (.25), and depth (25)."}, {"section_title": "Appendix B: Linking the three earthquake datasets", "text": "The first step is to combine the ComCat earthquake list with the ShakeMap dataset. Unfortunately, the ComCat list and the ShakeMap data are often updated separately from each other and earthquake source parameters (e.g. magnitude, timing, location) can therefore differ between a ComCat event and the ShakeMap for the same event. Also the earthquake \"ID\" does 20 not always agree between the ShakeMap and the corresponding ComCat event. The differences in source parameters either stem from the data providing network updating the parameters or from different networks being chosen for the ShakeMap and the ComCat with slightly deviating parameters. Sometimes also the magnitude type might be different, resulting in different magnitude values. When possible events from the datasets are matched by timing (to the minute), magnitude (rounded to .1), longitude (rounded to 1), latitude (rounded to .25), and depth (rounded to 25). Such a match is possible for 7,882 ShakeMaps."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": "The remaining ShakeMaps are matched to the remaining ComCat events (i) if they are at most 60 seconds apart, at a (euclidean) distance of at most 2 degrees, and have a difference in magnitude of at most 2.2 (0.7 if the ShakeMap magnitude is below 5.5), or (ii) if they occur within 2 seconds and at a distance of at most 2 degrees. If several events fulfill these criteria, the event with the least time difference and the event with the least spatial difference are identified, and if they are the same event it is assigned to the ShakeMap. Otherwise the event with the least time difference is chosen if that time difference is at most 30 one fifth of the next closest event (in terms of timing). If that again is not the case, the spatially closest event is chosen, given that it has a spatial distance of at most 1 degree. For all so far unmatched events of relevance (high magnitude of the ShakeMap they were produced after December 2016 when the ShakeMaps were downloaded and some also because the ShakeMap files were corrupted. The magnitude of 67 of those events is below 4.5 and for only three of the 127 events is the magnitude higher than 5.5. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the exclusion of these 127 ShakeMaps will not affect the representativeness of the dataset in a significant way.\nThe second step is assigning each event form the significant earthquakes list to a ComCat event. Again, the source param-10 eters show slight deviations and a similar approach as matching ShakeMaps with ComCat events is utilized. Each significant earthquake event is matched to a ComCat event if they are at most 90 seconds apart, at a distance of at most 5 degrees, and have a difference in magnitude under or equal to 2. If more than one ComCat event fulfills these criteria the event with the smallest time difference and spatial distance is chosen (they always agree for this dataset). However, for some events the significant earthquake list has missing timing data (second, minute, or hour). For those events, the timing has to be within the same day 15 and the spatial difference can not be more than 2.5 degrees. Additionally, 14 events were matched manually. Unfortunately some events seem to have typos in the significant earthquake list (e.g. a drop in the leading 100 of a longitude location). Some typos are identified manually and they are part of the 14 manual matches, but there are potentially more typos or just deviations in the data in terms of the timing. For all unmatched events with no ComCat event within 90 seconds, we therefore identify matches if they are within 24 hours, at a distance of at most 0.2 degrees and have a magnitude that deviates by at most 0.2.\nNevertheless, it is important to be aware that the sample is geographically biased for earthquakes below the magnitude threshold of 5.5.

This way location with the maximum shaking, that has the strongest shaking in the area surrounding it, is chosen as the shaking center. This procedure reaches in only 47 cases with PGA as the ground motion parameter the edge of the ShakeMap. We then assume that the average shaking outside of the ShakeMap is the same as the average shaking of the added cells that are still in the ShakeMap at the same distance to the potential shaking center. However, for 24 of the 47 events still no unique shaking center 5 can be found, since they occurred in small island regions and only caused shaking in very small areas (those events have on average only 17 km 2 exposed to any shaking). For those events a random candidate location experiencing maximum shaking is chosen as the shaking center.\nCompeting interests.
