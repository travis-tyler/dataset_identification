One of the primary intents of using a watershed-focused strategy is to optimize those recent fish passage investments that have resulted in minimal net benefit due to the continued existence of adjacent in-stream barriers.

To facilitate this process, the FBRB relies heavily on the local knowledge and expertise of regional salmon recovery organizations and lead entities. These regional organizations, composed of tribes, private citizens, and federal, state, and local agencies, develop salmon and steelhead recovery plans and implement restoration projects that support the goals of those recovery plans (Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office [RCO], n.d.a; RCO, n.d.b). The solicitation of local input from these groups helps orient the FBRB toward reaching a final consensus on which watersheds throughout the state may be eligible for the fish barrier grant funding based on the principles of the legislation. This process also has the benefit of increasing communication and collaboration between government and non-institutional agencies, tribes, and interested stakeholders at the local level. The watershed selection process is particularly challenging for the Puget Sound Partnership, the regional organization that develops and coordinates the implementation of regional recovery plans within the Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Region (Puget Sound Partnership, 2005). The Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Region (Figure 1, p.6), hereinafter 'PSR', is an administrative area defined by the RCO that is constituted of a complex human and hydrologic landscape. The PSR's high density of people, roadways, and waterways creates challenges to restoring stream habitat connectivity. Numerous conservation groups represent watershed areas across the entire PSR. Each of these groups has individual priorities and restoration goals based on the conditions and limiting factors of their local salmon and steelhead populations. The PSR also contains the majority of the Culvert Case Area (Figure 2, p.7) which encompasses Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIA) 1-23, as defined by the United States v. Washington, Case No. 70-9213 (2013). The potential of further litigation that targets other barrier owners, e.g., local governments and private entities, has increased general interest in fish passage-related issues in this area. The combination of these issues and the broad spectrum of the personal interests and values of local residents add to the cultural, political, economic and social factors that will be included in the FBRB's watershed selection process. A discussion of these elements is provided in the Other Considerations section (pp.57-66).

This creates the need for an assessment mechanism for comparing Puget Sound watersheds that can assist in the selection of focus areas for fish passage restoration. Within this framework, the research and application of the recommended criteria described in this analysis will answer the question: Using evaluation criteria that can help inform Puget Sound fish passage restoration strategies, how can a regional assessment be implemented to contrast the relative current and potential salmon and steelhead habitat conditions of Puget Sound watersheds?"}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW Fish Passage Prioritization Methods", "text": "There have been numerous attempts to prioritize fish passage barriers using various methods and strategies. Prioritization schemes range from informal ad-hoc processes that rely almost exclusively on professional judgment to more formal methods that use a defined set of criteria to prioritize barriers based on a formula that outputs a score for each barrier. Some of the more advanced methods rely on modeling software and implement mixed integer linear programming algorithms to select barrier correction projects based on the maximization of a net benefit within a user-defined budget. Typically referred to as optimization models, these programs assess the spatial relationship of barriers throughout a watershed in combination with the interactive effects of fish passage improvements on longitudinal connectivity (O'Hanley, 2015). The most common assessment criteria used in many of these prioritization methods include the barrier's position in the stream network, severity of barrier, amount and quality of habitat, estimated cost of the barrier correction, and species use. Most prioritization formulas support the integration of additional criteria or the use of coefficients to weight specific variables to help formulate an output that aligns with project-specific goals.  (Reagan, 2015). Models like these build on other proven models and are adaptable to different regional conditions. Barrier prioritization strategies are often developed for ranking projects in a single watershed, or to compare barriers in disconnected watersheds. Many of the prioritization methods are scalable and adaptable to area-specific project needs. However, to effectively optimize fish passage barrier removals, you must have a complete and accurate barrier dataset within your focus area. This includes, at a minimum, knowledge of all barrier locations (manmade and natural barriers), the severity of the barriers, and quantity of adjacent stream habitat. Without a complete dataset, some barriers may be mistakenly prioritized and corrected upstream of existing barriers. This required baseline information is incomplete in the Puget Sound and it is impractical to meet these data requirements at this scale. Therefore, the geographic range must be narrowed to an area that is feasible for effectively identifying and assessing the data gaps."}, {"section_title": "Puget Sound Watershed Prioritization", "text": "Throughout the years, there have been many assessments of Puget Sound watersheds to prioritize restoration areas. These prioritization efforts use different sets of assessment criteria and data analyses to meet specific objectives. For example, there are multiple recovery plans that have been produced and implemented throughout the PSR by local salmon and watershed recovery organizations. These plans serve an important role in developing and advancing project lists to grant program administrators for potential funding opportunities. RCW c 77.85 (2013) directs the organization and implementation of regional recovery plans to help identify local actions that are essential for the recovery of Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed, or proposed to be listed, salmon and steelhead populations. This statute originated the Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Plan that outlines the shared strategy and vision for regional recovery planning (Puget Sound Partnership, 2005). The intent of the document is to narrate the overall salmon recovery strategy for the PSR, while also providing specific numerical recovery targets and criteria for abundance and escapement goals for each watershed. However, it was not in the scope of the Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Plan to prioritize watersheds for restoration. To identify key actions necessary for making progress toward the abundance and escapement goals, 14 individual watershed recovery plans have been appended to the Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Plan (Puget Sound Partnership, 2005). These watershed plans are site-specific, but maintain the goal of identifying actions that increase local salmon populations and support the recovery of other Puget Sound salmon populations. The plans detail the management needs for salmon recovery within each watershed but do not facilitate the comparison of information between watersheds. Additionally, the plans were created before the 2007 ESA listing of Puget Sound steelhead and will need to be updated to include management recommendations for this now federally listed threatened species. Habitat limiting factors analysis reports have also been developed, as described in RCW c 77.85 (2013), that identify watershed issues including, but not limited to, fish passage barriers, water quality and quantity, riparian areas, floodplains, and hatchery management. Fish passage barriers are one of the highest priority limiting factors in nearly all of these analyses. Therefore, a cross-basin comparison of limiting factors reports does not provide much guidance for selecting a watershed to focus barrier correction efforts in the Puget Sound. The Volume 2 Puget Sound Characterization Project is a recently completed regional assessment that provides a tool for comparing the relative values of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats in small drainage areas throughout the Puget Sound (Wilhere, Quinn, Gombert, Jacobson, Weiss, 2013). This coarse-level assessment evaluates the relative value of 'assessment units' (AU) within the Puget Sound basin; these AUs have an average area of 12.2 square kilometers (Wilhere et al., 2013). Habitat metrics were measured within the AUs, and in areas with an upstream or downstream connection, to create indices that classify hydrogeomorphic features and reflect the relative conditions and capacity of salmon and steelhead habitats (Wilhere et al., 2013). The variables that were used in the characterization project have been demonstrated to correlate with freshwater lotic habitat conditions that affect salmon and steelhead (Wilhere et al., 2013). The Volume 2 Puget Sound Characterization Project is one of the most comprehensive and thorough spatial analyses of the relative conservation value of fish and wildlife habitats throughout the Puget Sound basin. However, similar to other basinwide prioritization studies, the analysis of data was conducted in a specific way for a particular purpose; the results of this characterization project are intended to assist users with local land use planning and zoning at the scale of one hundred to thousands of acres (Wilhere et al., 2013). In the final assignment of a relative habitat value, each AU was compared only with other AUs contained within the spatial extent of a WRIA and the final indices for each variable were categorized by deciles using a frequency distribution within a WRIA boundary (Wilhere et al., 2013). Therefore, the published results are not scalable to compare watersheds across the PSR without a recalculation of the data. The absence of an available regional watershed prioritization tool to guide fish passage efforts supports the need for creating a new Puget Sound watershed assessment. The use of measurable habitat evaluation criteria can help estimate the relative potential for a watershed area to support salmon and steelhead recovery."}, {"section_title": "Available Watershed Habitat Condition Indicator Data", "text": "To provide an objective comparison of the relative conditions of Puget Sound watersheds for fish passage restoration, complete and quantifiable data must be applied consistently across the region. Several biological and ecological datasets were reviewed for use as indicators of watershed habitat conditions within the framework of the research question. Salmonids are sensitive to changes in water quality and physical habitat conditions and therefore the presence of salmonid species can be an indicator of usable stream habitats (Glass, 2004 condition as well as a predictor of its potential condition if anthropogenic factors were removed and natural processes were able to be restored (Sheer et al., 2009). IP models have also been used as a spatial surrogate for production estimates when actual population abundance and distribution information is unavailable (Puget Sound Steelhead Technical Recovery Team [PSSTRT], 2013a; Myers et al., 2015). The importance of this information and its adaptability from stream reach to watershed scales has prompted the creation of several IP models. Habitat preferences differ between salmonid species, and therefore IP models estimate species-specific habitat values based on the stream reach characteristics that are most readily used by each species (Sheer et al., 2009). The availability of more than one IP model creates the need to determine which one to use and which species to consider."}, {"section_title": "Steelhead as an Indicator of Fish Passage Conditions", "text": "Steelhead use a wide range of habitats throughout their life cycle. They exhibit natural life history characteristics that can include spending several years in freshwater, spawning multiple times, and even migrating more than once between inland freshwater streams and saltwater (Withler, 1966). Steelhead spawn in small to large mainstem rivers and medium to large tributaries. Steelhead have the ability to ascend steep stream gradients and, although there is not full agreement in the upper gradient limit that can be utilized by steelhead, it is generally agreed that their threshold is higher than any species of Puget Sound anadromous salmon (Sheer et al., 2009). Due to the extended amount of time that steelhead spend in freshwater and because they can be found year-round throughout most Puget Sound freshwater streams, steelhead are typically considered to be a rearing-limited species. The habitat preferences and life history patterns of steelhead contribute to their spatial structure throughout their geographic range in the Puget Sound. In the Puget Sound basin, steelhead, Chinook, and summer-run chum are all ESA-listed threatened species (USFWS, 2015). The migratory patterns of steelhead and their utilization of a wide range of habitats makes them the most ubiquitous of these ESA-listed species. Their pervasiveness and preference for rearing in small to medium streams where the majority of stream crossings are culverts, many of which are barriers to fish migration, supports the use of steelhead presence as an indicator of a watershed's fish passage conditions. Due to their spatially broad resource requirements, I used steelhead as an umbrella species and my analysis of intrinsic potential has the underlying assumption that correcting barriers to steelhead migration will benefit the other Puget Sound salmonids. There is a limited amount of available occurrence data for steelhead in the PSR. Only 19 of the 32 Puget Sound steelhead Distinct Population Segments have escapement data that has been collected for at least 3 years since 1980 and still has ongoing data collection (WDFW, 2015a). The data gaps in escapement estimates restrict the ability to create meaningful trend analyses for these populations. Historical harvest records have been reviewed to estimate population abundance, which represent one of the only available data sources for population estimates. The combination of harvest records and usable data from ongoing collection efforts have allowed abundance estimates to be made for 21 of the 32 populations; the remaining populations have very limited or no related data (WDFW, 2015a)."}, {"section_title": "Steelhead Intrinsic Potential Models", "text": "Steelhead intrinsic potential models have been developed along the Pacific Coast and other areas in the Northwest that incorporate various geomorphic and hydrologic characteristics to assess historic or potential conditions for rearing and spawning life stages (Burnett et al., 2007;Agrawal, Schick, Bjorkstedt, Szerlong, & Goslin, 2005;Boughton, & Goslin, 2006;Olympic Natural Resources Center, 2012). Based primarily on expert opinion and the life stage of interest, specific variables are used to create habitat suitability values. The habitat suitability values are combined and processed by spatial models to output an estimate of a stream reach's potential to provide suitable habitat. The estimated potential to provide suitable habitat is not intended to be used to determine the actual 'quality' of habitat, which is typically measured through a demographic response, e.g., population abundance (Wilhere et al., 2013). Due to the rearing-limited production potential of steelhead, and the juvenile habitat preferences and distribution that can extend into high gradient headwater streams, an intrinsic potential model that assesses steelhead rearing habitat is used in this analysis. I carefully evaluated two IP models for functionality and applicability to the "}, {"section_title": "Puget Sound Steelhead Threshold Intrinsic Potential Model", "text": "In 2013, the Puget Sound Steelhead Technical Recovery Team (PSSTRT, 2013a) developed a stream habitat-rating matrix. Stream segments were broadly categorized as high, moderate, low or extremely low in a simplified matrix that is based primarily on stream width and gradient (Figure 3,p.19). These basin characteristics, adapted from an IP model developed for the Interior Columbia River basin, were established to determine whether a Puget Sound watershed could support a sustainable steelhead population based on expert opinion and a literature review of the total annual escapement necessary to meet a minimum required effective population size (PSSTRT, 2013a). The IP values were derived from a calculation of the average parr production per meter squared based on the results of a 1985 steelhead spawning escapement study (Gibbons, Hahn, & Johnson, 1985). The primary benefit of using the stream habitat rating matrix for Puget Sound steelhead is that it represents the only IP model developed specifically for the PSR. Although the model is new and still being validated, it is a functional tool that is currently being applied in a Puget Sound steelhead life-cycle modeling project that helps predict plausible population abundance trajectories, establish recovery goals, and evaluate potential resource management actions (Phil Sandstrom pers. comm., October 2015; Ann Marshall, email correspondence, October 2015). However, the classification of habitats into binned high, moderate, low, and extremely low categories makes it challenging to complete a quantitative analysis of the data. The use of such a small number of habitat value categories causes a loss of data precision and makes the assumption the relationship between the predictor and response is equal within each interval (Harrell, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Burnett et al. (2007) Intrinsic Potential Model for Steelhead", "text": "The Burnett et al. 2007 analysis. Although this model was developed for the Oregon Coast Range, it has been applied in the PSR after review and general agreement by regional experts that the habitat relationships defined by Burnett et al. (2007) are likely to be very similar for Puget Sound steelhead populations (Wilhere et al., 2013). Much research has concluded that there are strong linear relationships between the amount of impervious surface land cover and predictors of biological, hydrologic, physical, and chemical conditions of aquatic systems (Schueler, 2003). Disturbances that trigger significant changes in watershed conditions often lead to biological responses including decreases in sensitive fish species and invertebrate species diversity (Paul & Meyer, 2001). Urban areas typically have a high density of impervious surfaces. Urbanization is arguably the most intensive land use that affects watershed processes, primarily as a result of the increase in impervious surface land cover (Paul & Meyer, 2001 (Paul & Meyer, 2001). There are several effects of urbanization, and the subsequent increases in imperviousness, that create stream conditions that negatively impact salmon and steelhead populations. For instance, salmon and steelhead require cool water temperatures for survival; impervious surfaces in urban areas can warm stormwater runoff, which then contributes to warmer stream temperatures (Pluhowski, 1970). A literature review of salmon and steelhead thermal tolerances and behavioral responses verified that increased stream temperatures could inhibit migration and spawning (Peery, 2010). Urbanization can also contribute pollutants to nearby waterways via stormwater runoff. A 2011 study in the Puget Sound lowlands confirmed that salmon mortality was positively correlated with roadways that were contributing toxic stormwater runoff to streams (Feist, Buhle, Arnold, Davis, Scholz, 2011). Impervious surfaces can cause greater flood magnitude and frequency (Leopold, 1968). Unstable stream banks and erosion often result from the increase in flood events. Erosion and bank failure contribute to sedimentation of spawning areas and, in more extreme cases, can cause a landslide that affects an entire watershed (Randolph, 2004). Climate change is expected to alter flow regimes and may amplify these impacts to watershed conditions and ecological functions (Blair et al., 2010). A 1997 study of the effects of urbanization on Puget Sound lowland streams demonstrated a positive linear relationship between road density and the percentage of a watershed's total impervious area (May, Horner, Karr, Mar, & Welch). These findings aligned with a previous impervious surface coverage evaluation completed by the City of Olympia that reported over 60% of watershed imperviousness in suburban areas is transportation-related (City of Olympia, 1994). An increase in road density, consequently, correlates with an increase in the number of transportation-related stream crossings (Wheeler, Angermeier, & Rosenberger, 2005 (May, Horner, Karr, Mar, & Welch, 1997). Total imperviousness simply refers to the sum of the areas covered by impervious surfaces and effective imperviousness is only the surfaces hydraulically connected to a stream (Booth & Jackson, 1997). Effective impervious area, sometimes referred to as 'directly connected impervious', has been shown in some studies to have a more defined relationship with indicators of ecological conditions (Walsh, Fletcher, & Ladson, 2005). There have been multiple attempts to define the relationship between effective impervious and total impervious, often as a ratio, but the results have varied considerably based on local factors, including site-specific urban drainage practices and geography (Jacobson, 2011;Roy & Shuster, 2009). Effective impervious area is difficult to estimate due to the amount of data required at the local watershed level and therefore total impervious area, typically expressed as a percentage, has been widely accepted as a predictor of watershed conditions for many studies (Chowdhury et al., 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Use of Intrinsic Potential Model with Impervious Surface Land Cover", "text": "The IP model is based on watershed characteristics that are not significantly affected by anthropogenic disturbances, and therefore this model does not reflect the actual quality of habitat, which is highly affected by human actions on the landscape. A measurement of impervious surface land cover can serve as a proxy for the actual, current biological and ecological conditions of a watershed. Even though there is no known relationship between the IP model and imperviousness, it would be counteractive to restore fish passage to a watershed that has a high intrinsic potential for usable habitat that is also highly affected by impervious surfaces, thus creating stream conditions that may not be able to support fish life. Therefore, this joint assessment provides a more balanced and effective evaluation of a watershed's habitat conditions than using only a single indicator."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Area Description", "text": "The PSR (Figure 1, (Zweifel, 2015b).

(2007) habitat suitability curves for juvenile steelhead (Figure 4, p.21). Following the approaches adopted from earlier studies (Morrison, Marcot, & Mannan, 2012;Vadas & Orth, 2001) by Burnett et al. 2007, the IP index value for a stream reach was calculated by first multiplying the unweighted species-specific index scores from each of the three stream attributes in Figure 4: mean annual flow, calibrated valleywidth index, and channel gradient (Burnett et al., 2007). The geometric mean of this product represents the final IP index value for a stream reach (Burnett et al., 2007 Excel to identify gradient barriers based on contiguous stream reaches that exceed the gradient and length threshold. These stream reaches were flagged for review and error checking in ArcGIS before removal from the calculations. Modeled stream reaches were also excluded above natural point barriers, i.e., waterfalls, without fishways. Only waterfalls classified as total barriers, according to the 3.7-meter vertical height threshold described in WDFW 2009, were used in the analysis. This maximum leaping threshold was derived from a 1984 Washington State University study (Powers & Orsborn, 1984) that investigated the physical and biological conditions that affect fish passage at waterfalls. Within each HUC 10 the length (meters) of each stream reach located downstream of a natural barrier was multiplied by its IP index value (no defined units) to produce a reach score. The sum of these reach scores, commonly referred to as intrinsic potential meters (IPm, or equivalent), is commonly used to compare the relative intrinsic potential value of watersheds (Fullerton et al., 2011;Spence & Williams, 2001). However, calculations of the total IPm are highly affected by the size (area) of the watershed. The PSR HUC 10s vary greatly in size, ranging from 11.7 to 872. The purpose of this analysis is to develop a method for evaluating the relative current and potential habitat conditions of Puget Sound watersheds. The results provide a decision support tool that can be used by the FBRB in the process of determining which watersheds to focus fish passage efforts in consideration of the relative potential for the recovery of salmon and steelhead populations after barrier removal. There are multiple ways to integrate the calculated steelhead IP and impervious surface values. Various mathematical expressions could be used if a single numerical output is preferred for ranking purposes. These range from a simple arithmetical formula to a more complex scoring matrix that bins or weights one or both values. There is some logic in discretizing, or 'binning', the intrinsic potential and impervious surface values into a limited number of classes. Intrinsic potential index values have been classified in different ways in various reports. Studies using the Burnett et al. (2007) habitat suitability curves have applied thresholds of 'high quality' steelhead rearing habitat at index values of 0.70, 0.75, and 0.80 (Burnett, Reeves, Miller, Clarke, Christiansen, & Vance-Borland, 2003;Burnett et al., 2007;. Cutoffs that demarcate the IP index values into categories of high, medium, and low are useful for a visual display of the information, e.g., in the creation of geospatial products, as it allows end users to quickly identify stream reaches that have the highest potential for usable habitat. However, these breakpoints have not been tested using a sophisticated statistical analysis that relates fish use to steelhead IP values (Burnett, email correspondence Oct 26, 2015). Similarly, the data presented in the results of many impervious surface studies is often categorized based on an interpretation of the severity of impacts to aquatic systems (Schueler, 2003). However, depending on the methods employed, characteristics of the study area, indicators of aquatic condition, and other factors, the results vary and there is no universal agreement in the optimal division of the range of impervious surface values. Weighting one of the outputs is an easy way to emphasize the importance of one variable over the other. The use of coefficients provides a common method of weighting a variable. However, due to the absence of information relating intrinsic potential to impervious surfaces, weighting one of the variables based on its significance would be completely subjective. In the absence of unanimity or empirical support for biological breakpoints, the integration of the two variables is based on the actual calculated outputs. This approach prevents the introduction of additional assumptions and helps discern the area-specific habitat conditions between each HUC 10, i.e., the relative IP density and impervious surface values."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The calculated steelhead IP density (before normalization) and impervious surface percentage values are tabulated for each of the 92 HUC 10s (Table 2, p.36).

NetMap was used to compute topographic and watershed attributes over a 10-meter DEM traced channel network to create 100-meter stream segments with a calculated steelhead IP score. A final IP score for a stream reach is created by taking the geometric mean of the product of the un-weighted index scores of three stream attributes: mean annual flow, calibrated valley-width index, and channel gradient (Burnett et al., 2007). This approach works on the assumption that each of these stream attributes are approximately equal in importance and the one with the lowest index score has the greatest influence on the final IP score for that stream reach (Burnett et al., 2007). Juvenile steelhead are able to ascend steep stream gradients and have been found rearing in reaches with a 16% gradient (Bryant, Zymonas, & Wright, 2004). However, they generally rear in the lower gradient areas of those high gradient stream reaches (Engle, 2002). As shown in Figure 4, the gradient index score remains constant for reaches above 7%, and is 'zero' for reaches with a gradient above 10%. Juvenile steelhead tend to use stream reaches with hill slopes that constrict the channel and limit interaction with the floodplain (Hicks, 1990;Reeves, Bisson, & Dambacher, 1998). This preference for confined channels is reflected in the calibrated valley-width index (Figure 4, p.21). Juveniles can rear in a wide range of flows, from large mainstem rivers up to small headwater tributaries (Meehan & Bjornn, 1991). With the exception of those stream reaches with very little to no mean annual flow, the mean annual flow index is fairly high across a very large range of flows (Figure 4, p.21). However, there has been considerable deliberation on the actual productivity of large mainstem rivers, over 50 meters wide, as much of the channel area is typically not used by juveniles in the absence of instream cover (PSSTRT, 2013b)."}, {"section_title": "Impervious Surface Land Cover", "text": "As expected, the HUC 10s with the most impervious surface land cover were those in the Puget Sound lowlands.

This approach differs from the IP assessments that also incorporate datasets with natural point barriers and cascade barriers digitized from WRIA maps.

To help validate passage conditions at these points, the SWIFD database was used to review the spatial distribution of documented anadromous fish use. The natural barrier data and the documented fish distribution had several conflicts, i.e., there were streams that contained documented anadromous use upstream of natural point barriers that were categorized as total blockages. Therefore, I developed a hierarchy of evidence to assist with the determination of data integrity when there were disagreements between anadromous fish distribution and presence of a natural barrier. Natural point barriers that were field verified by WDFW staff with photos and measurements were always assumed to be accurate. I reviewed limiting factors reports, published habitat assessments, and similar documents from trusted sources including tribes, WDFW, and various watershed restoration groups; if these had photos or/and descriptions consistent with the point record, these were assumed to be accurate. If supporting documentation for the natural barrier could not be located and the SWIFD database had a record of documented anadromous use extending upstream, then other resources such as recovery plans and other credible publications were reviewed to determine if the natural barrier information was accurate. If a natural point barrier was determined to not be a total barrier, then it was completely disregarded and the IP calculations continued to the next natural point barrier, gradient barrier, or end of fish use. One of the likely causes of discrepancies between natural point barriers and anadromous distribution is the inconsistency and incompleteness in the documentation for both datasets. For example, the SWIFD database currently includes records of documented fall Chinook extending a very long distance upstream of the 3 Upper Skagit River dams that have no fish passage facilities. Although the SWIFD database is maintained by the WDFW and NWIFC, both the WDFW and tribes have agreed with the 1921 survey that found no historical record of anadromous fish use above the current location of the most downstream dam (Smith & Anderson, 1921). Another example supporting the need to carefully review natural barriers involves WDFW's fish passage database record of Granite Falls on the South Fork Stillaguamish River. This waterfall was appended to the database as a total barrier without a fishway in 2004. However, it is widely known that there is a fish ladder, constructed in 1954, that allows upstream migration to several miles of habitat above Granite Falls. Natural barriers are species-specific and the blocked species information is missing from most of the feature records used in this analysis. A natural feature that is a complete barrier to the weaker swimming and leaping chum salmon is not necessarily a complete barrier to the stronger swimming and leaping steelhead, however most of the records did not contain information about which species were blocked. Further investigation was required, as previously described, if these records were also missing a measurement of the vertical height of the natural point barrier. As these data gaps are filled and as better natural barrier information becomes available, the IP assessment results presented in this analysis must be reviewed and possibly recalculated."}, {"section_title": "Data resolution", "text": "It is highly recommended that the impervious surface and IP outputs be recalculated as more accurate, higher resolution data becomes available. The steelhead IP indices were derived from a 10-meter DEM. Elevation rasters produced from higher resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) would provide better accuracy. Higher resolution DEMs are not readily available for the entire PSR, but could be obtained through multiple sources. Data from multiple sources would need to be checked for consistency, which was not within the scope of this analysis. The 2011 C-CAP dataset includes Landsat data that is captured at a 30-meter resolution (NOAA, 2012). Dr. Kenneth Pierce (2011) conducted a feasibility study, referred to as the High Resolution Change Detection Project, to assess land cover changes in three Puget Sound WRIAs using 1-meter resolution. The use of the higher resolution imagery resulted in land cover class changes of 0.057 -0.105% from undeveloped classes to developed classes within the three WRIAs; these were the results of omission errors from the use of medium resolution imagery (Pierce, 2011). A higher resolution dataset would allow a more accurate estimate of impervious surfaces. However, a comprehensive analysis of land cover in the PSR at a 1-meter resolution has not yet been completed. This assessment uses impervious surface estimates from 2011 ( Figure 11, p.49). The amount of impervious surface areas is expected to increase with population growth and urbanization. From 2006 to 2011, there was an increase of 9,457 acres of impervious surface land cover in the PSR (NOAA, 2012). The 2016 C-CAP data is expected to be available in 1-3 years, allowing this assessment to be repeated to reflect post-2011 development."}, {"section_title": "Further Research Needs", "text": "In addition to recalculating the intrinsic potential and impervious surface values as new data becomes available, further research may be undertaken to support the results of this analysis. As described in the Literature Review section (pp.8-25), the available biological datasets in the PSR contain many data gaps and inconsistencies that make them difficult to use in a comparative analysis of watersheds. Furthermore, the actual distribution of salmon and steelhead throughout the PSR is directly affected by the presence of manmade barriers. "}, {"section_title": "OTHER CONSIDERATIONS", "text": "The limited availability of landscape-scale spatial datasets that have reasonable implications for fish passage restoration strategies contributed to the restriction of the watershed evaluations to a spatial analysis of just 2 indicators of current and potential habitat conditions for salmon and steelhead. Although the habitat assessment criteria are supported by peer-reviewed sources and expert opinion, the results will not be the determinant of which HUC 10s receive fish passage funding. Using the impervious surface and IP matrix to narrow the list of priority HUC 10s facilitates the investigation of other important information within the geographically smaller focus areas. Some factors that may be considered include the status of other restoration projects, the number of recently completed barrier corrections, hatchery impacts, landowner willingness to provide fish passage, invasive species and other relevant information about environmental and human-landscape interactions that are often difficult to quantify. In the following sections, I review the principles of the RCW that defined the duties of the FBRB and discuss the social, economic, political, and cultural considerations that are pertinent to the FBRB's mission. The selection of watersheds for fish passage barrier removal will involve these elements, and their interaction with conservation and human values that are immeasurable, to complete the conceptual framework for the implementation of a strategy that aligns with the intent of the legislation."}, {"section_title": "Principles of RCW Title 77 Chapter 95", "text": "The FBRB must develop and implement a statewide fish barrier removal strategy that adheres to the principles described in RCW c 77.95 \u00a7 180 (2014). Accordingly, the strategy must determine the appropriate pathways to prioritizing fish passage restoration opportunities that maximize habitat recovery. The RCW describes this framework through the formulation of a watershed-based approach that corrects barriers throughout whole streams, rather than continuing with traditional methods of prioritizing individual, isolated projects. There is also much emphasis on facilitating coordination between government agencies and other entities in order to help reduce spending by all parties involved in the implementation of cost effective projects. Process efficiencies and improvements include streamlined permitting and assistance with engineering and technical services. The FBRB will also strive to capitalize on recent habitat recovery investments and leverage existing fish barrier removal programs."}, {"section_title": "Cultural Considerations", "text": "In the Pacific Northwest, salmon have a significant role in traditional and modern  differ between these markets, many local businesses can benefit from the economic stimulation created by both commercial and recreational fishing operations. At a smaller scale, the fish passage barrier removal projects that are selected for construction will help strengthen local economies through the creation of construction and environmental planning jobs. Project managers may also purchase goods and labor from local businesses, including construction-related materials and field equipment, traffic control supplies and services, and design work for the new water crossing and associated structures. A study conducted at the University of Oregon estimated that 1.52 local jobs are created for every $100,000 spent on fish passage restoration projects (Pincus & Moseley, 2010). It is evident that the economic importance of Puget Sound salmon and steelhead is extended to many different industries."}, {"section_title": "Social Factors", "text": "There are many social benefits that result from salmon and steelhead recovery efforts in the PSR. At the local level, habitat restoration projects frequently bring together special-purpose districts, private landowners, and citizen volunteers, which helps build a strong sense of community. In addition to these local partners, large-scale watershed-based restoration strategies often require the coordination of tribal, federal, state, and local governments to be successful. In addition, throughout the PSR, various salmon and watershed restoration and conservation groups are actively involved in salmon recovery activities at all levels. The coordinated efforts of these communities, agencies, and organizations help create partnerships that can provide new environmental education and recreation opportunities to local schools and families and bring in outside dollars to local communities. The experience of joining in locally organized activities that contribute to fish and wildlife conservation provides many participants with a feeling of accomplishment. Restoration projects that improve fish passage conditions can very quickly create new salmon viewing opportunities, as it is common for salmonids to begin migrating through reconnected stream reaches to spawn and rear in the newly available habitat almost immediately after barrier removal. In the longer term, an improvement in spawning escapement and juvenile to adult survival would increase population abundance, which could support future recreational fishing opportunities. Other societal benefits to replacing undersized transportation-related water crossing structures include improvements to public safety, local flood and erosion control, better water quality, and countless ecosystem services. The combination of all these factors provides significant social benefits to families and communities that overlap and extend beyond the economic benefits of salmon and steelhead recovery efforts."}, {"section_title": "Political Drivers", "text": "Urban development in response to population growth has created challenges to impacts, such as flooding, was presented in 2015 (Reagan, 2015). The output of the model can be used to assist local governments with their evaluation of the financial significance of proposed culvert replacement projects (Reagan, 2015). Reliable models that are able to assist with the prioritization of transportation projects based on culvert life cycle costs and fish passage requirements can provide a decision support tool that maximizes investments by improving local infrastructure and public safety, reducing annual maintenance costs, and restoring habitat and aquatic ecosystems. The use of these models and support tools also helps local governments be proactive in addressing barriers, which could lead to more flexible and strategic solutions. However, the effectiveness of these prioritization tools is often limited when the optimal solutions cannot be achieved due to insufficient funds. It is now common for representatives of local governments to lobby for transportation improvement funds for projects that have the added benefit of restoring fish passage to support their funding request. Local governments are eligible to apply for funding to correct transportation-related fish passage barriers through grant programs administered by the Salmon Recovery Funding Board and the Transportation Improvement Board. However, these grant programs operate on a limited budget and can be very competitive. The FBRB grant program will help by providing a new funding source that can contribute some much-needed financial assistance. As the FBRB begins funding projects that support a watershed-based fish passage restoration strategy, they will inevitably be selecting projects with variable ownership types, i.e., state, county, city, private, etc. In addition to selecting projects that provide the most benefit to salmon and steelhead, the FBRB will be working within the principle of the legislation that directs financial assistance to cities and counties with limited resources (RCW c 77.95 \u00a7 180, 2014). The PSR encompasses 114 cities across 12 counties (Figure 13, p.66). Because the FBRB is comprised of a diverse group of representatives from multiple agencies and tribes, each serving individual organizations, members, and jurisdictions, attempting to evenly distribute funds and meet other program goals may introduce political conflicts to the decision-making process. To be successful, it will be important to ensure that the political drivers of the FBRB's barrier correction strategy are considered, but not misdirecting the actions necessary to meet the habitat restoration goals of the legislation.
