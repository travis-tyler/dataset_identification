[{"section_title": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "text": "The education standards and accountability movements, spurred on by the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), have focused attention on math and reading test scores as the main barometer of student achievement and school performance. The growing use of test scores to measure school and student performance has heightened an old debate about which competencies public schools should help students develop. Does this focus on test scores allow schools to concentrate on helping students develop the most important skills and abilities they can gain in school? Or might it discourage teachers from helping students work on other important competencies skills, habits, and attitudes? Part of this question depends upon schools' capacity to influence students in specific ways. A more basic issue, however, concerns the relative value of various competencies-specifically, which ones have the largest effect on students' success in higher education and in the labor market. complex interactions among competencies. Using this approach, we can estimate the effect of a competency as a function of students' other competencies. That is, we examine whether the x benefit of improving a given competency depends on a student's existing strengths and weaknesses."}, {"section_title": "FINDINGS", "text": "We find that the benefit of incremental gains in a competency does depend on the mix of skills each student possesses. This variation is due to diminishing returns of some competencies, and to complementary relationships among some competencies, in their effects on postsecondary outcomes. For example, we find a diminishing effect of math test score on postsecondary enrollment, such that the benefit of improving math test score appears much greater for students who are weak in math (see figure below)."}, {"section_title": "THE PROBABILITY OF EVER ENROLLING IN ANY POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION VERSUS PERCENTILE MATH TEST SCORE", "text": "Nonlinear relationships such as the one pictured above, as well as complementarities between competencies, mean that some students are most likely to benefit from improving academic competencies, while others are most likely to benefit more from improving their nonacademic competencies. For example, with respect to earnings eight years after high school, we find that increasing one of the nonacademic competencies is more valuable for most students than improvements in math ability (see table below). Similarly, for most students, improvements xi in one of the nonacademic competencies appear to have a larger effect than does math on their chances of enrolling and completing postsecondary programs. For most students, however, gains in math have a larger effect on their chances of completing a bachelor's degree than do the other nonacademic competencies. PROPORTION  In general, we find that, when choosing between improving math skills and various nonacademic competencies, it is better for students to improve in areas where they are weak than to focus on further developing areas where they are well above average. This suggests that the emphasis on improving the academic performance of low achievers may be well placed but that the concerns of some parents that their higher-achieving children might benefit more from developing nonacademic skills might also be well founded. The pattern of findings presented above suggests that taking into account students' individual strengths and weaknesses when helping them decide which competencies to improve might be more effective than simply encouraging all students to improve the same competency. In other words, it suggests that an individualized approach is better than a one-size-fits-all approach. We conducted a statistical test of this hypothesis for each outcome, and find that, for enrollment, completion of any program, and earnings, the \"individualized\" approach is xii significantly more effective. For example, for earnings, we find that increasing the competency of greatest value to each individual student by 20 percentile points is associated with an increase in earnings of 9.3 percent, compared to an increase in earnings of 5.6 percent if math test score were improved by 20 percentile points for each student."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "Our findings have two implications for educational policy and practice. First, the increasing focus on academic skills, and particularly skills captured by standardized tests, may be misplaced if it leads schools and parents to neglect the development of valuable nonacademic competencies. Second, an individualized approach to setting and pursuing competency objectives for each student could benefit students in terms of their future educational attainment and earnings. Educators are likely to face at least two challenges in developing nonacademic competencies: \u2022 Measuring these competencies objectively is difficult. For many measures used in this study, we relied on student self-reports or reports from teachers. In practice, schools could not depend on this type of subjective and informal assessment, particularly if they are held accountable for students' mastery of these competencies. Furthermore, little is known about how teachers can develop most nonacademic competencies. \u2022 Schools may find it hard to help individual students identify and develop the competencies they need most. Expanding the use of individualized education plans, currently required for students with special needs, is one possible strategy. The plans could help schools advise parents and students on classes and activities that could be most beneficial. This approach would require a large investment in guidance staff and professional development. Additional teacher training, curriculum changes, and reductions in class size might help teachers develop customized assignments and projects for students. Despite the challenges and costs involved in developing a more individualized approach to schooling, the investment may be worthwhile. Future research should clarify what types of investments would be most beneficial. It should also address the value of a broader range of xiii competencies, including ones not captured in our study, and illuminate how the benefits of specific competencies interact with students' existing skills, attitudes, and interests. Research can also play a role in helping educators develop methods for measuring competencies, particularly ones that cannot be evaluated well through standardized tests. Finally, future education experiments could help policymakers identify cost-effective ways to increase academic and nonacademic competencies."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "In this report, we examine how indicators of academic and nonacademic competencies are related to postsecondary educational and labor market outcomes and how the value of these competencies depends on students' existing strengths and weaknesses. Drawing on the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) surveys of students and teachers, we analyze how postsecondary earnings and the likelihood of attending and completing a postsecondary education program are related to several competencies-specifically, indicators of math skills, work habits, leadership skills, teamwork and other sports-related skills, and attitudes toward whether luck or effort determine success in life (\"locus of control\"). Other studies have examined the average effect of competencies on postsecondary outcomes. The contribution of our study is that we can estimate the effect of a competency as a function of students' other competencies. That is, we examine whether the benefit of improving a given competency depends on a student's existing strengths and weaknesses. When taking into account individual strengths and weaknesses, we find that, for a majority of students, nonacademic competencies are more predictive of postsecondary educational attainment and earnings than math test score. We arrive at this finding by calculating the effect of each of the competencies listed above as a function of students' existing competencies. This yields an estimate of the effect of each competency for every student. We then group students according to the competency most predictive of each outcome. For example, for 33 percent of students, math test score is most predictive of earnings, meaning that, for 66 percent of students, a nonacademic competency is most predictive of earnings. For a majority of students, nonacademic competencies are also most predictive of postsecondary enrollment and completion of any degree. For a majority of students, however, math test score is the strongest predictor of bachelor's completion. Furthermore, we show that a hypothetical policy intervention in which every student improves the competency of greatest value to him or her (an individualized approach) is significantly more beneficial than an intervention in which the same competency is improved for all students (a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach). For postsecondary enrollment, completion of any postsecondary degree, and earnings, we find that the individualized approach is significantly more effective than the one-size-fits-all approach. Only for bachelor's completion is there no difference between these approaches. This report is organized as follows. In Chapter II, we describe the policy context and previous studies in this area. Chapter III presents our data and methods, and Chapter IV presents detailed findings. Chapter V contains a concluding discussion of implications for policy and future research."}, {"section_title": "II. POLICY CONTEXT AND PRIOR RESEARCH", "text": "Policymakers, educators, and business people have a variety of perspectives about the competencies most useful in postsecondary education and in the workplace. In some cases, researchers have attempted to test these hypotheses using secondary data. Here, we examine both the policy context and the literature on the relationship between competencies and postsecondary outcomes."}, {"section_title": "A. POLICY CONTEXT", "text": "In the early 1990s, amid growing concern about U.S. economic competitiveness, the U.S."}, {"section_title": "Department of Labor assembled the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills", "text": "(SCANS), which defined the capabilities young people need to acquire to secure good jobs and be successful at work (U.S. Department of Labor 1991). The SCANS report concluded that schools should help students develop a diverse array of competencies, including the capacity to allocate resources, obtain and use information, work productively with others, understand and use systems, select and use technologies, and maintain a positive attitude toward work. Interest in fostering teamwork and leadership skills was heightened by the emergence of management strategies that increased the responsibilities of frontline workers. Such strategies (borrowed in part from Japanese corporations) include (1) seeking employees' input on ways to identify errors, improve products, or increase productivity; and (2) holding teams of employees responsible for key functions or tasks (Hackman 2002;Osterman 1997;Carnevale et al. 1990). These became known as \"High-Performance Work\" strategies, as some studies indicated that they are associated with high rates of productivity and innovation. Some analysts have argued that the success and diffusion of these innovations hinges on the extent to which students and employees develop leadership and teamwork skills (Osterman 1997;Capelli 1997). The passage of the School-to-Work Opportunity Act (STWOA) of 1994 reflected an interest among educators in helping students develop a broad range of competencies. STWOA supported the development of state and local programs designed to expose students to alternative careers and prepare them for specific careers through career counseling, academic and technical instruction, and paid or unpaid work-based learning activities. STWOA placed a high priority on the work-based learning activities and mandated that these activities include some \"instruction in general workplace competencies, including\u2026activities related to developing positive work attitudes, and employability and participative skills.\" In practice, many of the programs STWOA funded developed school-and work-based activities designed to develop a variety of competencies, including problem-solving skills, teamwork, and positive work habits. For example, interested students were placed in internships or encouraged to participate in schoolbased businesses, where they were assessed on their performance and interactions with team members or supervisors. By the late 1990s, policymakers' interest in diverse competencies and career-focused education strategies waned, for several reasons. Bipartisan political support grew at both the federal and state levels for policies that would hold schools accountable for student achievement. Policymakers also were concerned about the persistent gap in academic achievement between white and minority students. To gauge student achievement, policymakers and educators chose to rely increasingly on standardized tests-particularly in math and reading-which many states were already using on a large scale. These tests were viewed as a reliable and relatively inexpensive measure of students' skills. Support for school-to-work programs declined, in part because some educators and parent advocates feared that such programs might compel students to define a career goal too early, or even worse, unnecessarily pigeonhole some students into narrow vocational avenues that could limit their career options and their preparation for college. Efforts to measure a broad range of student competencies lost momentum, as school systems struggled to satisfy federal and state demands to boost reading and math scores. As schools faced intense pressure to boost test scores, however, some educators questioned the wisdom of measuring success largely through reading and math tests. Some voiced concerns about the growing incentives for teachers to focus exclusively on students' test-taking skills (Meier 2002). Meier has argued that these incentives have led some schools to spend too much time on test-prep activities at the expense of developing other important competencies. These concerns, in turn, have heightened interest among some educational researchers in measuring the value of specific competencies and, specifically, in gauging the value of the skills captured by standardized academic tests relative to that of other types of cognitive and noncognitive competencies."}, {"section_title": "B. LITERATURE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPETENCIES AND POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES", "text": "Several studies have analyzed how postsecondary outcomes are related to specific competencies. Krueger (2000) examined several studies linking math and reading test scores to future earnings and concludes that an increase of one standard deviation in these scores yields a substantial (about eight percent) increase in annual earnings. The studies Krueger cites include Murnane et al. (1995) and Currie and Thomas (1999). Murnane  Several recent studies have focused on the returns to nonacademic and noncognitive skills. Heckman and Rubinstein (2001) find that people who obtain the GED tend to have lower earnings than high school dropouts with comparable academic test scores. They attribute this wage differential to differences in the two groups' noncognitive competencies and, specifically, to the relatively poor work habits and other noncognitive competencies of those who choose to earn a GED. Heckman et al (2006) use factor analysis to construct composite measures of cognitive and noncognitive skills, which they then relate to postsecondary outcomes. They find noncognitive skills strongly influence both postsecondary educational attainment and wages. Using longitudinal data from HS&B, Rosenbaum (2001) finds that participation in leadership activities, good attendance, and the absence of discipline problems are positively associated with educational attainment and earnings, after controlling for academic achievement test scores and other factors. Kuhn and Weinberger (2003) find that proxies for leadership skills appear to have a substantial effect on postsecondary earnings, controlling for test scores and other factors, and that the return to these skills is growing for successive cohorts of students. Osborne (2000) finds a connection between postsecondary success and attitudes (measured at age 11) regarding whether success in life depends on hard work or good luck (\"locus of control\"). Dunifon and Duncan (1998) find that locus of control and a desire for challenge are both good predictors of postsecondary earnings, controlling for test scores and background characteristics. Our study builds on this literature by using a methodological approach that allows us to model the relationship between postsecondary outcomes and competencies as a flexible production function involving nonlinear returns to competencies and complex interactions between competencies. Using this approach, we can identify what proportion of students would benefit most from improving either academic or nonacademic competencies."}, {"section_title": "III. METHODOLOGY AND DATA", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY", "text": "Our conceptual framework draws on the concept of a production function, in which we regard various competencies as inputs that increase a young person's productivity as a student or as a worker. A key component of our conceptual framework is that young people's productivity, both as students and workers, may depend on interactions among several competencies, as well as nonlinear effects. Specifically, there may be complementarities among competencies, such that the value of improving one competency is greater for students with a higher level of the complementary competency. Alternatively, some competencies might be substitutes for others, such that students who are strong in one competency would benefit little from improvements to the substitute competency. In addition, there may be diminishing (or, possibly, increasing) returns to improving competencies. The nature of these nonlinearities and interactions can support very different conclusions. If we generally find diminishing returns to competencies and complementarities among competencies, we can conclude that students should focus on improving their weakest competencies rather than on further improving their areas of strength. On the other hand, if we find that competencies are substitutes for one another and that there are increasing returns to competencies, we can conclude that students should focus on specializing in areas where they are already strong. To empirically identify the nature of nonlinearities and interactions among competencies, we selected a flexible model and estimation methodology. In equation form, the production function we wish to estimate is simply: (1) where Y denotes a postsecondary outcome, C 1 \u2026C 6 are competencies, X is a vector of student background characteristics that might also influence postsecondary outcomes, and f is an unspecified function that allows for nonlinear effects of each competency and nonlinear six-way interactions. To estimate equation 1, we use an approach that combines two regression methods. Specifically, we use local regression (LR) to estimate the unspecified function f, ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the effects of control variables X, and the backfitting algorithm described by Hastie and Tibshirani (1990) to bring those two regression methods together into the framework of generalized additive models. To calculate standard errors for all the statistics we generate from this model, we use bootstrapping, which can account for the clustered sample design of our data. Appendix A describes these methods in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "B. DATA", "text": "To estimate the relationship between competencies in high school and postsecondary education and earnings, we rely on data collected for NELS. NELS followed a cohort of students who were in eighth grade in 1988 with interviews in 1988, 1992, 1994. The 1988, and 1992 rounds included detailed surveys of students while in high school, as well as surveys of their teachers and parents. We draw on data from these first three rounds to form competency measures, control variables, and subgroups. The 2000 wave of NELS included details on postsecondary education and earnings. Our base sample consists of the 9,977 high school graduates who have sufficient data from the 1988, 1990, 1992, and 2000 waves to be included in our analyses. 1 Next, we describe all the variables included in our analyses."}, {"section_title": "Competency Variables", "text": "Because students' true competencies cannot be observed directly, we analyze composite variables that we believe are indicators of these competencies. To reduce the dimensionality of the analysis and increase the reliability of our measures, we group individual NELS variables into categories based on the underlying competencies that we believe these variables represent. We then form composite measures for each competency area. Below, we describe the construction of these composites, show how the composites relate to the individual NELS variables used to construct the composites, and examine how closely related the composites are to each other. We followed a five-step procedure to create composite competency measures. First, we identified the broad types of competencies we wanted to measure. Second, we examined NELS to identify a broad set of variables that appeared to relate qualitatively to the competency areas of interest. Third, we constructed a composite by standardizing all the individual variables we thought might be related to a competency, then averaging them into a single variable. Fourth, we calculated Cronbach's Alpha coefficient to measure the extent to which the items we subjectively grouped together are statistically related to one another and to remove variables that were weakly correlated with the composite. 2 Fifth, to aid in interpretation, we transformed all the measures 1 We do not analyze dropouts. 2 Cronbach's alpha is a measure of how closely a set of variables are related to one another and, presumably, to a common underlying factor. It is a function of the number of variables included in a composite and the average correlation among the variables. (See Cronbach [1951].) into a percentile scale. 3 Below, we summarize each competency area and the types of variables in NELS that we believe are indicators of each competency. We also provide summary information in Table III.1 for the four measures that we constructed ourselves, including the source and timing of the variables, as well as Cronbach's alpha coefficient. 1. Academic Achievement as Measured by Test Scores. A central question of this study is the extent to which academic standardized tests are the most important predictor of student success. To address this question, we used the NELS math, reading, history, and science tests that were administered in the 8th, 10th, and 12th grades. We created a percentile scale for all four tests based on the average of the 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade scores. We only include math test score in most of our analyses, however, because the four tests are too highly correlated to be included in the same regression. We chose math test score because it appears to be more strongly related to outcomes than the other test scores (see Appendix C). The alpha coefficient is less meaningful for the sports and leadership composites, since participation in one activity reduces the amount of time available to participate in other activities. 2. Work Habits. Students' work habits may relate to their ability to succeed both in school and on the job. NELS posed, to both students and teachers, many questions relating to work habits, including questions on how much time students spend on homework, how hard they work in class, how often they come to class with their textbook and other materials, and how often they are tardy or absent. We combined these questions into a single composite and confirmed that the components are significantly related to one another. 3. Sports-Related Competencies. We use students' participation in sports activities as a proxy for multiple competencies. Sports participation is likely to be associated with competencies such as teamwork skills, competitiveness, and, perhaps, time management skills and an ability to set and work toward goals. We refer to the skills and capabilities captured by sports participation as \"sports-related\" competencies. An important distinction is that we are not attempting to estimate the effect of participation in sports on these competencies. Instead, we are attempting to measure the effect of competencies that are correlated with sports participation. Our measure of sports-related competencies is the number of sports that a student participated in during high school, transformed into a percentile. 4. Leadership Skills. An ability to take primary responsibility for a task and manage others effectively is likely to be rewarded in the labor market. NELS records leadership roles that students play in a wide range of extracurricular activities, including student government, sports, and nonathletic organizations and clubs. As with sports activities, we view this measure as an indicator of competencies students may have already possessed-we do not view our findings as indicative of the effect of taking on these particular leadership roles. Our measure is the number of leadership roles a student has during high school, transformed into a percentile. 5. Prosocial Behavior. Students' ability or willingness to follow social rules may relate to how they interact with others. It may also be an indicator of the amount of time they spend in unproductive, rather than productive, activities. Both hypotheses suggest that better behavior is associated with postsecondary success. Alternatively, an unwillingness to conform to school rules could indicate an independent attitude or propensity to take risks-traits that may be rewarded if they can be channeled productively. NELS questioned students and teachers about whether students get into trouble for being \"disruptive\" or for not following rules. This measure does not include questions related to illegal activity or expulsion from school, because those events are too rare to reliably analyze and may be substantively different from the other items in this composite. (The most extreme measure in this composite is suspension from school.) 6. Attitudes Toward Determinants of Success. Students who believe that success is the result of hard work rather than of good fortune may be more likely to strive to succeed both in school and on the job. NELS includes a locus of control composite designed to measure the extent to which students believe success is the result of hard work as opposed to luck. To confirm that variation in the composite measures we constructed is meaningful, we relate the composites back to their individual components. Table III.2 shows how two components of the work habits and sports composites relate to the overall composites. For example, 14.2 percent of students at the 25th percentile of the work habits composite reported spending seven hours or more each week on homework, compared to 35.5 percent of students at the 75th percentile of this measure. Similarly, just 0.6 percent of students at the 25th percentile of the sports composite participated in a team sport in 12th grade, compared to 51.1 percent of students at the 75th percentile of the sports composite. These examples suggest that variation in the composites is meaningful in terms of the individual components. They also provide a more intuitive sense of what variation in the composites actually means. Tables B.1-B.4 in Appendix B show the relationship between all the competency components and the overall composites. We examine how closely related the composites are to one another to ensure that the composites are clearly measuring six separate competencies. This is important both conceptually and because, if the composites are highly correlated with one another, interpreting results of regression analysis will be complicated by the problem of multicolinearity. In Table III.3, we show the correlations among competency measures. The academic competencies (math, science, reading, and history test scores) are all highly correlated, suggesting that they are essentially measuring the same underlying competency and cannot be analyzed together in the same regression. The other composites are not as highly correlated, suggesting that they are measuring distinct competencies and can be analyzed jointly. 4 Source: Authors' tabulation of data from NELS."}, {"section_title": "Note:", "text": "This table illustrates the relationship between the individual variables that make up the competency composites and the percentile value of the composites. Higher values of the work habits composite corresponds to better work habits, and higher values of the sports participation composite correspond to more sports participation. The values presented in this table are calculated by finding the proportion of students with the specified characteristic within +/-2 percentile points of the stated competency percentile (approximately 400 students). For example, among students between the 23rd and 27th percentile of the work habits composite, 14.2 percent report working on homework for at least seven hours per week. See Appendix B for similar tables corresponding to all variables in the work habits, prosocial behavior, sports participation, and leadership composites. Authors' tabulation of data from NELS.\nThis table shows the unadjusted correlations between competencies. Including highly correlated competencies in the same regression may lead to estimates that are difficult to interpret. Due to the high correlations among academic competencies, we do not generally include multiple academic competencies in the same regression. The correlation between work habits and prosocial behavior is somewhat high; however, we have not observed any substantial difference in findings when only one is included in regression analyses compared to when both are included, so we include both in most analyses. These correlations also are suggestive of the support that exists for examining complementarities between competencies. The fact that most correlations are low suggests that the data do support analysis of how the effect of one competency varies with the level of another competency.\nThis table illustrates the relationship between the individual variables that make up the competency composites and the outcome variables. Fulltime workers are the 5,645 respondents who were not currently enrolled in a postsecondary education program, who worked more than 35 hours per week in 1999, and who worked more than 40 weeks in 1999.

Appendix C presents these subgroup findings. We have grouped educational aspirations into three categories: (1) less than a bachelor's degree (34 percent), (2) a bachelor's degree (44 percent), and (3) more than a bachelor's degree (22 percent). We have grouped parents' education into three categories: (1) high school (39 percent), (2) some college (39 percent), and (3) bachelor's degree or more (21 percent). We also attempted to analyze racial subgroups; however, sample sizes were too small to detect any competency effects.\nThe mean marginal effects presented in this table are regression adjusted for student, household, and school characteristics. There are 9,977 high school graduates included in the \"enroll in any postsecondary program\" regression. The 8,506 students who did enroll in any program were included in the \"complete any postsecondary program\" and \"complete a bachelor's degree\" regressions. The 5,645 respondents who were employed full-time and not enrolled in any education program were included in the \"log of 1999 earnings\" regression. *Significantly different from zero at the .10 level, two-tailed test. **Significantly different from zero at the .05 level, two-tailed test.\nThe \"one-size-fits-all\" policy consists of improving the competency with the highest average effect by 20 percentile points for every student, regardless of individual strengths and weaknesses. The individualized policy consists of allocating 20 percentile points to the competencies of greatest value to individual students, given their existing strengths and weaknesses and taking into account nonlinear returns to, and interactions between, the competencies. *Significantly different from zero at the .10 level, two-tailed test. **Significantly different from zero at the .05 level, two-tailed test. While this comparison highlights the importance of taking into account individual strengths and weaknesses when considering the relative benefit of improving student competencies, it does not take into account the relative costs of improving different competencies or whether improvements of this magnitude are even feasible. The comparison is only meant to highlight the fact that individual strengths and weaknesses do significantly (both statistically and substantively) affect which competencies are most predictive of outcomes for individual students. It seems likely, however, that an individualized approach would make sense, unless the costs of improving each competency are exactly inversely proportional to the benefits. In sum, the finding of this analysis suggests that one size probably does not fit all.\nThe subgroups in this table are identified by calculating the marginal effect of each competency for each student in our sample. For each student, we identify the competency that has the highest marginal effect. The student is then assigned to a subgroup corresponding to that competency. For example, 40 percent of students in our sample would benefit more from an increase in math test scores than from an increase in any other competency. Every student has a different marginal effect of each competency because the marginal effect is a function of students' existing competencies.

For example, in Figure D.16, we show the relationship between earnings and math test score, holding sports participation constant at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. This particular figure suggests that a complementarity exists between math and sports participation, because the effect of math is greater when sports participation is high.

Among the people in our sample, 85 percent had enrolled in some form of postsecondary education as of the 2000 followup. 2.

The number of extracurricular activities is an important control variable when interpreting findings related to sports participation and leadership roles, because it helps ensure that variation in these variables is not driven by variation in the number of activities offered at a school.

Third, we examine some of the implications of these findings by comparing two hypothetical interventions-one using an individualized approach, in which individual students work to improve the competency of greatest value to them, and one using a one-size-fits-all approach, in which all students work to improve the same competency. 1 Finally, we conclude this section by examining the specific nonlinearities and interactions among competencies that underlie the variation in competency effects among students with different strengths and weaknesses (the extent to which there appear to be increasing or decreasing returns to particular competencies, and which competencies appear to be complements to, or substitutes for, other competencies)."}, {"section_title": "A.

This type of comparison is useful when the only available policy choices involve efforts to improve the same competency for all students. For example, if we are only able to choose between improving math ability and improving work habits for all students, then comparing the average effects of these two competencies is sufficient to inform that decision. However, comparing average effects might be insufficient to inform more nuanced policy choices.

THE PROPORTION OF STUDENTS WHO BENEFIT MOST FROM EACH COMPETENCY", "text": "Although policymakers and researchers often debate the value of competencies in terms of average benefits for students overall, educators and parents often stress that individual students have distinct educational needs. If the relative value of competencies does vary among students, then the potential exists to improve students' postsecondary outcomes by improving different competencies for different students. 4 For example, the fact that the average effect of math test score on earnings is greater than the average effect of sports participation does not mean that the effect of math is greater than the effect of sports for every student-some students might benefit more from math, and some might benefit more from sports. In this section, we find that the benefit of improving competencies does appear to depend on students' individual strengths and weaknesses. Using the flexible functional form described in Chapter III, we calculate the effect of each competency for each student in our data, taking into account each student's individual strengths and weaknesses. We then group students according to the competency most valuable to them. Thus, we can identify the proportion of students for whom each competency is most predictive of each outcome.  \u2193 The mean marginal effect of the second most predictive competency is significantly less than that of the most predictive competency, at the .10 level. \u2193\u2193 The mean marginal effect of the second most predictive competency is significantly less than that of the most predictive competency, at the .05 level. control on earnings is higher than the mean marginal effect of any other competency. 5 Specifically, the mean marginal effect of locus of control is 4 percent, while the mean marginal effect of math test score (the second most predictive competency for this subgroup) is 1.5 percent. The findings presented in Table IV.2 support very different conclusions from those presented in Table IV.1. Table IV.1 shows that the average effect of math test score is greater than the average effect of all other competencies. In Table IV.2, however, we see that, for three out of four outcomes, nonacademic competencies as a group are more effective than math test score for a majority of students. Furthermore, we see in several cases that, among students for whom nonacademic competencies are most predictive, there is a significant difference in the average effect of the most effective competency and the second most effective competency. For example, among the 30 percent of students for whom locus of control is most predictive of earnings, the effect of locus of control is significantly greater (at the 5 percent level) than the effect of math test score."}, {"section_title": "C. ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL", "text": "The pattern of findings presented above suggests that taking into account students' individual strengths and weaknesses when helping them decide which competencies to improve might be more effective than simply encouraging all students to improve the same competency. Put another way, these findings suggest that a more flexible functional form provides a better fit to the data. In this section, we describe the results of a statistical test of this hypothesis for each of our four outcomes. To test whether an individualized approach to helping students choose which competencies to improve is more beneficial than a one-size-fits-all approach, we compare two hypothetical policies. The one-size-fits-all policy consists of improving the competency with the highest average effect by 20 percentile points for every student, regardless of individual strengths and weaknesses. For example, for earnings, every student's math test score would be improved by 20 percentile points because math test score has the highest average effect (see Table IV.1). The \"individualized\" policy consists of allocating 20 percentile points to the competencies of greatest value to individual students, given their existing strengths and weaknesses and taking into account nonlinear returns to, and interactions between, the competencies. For example, one particular student in the data is at the 70th percentile in math ability and the 86th percentile in sports participation. The best strategy for this individual is to improve math ability by 12 percentile points and sports participation by 8 percentile points, which reflects a complementarity between math ability and sports participation (see Section D for more details on nonlinearities and interactions). Table IV.3 shows the difference in overall effects of these two policies for each of the four outcomes examined in this report. In every case except bachelor's completion, the effect of the individualized policy is significantly larger than the effect of the one-size-fits-all policy. Specifically, the individualized policy increases the probability of enrolling in any postsecondary program by 2 percentage points more than the one-size-fits-all policy; it increases the probability of completion by 1.9 percent more; and it increases earnings by 3.7 percent more. 6 Author's calculations using data from NELS."}, {"section_title": "D.

In particular, we examine whether some competencies are complements or substitutes and whether we observe diminishing or increasing returns.

Second, we see some evidence to support the well-rounded education model over the specialist model, at least in the choice between academic and nonacademic competencies. That is, when students are particularly strong in one area and weak in another, we see more evidence that they should focus on improving in the area where they are weak rather than continuing to build on an existing strength."}, {"section_title": "a. Enroll in Any Postsecondary Program", "text": "Enrollment in postsecondary education is a function, not only of students' competencies, but also of their goals, enjoyment of the educational process, and confidence that they will succeed in postsecondary programs. High math test scores, strong teacher recommendations, or achievement in extracurricular activities (like sports) might all increase the likelihood that a student applies to, and is accepted by, a postsecondary program. Because our measure of postsecondary enrollment also includes two-year schools and certificate programs, even students who lack these skills might be able to enter some form of postsecondary education. In those cases, simply having the motivation and belief that they can succeed may be enough to enroll in postsecondary education. However, completing a postsecondary program may require a different mix of competencies. The competency measure most predictive of enrollment is math test score (Table IV.2), perhaps because of the weight admissions committees place on test scores. If students have high math ability, then their probability of enrollment is very high. There is little room left for gains in work habits or sports participation to boost this probability further (Figures D.5 and D.6). However, gains in locus of control, if locus of control is low, do matter (Figure D.7). It may be that students with a low locus of control are less likely to take the initiative to enroll, even if they are fully capable of succeeding. For students with low math ability, there are a variety of ways to increase the probability of enrolling in postsecondary education. Both work habits and sports participation are predictive of enrollment when math ability is low (Figures D.5 and D.6). 7 Neither of these is quite as effective as math ability when math ability is low, but in cases where students have difficulty improving their math ability, these could be effective alternatives. For sports participation, this could be due to sports scholarships, not just the effect of competencies associated with sports. Students with good work habits might be more likely to receive recommendations from teachers, or good work habits might be an indicator that they have already decided to enroll in postsecondary education. On balance, our findings provide more support to the hypothesis that students should be well rounded than to the hypothesis that students should focus on building a single strength. Figure   D.1 shows that both locus of control and math test score exhibit diminishing returns and that none of the competencies exhibit increasing returns. This relationship is also evident in Table   IV.4, where we see that the students for whom math is the most effective competency have below-average math test scores and that the students for whom locus of control is the most effective competency have below-average locus of control."}, {"section_title": "b. Complete Any Postsecondary Program", "text": "Completion of a postsecondary program appears to be driven by a somewhat different set of competencies than enrollment. Academic ability still matters, but work habits appear to be more predictive of success than any other competency. Locus of control and sports participation still have positive effects, but they are not nearly as important as academic ability and hard work, nor are they as important with respect to completion as they were with respect to enrollment. This seems to suggest that, while participating in sports might look good on a college application, it is not as strong of a predictor of success in college. Similarly, believing in one's ability to succeed (locus of control) might increase the probability of enrolling but does not necessarily guarantee completion. Specifically, math is most predictive for 30 percent of students, and work habits are most predictive for 43 percent (Table IV.2). This difference is driven by complementary relationships between math and work habits ( Consequently, the students who appear to benefit most from improving their math test score are those with high levels of work habits, sports participation, and leadership (Table IV.5, column 1). Those who appear to benefit most from work habits have high math test scores but lower levels of sports participation and leadership (Table IV.5, column 2).

Complete a Bachelor's Degree", "text": "The relationship between completion of a bachelor's degree and competencies is similar to the relationship between completion of any degree and competencies, except that math test score, rather than work habits, is the most predictive competency. Specifically, math is most predictive for 56 percent of students, and work habits are most predictive for 31 percent (Table IV.2). This finding is consistent with the average effects of work habits and math test scores discussed in Section A (Table IV.1). This difference might be due to more math or science requirements in bachelor's programs than in associate's or certificate programs. To the extent that our math test scores are picking up broader academic skills, this may simply reflect the fact that bachelors' programs are academically more challenging. The effects of each competency are mostly linear ( Figure D.3). The nature of the interactions between competencies is similar to the interactions observed for completion of any postsecondary program (for example, see Figure D.13 for the complementarity between work habits and math test score, and Table IV.6, which shows patterns similar to those in Table IV.5). 8"}, {"section_title": "d. Earnings", "text": "The relationship between competencies and earnings is more similar to the relationship between competencies and postsecondary enrollment than between competencies and postsecondary completion. Specifically, locus of control and sports participation are much more predictive of both enrollment and earnings than they are of postsecondary completion, while work habits are much more predictive of postsecondary completion than either postsecondary enrollment or earnings (Table IV.2). One possible explanation is that these earnings are observed relatively early in respondents' careers and, hence, may be more reflective of respondents' initial job offers than their ultimate productivity on the job. In other words, both enrollment and this early measure of earnings may be indications of which competency measures are rewarded on an application, on a resume, or in an interview. For two-thirds of students, nonacademic competencies are more predictive of earnings than math test score. Specifically, math test score is most predictive for 33 percent of students, locus of control is most predictive for 30 percent, sports participation is most predictive for 20 percent, and leadership is most predictive for 14 percent (Table IV.2). The variation among students in the most predictive competency is driven by a diminishing return to math, a constant return to locus of control, and interactions between math and leadership and between math and sports participation. The nonlinear effect of math and the interactions between math and other competencies determines when those competencies are most effective. The constant, fairly high, return of locus of control means that it is the most effective competency when the nonlinearities and interactions among the other competencies render them less effective. participation. Math and sports participation appear to be complements-the effect of math increases when sports participation is high, and the effect of sports participation increases when math test score is high. Math and leadership appear to be substitutes-the effect of math is higher when leadership is low, and the effect of leadership is higher when math test scores are low. As with the other outcomes, we see more evidence to support the well-rounded model than the specialist model. As with enrollment, we see in Figure D.4 that there are diminishing returns to math ability, constant returns to other competencies, and no evidence of increasing returns to any competency. Furthermore, the complementarity described above between math and sports participation suggests students would generally be better off improving in the area of weakness rather than areas of strength. 9"}, {"section_title": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "Our findings have two implications for educational policy and practice. First, the increasing focus on academic skills, and particularly skills captured by standardized tests, may be misplaced if it leads schools and parents to neglect the development of valuable nonacademic competencies. Second, an individualized approach to setting and pursuing competency objectives for each student could benefit students in terms of their future educational attainment and earnings, although there may be challenges to developing and implementing an individualized approach. In general, we find that, when choosing between improving academic and nonacademic competencies, it is better for students to improve in areas where they are weak than to focus on further developing areas where they are well above average. This suggests that the NCLB emphasis on improving the academic performance of low achievers may be appropriate for many low-achieving students but that the concerns of some parents that their higher-achieving children might benefit more from developing nonacademic skills also might be correct in many cases. However, educators are likely to face at least two challenges in developing nonacademic competencies: \u2022 Measuring these competencies objectively is difficult. For many measures used in this study, we relied on student self-reports or reports from teachers. In practice, schools could not depend on this type of subjective and informal assessment, particularly if they are held accountable for students' mastery of these competencies. Furthermore, little is known about how teachers can develop most nonacademic competencies. \u2022 Schools may find it hard to help individual students identify and develop the competencies they need most. Expanding the use of individualized education plans, currently required for students with special needs, is one possible strategy. The plans could help schools advise parents and students on classes and activities that could be most beneficial. This approach would require a large investment in guidance staff and professional development. Additional teacher training, curriculum changes, and reductions in class size might help teachers develop customized assignments and projects for students. Despite the challenges and costs involved in developing a more individualized approach to schooling, the investment may be worthwhile. Standard errors are estimated using bootstrapping, in which we take into account the sampling design of NELS by randomly selecting schools and then randomly selecting students from within those schools (both with replacement) for each bootstrap replication. In this appendix, we explore each of the following in greater detail: \u2022 Local regression estimation \u2022 The backfitting algorithm \u2022 Bootstrapping algorithm"}, {"section_title": "A. LOCAL REGRESSION ESTIMATION", "text": "Local regression is a semiparametric approach to regression in which a global fit of a dependent variable Y to an independent variable X is based on a large number of local fits. The term \"local\" refers to a bandwidth around a particular value of X. Within that bandwidth, a linear regression model is estimated, possibly including higher-order terms of X. Separate models are estimated for multiple bandwidths, covering the entire empirical domain of X. A global fit of Y to X is inferred from these local fits by plotting the predicted value of Y for every value of X using the appropriate local fit for each value of X. Thus, the global fit is A.4 \"semiparametric\" because it relies on the estimation of multiple parameters locally, but there is no single parametric function that describes the global fit. Three key choices must be made when estimating local regression models: the degree of the local polynomial, the size of the bandwidth, and the weighting function. (The following discussion is based primarily on Loader 1999.) The degree of the local polynomial refers to the specification of the local regression. We chose a quadratic form, so that each competency enters the local regression with both a linear and a squared term, and such that up to six-way interactions between competencies are also included in the local regression function. The size of the bandwidth refers to the number of points to be included in each local regression. We use a nearest-neighbor bandwidth, in which 70 percent of the data are used for each local fit. Wider bandwidths result in smoother fits, while narrower bandwidths yield \"bumpier\" fits. A narrower bandwidth will provide a better fit to the data, but it is difficult to determine if it is fitting real relationships or if it is simply fitting noise. For density estimation, there are suggested procedures for selecting an optimal bandwidth. For regression, however, there is no clear concept of an optimal bandwidth that is purely data driven. We chose a bandwidth that yields a smoother fit, because we prefer to believe that we are estimating an underlying, reasonably well-behaved production function. Or, as Loader puts it, \"We hope that nature isn't too nasty\" (Loader 1999, page 22). The weighting function generates a weight for each point in the local regression, typically such that points that are further away from the center of the bandwidth receive a lower weight. We used the tricube weight function described by Loader (1999), x is the point at the center of the bandwidth h(x), and x i is the point for which a A.5 weight is being constructed. The tricube function generates a bell curve, in which points closer to the center of the bandwidth receive a heavier weight than points further from the center."}, {"section_title": "B.

If they do differ, then our choice of the test score that we use to compare academic to nonacademic competencies will affect our findings. Furthermore, any difference in the predictive power of these test scores may be of interest in and of itself to parents, teachers, and policymakers. These differences must be interpreted cautiously, however, because the high correlation among these competencies means that any difference in predictive power is likely to be small and statistically insignificant. To calculate the predictive power of these four test scores, we estimated a separate regression for each of the four test scores, for each of the four outcomes, resulting in a total of 16 regressions. We estimated a separate regression for each test score rather than include all four in a single regression due to the high correlation among test scores. In each regression, we also included the nonacademic competencies and control variables described in Section III. C.4 Table C.1 reports the results of these 16 regressions.

While a 10 percentile point increase in math test scores is associated with a statistically significant 2.9 percent increase in earnings, a similar increase in reading test scores has a statistically insignificant effect of just 0.8 percent. The difference in the effect of math and reading is significant at the 10 percent level. The effects of history and science also appear to be less than those of math, although these differences are not statistically significant. The existence of such a large difference in the effects of math and reading test scores on earnings is surprising, particularly given the high correlation between these two tests. However, these findings are consistent with other studies regarding the relative value of reading and math test score in predicting earnings. Murnane et al. 1995, using data from both High School and Beyond and the National Longitudinal Study of 1972, find that math test scores are better predictors of earnings than reading test scores. The National Job Corps Study examined the relationship between earnings and an adult literacy and numeracy test. That study also found that the numeracy test was more predictive of earnings than the literacy test (Glazerman et al. 2000). Throughout this report, we use math test score as a proxy for academic ability. This choice does not affect findings for the postsecondary education outcomes. However, it does affect findings for the earnings outcomes. If we were to use another measure of academic ability, then the nonacademic competencies would appear even more predictive. Because our ultimate finding for earnings is that the nonacademic competencies are jointly more predictive of earnings than academic ability, the use of math test score as our proxy for academic ability is a conservative choice. Put another way, using a different test score to proxy for academic ability would only strengthen our conclusions. C.6"}, {"section_title": "B.

One hypothesis regarding the source of this discrepancy is that the work habits composite is actually measuring study habits and that having good study habits in an educational setting is not necessarily correlated with good work habits in a workplace setting. For example, a student who is not interested in academics may have poor study habits in school but might have strong work habits on the job. An alternative hypothesis is that at the early point in many workers' careers when earnings data were collected, employers have not yet had an opportunity to observe work habits and adjust compensation accordingly. It may be that this early measure of earnings is affected more by the competencies that are easily observed on a resume (for example, test scores and past leadership C.7 roles) than competencies that can only be observed through direct, prolonged experience with a worker. A third hypothesis is that work habits are too highly correlated with other competency measures. To test this, we estimated the earnings regression without any of the other competencies.

In fact, the effect of prosocial behavior with the largest magnitude is a negative effect on earnings (though this effect is not statistically significant). We can only speculate as to the interpretation of this finding. One possible explanation for the weak predictive power of prosocial behavior is that respondents' behavior later in life is not strongly correlated with their behavior in high school. Alternatively, it may be that, within certain bounds, \"bad behavior\" might not always be bad. For example, students who are \"disruptive\" might also be more willing to take risks or might be more likely to question authority.

A higher locus of control is also positively related to earnings. On the one hand, this may suggest that greater confidence does lead to greater productivity in the workplace. On the other hand, if the hypothesis stated above regarding work habits is true-that is, if our early earnings measure reflects variation in starting salary that is due to characteristics that employers can observe when first hiring employees rather than characteristics that are observed on the jobthen the benefit of a higher locus of control may be to \"get a foot in the door\" in a higher-paying position rather than to actually improve productivity.

SPORTS PARTICIPATION, WORK HABITS, AND ENROLLMENT", "text": "A significant finding revealed when looking beyond the average effects of competencies on enrollment in postsecondary education is that sports participation appears much more effective than work habits, which is the opposite conclusion drawn from looking at average effects. For 21 percent of students, sports participation is more predictive of enrollment than any other competency (Table IV.2). Furthermore, the number of students for whom sports participation is the most predictive competency is twice as large as the number for whom work habits is most predictive. Yet in Table IV.1, we see that math test score, work habits, and locus of control are the only competencies with a statistically significant average effect on enrollment-the effect of sports participation is insignificant. This apparent difference in the effectiveness of sports participation and work habits is due to the fact that when work habits is at its most effective, math ability is even more effective, and when math ability is not effective, sports participation is more effective than work habits. First, Figure D1 shows that there actually is a wide range of the sports participation distribution in which sports participation does have a significant effect on enrollment. For students between the 40th and 80th percentiles of sports participation, the marginal effect is statistically significant. 1 Second, sports participation appears to be the most effective competency when math and locus of control are above average (Table IV.4), an observation consistent with the diminishing marginal returns to both of these competencies seen in Figure D.1 (the effect of both competencies becomes insignificant beyond the 60th percentile). Third, work habits appear to be most effective when math ability is low (which also happens to be when math ability is most effective) and work habits appear to have no significant effect on enrollment when math ability is above average (Figure D.5). Thus, when work habits are most effective, math ability is even more effective. When math ability is not effective, sports participation is more effective than work habits. It is the combination of these nonlinearities that yields the surprising difference in interpretation when we look beyond average effects."}, {"section_title": "D. THE AVERAGE VALUE OF COMPETENCIES BY SUBGROUP", "text": "Improving the outcomes of students from disadvantaged backgrounds is a goal of many policymakers and educators. In this section, we examine subgroups of students defined by educational aspirations and parents' educational attainment, where we consider students with less educated parents and lower aspirations to be representative of \"disadvantaged\" students. Improving the outcomes of these students requires an understanding of exactly what factors associated with a \"disadvantaged background\" inhibit success later in life. For example, are students whose parents have less education disadvantaged because they have fewer financial resources, because their parents are less able to help them with homework, or because of some other reason? Are students with low educational aspirations less likely to succeed simply because they have lower aspirations, or are their low aspirations the result of other factors that also affect outcomes, such as students' abilities, access to resources, and quality of education? A partial explanation for the lower earnings and educational attainment of disadvantaged students is that they may not have the same skills, abilities, and attitudes as students from more advantaged households. To the extent that this explanation is valid, policymakers have the potential to improve the postsecondary outcomes of these students by helping them build these C.11 competencies. If feasible, policymakers and educators would ideally focus their efforts on helping disadvantaged students improve the competencies of greatest value to those students. Understanding how the relative effects of competencies vary among easily identifiable subgroups is a first step towards devising a more refined policy in which the development of different competencies is emphasized for different students. However, using such broad subgroups as the basis for targeting efforts to develop specific competencies may be unappealing for at least two reasons. First, there may be considerable variation in individual student needs within these broad subgroups. Second, targeting disadvantaged groups to receive a different education may raise serious legal and ethical concerns. Understanding why the relative effects of competencies vary across subgroups is the second, and more important, step towards devising a more refined policy. Of particular interest are explanations for this variation that are policy-relevant-that is, explanations that suggest a direct connection to a specific policy action. The possible explanation, which is the focus of this study, is that the effect of competencies for disadvantaged students might differ from other groups because they have lower overall competency levels or have a different mix of strengths and weaknesses. 2 For the present study, we are particularly interested in testing the hypothesis of whether differences in the effects of competencies among students are due to differences in the competency levels of students. In this section, we examine whether average effects of competencies differ among subgroups defined by students' educational aspirations and parents' 2 There may be many other explanations for why the effects of competencies would vary across these groups. For example, there may be important interaction between the competencies examined in this study and other factors, such as financial resources or parents' connections, that might influence the relative value of competencies. education. 3 We then look to see if these differences might be explained by differences in average competency levels between groups. Overall, we see noticeable variation among subgroups in the effects of competencies. However, while the magnitude of these differences may appear large, the number of differences that are statistically significant is small. Where significant differences do exist, we use an Oaxaca-style decomposition to calculate the proportion of the difference in effects between subgroups that can be explained by different competency levels between groups. This analysis suggests that competency differences between subgroups do contribute to the differences in effects between subgroups but that there are also other unobserved factors at work. 4 In Chapter IV, Section B, we more directly examine the extent to which the effects of competencies vary by the levels of competencies. Below, we first describe the Oaxaca-style decomposition we used, followed by a discussion of findings for subgroups defined by educational aspirations and parents' education.

For bachelor's completion, we find that the effect of work habits is strongest for students who aspire to more than a bachelor's degree.

VARYING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE EFFECT OF POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION ON EARNINGS", "text": "Due to the select nature of the respondents included in our earnings regressions, our estimates of the \"full effect\" of competencies on earnings could be biased. The full effect of competencies on earnings (which is the effect reported in all tables and figures in this report) includes both the direct effect of competencies on earnings and the indirect effect through postsecondary education. The indirect effect through postsecondary education is based on the effect of competencies on postsecondary education and the effect of postsecondary education on earnings. Specifically, the effect of postsecondary education on earnings may be understated, for two reasons. First, students in this sample who did not attend any postsecondary education have more experience in the labor market than students who did not, meaning that the effect of postsecondary education on earnings is negatively biased. This cannot be directly accounted for in the regression model, because years of postsecondary education and years of experience are nearly collinear. Second, this sample excludes graduate students, who may receive a larger return to postsecondary education. The implication of this bias is that when finding the \"full effect\" of competencies on earnings, we may understate the effect of competencies that have a strong effect on postsecondary education because we are understating the effect of postsecondary education on earnings. To explore the sensitivity of our earnings findings to this issue, we estimated a regression in which we imposed an assumption regarding the effect of postsecondary education on earnings. Specifically, we assumed that the effect of enrolling in any postsecondary education on earnings is 10 percent, that the effect of completing any degree is 10 percent, and that the effect of C.23 completing a bachelor's degree is 20 percent (thus, the cumulative effect of completing a bachelor's degree is 40 percent).
