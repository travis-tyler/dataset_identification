[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Personality traits have been shown to be associated with longevity and healthy aging. In order to discover novel genetic modifiers associated with personality traits as related with longevity, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on personality factors assessed by NEO-five-factor inventory in individuals enrolled in the Long Life Family Study (LLFS), a study of 583 families (N up to 4595) with clustering for longevity in the United States and Denmark. Three SNPs, in almost perfect LD, associated with agreeableness reached genome-wide significance (p < 10 \u22128 ) and replicated in an additional sample of 1279 LLFS subjects, although one (rs9650241) failed to replicate and the other two were not available in two independent replication cohorts, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the New England Centenarian Study. Based on 10,000,000 permutations, the empirical p-value of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 was observed for the genome-wide significant SNPs. Seventeen SNPs that reached marginal statistical significance in the two previous GWASs (p-value <10 \u22124 and 10 \u22125 ), were also marginally significantly associated in this study (p-value <0.05), although none of the associations passed the Bonferroni correction. In addition, we tested age-by-SNP interactions and found some significant associations. Since scores of personality traits in LLFS subjects change in the oldest ages, and genetic factors outweigh environmental factors to achieve extreme ages, these age-by-SNP interactions could be a proxy for complex gene-gene interactions affecting personality traits and longevity."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Personality traits have been shown to be associated with important health outcomes and longevity (Terracciano et al., 2008) . Previous findings suggest that low levels of neuroticism, high levels of conscientiousness, and high levels of extraversion are associated with reduced mortality (Friedman et al., 1993; Wilson et al., 2004 Wilson et al., , 2005 Weiss and Costa, 2005; Chapman et al., 2011) . Centenarian offspring have lower neuroticism and higher extraversion in comparison to published normative data (Givens et al., 2009) . We recently assessed domains of agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness to experience using the NEO-five-factor inventory (NEO-FFI) (Costa and McCrae, 1992) in subjects enrolled in the Long Life Family Study (LLFS): a familybased longitudinal study of longevity and healthy aging (Newman et al., 2011) . The analysis replicated the association of low neuroticism and high extraversion with longevity and also confirmed differences in distributions of personality scores at different ages.\nHeritability estimates of agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness assessed by the NEO-FFI in 6148 Sardinians ranged from 17 to 33% (Pilia et al., 2006) , and a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis identified many genetic variants associated with personality traits, although just a few reached levels of genome-wide significance de Moor et al., 2012) . This enrichment of associations suggests that personality traits are likely influenced by many genes in a complex manner, each with small effects.\nThe association between some personality traits and longevity however triggers the question as to whether additional or different genetic variants in long-lived individuals may be associated with longevity-promoting personality traits such as low neuroticism and high extraversion, and as such could contribute to longer life span and health-span. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a GWAS of five domains of NEO-FFI in subjects from the LLFS and examined the results in the context of other studies, Terracciano et al. (2010) and de Moor et al. (2012) , and tested gene-by-environment interactions."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND NEO FIVE-FACTOR INVENTORY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Long Life Family Study", "text": "The LLFS is a study of 583 families demonstrating clustering for longevity and healthy aging living in the United States and Denmark.

Potential probands were screened for familial longevity using the Family Longevity Selection Score (FLoSS), which scores a family according to birth-year cohort survival probabilities of the proband and siblings (Sebastiani et al., 2009) . Family eligibility criteria were a FLoSS >7.0, a proband and at least one living sibling, who did not have dementia, and at least one offspring also willing to participate. The spouses were enrolled as controls of subjects enrolled for familial longevity. Spouses of the offspring generation were recruited as controls while spouses of the proband generation were recruited only if their biological children were enrolled in the study.

The NEO-FFI consists of 60 items, with 12 items for each of the five domains of personality as compared to the NEO PI-R which has 48 items per domain. Each item in the NEO-FFI is scored using a five-item Likert scale of agreement with each statement. During Phase 1 of the LLFS (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) , only the domains neuroticism and conscientiousness of the NEO-FFI were administered to 4938 participants during a phone interview or an in-home interview. During Phase 2 (2010-present) of the LLFS, all five domains of the NEO-FFI were administered by phone or mail to all living and willing participants, and the data were distributed by the data management and coordinating center in two batches: an initial batch of data from 3032 participants (July 2011) (Andersen et al., 2012a) , and an additional batch of data from \u223c1300 participants (November 2012). Because of some loss at follow-up and deaths of participants, the sample size for the three domains of agreeableness, extraversion, and openness was \u223c4400 ( Table 1) . The way in which we received the data from the data coordinating center created an independent split of the entire data into two non-overlapping data sets that will be used for internal replication, even though individuals in the two batches of the data are correlated. Note that in the analysis of the two data sets, we fully account for this family correlation. Note also that while the proband generation receives a full follow-up every year, the offspring generation receives a full follow-up every 3 years.

The LLFS GWAS SNP data (Illumina Omni 2.5 or 2.5 million SNPs) underwent checking and quality correction centrally at the LLFS data coordinating center (Washington University, St. Louis) where a series of standard procedures were applied. By using GRR package (Abecasis et al., 2001) , the GWAS data were checked with the pedigree structure data to verify that the relationships were correct and to avoid sample mismatches. In some cases, direct comparisons of Y and Mitochondrial markers were also applied to verify relationships. Mendelian consistency for all SNPs was assessed with Loki (Heath, 1997) for autosomal markers, PedCheck (O'Connell and Weeks, 1998) for X markers or direct comparison for Y and mitochondrial markers. All Mendel inconsistencies were removed: a sliding threshold depending on minor allele frequency (MAF) was set and if a SNP had inconsistencies below that threshold, the SNP was set to missing in all families with an inconsistency. If the number of families with inconsistencies was above the threshold, the SNP was removed from the analysis. The threshold was set to remove the \"worst\" \u223c0.2% of markers, and ranged from 35 for a MAF of 0.45-0.5 to 1 for a MAF below 0.1. Filters on call rates both by SNP and by individual were also applied as follows: Individuals with a call rate below 97.5% and SNPs with a call rate below 98% had genotype data removed. These steps resulted in 18 individuals and 86,233 autosomal SNPs being removed, as well as 153,363 Mendel inconsistencies set to missing in the families in which they occurred. Approximately two million autosomal SNPs were judged fit for analysis after this filtering.\nThe NECS DNA samples were genotyped at Boston University using the Illumina Human610-Quad SNP array, with \u223c600,000 SNPs. All samples genotyped at Boston University were processed according to the manufacturer's protocol and BeadStudio Software was used to make genotype calls utilizing the Illumina pre-defined clusters. Samples with less than a 95% call rate were removed and SNPs with a call rate <97.5% were re-clustered. After reclustering, SNPs with call rates >97.5%, cluster separation score >0.25, excess heterozygosity between \u22120.10 and 0.10, and MAF >5% were retained in the analysis.

This discovery set comprised data released in February 2012 (batch 1). Again, due to the difference in the data collection between the proband and offspring generations, the additional data we received on November 2012 (batch 2) were an independent split of the entire data and were used to replicate the top findings from the discovery set in the domains of agreeableness, extraversion, and openness. There were 2759 participants, who had repeated measures on conscientiousness and neuroticism, and the average time interval between the repeated measures was 2.6 years. The agreement between repeated measures of conscientiousness and neuroticism was estimated using the Spearman correlation coefficient (0.67 and 0.66, respectively) and repeated measures were summarized by the average scores and the average ages. No significant trend between age and difference between the two domains was observed, as reported in Andersen et al. (2012a) . The association between the five domains of personality and the genotype for each SNP was tested in a linear mixed model with random effects per subject. The random effects were modeled as a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean vector and variance-covariance matrix proportional to the kinship matrix to fully account for familial relations. Covariates included sex, field centers, and significant polynomial terms of age. Significant polynomial terms of age were searched using the model search strategy described in Andersen et al.

Compared to a twin study (Jang and Vernon, 1996) that reported heritability estimates of 41, 53, 61, 41, and 44%, respectively for neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, LLFS estimates are lower in every domain. Compared to the recent estimates reported by Pilia et al. (2006) from 6148 Sardinians, the estimates of heritability in the LLFS are higher in conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness. The heritability estimate was lower in LLFS for agreeableness, but comparable for neuroticism. These differences may be due to the fact that samples in the two studies are ethnically different (the Sardinian sample was from a genetically isolated population) and phenotypically different. The LLFS is a study of longevity and families were selected for evidence of familial longevity (Newman et al., 2011) . Andersen et al. (2012a) showed that all five domains of NEO scores have different distributions at different ages in the LLFS subjects, and this selected population may be enriched for variants that are associated with longevity as well as longevity-promoting personality traits that translate into different heritability estimates. Intriguingly, the variants associated with agreeableness that reached genome-wide significance in the LLFS did not replicate in the BLSA. The three genome-wide significant SNPs in agreeableness showed consistent results in the two batches of samples of the LLFS. Even though the two data sets are not independent, the fact that these SNPs show significant associations with consistent effects strengthens the validity of this finding. Among the 10,000,000 permutation tests performed, there was 1 permutation that achieved genome-wide significance, which yields an empirical p-value of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 (North et al., 2002) . The analysis using the combined samples yielded improved statistical significance for the three SNPs and two additional SNPs that almost attained genomewide significance (rs2587559 with p = 4.13 \u00d7 10 \u22128 and rs2587561 with p = 5.27 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ), located in the promoter region of TRPA1, which is in a close proximity (within 40,000 bp) to the original variants. This result further corroborates the association between agreeableness and this particular region on chromosome 8, which is linked to tolerance to pain (Doehring et al., 2011) . The three genome-wide significant SNPs in the initial GWAS of LLFS have a MAF of around 9%, and there are only 18 subjects out of 2622 with the GG genotype for rs9650241 (the most significant SNP). Therefore, it is difficult to assess the true relationship with the additive coding of SNP genotypes. Under dominant coding (dominant for the G allele) for rs9650241, the statistical significance improves to a p-value of 2.1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , compared to 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22129 in an additive model. We observed that the median agreeableness in subjects with the G allele is above the normal range (median T -score = 56.1). The association of this locus with agreeableness is novel in the www.frontiersin.org LLFS, although it did not replicate in the BLSA and it could not be tested in the NECS. Therefore, there is no evidence on whether the same association exists in the general population or this locus is linked to agreeableness through longevity.\nThere were a total of 75 SNPs (21 SNPs associated with agreeableness; 26 SNPs associated with conscientiousness; 7 SNPs associated with extraversion; 12 SNPs associated with neuroticism; 9 SNPs associated with openness, Table S5 in Supplementary Material) with p-value <10 \u22125 in the GWAS of LLFS. Some of these SNPs were in interesting genes. For example, the most significant SNP in neuroticism (rs177389) is a missense mutation in PAPLN, which changes the aminoacid MET into ARG. This gene was shown to be linked to suicidal ideation during anti-depressant treatment (Laje et al., 2009 ). On average, carriers of the T allele scored lower in neuroticism; the median scores for the three genotypes (GG, GT, TT) were 43.8, 42.7, and 41.4, respectively, all of which are below the normative value. This SNP could not be replicated in the NECS and BLSA GWAS. Likewise, many of the top findings from LLFS remain to be replicated by other investigators in a larger sample with evidence of longevity.\nInterestingly, the LLFS GWAS also replicated findings from other studies de Moor et al., 2012) . Six SNPs in agreeableness, 10 SNPs in neuroticism, and 1 SNP in extraversion replicated in either the LLFS or NECS GWAS de Moor et al., 2012) , although none of the replicated associations passed the Bonferroni correction (p = 0.00015). de Moor et al. reported several SNPs in ARNTL to be associated with agreeableness. In both the LLFS and NECS GWAS, a cluster of SNPs in the same gene were significantly associated with agreeableness at \u03b1 = 0.05 (Table S6 in Supplementary Material). However, these SNPs were not in LD with those reported in de Moor et al. (highest r 2 = 0.234). ARNTL, one of the circadian clock genes, is associated with winter depression and seasonal affective disorder (Partonen et al., 2007) as well as alcohol use disorders (Kovanen et al., 2010) . These replicated associations strengthen the original findings in Terracciano et al. (2010 ), de Moor et al. (2012 . Lack of replication of the other findings may be due to different ethnicities, social, and environmental factors.\nThe significant SNP-by-age interaction terms in Table 4 suggest an interesting hypothesis that it is depicted in Figure 2 . It is well known that aging is in part determined by genetic and environmental factors and while genetic factors may explain only 25% of the variability to survive to the mid 1980s (Herskind et al., 1996) , the contribution of genes to surviving to older ages is likely much larger (Perls et al., 2000; Sebastiani et al., 2012) . Being selected for familial longevity, participants of the LLFS may be enriched for genetic and non-genetic variants that promote longevity, and LLFS subjects who have reached old ages may harbor varying proportions of longevity associated variants. In this hypothetical context, the SNP \u00d7 age interactions found in this study may actually be surrogates for several gene \u00d7 gene and gene \u00d7 environment interactions. This hypothesis is consistent with work in McCrae et al. (2010) that suggested the genetic basis of personality traits is multifactorial, it is likely determined by many interacting genes with individual small effects, and environmental factors are also important factors. However, additional analysis that models the FIGURE 2 | Graphical representation of hypothesis on gene-gene interactions. Attributes inside the large rectangular box are the variables included in the statistical model. Age, which is associated with NEO scores, is reflective of both genetic and environmental factors associated with aging. As genetics factors outweigh the environmental factors in individuals enriched for longevity, SNP-by-age interaction term in the model may imply gene-gene interaction which plays important roles in personality traits, as related to longevity. genetic influence on lifespan and personality traits simultaneously is needed to begin to test this hypothesis."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS", "text": "Our ability to replicate the genome-wide significant associations discovered in the LLFS GWAS was limited by the different arrays that were used to genotype the DNA samples from the BLSA and the NECS. In addition, given that five phenotypes are analyzed, a genome-wide significance threshold of 10 \u22128 may be too liberal and additional replication is necessary to confirm a role of these discovered variants in personality traits."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This study is the first GWAS on five major domains of personality traits assessed by NEO-FFI in a sample enriched for longevity. Our results replicated a few loci identified by others, and confirm that effects of each common genetic variant are modest. As with many complex polygenic traits, genetic framework of personality, as related to longevity, seems multifactorial. In particular, genetic variants that promote longevity may interact with other variants in the establishment of personality traits."}]
