[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already infected more than 13 million people in 188 countries, causing 570,375 global deaths as of July 13 th 2020 and extraordinary disruptions to daily life and economies (1, 2). The international research community rapidly started to establish diagnostic tools, assess immunological and pathological responses and define risk 5 factors for COVID-19 (3) (4) (5) (6) . Clustered outbreaks and superspreading events of SARS-CoV-2 pose a particular challenge to pandemic control (7) (8) (9) (10) . However, we still know comparatively little about the fundamental underlying properties of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution and transmission dynamics within the human population.\nDuring its sweep across the globe, the 29.9 kb-long SARS-CoV-2 genome has accumulated 10 mutations at a rate 2-3 fold lower than those for the SARS, MERS and influenza A viruses (11) . Acquired fixed mutations enable phylogenetic analyses and have already led to important insights into the origins and routes of SARS-CoV-2 spread (12) (13) (14) (15) . Conversely, low frequency mutations and their changes over time within individual patients offer deep insights into the dynamics of intra-host evolution. The resulting viral quasispecies represent 15 diverse groups of variants with different frequencies that form structured populations and maintain high genetic diversity, contributing to fundamental properties of infection and pathogenesis (16, 17) .\nWith a population of 8.8 million people, Austria is located in the center of Europe and 20 operates a highly developed health care system that utilizes a national epidemiological surveillance program. As of June 15 th 2020, contact tracing was performed for all 17, 082 reported cases that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 6,287 cases could be linked to 502 epidemiological clusters (18) (Methods) . Due to its prominent role in international winter tourism, Austria has been implicated as a superspreading transmission hub across the 25 European continent. Tourism-associated spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Austria may be responsible for up to half of all imported cases in Denmark, Norway and a considerable share of cases in many other countries including Iceland and Germany (12, 19, 20) .\nIn this study we phylogenetically and epidemiologically reconstructed major SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters in Austria and analyzed their role in transcontinental virus spread. 30\nMoreover, we combined our deep viral genome sequencing data with epidemiologically identified chains of transmissions and family clusters together with biomathematical analyses to study genetic bottlenecks and the dynamics of genome evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Our results provide fully integrated genetic and epidemiological evidence for continental spread 5 of SARS-CoV-2 from Austria and establish fundamental transmission properties of the SARS-CoV-2 in the human population."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Phylogenetic-epidemiological reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters in Austria 5 We sequenced 576 SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples from cases originating from different geographical locations across Austria. The main focus was on the Austrian provinces of Tyrol and Vienna (Fig. 1A) , given that these two regions led to numerous positive cases (Fig. S1A) (18) . The samples presented in this study capture the first phase of the outbreak (mid-February to mid-March 2020) as well as the peak of infections in Austria (Fig. 1A) , and 10 cover a balanced sampling across multiple epidemiological and clinical parameters including age, sex and viral load ( Fig. S1B-C) . Samples from both swabs (nasal, oropharyngeal) and secretions (tracheal, bronchial) were included, in order to investigate not only the evolutionary dynamics within the population, but also within individuals (Fig. S1D) . We assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, constructed phylogenies and identified low 15 frequency mutations based on high-quality sequencing results with >5 million reads per sample and >80% of mapped viral reads (Fig. S2A-B) . Our pipeline was validated by experimental controls involving sample titration and technical sample replicates ( Fig. S2C- "}, {"section_title": "E).", "text": "To investigate the link between local outbreaks in Austria and the global pandemic, we 20 performed phylogenetic analysis of 305 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Austrian cases (>96% genome coverage, >80% aligned viral reads) and 7,695 global genomes from the GISAID database (Fig. 1B, Table S1 ). Our analysis revealed six distinct phylogenetic clusters defined by fixed mutation profiles that were mainly present in the Tyrol region (Tyrol-1, Tyrol-2, Tyrol-3) and in Vienna (Vienna-1, Vienna-2, Vienna-3) (Fig. 1B) . These 25 clusters are related to the global clades 19A, 20A, 20B and 20C (Fig. S3A) . Our largest phylogenetic cluster, \"Tyrol-1\" (Fig. S3B) , whose cases are closely linked to the ski-resort Ischgl, was assigned to clade 20C (Fig. 1B) . This clade is predominantly populated by strains from North America (Fig. S3A) .\nIntegration of the phylogenetic analysis of Austrian SARS-CoV-2 sequences with 30 epidemiological data from contact tracing resulted in strong overlap of these two lines of evidence (Fig. 1C, Table S2 ). All sequenced samples from the epidemiological cluster A mapped to the relatively homogenous phylogenetic cluster Vienna-1 (Fig. 1C) with an index patient with reported travel history to Italy. Of note, both clusters Tyrol-1 and Vienna-1 6 originate from crowded indoor events (i.e. Apr\u00e9 Ski bar; spinning class), by now known origins for superspreading events.\nThe epidemiological cluster S, which includes resident and travel-associated cases to the skiresort Ischgl or the related valley Paznaun, largely mapped to the phylogenetic cluster Tyrol-5 1 (Fig. 1C) . While different SARS-CoV-2 strains circulated in the region of Tyrol, this data suggests that the epidemiological cluster S originated from a single strain with a characteristic mutation profile leading to a large outbreak in this region (Fig. 1D) . To elucidate the possible origin of the SARS-CoV-2 strain giving rise to this cluster, we searched for strains matching its mutation profile among global SARS-CoV-2 sequences 10 ( Fig. 1D-E, Fig. S3C ). We found that all strains in clade 20C matched the mutation profile of the Tyrol-1 cluster in our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1E, Fig. S3C ). To reveal possible transmission lines between European countries at that time, we performed phylogenetic analysis using all 7,675 high-quality European SARS-CoV-2 sequences sampled before March 31 that were available in the database GISAID. Using this approach, we identified 15 several samples matching the Tyrol-1 cluster mutation profile from a local outbreak in the region Hauts-de-France in the last week of February (Fig. 1E, Fig. S3C ) (21) . Introduction events of this SARS-CoV-2 strain to Iceland by tourists with a travel history to Austria were reported as early as March 2 (Fig. 1E, S3C ) (12), indicating that this strain was already present in Ischgl in the last week of February. These findings suggest that the emergence of 20 the cluster Tyrol-1 coincided with the local outbreak in France (Fig. 1E) and with the early stages of the severe outbreak in Northern Italy (22) . The viral genomes observed in the Tyrol-1 cluster were closely related to those observed among the Icelandic cases with a travel history to Austria (Fig. S3D-E) (12). Vice versa, many of the Icelandic strains with a \"Tyrol-1\" mutation profile had reported an Austrian or Icelandic exposure history (Fig. S3F) . 25 Together, these observations and epidemiological evidence support the notion that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Austria propagated to Iceland. Moreover, the emergence of these strains coincided with the emergence of the global clade 20C (Fig. S3C) . One week after the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 strains with this mutation profile in France and Ischgl, an increasing number of related strains based on the same mutation profile could be found 30 across continents (Fig. 1E) where they established new local outbreaks, for example in New York City (13). As a popular international destination attracting thousands of tourists from European countries and overseas, Ischgl may have played a critical role as transmission hub for the spread of clade 20C strains to Europe and North America (Fig. S3G-H) . 7 Dynamics of low frequency and fixed mutations in clusters Next, we sought to gain insights into the fundamental processes of SARS-CoV-2 infection by integrative analysis of viral genomes. Mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Austrian cases revealed that more than half of the observed substitutions were non-5 synonymous, with the most frequent non-synonymous mutations occurring in nsp6, ORF3a and ORF8 (Fig. S4A-B ). An analysis of the mutational signatures in the 7,695 global strains and the Austrian subset of SARS-CoV-2 isolates showed a non-homogeneous mutational pattern dominated by C>U, G>U and G>A substitutions (Fig. S4C) . Moreover, we observed increased mutation rates in the 3' and 5' UTRs ( Fig. S4D) . We found that 30% of the 10 positions in the genome (9, 194 total positions) harbored variants among the sequenced strains from Austria and we identified mutational hotspots for both high and low-frequency mutations ( Fig. 2A, Fig. S5A alleles being fixed in more than three samples and exhibiting a frequency <0.50 in at least two other samples ( Fig. 2A) . We confirmed the non-homogeneous mutational pattern of fixed mutations in our low-frequency data, suggesting that the same biological and evolutionary forces are at work for both types of mutations ( Fig. S5C-E) ."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "Based on our phylogenetic analysis, we found a sub-cluster inside the phylogenetic Tyrol-1 cluster, defined by a fixed non-synonymous G>U mutation at position 15,380 (Fig. 2B) . This mutation is absent from most of the other Austrian cases but was detected at low and intermediary frequencies in other cases of the Tyrol-1 cluster. Interestingly, around the emergence of this mutation, sequences sharing the same mutational profile (i.e. Tyrol-1 25 haplotype and G>U at position 15,380) appeared in other European countries including Denmark and Germany (Fig. 2C) . Similarly, a synonymous fixed C>U mutation at position 20,457 defines a subcluster inside the phylogenetic Vienna-1 cluster (Fig. 2D) . Potential functional effects of this mutation are unknown although it is predicted to slightly alter the locally stable RNA region with a destabilized central fold ( Fig. S6C-D) . The cases from this 30 subcluster intersect with members of two families (families 1 and 7) (Fig. 2E , see also 8 Conversely, four members of family 7, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 16 th and 22 nd , were epidemiologically assigned to cluster AL and also show a fixed U nucleotide at position 20,457 ( Fig. 2D-E) . This data indicates the emergence of a fixed mutation within a family, and provides phylogenetic evidence to link previously disconnected epidemiological clusters. Together, these results from two superspreading events (Tyrol-1, 5\nVienna-1) demonstrate the power of deep viral genome sequencing in combination with detailed epidemiological data for observing viral mutation on their way from emergence at low frequency to fixation. Impact of transmission bottlenecks and intra-host evolution on SARS-CoV-2 mutational 10 dynamics The emergence and potential fixation of mutations in the viral quasispecies depend on interhost bottlenecks and intra-host evolutionary dynamics (23, 24) . To test the individual contributions of these forces, we first investigated the transmission dynamics between known pairs of donors and recipients by inferring the number of virions initiating the infection, also 15 known as the genetic bottleneck size (23, 25) . Our set of SARS-CoV-2 positive-tested cases comprised twenty-three epidemiologically confirmed donor-recipient pairs (Fig. 3A, Fig.   S7A ). Using a beta-binomial method to quantify the bottleneck size (25), we found a median bottleneck size of 514 virions (ranging from 3 to greater than 5000) (Fig. 3B) . The observed relatively large bottleneck size of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the stability of mutation 20 frequencies across transmissions (Fig. S7A ).\nNext, we investigated the dynamics of intra-host evolution by using time-resolved viral sequences from nine longitudinally sampled patients. These patients were subject to different medical treatments and four of them succumbed due to COVID-19 related complications 25 (Table S3) . We observed diverse mutation patterns across individual patients and time (Fig.   3C, Fig. S7B ). Samples from patients 2, 3, and 10 showed a small number of stable lowfrequency mutations (\u2265 0.02 and \u22640.50), while patients 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 exhibited higher variability including the fixation of individual mutations (Fig. 3C, Fig. S7B ). The patientspecific dynamics of viral mutation frequencies may indicate influences of both host-intrinsic 30 factors such as immune responses and overall state of their health as well as extrinsic factors such as different treatment protocols. Finally, we examined the genetic distance between samples obtained across donor -recipient pairs and serially acquired patient samples. This analysis revealed that genetic divergence was greater between the consecutive samples within 9 individual patients than during inter-host transmission (Fig. 3D) , suggesting that viral intrahost evolution has a potentially strong impact on the landscape of fixed mutations."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Unprecedented global research efforts are underway to match the rapid pace of the COVID-5 19 pandemic around the globe and its pervasive impact on health and socioeconomics. These efforts include the genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 to track viral spread and to dissect the viral genome as it undergoes changes in the human population. Here, we leveraged deep viral genome sequencing in combination with national-scale epidemiological workup to reconstruct Austrian SARS-CoV-2 clusters that played a substantial role in the 10 international spread of the virus. Notably, our time-resolved study shows how emerging lowfrequency mutations of SARS-CoV-2 become fixed in local clusters with subsequent spread across countries, thus connecting viral mutational dynamics within individuals and across populations. Exploiting epidemiologically well-defined clusters and families, we were able to determine the inter-human genetic bottleneck for SARS-CoV-2, i.e. the number of virions 15 that start the infection and produce progeny in the viral population, at around 10 1 -10 3 . Our quantified bottlenecks are based on a substantial number of defined donor-recipient pairs and in agreement with recent studies implying larger bottleneck sizes for SARS-CoV-2 compared to estimates for influenza A virus (23, (26) (27) (28) (29) . These bottleneck sizes correlate inversely with higher mutation rates of influenza virus as compared to SARS-CoV-2. Of note, estimates of 20 viral bottleneck size are likely influenced by many parameters including virus-specific differences and stochastic evolutionary processes (29) . Successful viral transmission also depends on other factors including the rate of decay of viral particles, availability of susceptible cells, the host immune response and co-morbidities (23, 30) . To better understand the mechanisms at work, future investigations will need to probe these factors in the context 25 of viral intra-host diversity across body compartments and time (31) (32) and assess how the underlying viral population structures act together and influence genome evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (33, 34) .\nThis study underscores the value of tightly integrated epidemiological and molecular 30 sequencing approaches to provide the high spatiotemporal resolution necessary for public health experts to track pathogen spread effectively. This enables the retrospective identification of SARS-CoV-2 chains of transmissions and international hotspots such as the phylogenetic cluster Tyrol-1 (15, (35) (36) (37) . Our data also show that all but cluster Tyrol-2 carry 10 the prevalent D614G mutation in the S protein (38), supporting the notion of multiple introduction events to Tyrol. Moreover, our phylogenetic analysis of cluster Vienna-1 allowed us to uncover previously unknown links between epidemiological clusters. This observation was subsequently confirmed by extended contact tracing, demonstrating deep viral genome sequencing directly contributes to public health efforts. 5\nThe time has come to implement the technical capacities and interdisciplinary framework for prospective near real-time tracking of SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters by integrating approaches which combine viral phylogenetic and epidemiological evidence as well as possible complementary data such as serological testing (39) . Such inter-disciplinary 10 platforms will be particularly relevant for the prevention of superspreading events and the assessment of the effectiveness of pandemic containment strategies in order to improve the preparedness for anticipated recurrent outbreaks and resurgences of SARS-CoV-2 as well as future pandemics (40). Sequencing data processing and analysis Following demultiplexing, fastq files containing the raw reads were inspected for quality criteria (base quality, N and GC content, sequence duplication, over-represented sequences) using the FASTQC (v. 0.11.8) (42). Trimming of adapter sequences was performed with BBDUK from the BBtools suite (http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools). Overlapping read 5 sequences in a pair were corrected for with BBMERGE function from the BBTools.\nRead pairs were mapped on the combined Hg38 and SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) using the BWA-MEM software package (v 0.7.17) (43). Only reads mapping uniquely to the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome were extracted. Primer sequences were removed after mapping by masking with iVar (44) . From the viral reads BAM file, the consensus 10 FASTA file was generated using the Samtools (v 1.9) (45) #102024, Twist Biosciene) were titrated in increasing ratios (0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 90%, 20 100%) and subjected to cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification as described. These controls are important for assessing the limit of low frequency detection across samples. RNA was extracted and processed independently from sample CeMM0001 to serve as a technical control for PCR processing. Amplicons from the CeMM0008 sample were sequenced twice in order to assess the potential biases introduced by the sequencing step. "}, {"section_title": "Phylogenetic analysis and inference of transmission lines 15", "text": "Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the Augur package (version 7.0.2) (51). We compiled a randomly subsampled dataset of 7695 full length viral genomes with high coverage (<1% Ns) that were available from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/, 2 nd of June) and 305 sequences obtained in this publication. Sequences from GISAID were filtered for entries from human hosts with complete sampling dates. Metadata information for patient age 20 and sex were excluded from the analysis. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) were performed using mafft (52). A masking scheme for homoplasic and highly ambiguous sites was applied to avoid bias in the following phylogenetic analysis as discussed elsewhere [N.\nDe Maio, C. Walker, R. Borges, L. Weilguny, G. Slodkowicz, and N. Goldman, \"Issues with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data,\" virological.org.]. We reconstructed the phylogeny with the 25 augur pipeline using IQ-Tree (52) and further processed the resulting trees with treetime to infer ancestral traits of the nodes (53) . Phylogenetic trees were rooted with the genome of \"Wuhan-Hu-1/2019\". The same workflow was repeated for phylogenetic reconstruction of all high-quality European strains before March 31 st 2020 available in the GISAID database by June 7 th 2020 (7675). Clade annotations for global trees were adapted from nextstrain.org 30 (https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/config/clades.tsv), clusters of Austrian strains were identified based on shared mutation profiles and patient location from epidemiological data. 14 "}, {"section_title": "Mutational profiles", "text": "Inter-host mutations were reconstructed using the augur pipeline to infer nucleotide changes at the internal nodes (51) .

The mutational profile was obtained as the normalized count of the number of mutations in each of the 192 trinucleotide changes. To account for the genomic composition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus we also divided 10 each triplet probability by the total number of available triples in the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. For the intra-host analysis, the process to obtain the mutational spectra panels was the same as intra-host but using the low frequency variant calling output (3090 mutations across 404 Austrian samples with alleles frequencies between 0.05 and 0.5). The mutational profile was computed following the same rationale as for the inter-host variants. 15"}, {"section_title": "Genome-wide mutation rate analysis", "text": "We aimed to assess whether the variation in the rate of single nucleotide substitution along the SARS-CoV-2 genome can be solely explained by its tri-nucleotide composition. We devised a statistical test performing local estimations of the deviation from the expectation of the observed number of mutations with respect to the expected based on the tri-nucleotide 20 composition of a particular region of the genome. We first counted the total number of nonprotein affecting mutations (i.e., synonymous variants and upstream/downstream gene variants) that has been observed across sequenced viral genomes of infected individuals. The focus on non-protein affecting mutations aims to lessen the potential positive selection bias derived from their effect into the coding parts of the viral genome. We did not consider 25 mutations in masked sites (see filtering of mutations for further information about masked sites). We next assigned to each reference nucleoside a probability of mutation of the three alternatives based on its tri-nucleotide context (5' and 3' nucleosides) and the relative probability of mutation derived from the 7,695 samples from GSAID. Then we performed N (N=10 6 ) randomizations of the same number of observed mutations distributing them along 30 the SARS-CoV-2 genome according to their mutational probability. Protein-affecting mutations were not randomized, and masked sites were not available to the randomization.\nWe then divided the 29,903 bp of the viral genome into 10 windows of 1kb (except the last 15 window with 903 bps). Analogously, in the zoom-in analysis, we divided the first and last 1kb window of the viral genome into 10 windows of 100 bp. For each window we estimated the mean and standard deviation number of simulated mutations within the window. Finally, for each window we estimated the deviation from the expectation using a log-likelihood test (i.e., G-test goodness of fit), where we compared the observed number of mutations in the 5 window versus the mean simulated number."}, {"section_title": "RNA secondary structure prediction", "text": "To address the question whether mutations that have been observed in the Austrian SARS-CoV-2 samples have an influence on the RNA structure of the virus we performed 10 computational predictions at the secondary structure level with the ViennaRNA package (54) .\nWe started with characterizing locally stable RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome NC 045512.2 with RNALfold. We required that the underlying sequences were not longer than 150 nt and we targeted thermodynamic stability by selecting only regions whose free energy z score was at least -3 among 1000 dinucleotide shuffled sequences of the same 15 sequence composition. This approach yielded 386 locally stable RNA secondary structures spread throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were then intersected with 12 unique fixed mutations found in Austrian samples, i.e. positions 241, 1059, 3037, 12832, 14408, 15380, 20457, 23403, 24642, 25563, 27046, and 28881-28883 . This approach resulted in seven hits which were subsequently analyzed in detail. We performed single sequence 20 minimum free energy (MFE) structure predictions for both the reference and the mutation variants. In addition, we assessed for each region the level of structural conservation within a set of phylogenetically related viruses. Here we were particularly interested in finding evidence for covariation in stacked helices. Typical covariation patterns are compensatory mutations, i.e. cases where a mutation in one nucleotide is compensated by a second mutation 25 of its pairing partner, such as a GC base-pair being replaced by an AU pair. Likewise, consistent mutations comprise cases where only one nucleotide is exchanged, thereby maintaining the base-pair, e.g. GC to GU. We characterized orthologous regions in selected Sarbecovirus species with Infernal (55), produced structural multiple sequence nucleotide alignments with locARNA (56) and computed consensus structures with RNAalifold (57) . In 30 addition, each block was analyzed for structural conservation by RNAz (58) .\nBottleneck estimation. 16 We first set out to estimate the transmission bottleneck sizes for each donor-recipient pair.\nOur analysis is based on the beta-binomial method presented in Leonard et al (25) .

If multiple samples were obtained on the same day, the sample with lowest Ct value was considered. Note that the time-consecutive pairs had differing number of days between samples. To these genetic distances obtained from the shared variants we added the sum of the frequencies of the variants detected in only one of the pairs of shared samples; i.e.\nwe calculated the l1-norm of the variant frequencies. Statistical difference between the 5 genetic distances from transmission pairs versus consecutive pairs from serially sampled patients, was determined by a Wilcoxon (one-sided) rank-sum test.\nH\u00f6rmann for providing samples and Tobias Pahlke for support with computing cluster.
