To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the association between AC medication use and neuroimaging biomarkers of brain metabolism and atrophy as a proxy for understanding the underlying biology of the clinical effects of AC medications.\nOBJECTIVE To assess the association between AC medication use and cognition, glucose metabolism, and brain atrophy in cognitively normal older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS).\nThe ADNI and IMAS are longitudinal studies with cognitive, neuroimaging, and other data collected at regular intervals in clinical and academic research settings. For the participants in the ADNI, visits are repeated 3, 6, and 12 months after the baseline visit and then annually. For the participants in the IMAS, visits are repeated every 18 months after the baseline visit (402 cognitively normal older adults in the ADNI and 49 cognitively normal older adults in the IMAS were included in the present analysis). Participants were either taking (hereafter referred to as the AC + participants [52 from the ADNI and 8 from the IMAS]) or not taking (hereafter referred to as the AC \u2212 participants [350 from the ADNI and 41 from the IMAS]) at least 1 medication with medium or high AC activity. Data analysis for this study was performed in November 2015.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cognitive scores, mean fludeoxyglucose F 18 standardized uptake value ratio (participants from the ADNI only), and brain atrophy measures from structural magnetic resonance imaging were compared between AC + participants and AC \u2212 participants after adjusting for potential confounders. The total AC burden score was calculated and was related to target measures. The association of AC use and longitudinal clinical decline (mean [SD] follow-up period, 32.1 [24.7] months [range, 6-108 months]) was examined using Cox regression.\nThe 52 AC + participants (mean [SD] age, 73.3 [6.6] years) from the ADNI showed lower mean scores on Weschler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory Immediate Recall (raw mean scores: 13.27 for AC + participants and 14.16 for AC \u2212 participants; P = .04) and the Trail Making Test Part B (raw mean scores: 97.85 seconds for AC + participants and 82.61 seconds for AC \u2212 participants; P = .04) and a lower executive function composite score (raw mean scores: 0.58 for AC + participants and 0.78 for AC \u2212 participants; P = .04) than the 350 AC \u2212 participants (mean [SD] age, 73.3 [5.8] years) from the ADNI. Reduced total cortical volume and temporal lobe cortical thickness and greater lateral ventricle and inferior lateral ventricle volumes were seen in the AC + participants relative to the AC \u2212 participants.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The use of AC medication was associated with increased brain atrophy and dysfunction and clinical decline. Thus, use of AC medication among older adults should likely be discouraged if alternative therapies are available.\nQuestion Is use of anticholinergic medication associated with poorer cognition, brain hypometabolism, brain atrophy, and/or increased risk of clinical decline in cognitively normal older adults?\nFindings In this longitudinal study of 2 cohorts of cognitively normal older adults, use of medications with medium or high anticholinergic activity was associated with poorer memory and executive function, brain hypometabolism, brain atrophy, and increased risk of clinical conversion to cognitive impairment. This finding was greatest for those taking drugs with the most anticholinergic activity.\nMeaning Use of medication with significant anticholinergic activity should likely be discouraged in older adults if alternative therapies are available.

However, given the importance of the cholinergic system in cognition, researchers speculate that direct impairment of cholinergic neurons may underlie these effects. In fact, previous studies 21, 22 using scopolamine hydrobromide, a cholinergic antagonist, have shown transient cognitive impairment in young and older adults. A recent study 23 suggested that administration of AC medications modulates the association between brain volume and cognition. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of regular AC medication use on neuroimaging measures of brain structure and function in cognitively normal (CN) older adults.\nThe goal of the present study was to assess AC medication use in CN older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In particular, we sought to evaluate whether cognitive performance, brain glucose hypometabolism, structural brain atrophy, and clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and/or Alzheimer disease (AD) were associated with the use of AC medication. We also completed a similar analysis in an independent cohort of CN older adults from the Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS). We hypothesized that participants taking AC medications (hereafter referred to as AC + participants) would show poorer cognition, reduced glucose metabolism, brain atrophy, and increased clinical decline relative to those not taking AC medications (hereafter referred to as AC \u2212 participants) and that these effects would be greatest in those with the highest total AC burden score."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI (http://adni.loni.usc.edu; for more information, see the eAppendix in the Supplement, http://www.adni-info.org, and previous reports [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] ).

The effect appeared additive because an increased burden of AC medications was associated with poorer executive function and increased brain atrophy. Similar effects were seen in an independent cohort of older adults. These results suggest that medications with AC properties may be detrimental to brain structure and function, as well as cognition. The observed findings support previous reports 1- 16 regarding the association between AC medication use and cognitive impairments, with a significant effect of AC medication use on executive and immediate, rather than delayed, memory. We also found that the increased clinical progression from CN to MCI and/or AD was associated with AC medication use.\nThis study is one of the first, to our knowledge, to examine in vivo brain structural and functional differences between CN participants taking medications with medium or high AC activity and CN participants not taking these medications. We observed that AC + participants had reduced brain glucose metabolism and increased brain atrophy compared with AC \u2212 participants. Furthermore, those with the highest total AC burden scores showed the most atrophy.\nThe increased brain atrophy and decreased brain function that we observed may be linked to the central effects of AC medications on cholinergic pathways within the brain. Cholinergic pathways, especially those extending from the basal fore-brain, are important for cognition. 42 Studies have suggested that AC medications may affect cognition by altering cholinergic inputs, with a study 23 showing that AC medication administration leads to an uncoupling between brain structure and cognition in older adults. The process by which AC medications might lead to neurodegeneration is less clear. Cholinergic receptor antagonists have been shown to induce cell death, 43 while increased cholinergic neurotransmission reduces neurodegeneration in an AD mouse model. 44 Decreased cholinergic activity due to AC medications may induce synaptic loss and neurodegeneration in regions with significant cholinergic innervation, namely the MTL and cortex. 45 In mice, lesioning or damaging cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain has been shown to cause degeneration of the septal-hippocampal and basalo-cortical projections and neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. 46 Another possibility is that participants taking AC medications may be more sensitive to neuronal damage in response to stress. This hypothesis centers around the interaction of cholinergic systems and stress because MTL cholinergic neurons have been shown to regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. 47 Reduced cholinergic ac- The total AC burden score was significantly associated with both cognition and brain atrophy.

However, future longitudinal studies with imaging and other brain biomarkers, as well as in animal models, are needed to more fully understand the mechanism underlying the effect of AC medications on the brain.\nThere are a few notable limitations to this study. First, the information on medication use was based on self-report rather than directly ascertained through medical/prescription records. Self-report could be inaccurate because participants may forget to report specific medication use. However, given the normal cognitive status of the participants at baseline, it is unlikely that they would have reported taking medications that they were, in fact, not taking. Thus, the observed effect is potentially underestimated because some AC \u2212 participants may in fact have been taking an AC medication. Future studies using medical/ pharmacy records, along with imaging and biomarker measures, would help to confirm the findings of the present study.\nA second limitation is the relatively small sample size of AC + participants. Future studies using larger samples are warranted. A third limitation is the inability to determine the cau-sality of the findings because the results may be due to poor health rather than AC medication use. 49 We did include common comorbid health conditions (eg, vascular and psychiatric conditions), total number of medications, and total number of comorbid conditions as covariates. However, the only way to determine true causality would be by use of a wellcontrolled prospective longitudinal study.\nAnother limitation may be the variability in the duration of AC medication use among participants. Furthermore, a participant who had taken an AC medication for many years but ceased shortly before the baseline visit would not be captured as an AC + participant. Future studies with a better-controlled medication history assessment (ie, using medical/pharmacy records and patient self-report) are warranted, as well as studies on the effect of the duration of AC medication use on the target outcomes. Finally, only structural MRI and FDG PET were assessed in the present report. Future studies examining changes on more advanced imaging measures (ie, diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state or task-based functional MRI) would provide additional evidence about the selective effect of AC medications on the brain structure and function in specific circuits."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, we observed that CN older adults taking medications with medium or high AC activity showed poorer cognition, reduced cerebral glucose metabolism, increased A, A significant association between AC use and future progression of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants to mild cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer disease was observed (P = .01; hazard ratio [HR], 2.47; with total number of medications, cardiac surgery, total number of comorbid conditions, and other psychiatric conditions as additional covariates).
