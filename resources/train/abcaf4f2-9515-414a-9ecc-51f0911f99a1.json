[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The purpose of this study was to analyze and explore the effectiveness of constructivism approaches in improving mathematical communication skills of junior high school students in the city of Paser. The experimental quasi method was used in this study to test the hypothesis of the study. The sample of the study at three junior high schools in Paser City, representing high, medium and low school students.. The instruments used in this study were pre-post test, pre-post questionnaires, and observation. The data were analyzed using independent sample t-tests, paired sample tests, annova tests, and descriptive analysis. The findings of pre-post test and prepost questionnaire analysis using t-test showed that there were significant differences in group mathematical communication skills using constructivism approach compared to groups using conventional approaches at all achievement levels of high school students (high, simple and low). Based on the observation, it is found that high achievement school students have good mathematical communication skills in mathematical communication, these are identified in many aspects and observation indicators achieved by students during learning. where Indonesia ranked 36th (Gurria, 2013) . In other words, the mastery of mathematics in Indonesian students has decreased scores according to the results of the TIMSS survey. In addition, the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) report found that Indonesia ranked 64th out of 65 countries participating in mathematical literacy tests with a score of 375, still below the international average of less than the 500 score (Gurr\u00eda, 2013).\nAccording to a study conducted by Nur Izzati (2012) stating that the decline in the learning process at various levels of the school, especially in Indonesia, is due to the overloading of curriculum so learning is focused only on the improvement of curriculum targets. In addition, mathematical learning is less concerned with the development of mathematical communication skills, so that the efficiency of these skills is still low. As the Fauzan (2008) shows that the ability to communicate in mathematics is still weak among the students.\nThe empirical state of the above studies is in line with the findings of earlier studies that researchers have undertaken in June 2017 to grade VII students at one of the national standardized junior high schools in Paser City, which shows that the students have not been able to apply the wide-the kite they have just learned in solving the questions given. Almost all students who participated in the study, did not understand how to solve the problem and put forward the solution using the right mathematical language. The questions being tested for the students are very simple contextual problems, but contain a lot of information. It aims to see students' skills in understanding the problem.\nAccording to Nur Izzati (2012) in his study, low math communication skills among students need to be taken seriously. Because until now learning does not pay attention to the development of this competency. Therefore, we must strive to acquire learning approaches that can provide students with learning experiences, and provide space for students to practice learning to communicate well, and provide space for students to practice communicating well in mathematical subjects. The constructivism approach is an approach that conforms to all of the conditions stated above. Constructivism is a more focused approach to students, who in their learning process explain how knowledge is structured in the minds of students (Hanafiah Nanang and Sucana Suhana, 2009). In the constructivism approach it is found to be the result of the student's own efforts and not only transferred from the teacher to the student. This means that students are no longer sticking to the old teaching and learning concepts, where teachers only deliver or transfer knowledge to students without prior effort from their own students.\nHowever, these studies are more likely to be on the achievement and learning outcomes achieved by the students and no studies on the \nIn this study, the quasi-experimental design was used to test the hypothesis of the study. Experimental quasi designs are usually used to replace actual experiment studies when samples can not be randomly distributed (Chua, 2006) . In this study, researchers were unable to make random distributions due to constraints to timetables and the use of existing classes set by school administrators. Random distribution will cause problems of timetable and class changes that involve many students and teachers and can disrupt the process of teaching and learning in schools. In addition, students are also comfortable with the existence of their respective classes since the beginning of the year. Sudden class changes will pose a threat to internal validity as students are forced to adapt to the environment and new friends.\nThis study uses pre-test and non-equivalent control group design.\nAccording to Sugiyono (2013) Non-equivalent Control Group Design is roughly the same as pretest-posttest control group design, only in this design the treatment group and control group are not randomly selected. In this design, whether treatment groups or control groups are given the same treatment, even if the group is selected and placed without going through random. Two groups were given pre-test, then given treatment, and last \nPopulation is a generalization area consisting of: objects / subjects that have certain characteristics and characteristics established by the investigator to be studied and then make a conclusion (Sugiyono, 2013) . In this study population is all high school students (junior high school) in Bandar Paser class VII. The population should be carefully determined and studied so that the review decisions may give appropriate impact to the results of the study. Therefore, the reason for the selection of junior high school students as a population is to be grounded in a preliminary review that the reviewer The sample of the study was the seventh grade students in three junior high schools in Paser City, representing high, medium and low schools respectively, according to the decision of the head of Paser's education department. Thereafter from each of the schools selected 1 class as the treatment group and 1 class as the control group, so the total is 6 classes.\nInstruments are used to collect data according to the purpose of the study. In this study, the researcher used several research instruments including Comparison of post-test in treatment and control groups at high achievement schools was carried out to answer the first questionnaire which is that there is a significant mean difference score for the achievement of mathematical communication skills in treatment groups and control groups assessed from high achievement schools.\nThe effectiveness of constructivism approaches to enhancing mathematical communication skills is identified through student reactions.\nThree study questions have been submitted for this purpose. In high achievement schools, the results of the t-test showed that there was a significant increase in student response to the constructivism approach in improving mathematical communication skills. In simple achievement schools, the results of t-test analysis showed that there was a significant increase in student response to the constructivism approach in improving mathematical communication skills. At low achievement schools, the results of t-test analysis showed that there was a significant increase in student response to constructivism approach in improving mathematical communication skills.\nThis finding shows that learning using constructivism approaches can improve students' mathematical communication skills compared with conventional learning."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In mathematics learning there are some mathematical skills that must be owned by the students. One such mathematical skill is communication skills. The importance of communication skills in mathematics can be seen from the objectives of the curriculum in Indonesia namely the Education Unit Level Curriculum (KTSP) in 2006 that the mathematical learning taught in schools is intended to enable students to communicate ideas with symbols, Hadijah schedules, charts or other media to clarify the situation or problem . Next is the expected skills in mathematical learning ie the concept understanding, the logical element, the problem solving and the importance of mathematics (Dediknas, 2006) . The mathematical objectives and skills described in the KTSP are in line with the general objectives of mathematical learning as outlined by the National Council of Teacher of Mathematics (NCTM, 2000) , namely: (1) learning to communicate, (2) learning to think, 3) developing students' skills to solve mathematical problems, (4) learning to connect ideas, (5) forming positive attitudes towards mathematics. From the objectives of KTSP and NCTM shows that mathematical communication is one of the key skills that must be developed in every mathematical topic. Therefore, mathematical learning at school should pay attention to the development of this skill.\nHowever Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in recent years has shown that the achievement of students in mathematics and science has dropped dramatically. In 2011 TIMSS reported that the mastery of Indonesian mathematics and science was ranked 38th with a score of 386 out of 42 countries taking the test (Mullis, Martin, and Foy, 2011) . This result dropped in comparison to TIMSS report in 2007, where Indonesia ranked 36th (Gurria, 2013) . In other words, the mastery of mathematics in Indonesian students has decreased scores according to the results of the TIMSS survey. In addition, the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) report found that Indonesia ranked 64th out of 65 countries participating in mathematical literacy tests with a score of 375, still below the international average of less than the 500 score (Gurr\u00eda, 2013 ).\nAccording to a study conducted by Nur Izzati (2012) stating that the decline in the learning process at various levels of the school, especially in Indonesia, is due to the overloading of curriculum so learning is focused only on the improvement of curriculum targets.

Meanwhile, according to Creswell (2012) mix-methods is a research approach that combines or associates qualitative and quantitative forms."}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "In this study, the quasi-experimental design was used to test the hypothesis of the study.

The disadvantage of this design is to have more threats to internal validity than actual experiments because random selection is not run (Creswell, 2008) . To see more in depth the effectiveness of the constructivism learning approach in improving mathematical communication skills, this study examines the factors of the school level (high, medium, low). As for this study, a school level will be placed in accordance with the decision of the Head of Paser City Education Office.\nAccording to Creswell (2008) a quasi-experimental study was used when researchers wanted to see the relationship between cause and effect between variables. In this study, there are three variables, ie dependent variables, independent variables, and control variables. The dependent variables in this study are the students' mathematical communication skills, the independent variables are learning with constructivism and conventional approaches, and control variables at the school level."}, {"section_title": "Population and Sample", "text": "Population is a generalization area consisting of: objects / subjects that have certain characteristics and characteristics established by the investigator to be studied and then make a conclusion (Sugiyono, 2013) .
