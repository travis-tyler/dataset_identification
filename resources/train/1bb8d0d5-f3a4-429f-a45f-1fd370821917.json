DESIGN Scores calculated from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) and Braak criteria were correlated with measures of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in 197 participants who underwent autopsy after death and who had undergone 2 or more oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) using grouped analyses and a continuous mixed-models analysis. The same measures of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were also correlated with brain \nThe correlation of brain markers of AD, including CERAD score, Braak score, and 11 C-PiB retention, with serum markers of glucose homeostasis using grouped and continuous mixed-models analyses.\nWe found no significant correlations between measures of brain AD pathology or 11 C-PiB \u03b2-amyloid load and glucose intolerance or insulin resistance in subjects who had a mean (SD) of 6.4 (3.2) OGTTs during 22.1 (8.0) years of follow-up. Thirty subjects with frank diabetes mellitus who received medications also had AD pathology scores that were similar to those of the cohort as a whole.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this prospective cohort with multiple assessments of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, measures of glucose and insulin homeostasis are not associated with AD pathology and likely play little role in AD pathogenesis.

Some studies have shown excess cognitive impairment and lower cognitive performance in subjects with diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance, [1] [2] [3] [4] especially in those with poor control of glucose levels, 5 whereas others have not. 6, 7 In the Rotterdam Study, initial work indicated that diabetes was associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of a clinical diagnosis of dementia and AD, 8 although subsequent findings did not confirm the initial report. 9 The Religious Orders Study 10 and the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Registry 11 reported an increased risk of AD in subjects with diabetes, and the recent Hisayama Study 12 correlated an increased risk of developing AD with 2-hour postload glucose values. These studies, in combination with recent evidence that long-term intranasal insulin administration during a 4-month period improved cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment and early AD, 13 have established that the relationship among diabetes, insulin values, and AD is an important area of investigation. 14 Whether cognitive impairment seen in patients with diabetes is mediated by excess pathological features of AD or other related abnormalities, such as vascular disease, remains unclear. 15 In addition, few studies have addressed the relationships between longitudinal changes in measures of glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance and AD pathology or brain \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) burden.

We translated CERAD scores (0, A, B, and C) into a linear numeric scale (0, 1, 2, and 3) to allow statistical analysis. In addition, we generated a composite AD pathology score by summing the CERAD and Braak scores in equal measure. For this latter analysis, CERAD scores were divided into the following 3 groups: 1 indicates 0 or mild neuritic plaques; 2, moderate neuritic plaques; and 3, frequent neuritic plaques. Braak scores were divided into the following 3 groups: 1 indicates Braak stages 0, I, and II; 2, Braak stages III and IV; and 3, Braak stages V and VI. The sum of the modified Braak and CERAD scores yielded a composite score ranging from 2 to 6.

Of these, 186 had insulin levels measured at least once during the OGTT. The characteristics of these participants are given in Table 1 . Participants were divided into 3 equal-sized groups based on mean lifetime fasting or 120-minute glucose, insulin, or insulin resistance values ( Table 2) . Insulin resistance was calculated using the HOMA technique. None of the characteristics detailed in Table 1 differ significantly among any of these groups, including the number of OGTTs, the years covered, or the rate of dementia (not shown). No significant differences in any measure of AD pathology was seen between groups stratified on the basis of glucose, insulin, or insulin resistance values, even when the mean fasting and 120-minute glucose, insulin, and HOMA values taken from multiple OGTTs covering a mean (SD) period of 22.1 (8.0) years before death were markedly different among the groups ( Table 2 ). The continuous mixed-models analyses (rather than a grouped analysis) of the relationship between glucose, insulin, or insulin resistance values and AD pathology and controlling for sex and age at death showed no significant association between AD pathology and any measure of glucose or insulin homeostasis (Supplement [eTable 1] ). An analysis based on the rates of change of fasting and 120-minute postload glu- cose, insulin, and HOMA values during the lifetime of the participants and using linear mixed models also showed no differences in participants with low, medium, or high AD pathology scores (data not shown).

As given in Table 3 , when the 53 subjects were divided into 2 equally sized groups based on mean lifetime fasting or 120-minute glucose, insulin, or insulin resistance values, no significant difference in mean cortical 11 C-PiB retention was seen.

Similarly, we did not find an association between a clinical diagnosis of dementia and hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia. Our results concur with other studies that found no association between diabetes mellitus and AD pathology, 27,28 and we extend these observations more broadly to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. The strengths of our study are its prospective nature, the large number of well-characterized participants, and the multiple OGTTs obtained more than 20 years before death. These serial assessments allow us to determine the effect of prolonged burdens of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance on pathological findings in the brain. Although glucose and insulin levels measured even earlier in life than those in the present study might better predict AD pathology or dementia, our analyses of OGTTs performed at younger ages also revealed no association with AD pathology or 11 C-PiB retention, suggesting that glucose intolerance does not affect AD pathology even at its earliest stages.\nLimitations of the present study include the method for determining insulin resistance, which is calculated rather than determined by an insulin clamp procedure, 29 and our pathological assessments of AD, which are semiquantitative rather than quantitative and do not include immunostaining for A\u03b2 and tau. In addition, participants in our study are a sample of convenience, not an epidemiologically representative group, and have access to high-quality health care. Thus, they are unlikely to have experienced prolonged periods of severe hyperglycemia. In view of a recent study suggesting that cognitive changes in diabetes may be related to the severity of prolonged hyperglycemia, 5 we may have underrepresented that population. Our results disagree in part with the study of Matsuzaki and colleagues, 30 who found differences in 2-hour postload glucose and HOMA values in subjects with no AD pathology at autopsy compared with those who had any degree of Table 2 . a The cohort of 53 participants who had 11 C-PiB scans and 2 or more oral glucose tolerance tests were divided into 2 groups with nearly equal numbers of participants based on mean lifetime fasting or 120-minute postload glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (HOMA) values. Only 47 participants underwent determination of insulin values. Differences between the groups were assessed using analysis of variance. Unless otherwise indicated, data are expressed as mean (SD). AD pathology at death. Differences in cohort size, composition, and intensity of testing may account for these disparate findings.\nOur data certainly do not preclude insulin therapy (or endogenous insulin) from having a beneficial effect on cognition independent of its effects on AD pathology. Moreover, the effects of insulin may vary in subjects with and without dementia. 31 In our cohort, the number of participants taking exogenous insulin was small, limiting any direct test of the hypothesis. Second, the effect of insulin on the brain is complex and not confined to A\u03b2 precursor protein processing and A\u03b2 production. Such effects include growth factor regulation, gene transcription, and protection against oxidation. 32, 33 Moreover, insulin may have effects downstream of A\u03b2 deposition. Finally, insulin resistance within the brain itself may not correlate with peripheral measures of insulin resistance. 34 Given that AD is likely more than just A\u03b2 accumulation, 35 long-term therapeutic trials are important to elucidate this issue."}]
