[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract\nBackground"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Immuno-senescence and 'Inflammaging' are characterized by a low grade chronic proinflammatory state associated with ageing, which results from an imbalance between the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory networks (1) (2) . The Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) have a major role in mediating the chronic inflammatory pathway in autoimmune disease via antigen presentation to the CD4+/8+ T cells (3) . The HLA complex has long been associated with autoimmune disorders and infectious disease (4) . Examples of associations between certain HLA types and autoimmune disease include HLA-B*27 and spondyloarthritis (SpA), HLA-B*51 and Behcet's disease (5) , and HLA-DRB1*15:01 and multiple sclerosis (6)(7). Many autoimmune diseases directly impact on muscle strength and physical functioning, however autoimmune diseases are generally not monogenic or fully penetrant, but rather are complex polygenic diseases influenced by environmental factors (despite having over 110 linked genes, excluding HLA types, the heritability of multiple sclerosis is approximately 28% (8) ). We hypothesise therefore that both those with diagnosed auto-immune conditions and carriers of certain HLA types without diagnosed autoimmune diseases may have increased risk of age related conditions. Sarcopenia, loss of muscle mass and strength during ageing, is associated with reduced physical functioning and is associated with increased risks of morbidity (including falls and fractures) and mortality (9) (10) . The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) defines age-related Sarcopenia to include both low muscle mass and low muscle function (9) . The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) found evidence that this can occur as early as age 40 in both men and women (11) , with progressive decline over time. However studies of age-related sarcopenia commonly use an age range of 60 or older, to exclude causes of muscle weakness earlier in life (12) . Previous studies have presented evidence for the role of inflammation in sarcopenia (13) (14) , and it is becoming apparent that Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/gerona/glz042/5321878 by University of Exeter user on 27 February 2019 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t contributors to disease vary in penetrance from Mendelian disorders to complex diseases (15) . We hypothesise that certain HLA types may increase risks for sarcopenia, possibly via undiagnosed or subclinical autoimmune processes. While muscle loss is a classical feature of multiple sclerosis and some other autoimmune conditions, little is known of whether carrying certain HLA types predisposes to autoimmunity which in turn accelerates muscle loss in later life.\nWe aimed to test associations between diagnosed autoimmune conditions and sarcopenia in the exceptionally large UK Biobank study. We also aimed to test associations between common HLA types and sarcopenia in individuals independently of any diagnosed autoimmune condition, using three definitions of sarcopenia (European Working Group on Sarcopenia definition published in 2010; Low grip strength and lean muscle mass combined, grip strength only and lean muscle mass only). We hypothesise that the presence of certain HLA types are more common in sarcopenic individuals in later life, even in the absence of diagnosed autoimmune disease.

The UK Biobank is a volunteer study where participants visited one of 22 assessment centres across the UK. A range of physiological and questionnaire data was collected, including genetic data from blood draws (17) . Genotyping data was generated on the initial ~50,000 participants using the Affymetrix UK BiLEVE Axiom array and the ~450,000 participants of the remaining cohort were genotyped using the Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom array -the two arrays sharing over 95% similarity (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk)."}, {"section_title": "Phenotype definitions", "text": "Sarcopenia was classified using the EWGSOP definition (9), based on having both low hand grip strength and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI).

We aimed to determine whether HLA-types were associated with sarcopenia in the absence of diagnosed autoimmune disease, and we therefore excluded participants with a diagnosis at the baseline assessment (self-reported or hospital diagnosed). A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t A list of 135 (including sub-groups) ICD-10 codes for autoimmune diseases were generated from previous review articles (20) and the codes used to exclude participants from the initial analysis (Supplementary Table 1 ). In addition, UK Biobank self-reported data was also used based on the autoimmune conditions in the ICD-10 list. Following the initial analysis an additional 55 autoimmune diseases associated with the HLA types were added to the exclusion criteria and formed the basis of the secondary analysis (Supplementary Table 2 ). Table 10 for details)."}, {"section_title": "HLA imputation", "text": "Imputation of HLA types was performed centrally by the UK Biobank team. In brief, HLA*IMP:02 (21) was used to impute the four-digit HLA types from genotype information, with a number of modifications: localization feature turned off; graph sampling error (mS) and graph building error (mB) probabilities were both set to 0.001; and the number of sampled haplotype pairs was set to 5 (22) . Individuals are therefore coded as 0, 1 or 2 depending on the number of HLA alleles carried for each gene. The methods allow for imprecise coding (e.g. 1.92) to indicate the confidence in HLA type imputation. Some HLA type codes indicate unknown or other HLA types (e.g. *99:01), and these were not included in analyses. HLA-types below 1% frequency were excluded from analyses to account for lower quality imputation for rarer alleles.

Cohorts were restricted to the age range 60 to 70 and of European descent. Participants with known autoimmune disease were excluded as previously described, based on Hospital Episode\nStatistics data (ICD-10 codes) and self-reported fields.\nHLA types were modelled first assuming an additive effect, and secondly comparing participants with 2 alleles to those with 0. Participants with imprecise HLA imputations were recoded for the second, categorical analysis (i.e. estimated allele dose between 0 and 0.25 set to 0, values between 0.75 and 1.25 set to 1, and finally between 1.75 and 2 to 2; other doses were set to missing due to imprecise imputation). Correction for multiple testing was applied using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, for the additive and recessive models separately as these were independent hypotheses. Statistical analyses were performed in STATA (v14.1) and R (v3.3.2). Charts and figures were generated with package metafor (v2.0).\nAfter analysing each HLA type for its association with sarcopenia we performed a literature search to identify any autoimmune diseases implicated by the significant HLA types not already included in the autoimmune exclusion criteria. HLA type associations with sarcopenia were reanalysed after participants with a diagnosis of these further autoimmune conditions had been excluded (Supplementary Table 2 ); these are the final results presented.\nA c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t"}, {"section_title": "Sex specific cohort analysis", "text": "HLA types associated with the three definitions of sarcopenia was analysed with sex-specific cohorts, after the removal of participants with autoimmune conditions.

However, the three protective HLA-types associated with the sarcopenia grip definition were nonsignificant after adjusting for height and weight (p > 0.05) in the combined cohort. In the Table 6 )."}, {"section_title": "Non-coding SNPs associated with a phenotype in previous Genome-Wide Association", "text": "Studies.\nThe HLA types assessed so far were based on the protein-coding sequence of the HLA protein expressed. We also investigated non-coding SNPs within the HLA region that have previously been associated with traits in the GWAS catalogue; SNPs in the HLA region (4) between GRCh. After excluding those with autoimmune diagnoses, the remaining 181,301 participants had a mean age of 64.1 years and 95,340 were female (Table 2) . Of 85,961 men included in the analysis, 3,510 were defined as having sarcopenia (4.08%), and of 95,340 women there were 11,540 defined as sarcopenic (12.10%).\nOf 100 HLA types with allele frequency >1%, six were associated with sarcopenia (EWGSOP definition) in logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, genotyping array type, and population structure (genetic principal components 1-5), after accounting for multiple testing (FDR<5%) (Figure 1 Seven HLA-types were associated with the sarcopenia definition based on grip strength alone, and six were associated with the sarcopenia muscle mass definition, with no overlap between the alleles associated with the two phenotypes (Figure 1 and Supplementary "}, {"section_title": "Sex specific analysis", "text": "We tested for interactions between HLA types and sex on sarcopenia. Two HLA types, HLA-DQA*03:01 (p=0.032) and HLA-DRB1*04:04 (p=0.038), were nominally associated with sarcopenia (EWGSOP combined definition); indicating that the effect of these HLA types is significantly greater in females, compared to males. The other interactions were not significant, although we cannot rule out lack of statistical power due to the relatively low numbers of men with sarcopenia (Supplementary Table 5 ). "}, {"section_title": "Non-coding Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in HLA region", "text": "We analysed 658 non-coding SNPs (frequency \u2265 1% in order to li it the number of statistical tests undertaken and to avoid misclassification from lower quality imputation for rarer A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t We interrogated the GTEx eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) database of SNPexpression associations to determine the likely genes affected by these 4 genetic variants (Table 3 , see Supplementary Table 9 for full details), using a stringent significance threshold (25) and found that rs41268896 is highly correlated (R 2 =0.8 in UKB) with rs8111, a pQTL for ATF6A.\nWe also investigated the combined effect of the 4 non-coding SNPs; participants with at least 4 effect alleles (of a possible 8), showed an increased likelihood of sarcopenia of 11% (n= 74,820 participants of 181,301; OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08-1.15, p=1.06*10 -9 ).\nA c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t (26), the individual studies varied considerably and it was not unusual to observe substantial sex differences. We performed sex-stratified analysis of HLA-types and found that all observed associations were only statistically significant in females, and for some this sex-interaction was statistically significant, suggesting that the effect of HLA-DQA1*03:01\nand HLA-DRB1*04:04 are substantially greater in females compared to males. Unfortunately the study lacked the power required for the male only cohort to observe Odds Ratios within the ranges seen in the combined sex analysis.\nWe also identified 4 non-coding genetic variants in the HLA region of chromosome 6 associated with sarcopenia. These are known to affect the expression of multiple genes, When taken in combination participants with more than four of the effect alleles had an 11%\nincreased likelihood of sarcopenia.\nThe EWGSOP 2010 definition of sarcopenia (27) , which combines low grip strength and low muscle mass, shares many of the associated HLA alleles with those seen in low grip strength definition alone. In contrast, there is little overlap with the low muscle mass definition. Often, grip strength alone is used to identify \"frail\" participants in population studies (28) This type was protective against low grip strength and reported as associated with a multiple sclerosis-like condition in transgenic mice (37) . HLA alleles were only associated with low muscle mass using the additive model, C*01:02 and B*27:05, both of which have previously been linked to forms of arthritis -psoriatic arthritis (38) and spondyloarthritis (39) . Neither In our analysis of non-coding genetic variation in the HLA-region we identified 4 genetic variants associated with sarcopenia. These SNPs also affect expression of genes other than HLAs, including ATF6B, which encodes a transcription factor in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and there has been speculation that ER stress may impair autophagy and myogenesis activity resulting in sarcopenia (40) (41). rs41268896 is strongly correlated with the rs8111 (R 2 =0.8), known to affect protein levels of ATF6A (25), which binds as a heterodimer with ATF6B. The rs41268896 A allele increases ATF6B expression, whilst the rs8111 T allele (co-inherited) decreases ATF6A protein levels, suggesting a complex relationship; more work is required to understand this. The BAG6 protein product is also involved in elimination of misfolded proteins, including class-I HLA products (42) (43) . CYP21A2 has a role in producing cortisol and aldosterone as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, disruption to the HPA has been linked to decline in physical function and aging (44)(45).\nThe strengths of this study include the large number of older participants with consistent sarcopenia measurements and medical records data available for analysis. However, it is a volunteer study and will therefore be healthier than the general population: effects of HLA types on sarcopenia may therefore be underestimated in this study. Given the biologically plausible and strong association between autoimmune diseases and sarcopenia, our finding in the autoimmune diagnosis free group are also plausible. Although all reported associations passed multiple statistical testing correction our results, especially in men, do require independent replication, as the effects observed may vary between cohorts, although sample size requirements for replication will be challenging.
