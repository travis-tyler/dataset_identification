Since 1973, direct payments to agricultural producers have been a vital instrument for supporting that goal.\n1 Whether agricultural subsidies actually benefit farmers, however, is an open question. Non-farmers, individuals who do not currently farm any land, own and rent out nearly half of all farmland in the United States. Standard economic theory predicts that subsidies accrue entirely to land owners. Agricultural subsidies may not benefit farmers if non-farmer landlords are able to adjust rental rates to capture the subsidies paid to agricultural producers.\nIn the United States, agricultural subsidies are a significant transfer program. The standard model of agricultural subsidy incidence predicts that, due to the extremely inelastic supply of agricultural land, landowners receive the entire benefit of the subsidy. This model is widely used by economists to explain the effects of agricultural subsidies (e.g., Schultze, 1971; Schmitz and Just, 2002) . 3 According to this model, non-farmers, who own 94 percent of rented farmland and 42 percent of all U.S. farmland, reap a substantial share of the benefits from agricultural subsidies.\nSurprisingly little evidence substantiates this model. In spite of a large literature examining the capitalization of subsidies into farmland values, the proportion of the marginal subsidy dollar captured by landowners remains unknown. Rosine and Helmberger (1974) attempt to address this question by simulating producer surplus with and without agricultural policy. They conclude that 92 cents of every dollar generated by farm programs accrues to the landlord. However, fundamental aspects of their simulation model have been questioned (Gisser, 1993; Alston and James, 2002) , and modern farm programs, which began in 1973, differ from those examined by Rosine and Helmberger. Instead of estimating the subsidy incidence, the previous literature typically assumes full incidence on land and estimates either the elasticity of land value with respect to subsidies (Traill, 1982; Goodwin and Ortalo-Magne, 1992) , the rate at which future subsidies are discounted (Weersink, et al., 1999; Lamb and Henderson, 2004) , or the proportion of land value attributable to subsidies (Featherstone and Baker, 1988; Herriges, et al., 1992) .\nIn contrast, I directly investigate the incidence of agricultural subsidies by examining the response of farmland rental rates and tenants' net returns to exogenous agricultural subsidy changes while accounting for several potential sources of bias (see Roberts et al., 2003, for early work in this area). By law, farm operators receive the subsidy directly. Under cash lease arrangements, tenants receive the subsidy check; landlords extract the subsidy to the extent that rental rates rise with the subsidy. Thus, landlord and tenant incidence are measured by the extent to which rental rates and net operating returns, respectively, rise with the marginal subsidy dollar. In this paper I test the standard theory that landlords capture the full subsidy by testing whether rental rates rise dollar-for-dollar with subsidies and whether subsidies do not affect tenants' net returns.\nAs per-period prices, farmland rental rates respond primarily to innovations in expected returns in the current period, including exogenous policy-induced subsidy changes. Three policy changes provide the exogenous subsidy variation this paper uses to estimate the landlord-tenant division of the subsidy dollar. First, the 1996 Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act altered the relative subsidy rate among crops, resulting in subsidy variation due to historic crop choice rather than current behavior. Another source of bias may arise when the relevant subsidy measure, the expected subsidy when rental rates are set, is unavailable to the analyst. Prior to the 1996 FAIR Act, subsidy rates depended on post-harvest commodity prices, which were unknown when rental agreements were made in the spring. The difference between the realized subsidy used in the analysis and the expected subsidy considered when setting rental rates, i.e., the \"expectation error,\" results in measurement error-style attenuation bias. The FAIR Act solves this problem by divorcing subsidies from commodity prices, making subsidies knowable by tenants and landlords when setting rental rates. I use the post-FAIR Act subsidy as an instrumental variable to address the expectation error problem.\nContrary to the standard model's predictions, this paper finds that only 20 to 25 cents of the marginal subsidy dollar are reflected in increased rental rates, whereas tenant net returns rise by 70 to 75 cents. Accounting for nearly the full subsidy dollar with these two largely independent estimates provides confidence in an approximately 25/75 landlord-tenant split of the marginal subsidy dollar.\nAlthough previous research assumed full subsidy incidence on the landowner, characteristics of the farmland market, such as imperfect competition and social norms, suggest why this may not be the case. Farm consolidation and growth results in fewer tenants who may enjoy increasing market power in the farmland rental market. Landlords, who forgo the use value of the land without a tenant, may implicitly share the subsidy to attract tenants. I test this possibility using measures of rental market concentration and demonstrate that the landlord's incidence increases when the rental market becomes more competitive. Social norms and fairness also might play an important role in the division of the subsidy dollar.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 details the institutional facts about the farmland rental market and subsidy policy. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 lays out the empirical strategy employed in this investigation, emphasizing the identifying assumptions. Section 5 presents the incidence on landlords and tenants and provides evidence of the robustness of the estimated incidence. Section 6 explores the short and long-run incidence.

For the reasons listed above, namely unobserved heterogeneity and the substantial importance of local production shocks, the specification remains the same. Since net returns are realized after the subsidy payment, expectation error is not a concern, and I do not instrument for the subsidy variable.\nThe coefficient on government payments from this regression, reported in table 2 column 5, is 0.80 with a robust standard error equal to 0.059. Recall that renters own about a third of the land they farm and consequently receive the entire subsidy dollar on those acres. Accounting for this in the 0.80 net returns incidence implies that tenants receive about 70 cents of the marginal subsidy dollar on rented land. 20 In other words, nearly the entire subsidy dollar on a rented acre of land can be accounted for as either a 21-cent increase in the rental rate or a 70-cent increase in the tenant's net returns.

Short-run Response: Emergency Legislation in 1998 and 1999", "text": "The surprisingly low rental rates incidence might result from landlords preemptively adjusting rental rates in anticipation of the 1996 policy change. The emergency legislation passed in 1998 and 1999 provides a unique opportunity to observe the short run effect of unanticipated subsidies on farmland rental rates. I investigate this using the 1999 AELOS, which contains financial information on a sample of 26,553 farms. I create a dataset of the [1997] [1998] [1999] change by merging these data with the 1997 Census of Agriculture. I estimate equation (3') using data from the resulting 5,587 farms. 24 The 1999 AELOS provides data on total government payments. However, according to administrative data, in 1999 land subsidies accounted for only half of government payments. I address this measurement error with a second instrument, derived from administrative data: the county-level average subsidy per acre. This IV strategy precludes the use of time-varying county effects in the estimation. However, since rental rates are set prior to, and independently of, local shocks, the model may not be misspecified by omitting the time-varying county effect.

This section considers possible exceptions to the underlying assumptions of the farmland incidence model. I examine the role of competition in the less-than-perfect incidence finding and suggest the possible role of social norms.\nImperfectly competitive rental markets may play a role in these findings. Although landlords potentially could receive the subsidy on unrented, idle land, without a tenant, they would forgo the use-value of the land. 26 Landlords may have low reservation rents since agricultural land has few alternatives outside farming. In a market with many landlords and few renters, the landlords may implicitly share the subsidy dollar in an attempt to attract tenants.\nTo examine the hypothesis that rental market concentration affects the landlord's ability to extract the subsidy, I interact the farm-level subsidy with a county-level rental market concentration measure and include it in the main specification. I measure rental market concentration with two Herfindahl indices. One index defines market share over total county 26 Prior to the 1996 FAIR Act landlords could not directly receive subsidies on idle, unrented land. 27, 28\nThe effect of market concentration on rental rate incidence is reported in table 6. Column 2 reports how the incidence changes as rental market concentration varies. A 0.01 increase in the expenditure Herfindahl causes the incidence to fall by 0.035, and a 0.01 increase in the acreage Herfindahl leads to a 0.11 drop in the incidence. These estimates imply a 0.02-0.05 fall in the rental rate incidence due to average concentration growth between 1992 and 1997. Column 1 reports the incidence as the market approaches perfect competition. The incidence estimate increases substantially, approaching 0.34, when concentration, as measured by the acreage Herfindahl, goes to zero. Incidence increases to 0.29 as the expenditure Herfindahl goes to zero.\nImperfectly competitive rental markets appear to play a role in the lower-than-expected rental rate incidence.\nSocial norms, such as custom, trust, and fairness, also may play a role in the incidence.\nCustom, which affects the structure of farmland rental contracts (Young and Burke, 2001) , might limit landlords' ability to extract rent. Tenant-landlord relationships are typically long term, 27 In the analysis, where the Herfindahls are averaged over tenants rather than counties, the mean ( allowing trust to play a role. 29 Robison et al. (2001) report that farmland sales prices are 6-7 percent lower when there is trust between the buyer and the seller.

The remaining 10 cents may be extracted by other input providers or may be lost due to measurement error.\nThe approximately 25/75 landlord-tenant subsidy split holds across farm sizes and across regions in the U.S. The same pattern holds immediately following a subsidy change and in the medium to long-run.\nUltimately, farm policy appears to accomplish its stated purpose to increase farmers'\nincome.
