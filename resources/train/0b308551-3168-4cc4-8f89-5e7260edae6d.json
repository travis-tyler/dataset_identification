[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Cancer commonly occurs in the elderly and immunotherapy (IT) is being increasingly applied to this population. However, the majority of preclinical mouse tumor models assessing potential efficacy and toxicities of therapeutics use young mice. We assessed the impact of age on responses to systemic immune stimulation. In contrast to young mice, systemic cancer IT regimens or LPS given to aged mice resulted in rapid and lethal toxicities affecting multiple organs correlating with heightened proinflammatory cytokines systemically and within the parenchymal tissues. This inflammatory response and increased morbidity with age was independent of T cells or NK cells. However, prior in vivo depletion of macrophages in aged mice resulted in lesser cytokine levels, increased survival, and decreased liver histopathology. Furthermore, macrophages from aged mice and normal human elderly volunteers displayed heightened TNF and IL-6 production upon in vitro stimulation. Treatment of both TNF knockout mice and in vivo TNF blockade in aged mice resulted in significant increases in survival and lessened pathology. Importantly, TNF blockade in tumor-bearing, aged mice receiving IT displayed significant anti-tumor effects. These data demonstrate the critical role of macrophages in the age-associated hyper-inflammatory cytokine responses to systemic immunostimulation and underscore the importance of performing preclinical assessments in aged mice. \nThe Journal of Experimental Medicine\nCytokine-mediated toxicity with aging | Bouchlaka et al.\nthe increased morbidity, as TNF blockade resulted in partial protection from these lethal systemic toxicities and pathology. Application of TNF blockade also led to successful adminis tration of IT while preserving antitumor responses in aged mice. These data indicate that aging results in a heightened predisposition to inflammatory responses by macrophages, which leads to increased susceptibility to multiorgan pathol ogy upon challenge.\nAnti-CD40 and IL-2 IT results in markedly increased mortality and multiorgan pathology in aged but not young mice We have previously shown the IT regimen using an agonist antiCD40 monoclonal antibody in combination with IL2 to synergize and induce complete regression of metastatic renal cancer in young mice (2-3 mo old; Murphy et al., 2003) . As this is roughly equivalent to treating teenage to collegeage individuals, we wanted to ascertain whether this IT regimen can be applied to the human cancer scenario with regard to age, so we investigated whether this IT regimen was efficacious"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "During normal aging, there are significant alter ations in immune functions and tissue responses to stimuli. Aging is associated with a lowgrade proinflammatory state and a diminished capacity to mount specific adaptive immune responses resulting in susceptibility to pathology after in fectious episodes (Boparai and KorcGrodzicki, 2011) . Immunotherapy (IT) in the treatment of cancer has recently resulted in significant clini cal responses and is being increasingly applied (Dougan and Dranoff, 2009) . However, as can cer also predominantly occurs within the el derly population (Repetto and Balducci, 2002) , these immune alterations that occur with aging potentially also render cancer patients more likely to be susceptible to systemic toxicities after application of systemic IT or in response to infection (Repetto and Balducci, 2002; Br\u00fc\u00fcnsgaard and Pedersen, 2003; Ferrucci et al., 2005; Franceschi, 2007; Chung et al., 2009) . Elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cyto kines, such as IL1\ue061, IL1\ue062, IL6, and TNF, have been observed with increasing age and are be lieved to be due to an agerelated redox im balance that activates multiple proinflammatory signaling pathways (Franceschi et al., 2000; Br\u00fc\u00fcnsgaard and Pedersen, 2003; Ferrucci et al., 2005; Chung et al., 2009) . The mechanisms underlying the causes and contributors to the agerelated proinflammatory state remain unclear. Of concern is that the majority of preclinical studies assessing potential immunotherapeutic regimens use younger mice, which likely fail to replicate human clinical cancer treatment conditions with regard to age. Therefore, understanding the impact of age on IT responses and outcome is critical as sig nificant toxicities can be observed with systemic IT (McInnes et al., 1997; Suntharalingam et al., 2006; Waldmann, 2006; Berger et al., 2009; Attarwala, 2010; Di Giacomo et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2012) .\nOur studies demonstrate that as opposed to young mice, applying systemic IT in aged mice resulted in rapid and lethal responses due to the induction of a proinflammatory cyto kine storm and multiorgan pathology. The elevated cyto kine responses occurred with numerous immunostimulatory regimens with proinflammatory cytokine production being mediated by macrophages.

The livers of aged ITtreated mice demonstrated extensive patchy piecemeal necrosis throughout the entire liver (Fig. 1 D) . Intestines of aged treated mice showed chronic acute segmental enteritis with extensive mucosal damage, loss of normal villi, and ulceration associated with acute cryptitis (Fig. 1 F) . Interestingly, untreated aged mice revealed a preex isting state of mild inflammation even before IT (Fig. 1 C) that was not present in young mice (Fig. 1 B) .\nWe also assessed the effects of other IT regimens. Compa rable agerelated effects on pathology and serum alanine ami notransferase (ALT) were also observed when aged mice were treated with an IL2/IL12 IT regimen (Fig.1, G and H) , previously demonstrated to induce potent antitumor effects in young mice (Wigginton et al., 1996 (Wigginton et al., , 2001 . These data indi cate that the dramatic induction of a cytokine storm, resulting in induction of antitumor effects in aged tumorbearing recip ients. However, when we treated aged (>16 mo of age) tumor bearing mice, all the mice rapidly succumbed to the IT within 2 days of regimen administration (unpublished data). To further investigate the ITinduced toxicities with age, we assessed the ef fects of IT in nontumorbearing aged mice with antiCD40/IL2 IT to ascertain if this rapid mortality was intrinsically related to the age of the recipients. As before, this regimen resulted in a marked and rapid lethality within 2 d of treatment (Fig. 1 A) , whereas no mortality was observed in young adult mice.\nNecropsy of the aged recipients indicated multiorgan pa thologies in response to IT. Aged mice developed marked his topathological changes to the liver (Fig. 1 D) , lungs ( Fig. 1 E) , and gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 1 F) shortly after IT with peri portal lymphocytic aggregates in the liver (Fig. 1 D) , peribron chiolitis in the lung (Fig. 1 E) , and intramucosal lymphocytic Figure 2 .

These data demonstrate that strong systemic immune stimulation results in a lethal reaction that correlates with increased age.\nThe multiorgan pathology ( Fig. 1 ) and increased mortality (Fig. 2 , A-D) in aged mice that received antiCD40/IL2 IT correlated with markedly increased serum levels of the proin flammatory cytokines TNF, IL6, and IFN\ue067 (Fig. 2, F-I ). The levels of TNF, IL6, and IFN\ue067 after IT also directly correlated with increasing age (Fig. 2, F-I ). This cytokine storm associated with aging was not limited to IT, aged mice treated with LPS not only succumbed to LPS toxicity more rapidly (Fig. 2 E) but also demonstrated higher serum levels of TNF and IL6 compared with younger mice (Fig. 2 J) . Heightened serum levels of ALT, indicative of liver damage, were observed in both treated aged (Fig. 2 , K and L) and middleaged (Fig. 2 , M and N) mice.\nWe then compared the inflammatory cytokine levels both in the serum in and in the tissues. IT with antiCD40/IL2 resulted in marked increases in both the serum protein (Fig. 3 , A-C) and mRNA levels (Fig. 3, D-F) of TNF, IL6, and IFN\ue067 within the tissues of the liver, gut, and lungs compared with younger mice. Increase in TNF expression was the high est in the livers of aged mice, whereas IL6 expression was most increased in the gut and IFN\ue067 was elevated in all three organs, suggesting that different proinflammatory cytokines may play a more predominant role in a particular organ sys tem. These results demonstrate that the ITinduced mortality and pathology in aged but not young mice is associated with marked induction of proinflammatory cytokines affecting multiple organs correlating with the increased lethality.\nin multiorgan pathology and correlating with age after systemic immune stimulation, span a variety of regimens."}, {"section_title": "Systemic cancer IT or LPS results in increased proinflammatory cytokines and liver enzymes in aged mice", "text": "We then delineated as to when the mice developed this sensi tivity to IT. Using aged (>16 mo old) mice, antiCD40/IL2 IT resulted in a marked and rapid lethality within 2 days of treatment (Fig. 2, A and B) . Significantly increased mortality from antiCD40/IL2 was also observed in mice as young as 9 mo (middleaged; Fig. 2 , C and D). However, 6moold mice treated with the same regimen of antiCD40/IL2 sur vived the entire IT regimen, indicating that this was the cutoff for the heightened sensitivity (unpublished data). We have also observed similar results in survival, cytokine production, and pathology in aged BALB/c mice comparable to C57BL/6 data presented in Figs. 1 and 2, suggesting that ITinduced toxici ties and mortality were strain independent (not depicted).\nMortality from antiCD40 and IL2 was only observed after combination therapy, as mice receiving either agent singly sur vived the full IT regimen. IL2 and antiCD40 monotherapy led to an increase in serum IFN\ue067 and TNF, respectively, com pared with the control group; however, these cytokine levels were 7fold lower for IFN\ue067 and 50fold lower for TNF than the combination of antiCD40/IL2 (not depicted).\nThis increased pathological response to IT was not lim ited to the antiCD40 and IL2 regimen. In addition to this IT, aged mice treated with LPS, to mimic a systemic infection (Munford, 2006) , yielded similar heightened pathology as they also succumbed to LPS toxicity more rapidly (Fig. 2 E) Figure 3.

The absence of CD4 and/or CD8 T cells or NK cells in aged mice all resulted in comparable ITinduced mortality, organ damage (Fig. 4 , A and B), and cytokine induction (not depicted). However, macrophage depletion in aged mice resulted in significant and marked protection from ITinduced toxicities. Interestingly, improvement of pathology was primarily observed in the liver (Fig. 4, C and D) and not in the other organs, indicating"}, {"section_title": "Macrophages mediate the cytokine storm and mortality in aged mice", "text": "We have previously demonstrated that the antitumor effects of antiCD40/IL2 IT were mediated by marked expansion and activation of CD8 T cells, although NK cells also ex panded after treatment . CD8 T cells have also been shown to be the principal antitumor media tors of IL2/IL12 regimens (Wigginton et al., 2001) . To deter mine the immune cells responsible for the toxicities occurring in aged mice after IT, aged mice were first depleted of T cells At day \ue0323, certain groups were NK depleted (300 \u00b5g), CD4 T cell depleted (500 \u00b5g), CD8 T cell depleted (500 \u00b5g), or received all three depletions before the start (day \ue0323) of anti-CD40/IL-2 (n = 3-4).

To test this hypothesis, we treated aged WT and aged TNF KO, as well as aged IFN receptor (IFNR)-KO mice with IT, and observed that aged TNFKO mice were able to survive the entire IT regimen (Fig. 6 A) , whereas 50% of the IFNRKO mice succumbed to IT by day 12 of antiCD40/IL2 admin istration (Fig. 6 A) . This indicated a partial involvement of the IFN\ue067 pathway in toxicities of antiCD40/IL2, but that lethality in the aged is predominately dependent on TNF. Aged TNFKO mice also demonstrated diminished serum levels of IL6 (Fig. 6 B) as well as the expected lack of TNF ( Fig. 6 C) , indicating that TNF was at least partially respon sible for inducing IL6 in the cytokine storm. Interestingly, serum IFN\ue067 levels were increased in aged TNFKO mice compared with aged WT mice (Fig. 6 D) , whereas serum ALT that liver pathology was pivotal for the rapid mortality due to the cytokine storm. Macrophage depletion by LC in aged mice was also accompanied by a significant decrease in serum ALT (Fig. 4 E) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL6, and IFN\ue067; Fig. 4 , F-H), and resulted in 100% survival after IT (Fig. 4 I) . Depletion of peripheral macrophages was ascer tained by flow cytometry (Fig. 4 J) . Peritoneal lavage cells re covered from aged mice that were also macrophagedepleted demonstrated significantly lower TNF production upon LPS stimulation, which further demonstrated macrophages as the primary source of proinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 4 K) . These data indicate that macrophages, and not lymphocytes, are the major cell type responsible for the ITrelated toxicities in aged mice, and that the liver was the principal target organ responsible for mortality.\nMurine and human macrophages ex vivo-stimulated with LPS show an age-dependent increase in proinflammatory cytokine production To further examine the impact of age on the extent of cyto kine production by macrophages, BMderived macrophages (BMDMs) from young and aged mice were isolated and stim ulated with LPS. Macrophages from aged mice produced sig nificantly higher TNF and IL6 compared with young mice (Fig. 5 A) . Similarly, human PBMCs, derived from 37 healthy donors ranging from 28 to 95 years old which were differen tiated into macrophages in vitro (Zhang et al., 2008) and then stimulated with LPS, revealed a striking agedependent increase in their ability to produce TNF (Fig. 5 , B and D) and IL6 (Fig. 5, C and E) , suggesting that aging (or variables associated with aging) contributes to the increased proinflammatory status of macrophages. The data further suggest that targeting of macrophages may be a potential therapeutic option for sys temic immune stimulation, either induced by cancer thera pies or during acute sepsis, particularly in the elderly."}, {"section_title": "TNF-dependent liver toxicity in aged mice after IT", "text": "Given the strong correlation of proinflammatory cytokine levels with pathology in the aged mice, we next sought to ex amine their role in the agedependent toxicities observed after IT. Macrophage depletion, which allowed for protection from acute organ failure and lethality in the aged, led to sig nificant decreases in TNF and IL6 expression in particular. Pathological TNF and IL6 expression has been implicated in various systemic inflammatory conditions (Hack et al., 1989; Gantner et al., 1995; Leon et al., 1998; Taylor and Feldmann, 2009; Kr\u00fcttgen and RoseJohn, 2012) . We focused on TNF in these next studies as opposed to other elevated cytokines be cause of its involvement in a variety of systemic pathological conditions, as well as its pleiotropic effects on other cytokines including IL6 and IFN\ue067, which have been shown to be ele vated after IT as well (Boccoli et al., 1990; Blay et al., 1992; Vonderheide et al., 2007) . Furthermore, TNF is known to amplify IL6 production (Shalaby et al., 1989; Sheron et al., 1990; Aggarwal, 2003) ; therefore, we reasoned that TNF inhi bition might account for reductions in other inflammatory Figure 5 . Ex vivo LPS-stimulated mouse and human macrophages have increased TNF and IL-6 production in an age-dependent manner. (A) Young (4 mo) or aged (17-18 mo) C57BL/6 mice received PBS or LPS and on day 3, monocytes from the BM were isolated, differentiated into macrophages (BMDM), and ex vivo restimulated with either PBS or LPS for 24 h to assess TNF and IL-6 levels. (B-E) Monocytes derived from the PBMCs of 37 donors aging from 28 to 95 yr old were isolated and differentiated into macrophages over 10 d and were then stimulated for 48 h with 50 ng/ml LPS or PBS, and TNF and IL-6 production was assessed.

TNFKO mice given IT demonstrated a sig nificant decrease in hepatic necrosis (Fig. 6 , F and G) and serum ALT (Fig. 6 H) . These findings suggest that TNF plays a pivotal role in the induction of ITmediated mortality and, in partic ular, liver damage.

Due to exciting results using TNFKO mice, we were enthusiastic that TNF blockade for the ame lioration of cytokine storm-induced toxicities in the aged may be readily translatable using preexisting, clinically ap proved treatment options. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of TNF antagonists on ITmediated toxicities using etanercept (Enbrel). Although etanercept contains a human TNF receptor, murine and human TNF share an 80% homology and etanercept has been shown to decrease TNFmediated inflammation in mice (Grounds et al., 2005; Hodgetts et al., 2006; Hutchison et al., 2008; Surguladze et al., 2009; Nemoto et al., 2011) . To test this hypothesis, aged mice were treated with etanercept, which resulted in significant increases in sur vival after antiCD40/IL2 IT. TNF blockade with IT allowed for greater survival, as 50% of aged mice survived the IT regi men when it was combined with TNF blockade (Fig. 7 A) . This enhanced survival correlated with significant improve ment in liver pathology (Fig. 7 , B and E) in mice receiving combination treatment (IT/etanercept), which was concordant with decreases in serum ALT (Fig. 7 F) . Interestingly, no dif ferences were observed in the gut and lung pathology (Fig. 7 , C-E), regardless of TNF blockade in the aged mice, further demonstrating the pivotal role of TNF in mediating hepatic changes in aged mice after IT and also demonstrating that the liver was the primary cause for mortality after IT. Interestingly, at the dose administered, etanercept only offered minimal protection in conjunction with the highdose IT regimen (unpublished data).\nIn agreement with the TNFKO data, serum cytokines were also affected after TNF blockade as IL6 levels were di minished (Fig. 7 G) . The induction of IFN\ue067 in aged mice was not inhibited by TNF blockade (Fig. 7 H) . This may be important as it suggested that IFN\ue067-dependent antitumor effects may still be preserved, as we have previously demon strated that antitumor effects associated with antiCD40/IL2 in young mice are IFN\ue067-dependent . Moreover, serum TNF was diminished after etanercept but there were no significant differences in TNF production with or without TNF blockade (Fig. 7 I) , as this drug only antagonizes mechanism of action of TNF.\nFurthermore, we have noticed that TNF ablation using TNFKO mice or etanercept led to marked reductions in IL6 (Fig. 6 B and Fig. 7 G) , suggesting that TNF may also mediate toxicity through modulation of IL6 levels. To address this, we treated aged mice with IT with or without an IL6 blocking antibody or with etanercept. Both TNF blockade and anti-IL6 resulted in lower serum IL6 and TNF (Fig. 7 K) , yet that protection from liver pathology in aged mice was only ob served when IT was combined with TNF blockade and not anti-IL6 (Fig. 7 L) . These data indicate that TNF blockade may be of use to ameliorate toxicities in aged tumorbearing recipients after IT and possibly allow for antitumor effects to be maintained.\nIncreased survival in tumor-bearing aged mice using a TNF antagonist with IT Because of TNF's contradictory roles in the suppression and promotion of tumor progression (Carswell et al., 1975; van Horssen et al., 2006; Calzascia et al., 2007; Sethi et al., 2008; Balkwill, 2009) , it was imperative to determine whether ITinduced TNF, although critical to generation of systemic toxicities, may also be necessary for antitumor responses. Therefore, we next sought to ascertain if IT could be admin istered in aged tumorbearing mice in combination with etan ercept to prevent ITassociated mortality while preserving the antitumor effects induced by IT. Aged mice bearing the 3LL (J-L) Aged C57BL/6 mice (12 mo old) received on day \ue0321 either hIgG (1.5 mg/0.2 ml s.c.), or etanercept (Etan; 1.5 mg/0.2 ml s.c.), or anti-IL-6 antibody (1.0 mg/0.2ml i.p) with combination of low-dose anti-CD40/IL-2 (IT) on day 0.

A-C are representative of three independent experiments. treatments, they displayed (even at day 11 of therapy) increased systemic toxicities and multiorgan pathology as compared with youngtreated mice. However, organ histopathology, although elevated in aged IL2/IL12 mice, was slightly lower than what was observed in aged mice treated with antiCD40/IL2, which could be indicative of the reasons that IL2/IL12-treated mice did not die. Additionally, we have also noted marked dif ferences in histopathology on day 2 versus day 11 in young mice, and given that the mice treated with IL2/IL12 survived too and were analyzed for histopathology on day 11, the later time point may also contribute to the overt differences in pa thology observed in IL2/IL12 mice. Overall, these data sug gest that systemic toxicities are not antiCD40/IL2 specific but also occur with other cytokine therapies and with a dif ferent extent of fatality.\nGiven the plethora of recent data highlighting the role of microbiota in toxicity and disease (Arthur et al., 2012; Hooper et al., 2012; Gallimore and Godkin, 2013; Kamada et al., 2013) , it begs the question as to the role of differential microbiota among institutional animal facilities in our studies. Importantly, in this study, given that the work presented here was performed across multiple organizations and across multiple strains of mice, all three (antiCD40/IL2, LPS, and IL2/IL12) immuno modulatory regimens resulted in similar patterns of toxicity and 100% mortality by day 2 of therapy (for antiCD40/IL2) in aged mice across all institutions. This suggests that the sys temic toxicities observed in aged mice are independent on the animal housing conditions and any potential discrepancies that might arise from cleanliness of the animal facility or type of feed, all of which could affect intestinal microbiota.\nThe aged recipients not only produced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in circulation but also within the tissues where the damage was occurring. This was rapid, as death occurred within 2 d in aged mice. Interestingly, even mice as young as 9 mo succumbed to the toxicities. The lifespans of mouse and man are dramatically different. The average labo ratory mouse lives 2-3 yr, whereas the average human lives \ue07a80 yr. As the vast majority of mouse cancer studies use mice starting at 2-3 mo of age, this would be roughly equivalent to treating an adolescent or young adult patient whose im mune system is markedly different than an individual over the age of 55, the average age at which cancer is diagnosed and subsequently treated. Therefore, to more accurately re flect the typical cancer patient in the clinic, our data suggest that it may be more beneficial to perform preclinical studies in aged mice, particularly when attempting to accurately model toxicities.\nIn the immune cell depletion experiments, it was ob served that whereas T cells are the predominant tumor effec tor cell, the systemic cytokine storm and mortality in aged mice were all dependent on macrophages. This ageassociated dysregulation in macrophages was similar in humans, as it was observed that macrophages from both aged mice and humans exhibited heightened TNF and IL6 production after LPS stimulation compared with macrophages from young mice or younger healthy donors.\nLewis lung carcinoma were treated with antiCD40/IL2 IT and continuous etanercept administration. As observed earlier, aged tumorbearing mice that received IT alone died very rapidly from acute toxicity compared with aged mice receiv ing tumor alone (Fig. 8 A) . In contrast, aged tumorbearing mice receiving continuous etanercept administration demon strated 100% survival during an entire course of IT (12 d) and also resulted in significant antitumor effects with increased survival compared with mice receiving tumor alone (Fig. 8 A; death determined due to tumor upon necropsy, not depicted). This combination approach also resulted in CD8 T cell expan sion in the spleens of aged mice (Fig. 8 B) , as well as preserva tion of CD8 T cell lytic ability (Fig. 8 C) comparable to what was observed in young recipients . These data indicate that TNF blockade allowed for aged tumor bearing mice to receive effective IT resulting in increased sur vival, lessened toxicity, and preservation of antitumor responses."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Cancer IT has been shown to elicit successful antitumor re sponses both preclinically and clinically (Dougan and Dranoff, 2009 ). However, cytokine and antibody therapies can also lead to severe and systemic toxicities resulting in cessation of IT. Aging is associated with increased inflammation, poten tially rendering cancer patients more susceptible to these tox icities. The mechanisms of increased \"inflammaging\" are not well understood and the majority of preclinical studies testing new immunotherapies have been investigated using young mouse models. Given that the mean age of a cancer patient is greater than 55 years old, these mouse models do not reflect the potential profound immune changes occurring that result in immune senescence and normal aging.\nIn the current study, we compared the effects of agonistic antiCD40 and IL2, as well as other immunostimulatory regimens, on systemic toxicities in young and aged mice. Our results demonstrate a pronounced agedependent susceptibil ity to multiorgan toxicities after systemic immune stimulation resulting from a macrophagemediated cytokine storm. We also show that aging results in increased inflammatory cyto kine production leading to rapid mortality. Our data confirm that the fundamental process of inflammaging may serve as a predisposition to toxicities with age, indicating that application of systemic immune stimulation in the elderly must proceed with caution and demonstrating that increased susceptibility to toxicities from infectious agents may also result.\nThe rapid onset of mortality coupled with multiorgan tissue damage after IT in aged mice suggested that lethality may be associated with a systemic pathology similar to that ex perienced after sepsis or shocklike syndromes termed MODS (multiple organ dysfunction syndromes). Aged mice exhibited higher serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, in particu lar TNF, IL6, and IFN\ue067, upon antiCD40/IL2 stimula tion as well as after LPS treatment compared with young mice. We observed similar trends in organ pathology and serum liver enzymes in aged mice receiving IL2/IL12 IT as well. Although the aged mice did not succumb to IL2/IL12\nIn contrast to this clinical scenario, we show here that IT per haps need not to be halted, but application of antiTNF ther apies (and in combination with inhibition of other cytokines such as IL6) can be administered concurrently to alleviate toxicities while not adversely affecting antitumor responses.\nIt will be of particular interest to ascertain whether the increases of these proinflammatory cytokines associated with aging also occur after other cytoreductive insults such as che motherapy and radiation therapy. Age, outside of frailty, may also play predisposing roles in other disease states, such as in fectious disease, and toxicities, such as GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, due to the heightened proinflammatory state. Thus, aging strongly promotes inflam matory responses in both mouse and man, which can result in multiorgan pathologies after immune stimulation. This in flammatory sensitivity may predispose individuals after infec tion as well as cytoreductive cancer therapies to adverse events, but interventions affecting the cell types responsible (macro phages) or the inflammatory cytokines (TNF) themselves rep resent viable options. These studies underscore the importance of considering age as an important variable in the assessment of potential immunotherapies where the target population is predominantly aged."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice", "text": "Female young (2-4 mo old), middleaged (9-12 mo old), or aged (16-22 mo old) C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River or from the animal production area at the National Cancer Institute.

The endotoxin level of the antiCD40 was <1 endotoxin unit/mg antibody as determined by a quantitative chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate kit (Lonza). Recombinant human IL2 (rhIL2; TECIN Teceleukin; Roche) was provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Recombinant mouse IL12 (PeproTech) was purchased from commercial vendors. Etaner cept (Amgen and Pfizer) was provided by E. Maverakis. Some mice received human or rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) as a control\nThe critical role for TNF is at least a partial mediator of these effects, as was demonstrated by the TNFKO mice re ceiving IT exhibiting decreased serum IL6, TNF, liver en zymes (ALT), and having preferential protection from liver pathology. In agreement with our data, mice deficient to ei ther TNF or TNF receptors are less susceptible to endotoxic shock from highdose LPS challenge and increased survival as opposed to WT mice (Smith et al., 1994; Paludan, 2000; Rosas et al., 2001; Kawa et al., 2010) . Moreover, both liver enzymes and serum IL6 were much lower after TNF block ade in our studies. This decrease in proinflammatory cytokines is likely a major contributor to the enhanced survival as well as diminished gastrointestinal and liver pathology. Although, IL6 is well known as a hepatoprotective cytokine (Cressman et al., 1996) , other studies have shown that longterm IL6 exposure induced SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) expression in hepatocytes, resulting in exacerbated liver in jury (Senn et al., 2003; Rotter Sopasakis et al., 2004; Jin et al., 2006) . Other reports have indicated that both IL6 (Chen et al., 2009 ) and TNF (Korngold et al., 2003) mediate damage as a result of graftversushost disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Interestingly, GVHD studies also suggest that different proinflammatory cytokines may play a more predominant role in a particular organ, al though they may all contribute to the overall pathology. Our studies would support that TNF appears to be a primary me diator of hepatic damage after IT, whereas it is likely that other cytokines such as IL6 may play a more predominant role in gut pathology. It is clear from these studies that liver failure is likely the principal cause of mortality after IT in aged mice.\nThe antitumor responses of antiCD40/IL2 are both CD8 T cell and IFN\ue067 mediated, as previously demonstrated . In the current study, we have found that aged mice treated with antiCD40/IL2 and TNF blockade were able to mount effective antitumor responses against pre existing tumors. Not only did we see protection in the aged mice from ITinduced lethality, we also observed expansion of CD8 T cells and elevated IFN\ue067 levels using a lower dose of IT with etanercept and the induction of antitumor effects. The role of TNF in cancer is complex as it can both promote tumor progression and affect innate immune activation (Sethi et al., 2008) . It is possible that the relatively short administration of TNF blockade during IT outweighs any tumorpromoting effects it can induce and the amelioration of toxicities allows for immune activation to manifest in antitumor effects.\nClinically, TNF blockade, in addition to being used to treat autoimmune diseases, is used as a treatment for immunerelated adverse events (irAEs), particularly colitis, experienced after certain immunotherapeutic cancer regimens such as CTLA4 blockade (Minor et al., 2009) . Therefore, there is precedent for its use during anticancer therapy. In these patients, however, treatment with the primary IT is halted due to irAE severity and antiTNF therapy is administered afterward. Antitumor immunity is often maintained in these patients, further sup porting the concept that TNF may not be essential to antitumor immunity and its blockade does not impede tumor immunity.\nAging. PBMCs from aged subjects were also collected from participants in the National Institute on Aging Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), approved by the IRB, and all participants signed informed consent. Details of the BLSA recruitment and testing methodology are described elsewhere (Shock et al., 1984) . Human PBMCs were obtained by Ficoll Hypaque density centrifugation after which monocytes were purified from PBMCs using the human Monocyte Isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated monocytes were typically >94% after isolation. Monocytes were either directly cultured in AIMV serumfree media (Invitrogen) on poly: ICcoated plates and stimulated with 50 ng/ml human recombinant macro phage CSF (hMCSF; GenScript USA Inc.) for 6 d, washed, and recultured in AIMV with hMCSF and 0.5% participant plasma for an additional 3-4 d.
