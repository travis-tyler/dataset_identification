[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Importance-The effect of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) accumulation on regional structural brain changes in early stages of Alzheimer disease (AD) is not well understood.\nObjective-To test the hypothesis that the development of A\u03b2 pathology is related to increased regional atrophy in the brains of cognitively normal (CN) persons.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants-Longitudinal clinicobiomarker cohort study involving 47 CN control subjects and 15 patients with AD dementia. All participants underwent repeated cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b242 and structural magnetic resonance imaging measurements for up to 4 years. Cognitively normal controls were classified using the longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b242 data and included 13 stable A\u03b2 negative (normal baseline A\u03b242 levels, with less than the median reduction over time), 13 declining A\u03b2 negative (normal baseline A\u03b242 levels, with greater than the median reduction over time), and 21 A\u03b2 positive (pathologic baseline A\u03b242 levels). All 15 patients with AD dementia were A\u03b2 positive.\nMain Outcomes and Measures-Group effects on regional gray matter volumes at baseline and over time, tested by linear mixed-effects models.\nResults-Baseline gray matter volumes were similar among the CN A\u03b2 groups, but atrophy rates were increased in frontoparietal regions in the declining A\u03b2-negative and A\u03b2-positive groups and in amygdala and temporal regions in the A\u03b2-positive group. A\u03b2-positive patients with AD dementia had further increased atrophy rates in hippocampus and temporal and cingulate regions.\nA\u03b2 pathology is coupled to increased frontoparietal (but not temporal) atrophy rates. Atrophy rates peak early in frontoparietal regions but accelerate in hippocampus, temporal, and cingulate regions as the disease progresses to dementia. Earlystage A\u03b2 pathology may have mild effects on local frontoparietal cortical integrity while effects in temporal regions appear later and accelerate, leading to the atrophy pattern typically seen in AD.\nHallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) include \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau proteins, and progressive brain atrophy. 1 \u03b2-Amyloid pathology can be measured by an increased signal of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 2,3 or by decreased A\u03b242 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 4,5 and is seen in about one-third of healthy elders, 6,7 appears several years before cognitive symptoms, [8] [9] [10] and has been termed preclinical AD. 11 It may occur upstream of tau pathology and atrophy, 12-14 but the exact temporospatial relationship among A\u03b2 plaques, atrophy, and tangles in AD remains unclear. The atrophy is usually believed to begin in the medial temporal lobe before spreading into other parts of temporal and parietal cortex and finally to most association cortex, including the frontal lobe. This model is based in part on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies [15] [16] [17] showing most robust changes in hippocampus and temporal cortex. The tau pathology probably first appears in entorhinal cortex (or in the brainstem 18, 19 ) before reaching hippocampus and other parts of temporal and parietal cortex. 20, 21 The development of A\u03b2 pathology is considerably different, with plaques first appearing in cortical regions \nAuthor Manuscript\nStructural MR Image Acquisition Structural brain MR images were acquired at multiple sites using 1.5-T imaging systems (\u22646 time points, at screening and at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months) with a standardized protocol that included T1-weighted MR imaging using a sagittal volumetric magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence. 41\nAutomated cortical and subcortical volume and thickness measures were performed with FreeSurfer. 42, 43 To reduce the confounding effect of intraparticipant morphologic variability, each participant's longitudinal data series was processed by FreeSurfer longitudinal work flow (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/LongitudinalProcessing).\nA previous test -retest study 44 had validated that the longitudinal processing provides consistent region of interest (ROI) segmentation. All images underwent standardized quality control. Participants with complete segmentation failure or gross errors throughout all brain regions were rated as complete failures. Participants with gross errors in 1 or more specific brain regions (ie, temporal lobe regions, superior regions, occipital regions, and insula) were given a partial pass rating. Participants with a partial pass rating were included in analyses of appropriate brain regions only.\nThe main analysis of this study focused on GM volumes. To reduce the problem of multiple comparisons, we used 6 a priori defined combinations of ROI volumes (overall, temporal, cingulate, parietal, frontal, and occipital regions), plus the individual data for hippocampus and amygdala. For the over all volume, we combined data from all available GM ROIs. For the temporal lobe, we combined the temporal pole, fusiform, superior temporal, inferior temporal, middle temporal, banks of the superior temporal sulcus, transverse temporal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal ROIs. For the cingulate, we combined the rostral anterior cingulate, caudal anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and isthmus cingulate ROIs. For the parietal lobe, we combined the postcentral, superior parietal, supramarginal, paracentral, inferior parietal, and precuneus ROIs. For the frontal lobe, we combined the frontal pole, precentral, caudal middle frontal, rostral middle frontal, medial orbitofrontal, pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, pars opercularis, and superior frontal ROIs. For the occipital lobe, we combined the lingual, lateral occipital, pericalcarine, and cuneus ROIs. In a secondary exploratory analysis, we tested all available FreeSurfer GM ROIs individually. Data of the right and left hemispheres were averaged in all analyses. As a supplementary analysis, we also tested effects on cortical thickness instead of GM volume.\nThe presence of vascular disease was a potential confounder for the relationship between amyloid and atrophy. Therefore, we included data for white matter hyperintensities, quantified from structural proton density-weighted, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted MR images as described in detail previously, 45 and data for white matter hypointensities, quantified by automatic volume measurements using FreeSurfer. \nCerebrospinal fluid was acquired annually (\u22645 time points, at baseline and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months) by lumbar puncture and stored at \u221280\u00b0C at the ADNI Biomarker Core laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. \u03b2-Amyloid42, T-tau, and P-tau were measured with a multiplex platform (xMAP; Luminex Corporation) using a kit (INNO-BIA AlzBio3; Innogenetics). 5, 46 The biomarker data set (UPENNBIOMK4.csv; http:// adni.loni.usc.edu/) has been described previously 38, 47, 48 but not in relation to MR imaging measurements.\nFrom the original CSF data set, one CN individual was excluded because of atypical A\u03b242 data (A\u03b242 levels increased greatly over time), and another CN individual was excluded because of atypical structural data (volumes increased greatly over time in several subcortical regions). Because we wanted to ensure that any differences in structure between the CN A\u03b2-s and CN A\u03b2-d groups were caused by emerging rather than established A\u03b2 pathology, we excluded data from individuals crossing the A\u03b242 cutoff of 192 ng/L during the study. This included one individual who had a baseline A\u03b242 level exceeding 192 ng/L but all follow-up A\u03b242 levels less than 192 ng/L (we excluded all data for that individual), as well as data from 3 individuals who had baseline A\u03b242 levels exceeding 192 ng/L but last follow-up (month 36) A\u03b242 levels less than 192 ng/L (we excluded the data from the last visit for those individuals). As described below, we repeated the analyses with all the data included, which did not change the main findings.\nWe used linear mixed-effects models with time as a single predictor to derive baseline levels (intercepts) and longitudinal changes (slopes) of A\u03b242. By definition, the CN A\u03b2-s group had estimated intercepts exceeding 192 ng/L (100% consistent with observed baseline A\u03b242 levels) and estimated change less than the median among all A\u03b2-negative CN participants. The CN A\u03b2-d group had intercepts exceeding 192 ng/L and change exceeding the median among all A\u03b2-negative CN participants. The CN A\u03b2+ and AD A\u03b2+ groups had intercepts of 192 ng/L or less. The cutoff of 192 ng/L is discriminative of brain A\u03b2 pathology in PET imaging 49 and autopsy 5 studies, with samples analyzed at the same laboratory as in the present study.\nTherefore, the study contained 4 groups representing increasingly severe stages of A\u03b2 pathology and cognition. These included CN A\u03b2-s (n = 13), CN A\u03b2-d (n = 13), CN A\u03b2+ (n = 21), and AD A\u03b2+ (n = 15). \nAuthor Manuscript intracranial volume, and APOE \u03b54 genotype status. Differences in baseline volumes were determined by the group effect and differences in atrophy rates by the interaction between time and group. Groups were tested pairwise in 4 combinations (CN A\u03b2-s vs CN A\u03b2-d, CN A\u03b2+, or AD A\u03b2+ and CN A\u03b2+ vs AD A\u03b2+). We also tested group differences in T-tau and Ptau levels and cognitive subscale scores on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale using linear mixed-effects models. Secondarily, we compared atrophy rates among CN A\u03b2 groups in all available GM ROIs to assess whether differences were consistent for individual ROIs within lobes. We used nonparametric bootstrap resamples (n = 1000) to generate 95% CIs for the comparisons. As a supplementary analysis, we also analyzed cortical thickness as the response.\nWe used logistic models to test whether variables were related to study dropout, with age, sex, education, and study group as predictors of missing data (for A\u03b242 levels, we compared individuals with 2-3 data points vs individuals with 4-5 data points; for MR imaging, we created a missing indicator [true or false] for each study visit). All linear mixed-effects models included a random intercept and a random slope. The applicability of the models was assessed by evaluating fitted vs observed measurement within participants, normality of model residuals, and quantile-quantile plots. All tests were 2-sided, and significance was set at P < .05. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed by the false discovery rate when indicated. All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.0.1; The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nStudy demographics are summarized in the Table. The APOE \u03b54 genotype status differed between groups (rare in CN A\u03b2-s and CN A\u03b2-d but common in CN A\u03b2+ and AD A\u03b2+). The groups were also not completely balanced on age, sex, and education (range, P = .10 to P = . 20). Therefore, all models were adjusted for age, sex, education, and APOE \u03b54 genotype status. Some individuals had a history of hypertension and increased levels of white matter hyperintensities or white matter hypointensities, but because the groups were balanced on these parameters (P = .84, P = .81, and P = .41, respectively), we did not adjust for them in the final models (although including them did not change the main results [data not shown]).\nParticipants lacked some CSF data (1 at baseline, 3 at 12 months, 22 at 24 months, 24 at 36 months, and 47 at 48 months) or MR imaging (2 at baseline, 4 at 6 months, 4 at 12 months, 11 at 24 months, 33 at 36 months, and 54 at 48 months). Study group effects were not associated with missing data.\nNo differences were observed among CN groups in baseline volumes in the a priori defined regions (Figure 1 ). The AD A\u03b2+ group had smaller overall, hippocampus, amygdala, temporal, and parietal volumes compared with the CN A\u03b2-s group and had smaller overall, hippocampus, amygdala, temporal, cingulate, and parietal volumes compared with the CN A\u03b2+ group. \nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nCompared with the CN A\u03b2-s group, the CN A\u03b2-d group had increased atrophy rates in the overall, frontal, and parietal regions, and the CN A\u03b2+ group had increased atrophy rates in the overall, amygdala, temporal, cingulate, frontal, and parietal regions (Figure 2 ). The AD A\u03b2+ group had increased atrophy rates in all regions compared with the CN A\u03b2-s group and had increased atrophy rates in overall, hippocampus, temporal, and cingulate regions compared with the CN A\u03b2+ group.\nWe compared atrophy rates among CN groups in all available ROIs using group resampling and nonparametric bootstrapping to estimate 95% CIs. Regions within lobes often had similarly altered atrophy rates (Figure 3 ). The CN A\u03b2-d group had increased atrophy rates compared with the CN A\u03b2-s group predominantly in frontoparietal regions, while most temporal, cingulate, occipital, and subcortical regions had similar rates between these groups (Figure 3, left) . The CN A\u03b2+ group had increased rates compared with the CN A\u03b2-s group in most regions, with largest effects in amygdala and several parietal, temporal (but not hippocampus), and frontal regions (Figure 3 , middle). The CN A\u03b2+ group also had increased rates compared with the CN A\u03b2-d group predominantly in amygdale and temporal lobe regions but not in frontoparietal or most cingulate regions (Figure 3 , right).\nAs a supplementary analysis, we also tested for differences in cortical thickness in the overall brain and in lobes (eFigure 1 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The results were similar to the results for volume. The main difference was that the rates of atrophy were slightly less pronounced in the CN A\u03b2+ group compared with the CN A\u03b2-s group than in the volume analysis, but rates remained significantly increased in the parietal lobe.\nBaseline cognitive subscale scores on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale were similar between the CN A\u03b2-s and CN A\u03b2-d groups, but the CN A\u03b2+ group had a trend for higher scores than the CN A\u03b2-s group (Table) . Longitudinal cognitive subscale changes on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale were smallest in the CN A\u03b2-s group and greater in the CN A\u03b2-d and CN A\u03b2+ groups (significantly different compared with the CN A\u03b2-s group). As expected, the AD A\u03b2+ group had higher baseline scores and increases over time compared with CN participants.\nBaseline T-tau and P-tau levels were similar between the CN A\u03b2-s and CN A\u03b2-d groups but were greater in the CN A\u03b2+ and AD A\u03b2+ groups (Table) . Slopes of T-tau and P-tau were similar between groups but showed trends to greater levels in the CN A\u03b2+ and AD A\u03b2+ groups (significant for AD and P-tau). \nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nOur main findings were (1) a subset of CN participants with CSF A\u03b242 levels in the normal range (and no preclinical AD by current definitions 11 ) demonstrates longitudinal CSF A\u03b242 reductions coupled to increased frontoparietal cortical atrophy rates in the absence of accelerated temporal atrophy and (2) CN participants with reduced CSF A\u03b242 levels at baseline have widespread increased cortical atrophy rates in addition to the frontoparietal regions. Our results suggest a stage of emerging amyloid pathology in CN persons before the presence of widespread amyloid plaques, which is associated with frontoparietal cortical thinning that does not accelerate further during the disease progression. Once individuals have evidence of widespread cortical plaque pathology, they also show signs of accelerating atrophy in regions usually considered to be affected by atrophy in AD.\nThe finding that frontoparietal atrophy rates were increased in the CN A\u03b2-d group is novel. A recently published study 39 used a similar approach but only tested atrophy rates in hippocampus, where there were no differences between controls in various A\u03b2 groups (consistent with our results). Previous investigations examining correlations between A\u03b2 pathology and brain structure in controls have been discrepant, with some reports of associations between atrophy and A\u03b2 pathology, 26, 27, 34, 50, 51 associations only in controls with subjective cognitive impairment, 31,37 or associations only in individuals with concomitant increased P-tau levels 52 or other signs of brain injury. 53 Several of these studies 34,53 found increased atrophy rates in the temporal lobe in the presence of A\u03b2 pathology, consistent with our results for the CN A\u03b2+ group. Our results are also in line with previous findings of association between A\u03b2 pathology and atrophy in parietal and frontal regions in healthy controls. 29, 30 Frontoparietal regions are known to be sites of early A\u03b2 deposition, and although the CSF A\u03b242 measurements in this study provide no information on regional A\u03b2 pathology, it is possible that localized A\u03b2 pathology was coupled to early effects on frontoparietal structures. 31 The fact that the CN A\u03b2-s and CN A\u03b2-d groups had similar levels of T-tau and P-tau, which are believed to indicate AD-type axonal degeneration and neurofibrillary tangles, 54 may suggest that the increased atrophy rates in the CN A\u03b2-d group were partly tau independent. However, autopsy studies show that severe A\u03b2-associated neurodegeneration is rare in the absence of tangles 55 or other pathologies. 56 One possibility in the present study is that local A\u03b2 (fibrils or oligomers) damaged cortical cells, but it is unclear if this occurs without concurrent tau pathology. 57 Neocortical tau deposition may be present in CN persons, 58 making it possible that the increased atrophy rates found herein occurred on a background of tau or other brain pathology. We considered the possibility that vascular pathology confounded our findings. Some individuals had increased white matter hyperintensities or hypointensities or a history of hypertension. However, the groups were balanced on all these parameters, and adjusting for them did not change the main results (data not shown).\nOur finding that the CN A\u03b2+ group had increased atrophy rates not only in frontoparietal regions but also in amygdala, temporal, and cingulate regions supports the notion that A\u03b2 accumulation induces atrophy in different brain regions at various stages. The CN A\u03b2+ and 56, 59 which may have affected brain atrophy rates. As explained above, we excluded a few individuals with atypical A\u03b242 measurements, but the main results were stable when we included all individuals and data (eFigure 3 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). A slight imbalance was observed in the proportions of men and women between groups, but all models were adjusted for sex. A final limitation concerns the measurement variability of CSF biomarkers, which may potentially introduce artificial changes. 60 The intraassay coefficient of variation for CSF A\u03b242 was 10.5% or less (all samples from each individual run at the same plate). However, this variability is not biased toward reduced levels over time, and we included 3 or 4 CSF measurements for most individuals, which greatly increase the robustness of the estimates compared with estimating slopes from only 2 time points.\nIn summary, we identify a group of CN persons with emerging amyloid pathology coupled to increased atrophy rates in frontoparietal but not temporal regions, suggesting local effects on brain structure during early stages of A\u03b2 accumulation. Cognitively normal participants and patients having AD with signs of widespread A\u03b2 pathology had increased atrophy rates in classic AD regions. Our results modify previous models of the relationship between A\u03b2 and regional atrophy during the development of AD."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "distinct from the medial temporal lobe. 22, 23 To unite these different observations, it has been suggested that A\u03b2 and tangles may start independently, with temporal lobe tangles also occurring in normal aging. 24 According to this model, AD first causes A\u03b2 deposition in the neocortex and later tangles in the temporal lobe, sometimes on top of age-related tangles. 25 Studies on A\u03b2 and atrophy in cognitively normal (CN) persons have been discordant, with associations between A\u03b2 and atrophy in temporal cortex and hippocampus 26, 27 or primarily in other regions, including the frontal lobe, [28] [29] [30] or only in control subjects with subjective memory impairment. 31 \u03b2-Amyloid pathology has sometimes (but not always 32, 33 ) been associated with longitudinal atrophy in CN persons in hippocampus and temporal cortex, 34, 35 as well as in regions not typically associated with early AD. 36 Finally, A\u03b2 has been associated with larger volume in temporal regions, perhaps indicating brain reserve mechanisms. 37 Reports of a bimodal distribution of A\u03b2 biomarkers 23, 38 suggest that the transition from A\u03b2 negative to A\u03b2 positive may be rapid, making it possible to observe CN elders with no evidence of preclinical AD but with rapidly changing CSF A\u03b242 levels, indicating emerging A\u03b2 pathology. Few studies have simultaneously measured longitudinal biomarkers of A\u03b2 and brain structure in CN persons. A recent study 39 found no difference in hippocampal atrophy rates based on emerging A\u03b2 pathology in CN persons but did not test atrophy in other regions. One possible outcome of such an analysis would be that emerging A\u03b2 pathology is associated with increased atrophy in the temporal lobe, consistent with the usually perceived pattern of atrophy in AD. Alternatively, emerging A\u03b2 pathology might be associated with atrophy in association cortical areas distant from the medial temporal lobe, consistent with local neurotoxic effects of A\u03b2. 14 Herein, we examined the kinetics of CSF A\u03b242 and brain structure in CN elders. Based on the idea that A\u03b2 may follow a sigmoidal trajectory, 40 we classified individuals into successively more advanced stages using combinations of baseline and longitudinal CSF A\u03b242 measurements (for details, see the Statistical Analysis section of the Methods) as follows: stable A\u03b2 negative (CN A\u03b2-s), declining A\u03b2 negative (CN A\u03b2-d), and A\u03b2 positive (CN A\u03b2+).

The applicability of the models was assessed by evaluating fitted vs observed measurement within participants, normality of model residuals, and quantile-quantile plots. All tests were 2-sided, and significance was set at P < .05. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed by the false discovery rate when indicated.

Our results suggest a stage of emerging amyloid pathology in CN persons before the presence of widespread amyloid plaques, which is associated with frontoparietal cortical thinning that does not accelerate further during the disease progression. Once individuals have evidence of widespread cortical plaque pathology, they also show signs of accelerating atrophy in regions usually considered to be affected by atrophy in AD.\nThe finding that frontoparietal atrophy rates were increased in the CN A\u03b2-d group is novel. A recently published study 39 used a similar approach but only tested atrophy rates in hippocampus, where there were no differences between controls in various A\u03b2 groups (consistent with our results). Previous investigations examining correlations between A\u03b2 pathology and brain structure in controls have been discrepant, with some reports of associations between atrophy and A\u03b2 pathology, 26, 27, 34, 50, 51 associations only in controls with subjective cognitive impairment, 31, 37 or associations only in individuals with concomitant increased P-tau levels 52 or other signs of brain injury. 53 Several of these studies 34, 53 found increased atrophy rates in the temporal lobe in the presence of A\u03b2 pathology, consistent with our results for the CN A\u03b2+ group. Our results are also in line with previous findings of association between A\u03b2 pathology and atrophy in parietal and frontal regions in healthy controls. 29, 30 Frontoparietal regions are known to be sites of early A\u03b2 deposition, and although the CSF A\u03b242 measurements in this study provide no information on regional A\u03b2 pathology, it is possible that localized A\u03b2 pathology was coupled to early effects on frontoparietal structures. 31 The fact that the CN A\u03b2-s and CN A\u03b2-d groups had similar levels of T-tau and P-tau, which are believed to indicate AD-type axonal degeneration and neurofibrillary tangles, 54 may suggest that the increased atrophy rates in the CN A\u03b2-d group were partly tau independent. However, autopsy studies show that severe A\u03b2-associated neurodegeneration is rare in the absence of tangles 55 or other pathologies. 56 One possibility in the present study is that local A\u03b2 (fibrils or oligomers) damaged cortical cells, but it is unclear if this occurs without concurrent tau pathology. 57 Neocortical tau deposition may be present in CN persons, 58 making it possible that the increased atrophy rates found herein occurred on a background of tau or other brain pathology. We considered the possibility that vascular pathology confounded our findings. Some individuals had increased white matter hyperintensities or hypointensities or a history of hypertension. However, the groups were balanced on all these parameters, and adjusting for them did not change the main results (data not shown).\nOur finding that the CN A\u03b2+ group had increased atrophy rates not only in frontoparietal regions but also in amygdala, temporal, and cingulate regions supports the notion that A\u03b2 accumulation induces atrophy in different brain regions at various stages. The CN A\u03b2+ and AD A\u03b2+ groups had similar atrophy rates in amygdala, indicating that atrophy there peaks early. In contrast, atrophy rates in hippocampus, temporal, and cingulated regions were greater in the AD A\u03b2+ group compared with the CN A\u03b2+ group, indicating accelerated atrophy as the disease becomes symptomatic.\nOur main limitation was the small sample size, especially for comparing the CN A\u03b2-s and CN A\u03b2-d groups. The classify cation of A\u03b2-negative CN participants as stable vs declining using a median split of the A\u03b242 slope does not exclude an overlap in pathology for individuals with intermediate A\u03b242 changes. However, the overall results remained significant or close to significant when we excluded the mid-tertile (8 of 26) of A\u03b2-negative CN participants with intermediate changes, supporting our main conclusions (data not shown). Another limitation is that we did not determine the presence of other potentially important brain pathologies, including mild tau pathology, hippocampal sclerosis, Lewy bodies, or TDP-43 inclusions, 56, 59 which may have affected brain atrophy rates. As explained above, we excluded a few individuals with atypical A\u03b242 measurements, but the main results were stable when we included all individuals and data (eFigure 3 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). A slight imbalance was observed in the proportions of men and women between groups, but all models were adjusted for sex. A final limitation concerns the measurement variability of CSF biomarkers, which may potentially introduce artificial changes. 60 The intraassay coefficient of variation for CSF A\u03b242 was 10.5% or less (all samples from each individual run at the same plate). However, this variability is not biased toward reduced levels over time, and we included 3 or 4 CSF measurements for most individuals, which greatly increase the robustness of the estimates compared with estimating slopes from only 2 time points."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, we identify a group of CN persons with emerging amyloid pathology coupled to increased atrophy rates in frontoparietal but not temporal regions, suggesting local effects on brain structure during early stages of A\u03b2 accumulation.
