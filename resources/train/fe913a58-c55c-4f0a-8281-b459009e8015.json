The properties of negative selection are determined by the corresponding fitness landscape, the function which relates fitness to the \"mutation burden\" of a genotype. In the simplest case of equally deleterious mutations, mutational burden is the total number of mutant alleles in a genome. According to the null hypothesis of no epistasis, selection acts on different mutations independently, so that each additional mutation causes the same decline in relative fitness and fitness depends exponentially on their number. By contrast, if synergistic, or narrowing (2), epistasis between deleterious alleles is present, each additional mutation causes a larger decrement of relative fitness. Synergistic epistasis can reduce the mutation load under a given genomic rate of deleterious mutations (1, [3] [4] and can produce the evolutionary advantage of sex and recombination (5) . However, because neither the mutational burden nor fitness can be easily measured, data on fitness landscapes of negative selection remain inconclusive (6) . Recent genome-wide investigations have found pervasive epistasis, but no consistent directionality of effect (6) (7) (8) . Synergistic epistasis between deleterious mutations is more prevalent in organisms with complex genomes (7) . Moreover, theoretical work suggests that narrowing epistasis may emerge as a result of pervasive pleiotropy, and modular organization of biological networks (9) . This would lead to antagonism between beneficial mutations and synergism between deleterious mutations.\nIn this paper, we study the distribution of the mutation burden in human and Drosophila melanogaster populations. In the absence of epistasis, deleterious alleles independently contribute to the mutation burden (3) . Thus, if mutant alleles are rare, the mutation burden has Poisson distribution, so that its variance ( 2 ) is equal to its mean ( ) ( Fig. S1 ). More generally, the variance of the mutation burden is equal to the sum of variances at all deleterious loci, or the additive variance ( ) (10), computed as \u2211 2 (1 \u2212 ) for all deleterious loci with mutant allele frequency in the genome (Fig. 1 ). This is mathematically equivalent to the genome-wide nucleotide diversity of deleterious alleles (11) . In contrast, epistatic selection creates dependencies between individual alleles, so total variance of the mutation burden is no longer equal to the additive variance. Selection with synergistic epistasis creates negative linkage disequilibria (LDs) between deleterious alleles. Due to the dependencies between individual alleles, variance of the mutation burden is reduced by a factor of (<1), which is determined by the strength of selection and the extent of epistasis (13, 14, Fig.  S2 ). Antagonistic epistasis, instead, creates positive linkage disequilibria (LDs) between deleterious alleles and increases variance of the mutation burden. Truncation selection, which represents the extreme mode of synergistic epistasis (4) leads to the smallest . In the extreme example, if 50% of individuals with above average numbers of mutations would not contribute to the next generation, = 0.36 if the average genomic number of mutations is high. Because free recombination halves LDs in the course of one generation, at the mutation-selection equilibrium 2 = 2 \u2212 \u2044 , where is the variance of the mutation burden under linkage equilibrium. More subtly, the difference between 2 and is also a genome-wide estimate of the net linkage disequilibrium in fitness. For all pairs of loci and in the genome,\n, where , is the pair-wise linkage disequilibrium. Using data on multiple genotypes from a population, we utilized this statistical framework to create a test for synergistic epistasis without the need to measure fitness.\nThe ideal population for our test would be single ancestry, outbreeding, non-admixed and randomly mating. We analyzed three suitable European datasetsthe Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL) (14), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Dutch controls from Project MinE, an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study. For each of these, we obtained whole-genome sequences of unrelated individuals. We obtained the same data for Zambian flies from Phase 3 of the Drosophila Population Genomics Project (DPGP3) (15) . For each population, after applying stringent quality control filters (Tables S8-S12), we computed the mutation burden distribution for coding synonymous, missense, and loss-of-function or LoF, defined as splice site disrupting and nonsense variants. For all of these datasets, distribution of LoF singletons was underdispersed (nonsense variants in the MinE dataset, if considered separately, were the exception, although underdispersion was also observed for stop gain variants in this dataset at a slightly higher allele frequency threshold (Table S2) ). On average, rare LoF variants displayed variance ( 2 ) reduced by a factor of ~0.9, or underdispersion, compared to additive variance ( ) (Table  1 , Fig. 2 ). Thus, 2 = 0.9 is consistent with = 0.89 which appears, for example, after truncation of less than 2% of the population. In contrast, rare coding synonymous variants Table S2 for other frequency cutoffs). For flies, alleles up to a minor allele count of 5 are included (see Table S3 for other cut-offs). The number of samples is given in parentheses for each dataset. LoF variants include splice site disrupting and nonsense variants. Net LD per pair of alleles (\u0301) is computed as the difference between the variance 2 and additive variance of the rare mutation burden, normalized by the square of the mean mutation burden \u03bc (\u0301= / 2 ). A p-value was obtained for each human dataset by permutation (Table S1) , and a joint p-value for all 3 human datasets shown (GoNL, ADNI, ALS) was computed by meta-analysis using Stouffer's method (coding synonymous p=0.999, missense p < 1x10 -3 , LoF p = 0.002). showed 2 greater than , or overdispersion. We replicated the same signal in three non-European populations from the (yellow, left) . In the absence of epistasis (grey), variance ( 2 ) of the mutation burden (bottom panel) is equal to its additive variance ( ). Overdispersion (blue) occurs due to natural selection with antagonistic epistasis, and due to population structure and technical heterogeneity during sequencing. Underdispersion (pink) occurs due to natural selection with synergistic epistasis. 1000 genomes Phase I Project (16) (Table S1, Table S2 ) and an American D. melanogaster population from the D. melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP, 17, Table S3 ). We proceeded to ask two questions: why were the synonymous variants overdispersed compared to their expectation under independence? Was the underdispersion in LoF variants significant?\nEven for a set of independent alleles, overdispersion in the mutation burden is observed if genome-wide positive LD is present due to population structure, which can also be seen as deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the entire genome ( Fig. 1, 18, 19 ). If the population has a cline in average mutation burden ( )(20) due to, for example, a southto-north expansion (14)(21) followed by assortative mating, this translates into an excess of 2 over (Fig. S3, Fig. S4 , Table S4 ). Overdispersion can also be caused by technical reasons (Fig. 1) . When DNA samples are sequenced or processed in different batches, the heterogeneity introduced can result in a clustering effect similar to that of geographic structure. Using GoNL samples, for which we had detailed geographic and technical information, we showed that a large proportion of the overdispersion in rare mutation burden could be attributed to geographic origin and sequencing batch (Fig.  S5 , Table S4 ). We also showed that by calculating mutation burden across allele frequencies, where no strong differences in between human populations have been detected (20) , we effectively observed an independent distribution of mutation burden for all variants (Table S2 ).\nWe next proceeded to investigate the contrast between coding synonymous and LoF variants. Having uncovered the primary sources for overdispersion of rare mutation burden, we realized that overdispersion scaled with the mean ( ) of the mutation burden distribution (Table S5) . We, therefore, generated an empirical null distribution for each dataset by resampling coding synonymous variants at the same mean ( ) and allele frequency as our test set of LoF variants (1000 resamples for each dataset, Fig. 2 ). Meta-analyzing across all datasets using Stouffer's method (Tables S1-S3), we showed that the deleterious mutation burden for LoF variants was significantly underdispersed in humans (p = 0.0003) and flies (p = 9.43 x 10 -6 ). We also tested significance in humans using an alternative approach (Table S1 ). Permuting functional consequences across variants, we confirmed the significance of our underdispersion signal in deleterious mutation burden (missense p < 1x10 -3 , LoF p = 0.002). Furthermore, we showed that the underdispersion signal persists after correcting raw metrics for population structure and other confounding factors (Table S5) ."}, {"section_title": "Fig. 2. Resampling distributions of", "text": "to ratio ( ) for LoF rare mutation burden in humans and D. melanogaster. Synonymous (purple) and missense (green) variants were resampled at the same mean and allele frequency as LoF variants to obtain empirical null distributions for the variance 2 to additive variance ratio for each dataset. For humans, only singletons are included (see Table S2 for other frequency cut-offs). For flies, alleles up to a minor allele count of 5 are included (see Table S3 for other cut-offs). A synonymous p-value for the 2 to ratio of the rare LoF mutation burden (red) was obtained for each dataset (Table S1) , and a joint p-value for all 3 human datasets shown (GoNL, ADNI, ALS) was computed by meta-analysis using Stouffer's method (p = 0.0003).\nNotably, the detected signal varies between human and fly populations. The underdispersion signal in deleterious mutation burden is stronger in flies compared to humans (Fig.  2) . First, this is because recombination, which opposes the reduction in genetic variance caused by negative LDs, is weaker in flies compared to humans. The observed effect decreases with the harmonic mean c H of the recombination frequencies among the sites involved (22) . Flies, with only four pairs of chromosomes and no crossing over in males, has an estimated c H of 0.1, significantly lower than a c H close to 0.4 for humans (23) . Second, in industrialized human populations, after the second demographic transition, selection due to pre-reproductive mortality is deeply relaxed (24, 25) . Thus, recombination would rapidly destroy linkage disequilibria between deleterious alleles.\nWhile several factorsgeographic structure, technical issues, antagonistic epistasiscan lead to an overdispersed mutation burden distribution, only synergistic epistasis can lead to an underdispersed distribution for unlinked loci. We further partitioned the underdispersion signal into within-and between-chromosome components, and demonstrated that the deleterious mutation burden was underdispersed due to multilocus associations both within and between different chromosomes (Table S6 , Table S7 ). While the negative linkage disequilibria from linked regions may be attributed to Hill-Robertson interference (26, 27) the majority of our underdispersion signal comes from unlinked pairs of loci, even for pairs of loci within the same chromosome (Fig. S6, Fig.  S7 ). Having identified and controlled for other sources of LD, we thus invoke synergistic epistasis as a significant contributor to the underdispersion signal in deleterious mutation burden that we observe in humans and flies.\nThirty years ago, Neel posed the question: \"The amount of silent DNA is steadily shrinking. The question of how our species accommodates such [high deleterious] mutation rates is central to evolutionary thought (28) .\" Indeed, a newborn receives ~70 de novo mutations (29) . Although estimates for the target size for deleterious alleles (fraction of the genome that is \"functional\") vary, an overwhelming majority suggest that about 10% of the human genome sequence is functionally significant and selectively constrained (30, 31) . Thus, the average human individual is expected to carry at least seven de novo deleterious mutations, which is incompatible with the long-term population survival if selection is non-epistatic. Moreover, regardless of epistasis, at the mutation-selection equilibrium, the sum of coefficients of selection against mutant alleles present in an average genotype must equal the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate (32) . Recently Henn et al (20) independently estimated this sum in humans to be 15. Without epistatic selection, this suggests a mutation load that is inconsistent with the existence of the population (1-e -15 >0.999). Thus, synergistic epistasis is the only way for humans to survive, and in a sense, our findings are not unexpected. In industrialized human populations, while selection due to pre-reproductive mortality is deeply relaxed, there is still a substantial opportunity for selection due to differential fertility (33) . Also, only ~30% of human conceptions result in live births (34) , indicating a substantial opportunity for prenatal selection. Thus, our results suggest that epistatic negative selection in humans is ongoing.\nPart of the data collection and sharing for this project was funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904) and DOD ADNI (Department of Defense award number W81XWH-12-2-0012).
