[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Many studies have shown that women are under-represented in tenured ranks in the sciences. We evaluate whether gender differences in the likelihood of obtaining a tenure track job, promotion to tenure, and promotion to full professor explain these facts using the 1973-2001 Survey of Doctorate Recipients. We find that women are less likely to take tenure track positions in science, but the gender gap is entirely explained by fertility decisions. We find that in science overall, there is no gender difference in promotion to tenure or full professor after controlling for demographic, family, employer and productivity covariates and that in many cases, there is no gender difference in promotion to tenure or full professor even without controlling for covariates. However, family characteristics have different impacts on women's and men's promotion probabilities. Single women do better at each stage than single men, although this might be due to selection. Children make it less likely that women in science will advance up the academic job ladder beyond their early post-doctorate years, while both marriage and children increase men's likelihood of advancing.\nJEL Codes: J4, J71"}, {"section_title": "Does Science Promote Women? Evidence from Academia, 1973-2001", "text": "Fewer women are present in science academe than in the workforce as a whole and particularly in the higher levels of academe -such as tenured jobs and full professorships at major research universities. This paper begins from the point when scientists receive their Ph.D.s and investigates gender differences as they move up the academic career ladder, getting tenure track jobs, being granted tenure, and being promoted to full professorships.\nThere is a large body of literature about women and science, particularly since 1982 when Congress instructed the National Science Foundation (NSF) to report biennially on the status of women and minorities in science. The NSF reports have consistently shown that since 1982 and through the most recent report (NSF 2004a) , women continue to be less likely than their male colleagues to be full professors and more likely to be assistant professors. Congress also established its own committee, the Congressional Committee on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering and Technological Developments (CAWMSET), to review the status of women in science. CAWMSET (2000) also found that women in SET (Science, Engineering and Technology) academia are less likely to be tenured (29 percent of women versus 58 percent of men among full time ranked academics at 4 year colleges) or hold full professorships (23 percent of women compared to 50 percent of men). More recently, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported to Congress that women scientists lag behind men in terms of salary and rank (GAO 2004) . In site visits, some women report that tenure track positions at research universities create difficulty in balancing work and family. Others report that a hostile climate makes academic employment unattractive. Another recent study by Donna Nelson and Diana Rogers (2005) found that smaller percentages of women than men who receive Ph.D.s proceed to become assistant professors in top 50 SET departments. These important sources represent only a few of the many studies on women in science.\nEven though women are under-represented in upper echelons of academic science, one cannot conclude from the NSF, CAWMSET or Nelson reports that unfair treatment in the promotion process is the underlying cause of the gender gap in academic promotion. Two alternative possibilities include that women choose careers that do not have the rigid academic timetable or that women are less productive, particularly in terms of research, than men. Of course, research productivity itself may result from the absence of an environment and the resources that foster research, as demonstrated at MIT (Goldberg 1999) .\nIn contrast to these negative findings, Long et.al. (2001) studies the careers of women in science from 1973-1995 and conclude that women have been successful in moving \"from scarcity to visibility.\" They find that the impact of marriage and children on women's careers had largely been eliminated by 1995, although men were still 4 percent more likely to receive tenure. On the other hand, Xie and Shauman (2003) find that marriage and children exacerbate gender differences in promotion in nonacademic science. In addition, they find the gender publication gap is smaller than in previous studies and declining over time, suggesting a convergence in women's and men's academic productivity.\nA recent report by the NSF (NSF 2004b ) is the most comprehensive study to date of the factors contributing to promotion in academic careers of scientists and engineers. This work, carried out contemporaneously to ours and also using NSF's longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), finds that controlling for human capital, personal characteristics and institutional factors, there remains a significant female disadvantage in the likelihood of being in a tenure track job, of receiving tenure and of being promoted to full. However, in most of their specifications, they find that these gender differences become statistically insignificant when family characteristics are allowed to affect men and women differently. Our findings are quite different qualitatively from theirs, for reasons we discuss in the conclusion. We find that in science, single women actually have an advantage over single men in obtaining tenure track jobs, in being granted tenure and in being promoted to full after controlling for covariates and that married men and women without children are quite similar at each of these stages overall.\nHowever, the presence of children prevents some women from ever achieving a tenure track job and thus stepping onto the academic career ladder.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: we first describe the data and methodology. We then discuss the entry into tenure-track jobs, describe and model the tenure decision and then describe and model promotion to full professor. The final section concludes."}, {"section_title": "Data and Empirical Methodology", "text": "Our analysis of promotion uses data from the 1973-2001 waves of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). The SDR is a biennial, longitudinal survey of doctorate recipients from U.S. institutions conducted by the National Research Council. The SDR collects detailed information on doctorate recipients including demographic characteristics, educational background, employer characteristics, academic rank, government support, primary work activity, productivity, and salary. The SDR has undergone substantial changes in the sampling frame and survey content between the 1973 and 1993 waves (Mitchell, Moonesinge, and Cox 1998) . Technical reports provided by the National Science Foundation have allowed us to construct a longitudinal data set with consistent variable definitions over time.\nWe have selected a longitudinal extract of doctorate recipients in the sciences who received their Ph.D. between the years of 1972 and 1991 and remain in the survey 10 years after the Ph.D. Individuals are excluded if they are not observed more than once or if they skip more than three surveys.\nWe estimate three career milestones. First, we examine the probability of obtaining a tenure track job within five years of the Ph.D. Then we restrict the analysis to those who have ever held a tenure track job to estimate two promotion milestones, the first award of tenure and the first award of full professorship.\nFrom the 1973 through 1991 surveys, respondents provided the exact year that they received tenure, which adds some accuracy given the biennial nature of the survey. For later surveys, tenure year is imputed as the first year a person is observed with tenure in the sample.\nWe impute the year a person receives full professorship as the first year a person is observed as a tenured full professor in the sample. Given the biennial nature of the survey, years until tenure and years until full professor may be measured with one-year error.\nOur analyses below include both time-varying and non-time varying independent variables. Non-time varying variables include gender, race, whether foreign born, field, and aspects of the person's Ph.D. institution. Time varying independent variables include marital status, children, employer characteristics, primary and secondary work activities, government support, and limited productivity measures (discussed below). These covariates are suggested by previous studies of academic promotion (Long, Allison, and McGinnis 1993, Ginther and Kahn 2004) . Table 1 gives descriptive statistics about both dependent and covariate variables at different stages of academic careers of scientists.\nResearch by Hayes (1999, 2003) , Ginther (2001 Ginther ( , 2003 Ginther ( , 2004 , and Ginther and Kahn (2004) demonstrates that employment outcomes differ by academic field. Thus, promotion is analyzed for all scientific fields together and broken down into three major scientific fields -biological and life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering.\nMeasures of academic productivity are largely missing from the SDR data, but the SDR does ask questions about publications in the 1983, 1995, and 2001 surveys. The 1983 question refers to publications between 1980 and 1983 whereas the 1995 and 2001 questions refer to numbers of publications in the previous five years. We use these data to create rough measures of cumulative papers presented and publications per year past Ph.D. If productivity data are missing for a particular year (as they are prior to 1980), average observed productivity is used to impute total productivity -an admitted rough correction which nevertheless seems preferable to omitting the information altogether.\nWe evaluate gender differences in academic careers using both probit and hazard methodologies. In our probit analyses, first we estimate whether significant gender differences exist in the probability of a tenure track job within five years of the Ph.D. In this estimation, we exclude doctoral recipients who were unlikely to have sought academic jobs as evidenced by their immediately entering non-academic jobs upon or prior to receipt of their Ph.D.\n1 Second,\nfor those who hold a tenure track job at some point in their careers, we estimate probit models of the probability of having tenure 11 years after Ph.D. In most scientific fields, this includes a period of one or more post-doctorates in addition to a period in tenure-track assistant professor We also use proportional hazard models with time varying-covariates to estimate the likelihood each year of becoming tenured, given that the individual has survived untenured until that point, and to estimate the likelihood each year of being promoted to full, given that the individual has received tenure but has not yet been promoted to full. 2 The hazard analysis allows time-varying covariates to change each year.\nBefore proceeding, we inject a word of caution about overall trends among science Ph.D.'s. We have grouped all scientists into three broad groups, life sciences, physical sciences and engineering. In this analysis, these three areas often have different characteristics. The problem is worse than usual when using averages, in that the combined science statistics on women are more likely to be picking up trends in the life sciences, where most of the women are, while the statistics on men are quite likely to pick up engineering which is heavily male.\nAccordingly, we point out when major facts differ across these broad areas."}, {"section_title": "Stepping Onto the Academic Career Ladder", "text": "The NSF conducts a census of doctorates granted in the U.S. in its Survey of Earned Doctorates. Based on these data, Figure 1 Other aspects of the time trends in assistant professorships (in Figure 2 ) compared to doctoral recipients (in Figure 1) Table 2 shows the gender differences once we control for covariates. (Results of the entire probit specifications are presented in Appendix Table A1 ). Even after controlling for age at Ph.D., cohort, race, origin, Ph.D. quality tier 3 and field in Model 2, there is a significant gender difference in the likelihood of being in a tenure track job five years after Ph.D. receipt. This difference is, however, entirely due to life sciences which has a significant and large gender difference in the likelihood in being in a tenure track job that increases to 7.7 percent once all of these covariates are added. In contrast, for engineering and physical sciences, the gender difference is small and insignificant.\nMarriage and fertility decisions may be affecting women's tenure track employment. To investigate this possibility, we include marital status, total number of children, an indicator for having children less than six years of age, and each of these interacted with gender (Table 2 Model 3). Some female interaction terms are statistically significant and suggest that family variables affect women and men quite differently.\nWith family characteristics entered as controls, the female coefficient in science as a whole, in life sciences, and in physical sciences becomes positive and statistically significant.\nThis indicates that single, childless women are between 11 percent in life science to 21 percent in physical science more likely to get a tenure track job within 5 years of the Ph.D. than single, childless men. In engineering, there is no significant difference.\nBeing married increases men's probability of getting a tenure track job by a whopping 22 percent, in science as a whole and for each field separately. Women's chances are also helped somewhat by marriage, but only by 5 percent. 4 As a result, in science as a whole a married man without children and a married woman without children are about equally likely to have a tenure track job five years after Ph.D..\nChildren create a marked divergence between men and women. For science as a whole, the presence of a pre-kindergarten aged child lowers women's likelihood of having a tenure track job by 8.1 percent. The presence of a grade school child has no effect. In contrast, for men, prekindergarten children have no effect on their likelihood of having a tenure track job while each child above six years old increases a man's probability of getting a tenure track job by 2.9 percent.\nSome gender differences in the impact of marriage and children differ by scientific field.\nOne of these is the impact of marriage on women. At one extreme, in engineering both sexes have equally large positive impacts of marriage (21-22%). In life sciences, marriage increases women's likelihood of entering a tenure track job by a more modest 7.9% (again compared to 22% for men). Finally, in physical science, marriage does not affect women's chances at all.\nDisaggregating children's impact by field, young children especially hurt the tenure-track prospects of women in life sciences (by -8.1%) and in physical sciences by (-5.6%). In engineering, while the point estimate is large (-9.8%), it is significant only at the 20% level.\nGrade school children are negatively correlated with having a tenure track job for physical science only, where the impact is relatively small (-3.4%).\nThe positive impact of marriage and children on men's prospects here recalls positive impact on wages and promotion in the labor market as a whole. There are three primary explanations for positive impacts. First, particularly with respect to marriage, it may be due to selection: \"good catches\" in the marriage market are correlated with \"good catches\" in the labor market. Second, it could be induced effort by people \"responsible\" for a family. Third, it could be favoritism by employers who know that the man has a family to support. The positivealthough smaller --effect of marriage on women here suggests selection. The favoritism explanation seems not to apply to women, since employers are more apt to be prejudiced against women with a family than for them. We return to these explanations in the conclusions.\nGender differences in the likelihood of receiving a tenure track job have changed over time. In additional specifications (available upon request), the gender difference between comparable men and single women ( actually saw even larger changes over cohorts, while engineering had no significant cohort differences between men and women."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Analysis of Moving Up the Career Ladder: Promotion of Academic Scientists", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Estimates of the Probability of Promotion to Tenure", "text": "Returning to Figure The top panel of Table 3 summarizes the impact of gender on the probability of being promoted to tenure as captured by probit and hazard analysis, before we allow gender differences in the impact of family variables. The top panel of Table 4 summarizes tenure results when family-gender interactions are included. (Appendix Table A2 provides detailed parameter estimates for the probit model. Hazard estimates are available by request).\nThe first row of Table 3 shows the probit analysis of gender differences in the probability of tenure by 11 years from the doctorate controlling for all variables including marriage and children, but without interaction terms. These results show no significant gender differences in tenure; the point estimates of the impact of being female even vary in sign across fields.\nHazard analyses are able to capture the entire year-by-year pattern of the likelihood of receiving tenure and thus in the duration until tenure. A particular strength of this analysis is that it takes into account those observed to not have received tenure by the last survey. The second row of Table 3 presents the risk ratios from a proportional hazards model of promotion regressed on a dummy variable for gender. This risk ratio can be interpreted as the effect of being female rather than male on the probability of receiving tenure. A number less than one indicates that on average the likelihood of tenure receipt in any given year for females is less than of males.\nThere is not a significant gender difference either for science as a whole or for any of the broad fields.\nThe third row of Table 3 (Model 1) shows the female risk ratio after accounting for differences in academic field, demographic, family and employer characteristics, primary and secondary work activity, and government grant support. The fourth row of Table 3 shows the female risk ratios that include productivity as well (Model 2). The risk ratios fall after controlling for these covariates in each field. This gender difference is not significant for science as a whole. By field, it is not significant except in the life sciences where women are 8 percent less likely to get tenure with all covariates, but only significant at the 10 percent level.\nTo illustrate how gender affects the likelihood of being promoted, in Figure 4 we have graphed a smoothed version of baseline survival function for men and women separately with the full set of covariates given in Model 2. Each baseline survival function is evaluated at the average characteristics of men and women respectively in the sample. The estimated survival function is then smoothed using a nonparametric kernel density estimator described in Allison (1995) . The graphs demonstrate that for science as a whole and for each broad field, males are slightly more likely to remain untenured over the entire period after controlling for all covariates.\nThus, the men's covariates lead them to have slightly lower levels of tenure, even though an identical man would have a higher level of tenure as a woman.\nOnce again, adding in controls for family, children and female-interactions changes the picture. Table 4 reports probit coefficients of these gender and family terms when included in addition to other covariates. 5 We have done the same estimation with hazard analyses (details available on request). Those results are qualitatively similar except where noted.\nAs was true with entrance into tenure track jobs, single women are more likely than single men to receive tenure. For science as a whole, the difference is 5.9 percent.\nDisaggregating by broad field, it is significantly true with a very large difference (20.7 percent) in engineering. In the life and physical sciences, differences between single men and women are not statistically significant.\nMarriage does not have as large an effect on men with regard to tenure receipt as it did for obtaining tenure track jobs. Marriage only significantly increases men's likelihood of tenure in engineering (by 12.2%) and in science as a whole (6.2%). Marriage does not have a statistically significant effect on women in any field. Combining this with the direct gender effect, married (childless) women have similar likelihoods of tenure as married (childless) men in life sciences and physical sciences. In engineering, married (childless) women have a 19%\nhigher likelihood of tenure in engineering ceteris paribus, similar to the difference between single men and women in engineering.\nEach school-aged child has a positive impact on the promotion probability of men in all fields. This is statistically significant in engineering (where the impact is 4.0 percent) and life science (with an impact of 2.8 percent). In physical sciences, the impact is not significant in the probit but is marginally significant in the more powerful hazard analysis. As was true in the previous section for entering the tenure track, the impact of younger children on men's tenure likelihood is zero in all fields. For women, pre-school children have no significant impact in any field (once again, adding together the 4 children coefficients). Grade school children have a large negative (-22.8%) impact on women's tenure in engineering only. This engineering result must be seen in the context of two other differences between engineering and other scientific fields. Engineering was the only field where young children did not hurt a woman's likelihood of being in a tenure track job five years after Ph.D., and engineering has the lowest incidence of post-docs (NSF 2006) . Together, these three facts suggest that women with children in all three fields are more likely to drop off the tenure-track career path within several years post-Ph.D.\nHowever, in engineering, this occurs while they are assistant professors.\nIn these specifications, other variables were allowed to have different coefficients for men and women if the interaction term was found significant in any specifications. We find that in the life sciences (only), otherwise identical women were not as likely as men to get tenure in the universities with the highest ranking. However, in the life sciences, private universities were less likely to give tenure in general, but women were penalized less than men. For men, the likelihood of receiving tenure fell over the cohort years. For women, this effect was smaller, still negative in life sciences but marginally positive in engineering and physical sciences."}, {"section_title": "B. Estimates of the Probability of Promotion to Full Professorship", "text": "Returning to Figure The first row of the bottom panel of Table 3 gives the probit coefficient on promotion to full professor (with covariates.). For all sciences pooled, there is a significant gender difference.\nBreaking this down by broad fields allows us to see that this is entirely due to life sciences, where women have a 9 percent lower likelihood of being promoted to a full professorship. In the other two fields, differences are not significantly different from zero. Table A3 provides detailed parameter estimates for the probit models. Hazard estimates are available on request. 7 In analysis not shown, we estimated the probability of promotion to full professor 17 and 19 years after Ph.D. for life scientists as well. While women are 5 percent less likely to be promoted to full professor by 15 years after Ph.D. receipt, they were 6 percent less likely by 17 years, but this difference is only significant at the 7 percent level. There was no significant difference in the probability of being promoted to full professor by 19 years after Ph.D. receipt.\nIn the hazard analysis of Table 3 , as before, the second row of the panel includes no covariates. The risk ratio from the proportional hazard analysis (without covariates) indicates highly significant gender differences in promotion to full in science as a whole. On average, the likelihood of promotion to full in any given year for females is 90 percent that of males.\nDisaggregating by field, physical science is the only one where women have a significantly lower likelihood of being promoted to full than men on average. In fact, in physical science the likelihood of being promoted to full professor in any given year for females is only 79 percent that of males.\nAdding in a full set of controls in the last two rows of Table 3 , however, moves the risk ratio in both the full sample and in physical sciences closer to one and makes them insignificant at standard levels of significance. Details on the family terms are reported in the bottom panel of Having school aged children has no effect on men's promotion to full, except in engineering where each child makes promotion 6.4 percent more likely. Having school aged children has an effect on women's promotion to full only in the physical sciences, where in this case it lowers the probability of becoming full by 9.6 percent Finally, having young children has no clear effect on full professorship for either sex in any field, with one exception: women in engineering. In engineering, young children may raise the probability of a woman receiving full in engineering (31.1%, significant at the 14% level).\nA few other variables were shown to have different impacts on men and women. As with tenure, presently working in a Research I university hurt women's chances of becoming full but not men's in life sciences and consequently in science as a whole. Similarly, for life sciences (and hence sciences as a whole), private universities significantly hurt women's chances of being promoted to full in the hazard model specifications--opposite to the gender difference found at promotion to tenure. Finally, unlike the tenure decision, both women's and men's likelihood of promotion to full worsen for later cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions: Putting Gender Differences in Promotion into Perspective", "text": "This paper has shown that within science as a whole, even without controls, there are no appreciable gender differences in the probability of receiving tenure, and only a five percent difference in the probability of promotion to full. Moreover, we can explain what differences that do exist in tenure and promotion to full professor by differences in academic field, demographic and employer characteristics, primary and secondary work activity, government grants, and publications. When broken down into broad fields, with controls there do seem to be some gender differences in promotion to tenure for life sciences only, on the order of approximately 8 percent. No broad fields demonstrate significant gender differences in promotion to full professor after including these covarates. The stage where there are gender differences is the entry stage, where there is a 3 percent gender difference in the likelihood of starting out in a tenure track job (within 5 years of Ph.D. receipt) even after controlling for these covariates.\nThese small or nonexistent gender differences mask much more substantial differences between men and women with identical kinds of family structures. In fact, single women are significantly more likely than single men to enter tenure track jobs and to be granted tenure ceteris paribus. Reversing this, single women who received tenure are much less likely to become full professors within fifteen years of Ph.D.\nMarriage greatly increases the likelihood than men get tenure track jobs (by 22 percent), but has smaller and generally less significant effects on men's promotion at either level.\nMarriage tends not to hurt women's likelihood of getting tenure track jobs, being granted tenure or becoming full. 8 Often, it helps. It is striking that marriage does not hurt women in science.\nDual career problems do not seem to deter women from getting a tenure track job, from getting tenure, or from becoming a full professor, despite the fact that more than 60 percent of women scientists are married to scientists (Rosser 2004) .\nThe presence of children, however, does disadvantage women during the early post-Ph.D.\nyears that coincide with the child-bearing window. In life sciences and physical sciences, children make it less likely for women to make it through the postdoc hurdle and get a tenure track job. In engineering, people tend to go directly from the doctorate receipt to jobs, bypassing the postdoc stage. Here, too, however, children make it less likely for women to be successful in academia during the early career years, lowering their likelihood of receiving tenure . Our results indicate that to some extent, women in science must make a choice between a family and an academic career. Opting out of academic career jobs because of children dovetails with some of Preston's (2004) results that show a major reason that women leave science is because of childcare responsibilities.\nIn contrast, for men the presence of grade school children (but not young children) is positively correlated with their likelihood of receiving tenure track jobs and receiving tenure. A gender difference is not surprising, given that men spend much less time than women in childcare, even in professional couples. Preston (2004) finds that those male scientists who do childcare have similar impacts on their academic careers.\nSome of these gender differences in family variables are likely to be selection. The widespread labor market disadvantages of single men suggests that the most able men tend to get married and have children. It is possible that the negative impact of children on women entering academic careers is also selection. We cannot know whether the women who have children during the \"formative\" years of their careers would be less devoted to their careers even in the absence of children (i.e. a selection story), or are being hampered by their presence. To some extent, this is a chicken and egg problem.\nThe estimated gender differences that we have found among women scientists entering academic jobs post-PhD. are different from the recent NSF report (NSF 2004b) using the same data set. Where we find that single women have greater rates entering tenure track jobs and being promoted to tenure and full (ceteris paribus), the NSF found no gender differences for entering tenure track jobs and lower rates of women promoted to full. Where the NSF found that marriage hurt women's careers at various stages, we find that marriage in the absence of children does not hurt. While NSF found negative impacts of children all levels, we find negative effect of children at the point of entry into tenure track jobs only. What accounts for these very different results?\nThere are some small differences in our research that are not responsible for the large discrepancies in results. However, the important explanation for differences between our results and the others is that we are looking only at the life sciences, physical sciences and engineering. In contrast, both Long et. al. (2001) and NSF define science as including social science. Indeed, there is a gender difference in academic promotion in social sciences which we have demonstrated in previous work. Ginther (2002) and Ginther and Kahn (2004) estimates the probability and duration to promotion for faculty in the social sciences and economics respectively. Ginther (2002a) finds a gender promotion gap in the social sciences that ranges between 10 to 12 percent (through 1997) with only half of the gap being explained by observable characteristics. In the field of economics, Kahn (1993) and Ginther and Kahn (2004) both find large gender promotion differences. Ginther and Kahn (2004) Our results on promotion in sciences also differ from findings by Hayes (1999, 2001 ) for faculty in the humanities. Using the 1977-1995 waves of the SDR and performing similar estimates, Ginther and Hayes find a gender promotion gap ranging between 7 to 9 percent. Some of the promotion gap in the humanities is explained by fertility and the treatment of work experience.\nTaking all of this work together, women's disadvantages in promotion to tenure not explained by any covariates are largest in economics and other social sciences, are smaller in the humanities (in part explained by marriage and family characteristics), and non-existent in the physical or life sciences or in engineering once all variables are taken into account.\nThis is not to say that there are no gender differences at all in academic science careers once scientists enter tenure track jobs. Salaries of men and women are significantly different.\nGinther (2001, 2003, 2004) show a significant gender salary gap in academic science especially at the full professor rank, after controlling for similar covariates including productivity. In 2001, male full professors in science earned 12 percent more than female full professors and onethird of this salary gap is not explained by observable characteristics (Ginther 2004 ). Although there is no significant difference in the likelihood of being promoted to full professor, compensation is apparently not equivalent.\nThere is some indication that the most prestigious schools are harsher on women than on men in the promotion process in the life sciences. We see this in both promotion to tenure and full, where working in a Research I university hurts women but helps men. Finally, in terms of promotion, our results agree with evidence from Long et. al. (2001) of improving conditions for women in science over the last quarter century. Notes: P-values in parentheses. Probit coefficient reports change in probability.
