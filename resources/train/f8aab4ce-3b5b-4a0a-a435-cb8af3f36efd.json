"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "68", "text": "Primary production in the oceans accounts for approximately half of the carbon fixed by 69 photosynthesis on a global scale (Field et al., 1998) . This production fuels the growth and reproduction 70 of living marine resources and is a critical factor exerting control over which species produce harvestable 71 surpluses, contributing to fishery yields (Ryther, 1969; Chassot et al., 2010; Stock et al., 2017) and global 72 food security (Perry, 2011; Christensen et al., 2015) . In addition to the production of continental shelf 73 species that are exploited in fisheries, there is also significant trophic transfer between open ocean 74 primary production and mesoplegic fishes on a global basis (Davison et al., 2013; Irigoien et al., 2014) . 75\nPhytoplankton also serve as a central linkage in ecosystem function (Sigman & Hain, 2012 ) and the 76 biogeochemical processes governing carbon flow and export flux (Doney et al., 2014; Laufkotter et al., 77 2016) . Oceanic photosynthetic production is geographically variable due to complex biophysical factors 78 controlling phytoplankton blooms that occur when the rate of cell reproduction exceeds the rates of 79 mortality associated with death and grazing (Behrenfeld & Boss, 2014; Cherkasheva et al., 2014) . 80\nVariability in blooms affect energy flow from phytoplankton production to pelagic and demersal 81 communities both horizontally and vertically in the water column (Corbiere et al., 2007) . 82 Bloom dynamics have been characterized on basin and global scales, identifying differing 83 patterns of bloom phenology (bloom timing and duration) by latitude and oceanic provinces. 84\nDescriptions of the spatial organization of bloom patterns have been complemented with analyses of 85 time series change in bloom dynamics utilizing a number of different sources of data. For example, a 86 study with a geographic focus in the North Atlantic found that spring bloom timing has advanced for 87 some temperate latitude regions and was delayed in other areas, whereas the fall and winter blooms 88 have been mostly delayed (Taboada & Anadon, 2014 ). Other longer-term studies identified the effects 89 of changing mixed layer dynamics on the relative strength of spring and fall blooms in the North Atlantic 90 (Martinez et al., 2011) cover (Kahru et al., 2011) . Changes in bloom magnitude and timing impact energy pulses in the 95 ecosystem, which in turn impact the growth and reproduction of higher trophic levels in the food web 96 (Cushing, 1990; Hunt et al., 2002; Platt et al., 2003; Schweigert et al., 2013; Malick et al., 2015) . 97\nClimate variation can modify bloom timing and size through mechanisms that influence water 98 column conditions such as the supply and ratio of nutrients and light availability. As climate systems 99 observations were considered for analysis; linear interpolation was used to fill missing values within the 164 range of the data and missing values outside the range were filled with the first and last observations at 165 the beginning or end of the time series, respectively. Hence, for each grid location, 806 bloom 166 determinations were attempted (46 attempts per year x 17.5 years) and each detected bloom was 167 associated with one of the 46 search start days of the year. From these data, we identified the search 168 start day of the year that yielded the dominant bloom, which was defined based on the search window 169 that yielded the highest number of bloom detections. If more than one start day yielded the highest 170 number of bloom detections, the dates were sorted sequentially and the median day was used as the 171 dominant bloom. With the 38,433 grid locations and factoring 806 bloom determinations per location, 172 ~31 million bloom determinations were attempted. 173\nBlooms were detected using the sequential averaging algorithm called STARS or \"sequential t-174 test analysis of regime shifts\" (Rodionov, 2004 (Rodionov, , 2006 which finds the change points in a time series. 175 STARS algorithm parameters were specified a priori: the alpha level used to test for a change in the 176 mean was set to \u03b1 = 0.1; the length criteria, the number of time steps to use when calculating the mean 177 level of a new regime, was set to 5; and, the Huber weight parameter, which determines the relative 178 weighting of outliers in the calculation of the regime mean, was set to 3. A bloom was considered to 179 have occurred if there was a period bracketed by a positive and negative change-point. We ignored 180 change-points (positive or negative) that occurred in the first or last two periods of the time series (8-181 day periods 1, 2, 22 and 23). The minimum duration of a bloom was three sample periods, which 182 represents the minimum span the algorithm needed to find a positive followed by a negative change-183 point. This method has been used in previous analyses of US Northeast Shelf (Friedland et al., 2008; 184 Friedland et al., 2015) , Arctic (Friedland & Todd, 2012) , and North Atlantic bloom patterns (Friedland & 185 Todd, 2012; Friedland et al., 2016) . 186\nWe extracted a suite of statistics to characterize the timing and size of each bloom event. For 187 each location, we calculated bloom frequency as the percentage of the years with a detected bloom in 188 study years with sufficient data to do a bloom determination. Bloom start was defined as the first day of 189 the year of the bloom period. Bloom duration was defined as the number of days of the bloom period.

We calculated Kendall's tau test for the significance (two-tailed test) of a monotonic time series 210 trend (Mann, 1945) for bloom start day, magnitude, intensity and duration of the dominant bloom. We 211 also calculated Theil-Sen slopes of trend, which is the median slope joining all pairs of observations. In 212 addition to absolute Theil-Sen slopes, we also calculated relative Theil-Sen slopes, where the slope is 213 joining each pair of observations divided by the first of the pair before the overall median is taken. Trend 214 tests and slope estimates were limited to grid locations with at least 10 detected blooms.

In addition to the data requirements on number of blooms, outliers, as identified as estimates 219 outside the range of \u00b12 standard deviations of the mean, were removed. Global mean trends were 220 expressed by trend test probability intervals and cumulative intervals. While individual grid cells with 221 probabilities > 0.05 inevitably have a Theil-Sen slope whose 95% confidence interval overlaps with zero, 222\nwe nevertheless opted to examine all probability intervals in order to see if any global or regional 223 patterns emerged in the direction and magnitude of the mean Theil-Sen slopes when examined across 224 all grid cells. Probabilities were rounded to intervals of 0.1 such that interval 0.0 includes p<0.05, 225 interval 0.1 includes 0.05\u2264p<0.15, etc. The cumulative trends are based on the same data as the interval 226 trends summing data over each progressive probability interval. Regional trends were based on eight 227 subdivisions of the world ocean (see Fig. 1 ) and the contrast between oligotrophic and non-oligotrophic 228 ocean areas, eutrophic and mesotrophic areas (see: ocean.acri.fr/multicolore for source of oligotrophic 229 ocean mask).

Bloom frequency had an interquartile range of 67 and 89% over the global ocean 254 (Fig. 2a) , which may seem low considering we selected the detection time frame that produced the most 255 bloom detections. An algorithm optimized to find the maximum number of blooms may be expected to 256 detect a bloom in most years. However, the bloom duration constraint in our algorithm will result in 257 characterization of bloom frequency less than 100% in areas where the dominant bloom tends to be a 258 multi-season event. This can be seen in the North Atlantic frequency data where a segment of the 259 Northeast Atlantic has relatively low bloom frequency; detailed analysis of this region showed the 260 blooms tended to be of long duration often exceeding the duration constraint resulting in non-detection 261 in some years (Friedland et al., 2016) . Most of the eastern North Pacific has bloom frequency closer to 262 the lower end of the interquartile range contrasting the distinct latitudinal patterns found in the South 263\nPacific. The South Atlantic and Indian oceans were dominated by high bloom frequencies. At the basin 264 scale, the North Atlantic exhibited the widest region where blooms were observed with a high 265 frequency. 266\nThe mean start day of the dominant bloom was arrayed primarily by latitude. At high latitudes in 267 the southern hemisphere, the dominant bloom started near the end of the calendar year typically 268 having start days in the 300s, November-December (Fig. 2b ). This coincides with austral spring. Mean bloom duration of the dominant bloom was longest in much of the oligotrophic ocean and 288 shortest in shelf seas and the higher latitude areas of the northern and southern hemispheres. Bloom 289 duration tended to exceed 60 days, or two months, in these oligotrophic ocean areas and was often as 290 short as one month in continental shelf ecosystems (Fig. 2d) . 291"}, {"section_title": "Effect of bloom timing on bloom duration and size 293", "text": "The timing of the dominant bloom was related to multiple measures of bloom size including bloom 294 duration, magnitude, and intensity. Over global scales, bloom timing was negatively correlated to bloom 295 duration, indicating that early blooms lasted longer than blooms that began later in the year (Fig. 3a) . 296\nVery few grid locations had significant positive correlations (~0.1%) indicative of early blooms of short 297 duration. Instead, fully half (50%) of the global grid was found to have significant negative relationship 298 between bloom start and duration. 299\nThe correlation between bloom start and magnitude was less well developed ( Fig. 3b ), but 300 reflected the strong correlation found with duration. Over the global grid, most locations had non-301 significant correlation between bloom start and magnitude (70%). For those locations with significant 302 correlations, 98% had significant negative correlation indicating that early blooms produced high 303 magnitude blooms. The latter result was most likely related to the underlying correlation between 304 bloom start and duration, as duration is a key component in the calculation of magnitude; longer lasting 305 blooms most likely have higher magnitudes. Locations with significant negative correlations between 306 bloom start and magnitude tended to occur at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. 307\nThe final relationship considered was that between bloom timing and intensity. These data 308 produced the weakest correlation field with 82% of the global grid found to be non-significant.

Distinct clusters of negative trends in bloom start day (i.e., 315 earlier blooms) can be seen in the southern Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans (Fig. 4a) . Distinct clusters 316 of positive trends in bloom magnitude (i.e., increasing magnitude) and bloom intensity (i.e., increases in 317 intensity) can be seen across higher latitudes in both northern and southern hemispheres ( Fig. 4b and  318 4c). Also negative trends in bloom magnitude and intensity were more common at low latitudes. Trends 319 in bloom duration with both positive and negative signs occurred, making spatial patterns difficult to 320 identify ( Fig. 4d) . 321\nMean relative Thiel-Sen slopes for bloom start day binned over latitude show that slopes tended 322 to be negative over most latitudes with the largest relative change found in the southern hemisphere 323 (Fig. 5a ). Mean slopes for magnitude were positive at high latitudes and negative for bands around the 324 equator ( Fig. 5b) , with positive slopes increasing with latitude. Mean slopes for intensity were arrayed 325 by latitude in a similar fashion to magnitude (Fig. 5c ). Mean relative Thiel-Sen slopes for bloom duration 326 tended to be positive over most latitudes with exception of a group of five high latitude northern bands 327 that were negative indicating a shortening of blooms at these latitudes (Fig. 5d) . 328\nMean relative Thiel-Sen slopes for bloom start day binned over longitude show that slopes 329 tended to be negative over most longitudes (Fig. 6a) . Mean slopes for magnitude were positive for most 330 longitudes with the exception of a cluster associated with the Indian Ocean (Fig. 6b) . Mean slopes for 331 intensity were arrayed by longitude in a similar fashion to magnitude (Fig. 6c) . Mean relative Thiel-Sen 332 slopes for bloom duration tended to be positive over most longitudes with exception of ranges of 333 longitudes associated with Indian and Atlantic oceans ( Relative Theil-Sen slopes of trends in SST suggest the most dramatic changes in thermal 346 condition have occurred at high latitudes associated with changes in patterns of sea ice extent and polar 347 amplification of climate change, noting however that most of these data fall outside the latitude 348 constraints (>62\u00b0 N/S) used here in most analyses (Fig. 6a) . At lower latitudes, SST trends were generally 349 positive with the exception of the parts of the North Atlantic, the western North Pacific, and the eastern 350 South Pacific. Salinity has increased and decreased dramatically in isolated high latitude locations in the 351\nNorth Atlantic, likely related to increase Arctic melting, where elsewhere over the global ocean there 352 has been a high degree of variability in salinity (Fig. 6b) . Mixed layer depth trends have been mostly 353 positive apparently to a higher degree in the southern hemisphere, although a lot of spatial variability in 354 trends is evident in the northern hemisphere (Fig. 6c) . Both zonal and meridional wind stress have 355 generally declined globally, with a pattern of zonal wind decline most intense along certain lines of 356 latitude (60\u00b0 S, 30\u00b0 S, 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0 N, and 60\u00b0 N) and meridional decline apparently circumscribing basin-scale 357 oceanic gyres (Figs. 6d&e, respectively) . Areas with the most intense declines in zonal wind stress 358 correspond to the transition zones between trade winds and westerly winds. 359\nTrends in abiotic factors were summarized by latitude and longitude in the same manner as 360 bloom parameter trends were summarized in Figure 5 . Mean relative Thiel-Sen slopes for SST binned 361 over latitude show that slopes tended to be positive over most latitudes with the largest relative 362 changes found at high latitudes, with a secondary peak just north of the equator (Fig. 7a) . SST slopes 363\nwere also positive over most longitudes with the exception of bands associated with parts of the North 364 Atlantic, the western North Pacific, and the eastern South Pacific (Fig. 7b) . There did not appear to be a 365 pattern in the latitudinal distribution of salinity slopes; however, the longitudinal pattern suggests an 366 anomalous freshening of the Indian Ocean compared to other ocean areas (Figs. 7c & d, respectively) . 367\nSlopes of mixed layer depth are mostly positive over latitudinal intervals, with the higher values at 368 higher latitudes and the only areas with negative slopes associated with the lower latitudes of the 369 northern hemisphere (Fig. 7e) . The increase in mixed layer depth appear highest in the Atlantic Ocean 370 basin compared to other areas based on longitudinal summary of slopes ( , respectively, which represents about a 10% increase in 383 both parameters (Fig. 8b&c) . The increases in these parameters in regions associated with statistically 384 significant shifts have been much greater and on the order of 0.9 mg m -3 8-day and 0.4 mg m -3 , 385\nrespectively, which represents about a 35% increase again for both. Bloom duration has shifted on the 386 order of 2 days longer on a global basis and for regions associated with statistically significant shifts, 387 blooms have lengthened on the order of one week (Fig. 8d) . 388\nThe bloom trends partitioned by the eight subdivisions of the world ocean and the between 389 oligotrophic and non-oligotrophic ocean areas differed from the global means in a number of ways. 390\nBloom start had negative trends, indicating earlier blooms, in all ocean areas; but, the trend was greater 391 in the southern oceans and in oligotrophic areas (Fig. 9a) . For regions associated with statistically 392 significant shifts, the North Atlantic had a positive bloom start trend suggesting that the bloom started 393 approximately five days later whereas the other ocean areas had negative trends suggesting shifts of 1-3 394 weeks (Fig. 10a) . Bloom magnitude and intensity had positive trends in the northern and southern 395 oceans and between oligotrophic and non-oligotrophic regions (Fig. 9b&c) . The tropical ocean areas 396 either had zero or negative trends in these parameters. The pattern of change in magnitude and 397 intensity in the regions associated with statistically significant shifts were nearly identical to the global 398 averages, but the size of the shifts was larger when considering only statistically significant results (Fig.  399   10b&c) . Bloom duration increased in all areas except the North Atlantic and tropical Indian oceans 400\nwhere trend confidence interval included zero (Fig. 10d) . The pattern of change in duration in the 401 regions associated with statistically significant shifts was similar to the global patterns; however, four 402 regions had confidence intervals that included zeros (Fig. 10d) . estimates of global trends in bloom duration were mostly negative indicating a tendency for blooms to 475 be shortened over global scales. We note, however, that their time series is shorter than that analyzed 476 here and bloom duration was estimated using a threshold approach (Siegel et al., 2002) , which as noted 477 above provides estimates of bloom duration 2-fold longer than ours. Hence, they are estimating a 478 different aspect of phytoplankton dynamics as we are focusing on the discrete portion of the bloom 479 associated with highly elevated [Chl] . 480 We view our results in the context of changes that have occurred and will likely occur to the 481 global climate system. Global thermal conditions are changing and it is important to consider change in 482 the level of system variability and its impact on ecosystems (Vazquez et al., 2017) . For phytoplankton, 483 change in thermal regime is having profound effects on atmospheric circulation and the forcing factors 484 related to bloom development, which may be more important than the direct effect of change in 485 thermal regime itself (Francis & Vavrus, 2015) . Changing thermal regimes have been associated with 486 shifting species composition of blooms, where for a fixed study site, blooms have become increasingly 487 dominated by the genus Synechococcus (Hunter-Cevera et al., 2016) . The changing role of cyanobacteria 488 is expected to have a profound effect on plankton dynamics in a range of aquatic systems (Visser et al., 489 2016) . We can also expect changes to the seasonal nature of blooms and likely 490 impacts on secondary production as well (Litchman et al., 2006) . The change in dominant bloom timing 491 we observed is consistent with the effect of an increase in global temperature and its role in mixed layer 492 dynamics, though the rate of stratification and turbulent mixing remains unclear (Franks, 2015) . documented increases in net primary production in the western Indian Ocean. However, a recent study 502 using the European Space Agency Ocean Color-Climate Change Initiative corroborate the current study's 503 findings of a reduction in chlorophyll over the past 16 years (Roxy et al., 2016) . These researchers 504 attributed this decrease to a reduction in available nutrients in the euphotic zone because a large 505 warming trend has increased stratification-induced trapping of nutrients in the deeper Indian Ocean. 506\nThe confounding influence of increasing SST trends on mixing and phytoplankton growth rates make 507 prediction of phytoplankton dynamics difficult especially in the Indian Ocean, an area experiencing the 508 largest warming trend in the tropical ocean. 509\nChange in phytoplankton bloom dynamics would be expected to impact the rate of flux of 510 particulate organic carbon (POC) from the water column to the benthos. Parts of the world ocean are 511 dominated by production cycles that are characterized by blooms associated with high concentrations of 512 biomass whereas other regions have bloom features that are not as prominent, though in many cases, 513 primary production can still be at a high level (Reygondeau et al., 2013) . However, phytoplankton 514 blooms, in particular, support conditions that result in the intense flux of POC (Reigstad et al., 2011; 515 Belley et al., 2016) . It follows that changes in the timing and size a bloom will affect the amount of POC 516 exported to the benthos. Over most regions of the globe, blooms appear to have lasted longer which 517 could result in an increase in POC flux. Bloom magnitude and intensity have changed over latitudinal 518 ranges, most notably with decreased bloom magnitude at low latitude and increases at high latitudes. 519\nSimilar changes in bloom magnitude across a range of latitudes were obtained in a study that used an 520 earth system model that included data assimilation to examine changes in North Pacific bloom 521 characteristics since the 1960s (Asch, 2013) . Together these results indicate that POC fluxes to the 522 benthos may increase at high latitudes, while decreasing at lower latitudes. These changes in bloom 523 dynamics should be taken into account in global carbon flux estimation models. 524\nThis study provides substantial evidence to support the observation that early blooms are longer 525 lasting blooms and conversely delayed bloom start is associated with shorter blooms. This phenomenon 526 has been described previously on a global scale (Racault et al., 2012) and for the North Atlantic 527 (Friedland et al., 2016) , with the latter study exploring the hypothesis that bloom duration is in large 528 measure shaped by grazing by zooplankton that have a diapause life cycle. It is important to note that 529 despite using a different bloom measurement methodology, results from Racault et al. (2012) agree 530 with the current study in the overall nature of the relationship, but differ in the fine scale regional 531 patterning of this correlation. 532\nThe observational results of this study provide some level of validation for earth systems models 533 that simulate global climate and ocean systems dynamics. Multiple earth system models suggest that 534 climate change will have the greatest impact on bloom phenology at high latitudes . 535\nUnder a business-as-usual emissions scenario, the month of maximum primary productivity is projected 536 to advance by 0.5-1 months by the end of the 21st across many ocean ecosystems. The exception to 537 this pattern is the oligotrophic subtropical gyres where delays in the timing of peak primary production 538 have been projected. These changes have been attributed to earlier easing of light limitation due to 539 increases in stratification . These future projections utilized earth system model 540 outputs with a monthly resolution, so additional research that can detect finer scale changes in 541 phenology is needed. One study that has used finer temporal resolution data from the NCAR 542\nCommunity Earth System Model (CESM) model assimilated historical data on atmospheric observations 543 and sea surface temperature (Asch, 2013) . In contrast to models of future projections, this study of 544 historical patterns identified the largest trends in bloom phenology in oligotrophic areas (Asch, 2013) , 545 which may reflect an influence of inter-annual climate variability rather than climate change. Our 546 observational results are consistent with this pattern and, thus, provide an indication of the skill of the 547 NCAR model, which did not assimilate any ocean color data. 548\nSpecies composition of phytoplankton communities varies over global scales and is principally 549 influenced by dispersion and competitive exclusion (Barton et al., 2010) . However, species composition 550 is also influenced by environmental conditions, such as mixing regimes and light conditions ( northward and are predicted to have the greatest potential impact on tropical phytoplankton diversity 560 (Thomas et al., 2012) . Considering the importance of species groups to the role of phytoplankton 561 production, the phenology of various methods to determine phytoplankton size has been compared 562 and the phenology of some methods has been connected to environmental 563 conditions (Cabr\u00e9 et al., 2016; Soppa et al., 2016) . However, the changes in phenology of various 564 phytoplankton groups have yet to be explored, which could provide refinements to both retrospective 565 and forecasted modelling efforts. 566"}, {"section_title": "567", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "568", "text": "The timing and size of phytoplankton blooms have changed on both regional and global scales. This 569 finding is important because blooms play a pivotal role in the flow of energy in marine ecosystems, 570 impacting the way food webs work and the way these ecosystems provide a range of services. The 571 dominant bloom was found to vary with latitude and in localized patterns associated with specific 572 oceanographic features. Blooms have increased in magnitude and intensity at high latitudes and 573 decreased in equatorial areas. Overall, blooms started earlier and lasted longer, with bloom timing 574 having the most profound effect on bloom duration; early blooms tending to last longer than later 575 starting blooms. This finding has the potential to impact phenological relationships between producer 576\nand consumer species such as mesozooplankton and higher trophic position fish and invertebrates. 577\nTiming mechanisms for reproduction in many species have evolved that ensure adequate forage for 578 early life stages, which may be impacted by changes in bloom timing. In regions where blooms last 579 longer and are associated with higher [Chl], the dynamics of the biological pump are likely to alter the 580 rate of carbon cycling and export in these ecosystems.

Figure 8 Mean global interval and cumulative trends in bloom start day (a), magnitude (b), intensity (c), and duration (d) versus Mann-Kendall trend test probability intervals. Trends are the product of Theil-Sen slopes for the dominant annual bloom and the number of years in the time series. Probability interval 0.0 includes p<0.05, interval 0.1 includes 0.05\u2264p<0.15, etc. Each interval estimate includes trends associated with that interval probability level only and are estimated from all data and from a subset excluding outliers. Cumulative trends are based on the same data as the interval trends summing data with each progressive probability interval. Only grid locations with at least ten years with detected blooms were included based on a global 1\u00b0 latitudinal/longitudinal grid over the study period 1998-2015 excluding data from latitudes north and south of 62\u00b0N and 62\u00b0S, respectively.
