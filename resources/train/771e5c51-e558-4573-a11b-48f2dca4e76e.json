Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2013;92:28Y35.\nObjective: Peak energy expenditure is highly correlated with usual gait speed; however, it is unknown whether the energetic cost of walking is also an important contributor to usual gait speed when considered as a component of peak walking capacity.\nDesign: The energetic cost of 5 mins of slow treadmill walking (0.67 m/sec), peak overground walking energy expenditure, and usual gait speed over 6 m were assessed cross-sectionally in 405 adults aged 33 to 94 yrs in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.\nResults: Mean (SD) energy expenditures during slow and peak sustained walking were 8.9 (1.4) and 18.38 (4.8) ml kg j1 min j1 , respectively. Overall, the energetic cost of slow walking as a percentage of peak walking energy expenditure was strongly associated with usual gait speed (P G 0.001); however in stratified analyses, this association was maintained only in those with peak walking capacity below 18.3 ml kg j1 min j1 (P = 0.04), the threshold associated with independent living.\nIn older persons with substantially reduced peak walking capacity, the energetic cost of walking is associated with gait speed, particularly when peak walking capacity nears the minimum level considered necessary for independent living. Thus, optimal habilitation in older frail persons may benefit from both improving fitness and reducing the energetic cost of walking."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "The most consistent age-related change in human gait is a decrease in self-selected usual gait speed, 1 beginning near age 60 years, when usual gait speed averages between 1.1 and 1.3 m/sec, and escalating near age 80 years, when the average drops to approximately 0.85 m/sec. 2 Accompanying this decline is an increase in the energetic cost of walking 3, 4 and a decrease in peak energy expenditure. 5, 6 Previous research in older adults has estimated that the energetic cost of walking per distance (ml kg j1 m j1 ) walked 7, 8 and per speed (ml kg j1 min j1 ) traveled is higher for older adults than for their younger counterparts, 4, 9 suggesting that the speed-aerobic demand association may vary with age. These age-related changes are not clearly understood but most likely result from a combination of factors including impaired aerobic capacity and reduced movement efficiency. Previous research in older adults has focused primarily on the independent factors affecting either peak aerobic capacity 7,10Y13 or movement efficiency, 14 but few studies have examined the combined effect of both peak aerobic capacity and the energetic cost on usual gait speed. 9, 12 Optimal biomechanics of walking during the gait cycle, including limb motion and displacement of the trunk and pelvis, contribute to minimizing energy expenditure. 15, 16 With age, alterations in these movement-related patterns contribute to reduced efficiency 4 and higher cost of walking. Reduced efficiency of mobility indicates that more work is required for a given task 8 and may suggest higher energy expenditure because of abnormal age-related mobility patterns, including increased step cadence and stride width and shorter stride length. Although altered gait patterns may improve stability, 17 they may also contribute to less efficient mobility and task-dependent energy expenditure, as the oxygen cost per meter of walking has been directly related to the extent of gait disorder. 18 Increasing variability in gait patterns and speed with age is common but is not normal and believed to be influenced by underlying pathology, 1, 17 including multisystem decline and subclinical disease. 19Y21 The consequences of these inefficiencies may contribute to reduced activity and slowed movement to conserve energy and minimize fatigue. 5 Such behavior may accelerate age-related deconditioning and thus progressively diminish energetic availability. Reduced energetic availability means that a high percentage of capacity must be used to perform everyday functional tasks. Over time, this may contribute to loss of autonomy as the cost of everyday tasks approaches 100% of peak energy availability.\nDifferences in walking energetics are unlikely to affect behavior in fit individuals, when energy availability is abundant. However, in unfit individuals, when energy availability is scarce, even small incremental increases in the energetic cost of walking may become problematic and may lead to increased fatigability and reduced self-selected, usual gait speed. Accordingly, to better understand loss of gait speed with age, it is critically important to evaluate energy availability (peak energy expenditure) while accounting for the energetic cost of walking, which may vary substantially across individuals and with age. Failure to account for both components may underestimate the minimal capacity required to ambulate and live independently. This study examined the energy expended during slow walking as a percentage of peak walking capacity over a wide range. Understanding the composite effect of both components may also help identify intervention strategies aimed at maximizing physical function in older persons."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design and Subjects", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging is a study of normative human aging established in 1958 and supported by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program.

Participant characteristics are detailed in Table 1 . Mean (SD) age was 68 (11.8) yrs, slightly more than half were men (53.3%), and body mass index averaged 26.8 (4.6) kg/m 2 .\nUsual gait speed ranged from 0.6 to 2.0 m/sec and averaged 1.2 (0.2) m/sec. Although progressively slower with advancing age, usual gait speed did not vary systematically with age in persons younger than 60 yrs (A = j0.005, P = 0.08). In persons 60 years or older, the magnitude of the slope between age and walking speed was more robust (A = j0.012, P G 0.001, P G 0.01 for interaction; Fig. 1 ).\nThe energetic cost of walking (ml kg j1 min j1 ) ranged from 5.3 to 14.8 ml kg j1 min j1 , averaged 8.9 (1.4) ml kg j1 min j1 , and tended to be higher with advancing age (Q = 0.24, P G 0.001, Fig. 2A ). Peak walking energy expenditure ranged from 8.9 to 45.0 ml kg j1 min j1 , averaged 18.4 (4.8) ml kg j1 min j1 , and was progressively lower with age (Q = j0.38, P G 0.001, Fig. 2B ).

Previous research has identified 18.3 ml kg j1 min j1 as the threshold of capacity required for independent function, 13 and other studies have found comparable values. 29, 30 In our sample, 216 (53%) individuals were below the 18.3 ml kg j1 min j1 peak threshold and were more likely to be older and female and to have a higher body mass index, greater ratio of fat to lean mass, slower gait speed, and a higher cost ratio (Table 3 ). In general linear models adjusted for age, sex, height, and body composition, the cost ratio significantly predicted gait speed only in those with a peak V O 2 below 18.3 ml kg j1 min j1 (Table 4 ).

In relatively healthy adults in mid to late life, the energetic cost of walking contributed to self-selected usual gait speed only in those with fitness levels below the threshold associated with independent living.\nIt is widely recognized that when oxygen intake during aerobic work does not meet demand, alterations in speed and intensity must occur. 31 The association between the cost ratio and usual gait speed in persons with low fitness indicates that when peak aerobic fitness reaches a critically low threshold, the cost of walking becomes a conditioning factor to speed, either directly, as a strategy to stay within boundaries of energy availability, or because the close match between energy availability and Gait Speed in Mid-to-Late Life utilization lowers the threshold of fatigue and imposes a behavioral change (Fig. 4) . Previous research suggests that rehabilitation to improve timing and coordination of movement may better impact efficiency than efforts to improve aerobic endurance. 32, 33 However, the importance of reserve capacity should not be overlooked. Recent studies evaluating the relative contribution of inefficiency and diminished capacity to slowing gait with age have shown a strong association between usual gait speed, peak aerobic capacity, and perceived exertion. 12 The present study builds on this work by simultaneously examining the age-associated upward trend in energetic cost in relation to the downward trend in peak walking energy expenditure in a large cohort of older adults free of mobility limitations. Furthermore, this study delineates the importance of maintaining functional capacity in adults older than 60 years when the relationship between the energetic cost of walking and usual gait speed becomes crucial even in healthy older adults without mobility limitations and underscores the importance of evaluating both energetic cost and availability in efforts to understand mechanisms that lead to slowing and in designing effective targets for intervention.\nSome limitations to this study should be noted. First, although the speed of the slow walking test (0.67 m/sec) (1) was consistent with the minimal demand of functional tasks and (2) allowed us to include deconditioned and very old individuals in the study, it was likely too slow for younger and more robust participants. Accordingly, the combined effect of walking on a treadmill at a fixed slow rate of speed may have actually increased the energetic cost of walking because of the U-shaped function of the speed-energy tradeoff. 34, 35 Although this phenomenon may tend to inflate the energetic cost of walking in more fit participants and diminish the correlation between age and energetic cost of walking, it should have minimal impact on the low-fitness analyses because these individuals are more likely to walk at an inherently slower pace. Second, cross-sectional data were used to estimate age-related changes in economy. Confirming these findings in a longitudinal cohort would strengthen these findings. Finally, the energetic cost of walking was estimated using a treadmill. Although using a treadmill ensures a steady rate of speed during individual testing and across age groups, it may alter step cadence and stance times, contributing to higher energy expenditure compared with overground walking. 36Y38 "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The mechanisms that underlie reduced gait speed with age are not well understood. Our study points to important connections between peak energy expenditure, energy cost, and usual gait speed. Findings highlight the energetic cost of walking as a looming threat to independence in persons with low fitnessVthe very old and the deconditionedVand suggest that future efforts target this group and evaluate mechanisms of inefficiency including muscle quality, gait mechanics, and energy-disease interactions."}]
