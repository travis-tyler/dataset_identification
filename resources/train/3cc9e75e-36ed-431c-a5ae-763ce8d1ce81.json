Our research design exploits contemporaneous, withinstudent comparisons made possible by a unique feature of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). Specifically, NELS:88 contains subject-specific outcomes for 8 th grade students in two subjects as well as data on their teachers for those subjects. Our analysis of these data indicates that assignment to a subject-certified teacher is associated with higher test scores. However, these gains appear to be concentrated in mathematics. It is not clear that subject-specific credentials promote student achievement in other subject areas. We also find that teachers with subject-specific credentials are not more likely to increase student engagement but are more likely to have negative opinions of a given student's performance. Our results indicate that assignment to mathematics teacher who is subject-certified may actually reduce the test scores of the very weakest students."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is a wide consensus among researchers that teacher quality is an important determinant of student achievement. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) explicitly acknowledged this view by requiring that every elementary and secondary public school teacher be \"highly qualified\" by the end of the upcoming school year. The NCLB's definition of \"highly qualified\" requires that teachers have bachelor degrees and state certification that has not been waived on a temporary or emergency basis. However, NCLB also requires that highly qualified teachers separately demonstrate proficiency in the subjects that they teach. For middle and highschool teachers, this \"demonstration of competency\" can be met by having a college major or graduate degree in the subject they teach, credits equivalent to a college major, passing a statedeveloped subject-matter test or having advanced certification. 1 These features of NCLB reflect the growing concern about \"out-of-field\" teaching. Outof-field teaching is typically defined as a situation where a teacher does not have an academic major or certification in the subject they teach (e.g., U.S. Department of Education 2004). In the 1999-2000 school year, nearly two-thirds of the middle-school teachers whose main assignment was mathematics (and roughly half of science teachers) did not have a major in their subject (U.S. Department of Education 2004, Table B -2). And roughly twenty percent of mathematics and science teachers did not have certification in their subject.\nCritics (e.g., Ingersoll 1999 , Jerald 2002 have argued that the prevalence of out-of-field teaching in such core academic subjects is \"unacceptably high.\" In particular, the concern is that 1 Veteran teachers can establish mastery of their subject matter by meeting their state's \"high, objective, and uniform standard of evaluation\" (HOUSSE). In most states, teachers can do this by earning a set number of points from a menu of approved activities. Walsh and Snyder (2004) criticize this approach, noting that many of the activities (e.g. working on a school committee, teacher mentoring) are only loosely related to mastery of subject matter. They also note that eleven states have argued that their existing systems of certification insure that teachers are proficient in their subjects.\nexposure to an out-of-field teacher compromises student achievement as measured by test scores as well as forms of achievement not well captured by standardized tests (e.g., student interest in the subject and critical thinking skills). Furthermore, out-of-field teaching may also contribute to achievement gaps since it occurs more frequently among poor and minority children as well as those in lower tracks.\nHowever, the direct evidence that out-of-field teaching actually harms student achievement is surprisingly limited.\n2 More specifically, it consists largely of a few crosssectional studies that focus on mathematics achievement at the high school level. This evidence consistently indicates that student performance is higher when the teacher has a college major, additional coursework or certification in their subject (e.g., Monk and King 1994 , Goldhaber and Brewer 1997 , Rowan, Chiang, and Miller 1997 . However, a fundamental concern with this limited evidence is that it may be biased by the unobserved determinants of student achievement. More specifically, these results could overstate the benefits of \"in-field\" teachers in the likely circumstance that students with an unobserved propensity for achievement (or achievement growth) are more likely to be assigned to such teachers.\nThis study presents new empirical evidence on whether teachers with subject-specific certification and degrees are more successful than other teachers at improving students' educational outcomes. This study contributes to the extant literature on this topic in at least four distinct ways. First, unlike prior studies, it focuses on all four major academic subjects (i.e., mathematics, science, social studies and English), not just mathematics. Second, we examine data on teachers and students at the middle school level (i.e., 8 th grade). Jerald (2002) notes that out-of-field teaching is much more common in middle schools than in high schools. However, the extent to which that is a problem depends on whether the subject proficiency of teachers matters as much in lower grades. Interestingly, NCLB regulations on teacher quality, which apply to both middle and high school teachers, are based on the implicit assumption that subject proficiency is important for middle-school teachers.\nThird, in addition to test scores, this study also examines other important educational outcomes that may be influenced by exposure to out-of-field teachers. These include student selfreports of their interest in particular subjects as well as teacher perceptions of the performance of individual students. Fourth, and perhaps most important, this study adopts an identification strategy that unambiguously eliminates the bias that could occur in cross-sectional evaluations if students' unobserved propensity for achievement is correlated with the subject-specific qualifications of their teachers. More specifically, this study examines the effects of teacher qualifications in models that condition on student fixed effects.\nThis type of panel analysis is possible because of a unique feature of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). Specifically, NELS:88 collected data from each of the sampled student's teachers in two of four distinct academic subjects (i.e., mathematics, science, social studies, English). This implies that NELS:88 contains contemporaneous data on student outcomes and teacher observables in two different academic subjects. The availability of these \"matched pairs\" data makes it possible to estimate how the same student performed when assigned to teachers whose subject qualifications differed.\nThis study is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief overview of the relevant literature on teacher quality. Then we discuss the NELS:88 data and our econometric specifications. The next section presents our results and the final section concludes with some discussion of how these results relate to the prior literature and what they mean for current policies."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Qualifications and Quality", "text": "Recent studies indicate that there is substantial variation in the quality of teaching within schools (e.g., Rockoff 2004 , Hanushek et al. 1998 . For example, Hanushek et al. (1998) find that teacher quality accounts for at least 7 percent of the total variation in student achievement. And, Rockoff (2004) finds that a one standard-deviation increase in teacher quality raises student achievement in reading and math by 0.1 standard deviations. However, while the importance of teacher quality seems uncontested, the importance of specific, observed teacher characteristics is often highly controversial.\nFor example, teacher pay is often linked to the completion of postsecondary degrees.\nHowever, the available evidence on whether teachers with more advanced degrees are more effective is mixed. 3 Another area of particular controversy involves whether teachers who have obtained state certification are more effective than those who have not. In general, teacher certification requires completion of a teacher-preparation program (i.e., course work in education and experience as a student teacher) and some evidence of subject-area knowledge (e.g., passing a subject test, a college major in the field to be taught). Proponents of teacher certification (e.g., Darling-Hammond 2002) argue that these procedures insure that teachers have the professional skills and knowledge (e.g., classroom management, curriculum development and pedagogical technique) that are particularly critical for the education of at-risk students. Darling-Hammond (2004) also claims that teacher education reduces attrition from the profession.\n3 See Wayne and Youngs (2003) and Goldhaber and Anthony (2003) for discussions of this literature. For more recent studies, see Jepsen and Rivkin (2002) , Jepsen (2005) , and Hanushek et al. (2005) .\nHowever, critics charge that the evidence linking certification to teacher quality is \"astonishingly deficient\" and that the impediments created by the certification process discourage high-ability individuals from ever entering the teaching profession (Walsh 2002 The mixed evidence on the effects of teacher degrees and certification may partly reflect the fact that prior studies did not identify whether the teacher credential was specific to the subject being taught. However, this is not entirely clear since there are relatively few studies that examine the effectiveness of teachers with subject-specific credentials. For example, in a recent review of the literature on teacher quality, Wayne and Youngs (2003) found only three studies of subject-specific teacher degrees and certification (Monk and King 1994 , Goldhaber and Brewer 1997 whose research design met their criteria for being \"compelling as opposed to merely suggestive.\" 4 However, these three studies cited by Wayne and Youngs (2003) do suggest that \"infield\" teachers are more effective than \"out-of-field\" teachers. For example, using data from the Longitudinal Survey of American Youth (LSAY), Monk and King (1994) found that high schools students had higher gain scores in mathematics when assigned to teachers who had more course work in mathematics. Similarly, using data from 10 th and 12 th graders in NELS:88, Brewer (1997, 2000) found that, conditional on prior achievement, students assigned to teachers with math certification or a mathematics degree had significantly higher math scores than students whose teachers lacked these traits. However, Goldhaber and Brewer (2000) found statistically insignificant results for models of science achievement. Goldhaber and Brewer (2000) also found that the performance of teachers with probationary and temporary certification in subject was indistinguishable from that of those with regular certification. They argued that this \"casts doubt\" on the claim that standard certification should be required of all teachers. 5 Rowan, Chiang, and Miller (1997) found that 10 th graders in NELS:88 had higher scores in mathematics when their teacher had a college degree in math."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "This study attempts to address some of the gaps in this literature. For example, the prior evidence focuses exclusively on high school students while this study focuses on outcomes among 8 th graders. Critics (e.g., Jerald 2002) allege that out-of-field teaching is a particular problem in both middle and high schools. Furthermore, the regulations that apply to subjectspecific teacher credentials are often the same for high and middle school teachers (most notably, as in NCLB). However, it is quite possible that out-of-field teaching is less relevant for younger students since they are following a less advanced curriculum.\nSecond, the prior literature largely focuses on teacher qualifications and student outcomes in math and science. However, this study examines teacher qualifications and outcomes in four major academic areas (i.e., mathematics, science, social studies and English). The prior emphasis on mathematics is in some sense justifiable. Specifically, mathematics may provide a relatively powerful test of the effects of out-of-field teaching because the correspondence between a college degree in mathematics and the material being taught is relatively strong. In contrast, a middle-school science teacher who has a degree in biology would be classified as \"in-field\" but 5 However, Darling-Hammond et al. (2001) criticize this inference noting, among other things, that there are relatively few teachers with probationary or emergency credentials in NELS:88 data. This study does not address the distinction between regular and alternative certification. 6 They also found that students had higher mathematics achievement when with a teacher who answered a specific algebra question correctly.\nmay not be particularly effective in teaching material related to physics and chemistry. Similarly, a social-studies teacher with a degree in sociology or economics may technically be \"in-field\" but have relative little proficiency in history. In light of these possibilities, additional evidence from fields other than mathematics is relevant for evaluating current policies.\nThird, the prior studies focused exclusively on test scores as an outcome measure. Apart from concerns about the meaning of variation in low-stakes tests, there is the possibility that test scores may fail to capture some of the important educational consequences of out-of-field teaching. Specifically, Ingersoll (1999) suggests that out-of-field teachers may be less effective at promoting the intellectual engagement and enthusiasm of students. This study examines this question using student-reported attitudes towards each academic subject. This study also examines teacher perceptions of an individual student's performance as outcome measures.\nThough not commonly studied by economists, a teacher's subjective perception of a student's performance is a potentially important outcome because, even when it is inaccurate, it can influence the student's access to future opportunities."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "Fourth, the prior studies rely exclusively on cross-sectional comparisons; that is, regression-adjusted differences in achievement across students who were assigned to in-field teachers relative to those who were not. One concern with this approach is that the students who are assigned to teachers with \"better\" observables are more likely to be those with an unobserved propensity for high achievement. In fact, we found using the NELS:88 data described below that the within-school assignment to an in-field teacher was significantly and positively related to socioeconomic status. This suggests that prior studies may overstate the true benefits of a subject-qualified teacher. The approach to addressing this \"omitted variables\" problem has been to estimate \"value-added\" specifications that condition on prior achievement. However, that procedure may not address the source of bias adequately. More specifically, the students assigned to subject-qualified teachers may also be those who have an unobserved propensity for achievement growth (e.g., high-SES students who may have less \"summer learning melt\"). In the next section, we introduce data and methods that address this concern in an alternative manner."}, {"section_title": "Data and specifications", "text": "The National Education NELS:88 also fielded questionnaires to the teachers responsible for teaching each of the selected students in two of four academic subjects: mathematics, science, reading, and social studies. The surveyed teachers were chosen by randomly assigning each school to one of four subject-area groupings: mathematics/reading, mathematics/social studies, science/reading, and science/social studies. Two completed teacher surveys are available for 21,324 of the 8 th grade students because of some non-response and because some students did not have a class in one or both of their assigned academic subjects. Eliminating students who attended private schools reduces the sample to 16,901 students. However, because the unit of observation is each teacherstudent pairing, the final data set consists of 33,802 observations (Table 1) .\nThe students participating in NELS:88 completed multiple-choice tests in the subjects taught by these teachers. 8 For purposes of this analysis, the formula scores on these tests have been standardized by subject so that the changes in these scores (STEST) can be understood as effect sizes. The other outcome variables used in this study reflect the student's perceptions of an academic subject and the teacher's perceptions of the sampled student.\nThis analysis focuses on three variables reflecting the students' perception of the class and subject taught by the responding teacher. More specifically, students were asked whether they see the subject as useful for their future, whether they look forward to class in the subject and whether they are afraid to ask questions in that subject. The students were given four options in response to these questions (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree), which are coded as integers from 1 to 4. However, for ease of interpretation, the order of the responses to the \"afraid\" question was reversed. This implies that, for each of the three questions, higher values of the ordinal response imply a negative view of the subject. Furthermore, within each subject, the responses to each of these three questions were standardized (Table 1) to create the variables used in this analysis (i.e., NOTUSE, NOTLF, AFASK).\nThe remaining outcome variables used in this study are three pejorative teacher assessments: whether the student rarely completed homework (NOHWK), whether the student was seen as consistently inattentive (INATT) or frequently disruptive (DISRUPT). The response options to these questions were simply yes or no, so these three variables are binary. One potential complication with the association between these variables and student outcomes is that a student may become disruptive or inattentive simply because they have mastered the classroom material relative to their peers. However, the data do not support that hypothesis. More specifically, using these NELS:88 data, we found that, conditional on student and subject fixed effects, students performed significantly lower on subject tests when the teacher for that subject viewed them negatively. The students viewed negatively by teachers were also substantially less likely than other students in their school to take any Advanced Placement courses over the subsequent two years and more likely to have dropped out of high school. However, a complication that does appear to be relevant to this analysis is that an in-field teacher may be more likely to view a student pejoratively simply because they have higher expectations (e.g., assign more homework).\nThe two key independent variables used in this study are dummy variables, one (SCERTIFD) indicating whether the teacher is state-certified in the subject they are teaching and another (MAJOR) indicating whether they have an undergraduate or graduate major in the subject they are teaching. However, a number of other controls for teacher and classroom observables are also included in the regression models discussed below. These include dummy variables for the gender and race-ethnicity of the teacher as well as two dummy variables that identify whether the student shares the teacher's gender and the teacher's race-ethnicity (Table   1) . 9 Teacher experience is measured by 10 categorical dummies (Table 1) . This relatively unrestrictive approach to measuring teacher experience may important given the evidence of non-linear returns to teacher experience (e.g., Hanushek et al. 2005) . The final controls capture two observable traits of the teacher's class, the number of students in the class and the percentage of students in the class who are limited English proficient (LEP).\nThe basic econometric specification used to evaluate the determinants of these outcomes (i.e., Y ist ) for student i in subject s with teacher t takes the following form:\n9 Prior research suggests that a demographically similar teacher may influence student outcomes through phenomenon like role-model effects, stereotype threat and teacher biases (e.g., Dee 2004 Dee , 2005 Hanushek et al. 2005 ).\nY ist = \u03b1 i + \u00b5 s + \u03b2 1 X 1t + \u03b2 2 X 2st + \u03b2 3 X 3it + \u03b2 4 X 4ist + \u03b5 ist .\nThe terms, \u03b1 i and \u00b5 s , refer respectively to student and subject fixed effects while \u03b5 ist is a meanzero random error term. The remaining terms refer respectively to variables that are specific to teachers (e.g., TFEMALE), to teachers when teaching a particular subject (e.g., SCERTIFD, MAJOR), to teachers when with a particular student (e.g., OTHSEX, OTHRACE) and to students in particular classes (e.g., PCTLEP). The error term in this equation could be heteroskedastic at the level of the student, the classroom, the teacher or the school. We experimented with White standard errors clustered at these levels. We found that clustering at the school level led to the most conservative (i.e., the largest) standard errors and we report those\nhere. This approach is also an appropriate one given the clustered nature of NELS:88's sampling design.\nAs discussed earlier, one of the potentially useful innovations of this specification is that it eliminates the possibly confounding influence of student unobservables that are correlated with both student achievement and assignment to subject-qualified teachers. To examine the potential importance of this approach, we also present the estimated effects of SCERTIFD and MAJOR in models that condition on school fixed effects instead of student fixed effects. Furthermore, as discussed earlier, the effects of SCERTIFD and MAJOR may matter more in some subjects (e.g., mathematics) than in others. To examine this issue, we also present the results of models that interact SCERTIFD and MAJOR with the subject fixed effects. We also examine the effects of these variables in sub-samples defined by school and student traits (e.g., urbanicity, race, and socioeconomic status)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In Table 2 , we present the key results of specifications that examine the effects of SCERTIFD and MAJOR on student test scores. The results in columns (1) and (2), which condition on school -not student -fixed effects suggest that assignment to a teacher with either of these traits increases achievement by quite large and significant amounts. However, in models that condition on student fixed effects, these point estimates are noticeably smaller. These comparative results suggest that, within schools, students with an unobserved propensity for achievement are more likely to be assigned to subject-qualified teachers. The differences in these point estimates are large relative to the sampling variation. In particular, the point estimates reported in columns (1) and (2) are outside the 95-percent confidence intervals associated with the remaining estimates.\nThe results from models that condition on student fixed effects and SCERTIFD suggest that assignment to a teacher with an undergraduate or graduate degree in the subject being taught has small and statistically significant effects on student achievement. These results also suggest that assignment to a subject-certified teacher increases achievement by 0.051 to 0.059 standard deviations and are not biased by the assignment of high achieving students to subject-qualified teachers.\nSince critics (e.g., Ingersoll 1999 , Jerald 2002 ) are particularly concerned with the effects and differential occurrence of out-of-field teaching on high risk subgroups, we investigate the effect of SCERTIFID on the tests scores of different populations in the sample. These results are presented in Table 3 , in which we examine how the results in Table 2 might differ by the urbanicity of the school or by the observed traits of individual students (i.e., race-ethnicity, gender and SES status). This exercise is highly qualified since reductions in sample size lead to meaningful losses in statistical power in virtually all cases. However, two interesting results emerged from these evaluations. One is that the benefits of subject-certified teachers appear to be particularly large in urban schools. Second, there is weakly significant evidence that assignment to a teacher with a subject major actually led to weakly significant reductions in achievement among minority students. These opposing results do not clearly confirm the assertion (Ingersoll 1999 , Jerald 2002 ) that certified teachers are particularly necessary for typically at-risk students.\nWe next turn to variables associated with students' perceptions of their teachers and the subject matter. In Table 4 , we present evidence on whether \"in-field\" teachers are more effective at promoting engagement among students. The results indicate that assignment to a teacher with subject-specific certification or a degree in the subject did not reduce the likelihood that the student would see the subject as not useful. Similarly, assignment to a subject-qualified teacher did not significantly influence the likelihood the student would not look forward to the subject or feel afraid to ask questions.\nIn Table 5 , we present the key results from models where the teacher's perceptions of the sampled student are the dependent variables. Interestingly, these results suggest that subjectcertified teachers were more likely to have negative perceptions of their students. More specifically, subject-certified teachers were 3 to 4 percentage points more likely to see a given student as rarely completing homework and frequently inattentive. Given that means for each of these perceptions is approximately 0.22, these point estimates are fairly large.\nIn order to examine the effects of SCERTID in each subject, we present the results of models for each of the 7 dependent variables where the effects of SCERTID are interacted with the subject fixed effects. The results, summarized in The results presented here suggest that, at least in mathematics, 8 th grade students benefit from subject-qualified teachers. However, one of the interesting caveats is that a subjectqualified teacher is more likely to have a poor opinion of a particular student. Of course, these results are internally consistent since the manner in which subject-qualified teachers increase student achievement may involve their high expectations for homework and attentiveness.\nNonetheless, the pejorative perceptions that a teacher maintains could also harm a student's relative educational opportunities in more informal ways (e.g., recommendations for future placement and the nature of classroom interactions).\nThis pattern of results may suggest another, more important qualification. The discussion and evidence on teacher quality tends to assume that a \"highly qualified\" teacher is effective for every type of student. However, this assumption may not be valid. In particular, it may be that the students most at-risk of academic failure are harmed by dramatic mismatches between their likely outcomes and the relatively high expectations of \"in-field\" teachers. This possibility is suggested by the evidence that subject-qualified teachers maintain poorer opinions of a given student as well as by the earlier evidence that MAJOR is associated with lower achievement among minority students (Table 3) .\nTo examine this issue further, we assess whether subject-qualified teachers have different effects at different points in the test-score distribution. Specifically, we constructed seven dummy variables for whether a student's standardized test score was greater than or equal to certain values (i.e., -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5). We then estimated specifications where these dummy variables were the dependent variables. The results of this application are reported in Table 7 .\nThese results suggest that, at most points in the test-score distribution, assignment to a mathematics teacher who is certified in mathematics increases the probability of having a high test score. The sole exception is in the far left tail of the test-score distribution, the lowest achieving students. There, assignment to a subject-certified mathematics teacher significantly reduces the likelihood that a student's test score will be greater than -1.5."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Recent efforts to insure that every public school teacher is \"highly qualified\" have focused on teacher proficiency (i.e., certification and a postsecondary major) in the subject that they teach. But are teachers with these subject-specific qualifications really more effective? The results of our study suggest that, at least at the middle-school level, the answer to this question is decidedly mixed.\nFor example, we found that assignment to a mathematics teacher with certification in that subject increased student test scores by at least 0.11 standard deviations. And an increase of this magnitude is by no means trivial. One particularly relevant point of comparison is the minority achievement gap. Improving the relative academic performance of minority students is one of the most important educational goals in the United States. In the 1999 NAEP mathematics exam, the gap between white and Hispanic 13 year olds was approximately 0.74 standard deviations; between white and Black students, this gap was 0.98 standard deviations (U.S. Department of Education 2002). This implies that just one year with a subject-certified mathematics teacher in a predominantly minority school would close the achievement gap in that subject by at least 11\npercent.\nAn issue of interpretation that is worth underscoring is that these models do not indicate the nature of the structural relationship between subject certification and test scores. For example, it could be that the requirements of subject certification make teachers better than they otherwise would be (i.e., a human-capital explanation). Alternatively, it could be that more able teachers undertake the costs of such certification (i.e., a signaling explanation). 12 From the perspective of a marginal decision (e.g., whether to hire a teacher with particular credentials), this caveat is not necessarily important since the goal is to identify high-quality teachers.\nHowever, this distinction may be more relevant for considering the \"general equilibrium\" impact of policies like NCLB that ostensibly require subject-specific credentials of all teachers. For example, if subject certification were merely a sorting device that currently distinguishes teachers with native ability from those without, the effects of requiring subject certification of all teachers could be attenuated.\nOur results also indicate that the educational returns to a subject-qualified teacher in areas other than mathematics are smaller and statistically indistinguishable from zero. These findings could reflect the possibility that subject proficiency in these areas is less relevant at the middle school level. Alternatively, it could that subject proficiency does matter in these subjects but that\n12 One way to discriminate between these explanations is to evaluate models that include teacher fixed effects. Such an approach is possible since responding teachers taught some subjects for which they were in-field and others for which they were not. However, as a practical matter, there are too few of such teachers in the data to generate much statistical power.\ncertification and academic majors, as currently regulated, fail to insure that proficiency. This could occur, for example, if a middle-school science teacher had a college degree in only one part of the science curriculum (e.g., physics, not biology). Regardless, these results raise some considerable doubt about how policy makers have chosen to identify high-quality teachers as well as about the academic consequences of out-of-field teaching at the middle-school level.\nOur results with respect to educational outcomes other than test scores compound these concerns. Specifically, we found that subject-qualified teachers were not significantly more effective than other teachers at promoting students' engagement and comfort with their subject.\nFurthermore, we found that subject-qualified teachers were more likely to view their students pejoratively (i.e., as inattentive and not completing homework). Of course, those teacher perceptions may reflect the relatively high expectations of subject-qualified teachers and those expectations may, on average, promote student achievement. However, our results also suggest that, at least in mathematics, \"in-field\" teachers actually reduce the achievement of the very weakest students. These results suggest that researchers and policy makers should be aware of the possibility that the determinants of \"highly qualified\" teaching may not be as uniform as policy initiatives suggest. Instead, effective teaching can depend on the interactions of teacher traits and those of the individual students that they engage.
