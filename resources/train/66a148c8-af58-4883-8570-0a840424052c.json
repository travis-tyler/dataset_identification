[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Paralysis after spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to a dramatic loss of sub-lesional lean tissue mass (LTM) during the first year after acute injury; with increasing duration of injury (DOI), declines in supra-lesional compartments are also reported to occur. 1 Even the maintenance of favorable body composition is difficult to achieve because of the inability to engage in normal levels of physical activity, with greater reductions in energy expenditure reported in persons with higher levels of neurological impairment. 2 Disuse atrophy and physical inactivity each contribute to decreased energy expenditure, and without appropriate caloric restriction, result in increased adiposity that may eventually lead to adverse metabolic consequences. 3,4 These body composition and metabolic outcomes could negatively affect physical function, health and wellness, social integration, quality of life and may likely be associated with increased cost of care. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) in persons with SCI may reduce levels of serum testosterone (T), which may further result in the adverse composition changes. [5][6][7][8][9][10][11] Low serum T levels are observed in 39-46% of men with SCI and percent of low levels are increased for each decade of life compared to the ablebodied male population. 7,12 Serum T concentrations have been reported to be inversely related to DOI. 5,13 Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in ablebodied men results in favorable changes in body composition, with increased LTM and decreased fat tissue mass (FTM). 14,15 In a previous report from our group, 12 months of TRT in hypogonadal men with SCI was demonstrated to be safe and effective at increasing LTM and energy expenditure. 16 As such, in men with chronic SCI, appropriately monitored TRT offers a logical and efficacious approach to treat clinically low T and improve body composition. The question not addressed in our initial report, however, was whether or not the favorable changes persisted once TRT is discontinued. Previous work performed by the administration of anabolic agents in the elderly resulted in conflicting findings with regard to the persistence of the favorable changes on body composition of T and growth hormone administration. 17,18 The primary objective of this report is to describe the changes to LTM and energy expenditure 6 months after discontinuation of TRT; additional participants were added to the treatment group in this study from our prior report. 16 "}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods Participants", "text": "Twenty-four healthy non-ambulatory men (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) with sensorimotor impairment (AIS A, B, or C)) between the ages of 18 and 65, >1 year post-SCI, were recruited for participation from SCI Service of the James J.

All subjects who received TRT were discontinued from therapy and followed for an additional 6 months, at which time repeated measurements for body composition, energy expenditure, and pertinent laboratory values were obtained. Participants were instructed to maintain their usual diet and physical activity/exercise schedule over the course of the study. The total time for participation in the study for hypogonadal and eugonadal subjects was 24 months. Eugonadal subjects were evaluated for study endpoints in conjunction with their scheduled routine annual medical examinations at baseline, 12 and 24 months. After enrollment, hypogonadal subjects had a 6-month lead-in period to confirm their hypogonadal status prior to the initiation of TRT, 12 months of TRT (TRT-12M), and then a 6-month follow-up observation without TRT (Post-TRT). There were no statistical differences between outcome variables collected at the start of the lead-in period from those obtained immediately prior to initiating TRT; because these lead-in time points were essentially redundant, only a single baseline time point representing testing acquired immediately prior to initiating TRT has been reported. The time point at 24 months from baseline in the eugonadal group was used to compare to the time point at 18 months from baseline in the hypogonadal group (a 6month lead-in period was only performed in the TRT group). Of the 24 individuals enrolled, 13 subjects were designated hypogonadal (treatment group) and 11 subjects, eugonadal (control group), as determined by serum total T concentrations. For the purposes of this study, hypogonadism was defined as a serum total T concentration \u226411.3 nmol/l, and eugonadal, \u226511.4 nmol/l, a threshold value not in accordance with the current Endocrine Society definition for hypogonadism; 19 this value for low T was also employed in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. 20 Our investigation was initiated prior to the publication of the 2006 recommendations by the Endocrine Society, 21 which was the first consensus document to provide guidance on clinical treatment of hypogonadism. All blood collections during the study were performed between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. For screening purposes, all participants had blood drawn for total T on three separate occasions and the average concentration was used to determine group assignment (e.g., hypogonadal or eugonadal). Because of interruption to somatosensory innervation, somatic symptoms of hypogonadism are often not perceived by persons with SCI, or cannot be differentiated from the consequences of SCI (e.g., depression, decreased libido, and a decreased sense of well-being are not uncommon symptoms in persons with SCI). Thus, there was the absence of the ability to correlate levels of serum T to the presence or absence of symptoms of hypogonadism per se as one of the determining factors prior to initiating TRT. After the 6-month lead-in period, TRT was initiated in the treatment group for 12 months using a daily 5 mg T patch (Androderm, Watson Pharma Inc., Corona, CA). At 6 months, all 13 participants receiving TRT had T concentrations within the expected physiological range. Because of difficulty coordinating bathing and placement of the T patch, the time of placement varied. Subjects were instructed to place the patch on a clean, dry, and shaved, if necessary, area of the skin on the thighs or abdomen. Placement in the evening was recommended but accomplished in only 4 of 13 participants (\u223c21:00 hours), and placement of the patch in the others was performed in the morning (\u223c09:00 hours). After 2 months of TRT, the serum concentration of T was determined 9-12 hours after patch placement. If serum T levels were not within normal physiologic range, the dose was increased to 10 mg (two patches) daily for the remaining 10 months of treatment. After 2 months, 6 of the 13 subjects in the treatment group required titration to a dose of 10 mg daily. To prevent skin irritation, T patch application sites were rotated among various sites anatomically located on the quadriceps and abdomen, with a 10-day interval between repeated uses of the same placement location. Subjects were instructed on the use of a potent topical corticosteroid (e.g., triamcinolone) cream at the application site if skin irritation developed. Patch compliance was monitored and determined by inventory of the number of patches returned each month. The average rate of compliance was 97% (\u00b13.3%) for the entire treatment period. Total body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, comprehensive physical examination, and laboratory work were performed at baseline prior to initiating TRT, after TRT-12M, and Post-TRT. Laboratory values and a comprehensive physical examination were also obtained at the 2-and 6-month time point after initiation of TRT and have previously been reported. 16 Subjects in the control group completed the same laboratory work and body composition testing at baseline, 12 and 24 months."}, {"section_title": "Laboratory analysis", "text": "Analysis for serum T and serum PSA were performed by Quest Diagnostics, Inc.

A metabolic cart (V-Max Encore 229, CareFusion, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) was used to measure exhaled air from subjects for fractions of mixed expired oxygen (O 2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ; FEO 2 and FECO 2 ). Using the dilution technique, a high-flow pump pulls expired air that is captured by a ventilated plexiglass canopy that covers the head. The flow rate of the pump was determined by the fraction of CO 2 in the air. The pump rate was adjusted by the technician to maintain an FECO 2 % between 0.5 and 1.0% (room to expired air ratio of 4:1) as the VE fluctuated. A mass-flow sensor was used to measure volume and air flow, and was calibrated before each testing session with a certified 3-l calibration syringe. A measured stroke volume \u00b13% at various flow rates was required to achieve successful calibration. Gas analyzers were calibrated prior to each testing session by using two calibration gas concentrations (Cal 1: 16% O 2 and 4% CO 2 ; Cal 2: 26% O 2 and 0% CO 2 ) and room air (20.94% O 2 and 0.05% CO 2 ) and calibration was completed when O 2 and CO 2 concentrations were no greater than \u00b10.05% of the expected values. Subjects arrived at the laboratory for testing between the hours of 8:00 and 10:00 a.m., following a 12-hour fast, with a minimum of 24 hours free from any type of exercise. Subjects were transferred to comfortable bed and instructed to lie still in a quiet, softly lit room for 20 minutes prior to testing. Data were collected under steady-state conditions defined as \u00b15% change in respiratory quotient and \u00b110% change in VO 2 and V E for 5 consecutive minutes. Predicted basal energy expenditure (BEE) was determined by the Harris-Benedict equation, 24 and the percentage of predicted was calculated as follows: % predicted energy expenditure = REE/BEE \u00d7 100. VO 2 and VCO 2 were continuously measured, averaged every 20 seconds, and converted to REE using the abbreviated Weir equation 25 27 and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) 27 were performed, as referenced.\nThe groups were not significantly different at baseline for energy expenditure (Table 2).

In the treatment group, REE at Post-TRT was not statistically different from TRT-12M, but was significantly elevated (P < 0.05) from the baseline level (Table 2). To corroborate this treatment and retention effect on energy expenditure, similar patterns (e.g. increases from baseline to month 12, no significant change between TRT-12M and Post-TRT, and Post-TRT levels remained elevated compared to baseline) were observed in the treatment group for VO 2 and % predicted energy expenditure."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Values are expressed as group mean \u00b1 SD.

At Post-TRT, serum T concentrations decreased significantly from the month 12 to baseline value (P < 0.01; Table 3). In the treatment group, serum HDL-C level increased at month 12 (P < 0.05) and remained at a similarly higher concentration at Post-TRT (Table 3). In both groups, there were no additional significant differences in lipoprotein parameters at baseline or over the course of the study, and all other values remained within the normal range.

There were no reports of mood fluctuations, depression, or other feelings of anxiety during the course of TRT. Similarly, there were no adverse events reported after T was discontinued."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This report, which has expanded upon our prior findings, 16 demonstrated in hypogonadal men with chronic SCI that discontinuation of TRT resulted in an expected fall in serum T to pre-treatment levels, but what was not anticipated was the retention of LTM 6 months after discontinuation of TRT. Because clinical trials are designed to test a therapeutic intervention, and not usually designed to describe endpoints after discontinuation of a treatment modality, there have been a limited number of clinical trials that have addressed the retention of favorable changes in body composition induced by TRT. 17,18 Sattler et al. recruited 108 communitydwelling elderly men (71 \u00b1 4 years) who were placed on transdermal T and recombinant growth hormone therapy for 16 weeks with subsequent evaluation at week 28; in those subjects who had attained serum T levels in the 'youthful' range on TRT and who also had improvements in body composition measures above for LTM or below for FTM of these respective group medians at study week 17, significant retention of favorable changes in body composition persisted at week 28 17 ; no additional time points were evaluated in this study for retention of favorable changes after 28 weeks. Thus, the Sattler et al. study raises the possibility that if the decline in physical function in the frail elderly can be sufficiently reversed, then the gains in muscle mass and strength may be retained by improved functional capacity, breaking the downward cycle of ever increasing weakness and debility. In contrast, in 242 frail elderly men administered TRT for 6 months (74 \u00b1 6 years), O'Connell et al. 18 failed to find retention of favorable changes in body composition 6 months after stopping anabolic therapy, without any interim measurements obtained 6-12 months after discontinuation of the hormonal intervention. It should be  appreciated that the pathophysiology of the frail elderly is distinct from that of a stable, relatively young individuals with SCI, which includes those participants in our study who were 33-49 years old. Despite the return of serum T concentration in our SCI treatment cohort to baseline levels 6 months after discontinuation of TRT, the beneficial changes to body composition and energy expenditure persisted for 6 months after discontinuation of treatment. If the TRT-induced gains in muscle mass are attained in younger persons with SCI, then it may be quite possible to consolidate, and possibly build upon, these gains by the associated hormonally induced improvements in level of energy, mood, and functional capacity. In addition, a multi-disciplinary approach that incorporates appropriate diet and exercise paradigms during and after the TRT may be speculated to offer the possibility of having the greatest and most enduring impact on body composition and functional outcomes. TRT has been shown to have positive effects on body composition, with associated increases of LTM and decreases of FTM. [28][29][30] Details of the effects of TRT on soft tissue body composition changes that led to overall weight gain have been previously reported. 16 It should be noted that the magnitude of this change in body soft tissue was the result of increased total body LTM (+2.7 kg), which, by comparison with the anabolic treatment cohort in the Sattler et al. 17 article, would place our SCI participants in the upper end of the 'high responder' groupthat is, those most likely to retain their beneficial changes in body composition at least 3 months after discontinuation of the anabolic intervention. The increase observed in LTM of the trunk and legs was an unexpected finding because of the presence of muscle paralysis and immobility in the lower extremities and portions of the trunk. The presence of increased and retained REE in the treatment group 6 months after discontinuing TRT compared to the baseline value serves to further confirm the positive and persistent changes observed to LTM, whereas if REE had not been concomitantly increased, then an argument may have been reasonable advanced that extracellular water had confounded our measurement. 31 The implications of increasing LTM and energy expenditure in the paralyzed portion of the body was not determined in our current study, but perhaps such soft tissue body composition changes may reduce the propensity for abnormal metabolic changes, 9,32 a possibility that was not able to be assessed with any sense of certainty in our current study. Our data suggest a trend for reduction in total body percent fat, but absolute changes in FTM after TRT were not consistent or significant, possibly due to the limited size and the inherent diversity of our study sample. Positive correlations between serum HDL-C and T concentrations have been observed in an able-bodied cohort. 33 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 studies suggested that TRT results in a small decrease in the level of serum HDL-C (\u22120.49 mg/dl; 95% CI, 1.35-5.01), as well as an increase in hemoglobin concentration (0.3.18%; 95% CI, \u22120.85 to \u22120.13). 34 Our treatment group had an approximate 13% improvement in mean serum HDL-C concentration during TRT that persisted after discontinuation of TRT, despite T concentrations reverting to baseline levels; it should be appreciated that over the same time interval the control group had a 10% improvement in mean serum HDL-C concentration. Because the difference in mean serum HDL-C between the T and control groups from baseline to the time point after discontinuation of TRT for 6 months was essentially negligible, it would not be prudent or appropriate, in the authors' opinion, to further discuss the potential beneficial effects of TRT on serum HDL-C in our report. Persons with SCI have been reported to have an increased risk for coronary artery disease [35][36][37] and serum HDL concentrations are frequently depressed, sometimes markedly. 38,39 In the general population, the association between low T and increased risk of cardiovascular disease is currently being established. 40 In consideration of the elevated prevalence of low serum T concentration in men with SCI 7 and the aforementioned risk for cardiac-related disease, [35][36][37] it may be prudent to consider screening for depressed serum T levels in the routine evaluation of men with chronic SCI. In our relatively limited cohort, the average hemoglobin concentration was not changed during or after discontinuation of TRT. Extended longitudinal investigations in persons with SCI are difficult to perform because of frequent acute illness, access to transportation, and, as in the ablebodied population, compliance with medication and follow-up visits. These considerations contributed to our unbalanced study design, with a few subjects terminating participation prior to the final study time point. Although salutary changes to body composition, energy expenditure, and possibly serum HDL-C concentration resulted from TRT in our SCI cohort, the translation and/or relevance of these findings as they may relate to functional gain, mood, strength, and sexual function could not be addressed with any degree of certainty in this report. Compared to similar treatment trials in the general population, our prospective clinical trial was relatively small and this limited our ability to address other endpoints of interest. As such, future randomized, controlled clinical trials should be performed to confirm our findings, as well as extend them to relevant clinical outcomes. Similarly, to maximize further the changes observed in soft tissue body composition by administration of TRT (e.g. favorable and opposite changes in lean and fat tissue mass), the possibility may be considered of concomitantly employing appropriate nutritional counseling and/or exercise training."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Twelve months of clinician-supervised TRT in hypogonadal men with chronic SCI was safe and effective with beneficial changes observed to body composition, energy expenditure, and, possibly, serum HDL-C levels. Six months after discontinuation of TRT, when serum T concentration returned to pre-treatment levels, beneficial changes persisted to LTM, energy expenditure, and, possibly, serum HDL-C concentration. Larger prospective randomized-controlled trials in hypogonadal men with SCI are required to determine whether TRT is safe and effective at maintaining concentrations of T in the normal physiological range with associated potential favorable outcomes of improved carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, higher functional performance, heightened mood, greater independence, and enhanced social integration."}, {"section_title": "Disclaimer statements", "text": "Contributors All authors had significant contributions to the study design, performance, data analysis/ interpretation, manuscript development and approval of the final document.
