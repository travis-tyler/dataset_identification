In a phylodynamic context, it is assumed that each lineage, represented by a branch in the phylogenetic tree, belongs to a single patient and that lineage divergence events, represented by tree nodes, coincide with transmission events (10) . Thus, branches in a dated phylogeny represent intervals of time between divergence events interpreted as transmission events. This situation can be translated in terms of survival analysis, which models rates of event occurrence, by considering divergence as the event of interest and by treating branch lengths as time-to-event intervals ( Fig.   1C -D). Phylogenetic survival analysis was devised by E. Paradis and applied to detecting temporal variations in the divergence rate of tanagers (11) or fishes (14) , but it has not been applied to pathogens so far (12, 15, 16) .\nTo quantify the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the transmission rate of COVID-19, we adapted the original model in (11) to account for the specific setting of viral phylodynamics (see Methods). Hereafter, we refer to the modified model as phylodynamic survival analysis. In survival analysis terms, we interpret internal branches of the phylogeny (those that end with a transmission event) as time-to-event intervals and terminal branches (those that end with a sampling event) as censored intervals ( Fig. 1C ; see Methods). The time-to-event intervals are loosely related to the so-called clinical onset serial interval, which is the delay between the onset of symptoms in the source and infected patients in a transmission pair (but see (17) ).\nThe predictors of interest in our setting, namely, the non-pharmaceutical interventions, vary both through time and across lineages depending on their geographic location. To model this, we assigned each divergence event (and subsequent branch) to a country using maximumlikelihood ancestral state reconstruction (18) . Each assigned branch was then associated with the .

Contrasting with home containment, the effectiveness of education lockdown has been more hotly debated. This intervention ranked among the most effective ones in a study of 41 countries (4) but had virtually no effect on transmission in other reports from Europe (8, 9) .\nChildren have been estimated to be poor spreaders of COVID-19 and less susceptible than adults to develop disease after an infectious contact, counteracting the effect of their higher contact rate (6, 30) . However, the relative susceptibility to infection was shown to increase sharply between 15 and 25 years, from 0.40 to 0.79 (30) . Importantly, we could not differentiate the effect of closing schools and universities because both closures coincided in all countries. Thus, our finding that education lockdowns reduce COVID-19 transmission might be driven by contact rate reductions in older students rather than in children, as hypothesized elsewhere (4), and, in addition, by parents staying at home with their children.\nRestrictions on gatherings of >100 persons appeared more effective than cancelling public events ( percent changes, -22.3% vs. -1.0%, respectively) in our phylodynamic model, in line with previous results from epidemiological models (4) . Notwithstanding that gathering restrictions prohibit public events, possibly causing interferences between estimates (Fig. 3C) , this finding is intriguing. Indeed, several public events resulted in large case clusters, the so-called superspreading events, that triggered epidemic bursts in France (31), South Korea (32) or the U.S. (33) . A plausible explanation for not detecting the effectiveness of cancelling public events is that data-driven models, including ours, better capture the cumulative effect of more frequent events such as gatherings than the massive effect of much rarer events such as superspreading public events. This bias towards ignoring the so-called 'Black Swan' exceptional events (34) suggests that our findings (and others' (4)) regarding restrictions on public events should not be interpreted as an encouragement to relax these restrictions but as a potential limit of modelling approaches (but see (35) ).\nThere are other limitations to our study, including its retrospective design. We could not consider important non-pharmaceutical interventions that are difficult to date and quantify, such as contact tracing or case isolation policies. Data were analyzed at the national level, although much virus transmission was often concentrated in specific areas and some non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented at the sub-national level (36) .

The number of genomes included by country did not necessarily reflect the true number of cases, which might have influenced country comparison results in Fig. 2 , but not intervention effectiveness models in Fig. 3 which were adjusted for between-country variations of . Finally, our estimates represent averages over many countries with different epidemiological contexts, healthcare systems, cultural behaviors and nuances in intervention implementation details and population compliance. This global approach facilitates unifying the interpretation of intervention effectiveness, but this interpretation still needs to be adjusted to local contexts by policy makers.\nBeyond the insights gained into the impact of interventions against COVID-19, our findings highlight how phylodynamic survival analysis can help leverage pathogen sequence data to estimate epidemiological parameters. Contrasting with the Bayesian approaches adopted by most, if not all, previous assessments of intervention effectiveness (4, 7, 9) , phylodynamic survival analysis does not require any quantitative prior assumption or constraint on model parameters. The method should also be simple to implement and extend by leveraging the extensive software arsenal of survival modelling. Phylodynamic survival analysis may complement epidemiological models as pathogen sequences accumulate, allowing to address increasingly complex questions relevant to public health strategies.\n.

We focused on large-scale interventions against transmission that did not target specific patients (for instance, we did not consider contact tracing) and we excluded economic and health interventions except for information campaigns. This rationale led to the selection of the 9 indicators shown in Table 1 . To facilitate interpretation while constraining model complexity, the ordinal-scale indicators in OxCGRT data were recoded as binary variables in which we only considered government requirements (as opposed to recommendations) where applicable. We did not distinguish between localized and nation-wide interventions because localized interventions, especially in larger countries, targeted the identified epidemic hotspots.\nAs the data did not allow to differentiate closures of schools and universities, we use the term 'education lockdown' (as opposed to 'school closure' in (23)) to avoid misinterpretation regarding the education levels concerned.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted August 26, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180927 doi: medRxiv preprint forward in time, the internal branches of a tree connect two divergence events while terminal branches, those that end with a tip, connect a divergence event and a sampling event (Fig. 1B) .\nThus, we considered internal branches as time-to-event intervals and terminal branches as censored intervals representing the minimal duration during which no divergence occurred (Fig. 1C) .\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted August 26, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180927 doi: medRxiv preprint\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted August 26, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08. 24.20180927 doi: medRxiv preprint with mean equal to the sum of the means and variance equal to the sum of the variance-covariance matrix of the deviates.

Noteworthy, this effect can be counteracted by a high extinction rate (16, 47) , which is expected in our setting and mimicks an acceleration of diversification. Moreover, whether the diversification slowdown should be interpreted as a pure artifact has been controversial (49, 50) . Notwithstanding, we considered incomplete sampling as a potential source of bias in our analyses because a diversification slowdown might lead to an overestimation of the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Additionally, the selection procedure used by Nextstrain to collect genomes included in the dated phylogeny possibly amplified the diversification slowdown by using a higher sampling fraction in earlier phases of the epidemic (40). To verify whether the conclusions of our models were robust to this potential bias, we built an additional multivariate model including the estimated date of each divergence event (the origin of the branch) as a covariate. The possible relation between time and the divergence rate is expectedly non-linear (47) and coefficient variations resulting from controlling for time were moderate (Table S1) , thus, we refrained from including a time covariate in the reported regression models as this might lead to overcontrol. Further research is warranted to identify an optimal function of time that might be included as a covariate in phylodynamic survival models to control for sources of diversification slowdown."}, {"section_title": "Phylodynamic survival models estimate variations of the reproduction number", "text": "The evolution of lineages in a dated viral phylogeny can be described as a birth-death process with a divergence (or birth) rate and an extinction (or death) rate (20) .

To quantify this potential time-dependent bias, we constructed an additional model including the age of each branch as a covariate (Table S1 ). The coefficients in this time-adjusted model only differed by small amounts compared to the base model. Moreover, the ranking by effectiveness of the major interventions remained unchanged, indicating that our estimates were robust to time-dependent confounders.\nWe also quantified the sensitivity of the estimated intervention effects to the inclusion of other interventions (collinearity) by excluding interventions one by one in 9 additional models ( Fig. 3C ). This pairwise interaction analysis confirmed that most of the estimated effects were strongly independent. Residual interferences were found for gathering restrictions, whose fullmodel effect of -22.3% was reinforced to -33.5% when ignoring home containment; and for cancelling public events, whose full-model effect of -0.97% was reinforced to -15.1% when ignoring gathering restrictions. These residual interferences make epidemiological sense because home containment prevents gatherings and gathering restrictions also prohibit public events.\nOverall, the absence of strong interferences indicated that our multivariate model reasonably captured the independent, cumulative effect of interventions, enabling ranking their impact on COVID-19 spread.\n.
