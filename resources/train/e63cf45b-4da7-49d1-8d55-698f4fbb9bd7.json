[{"section_title": "", "text": "\u2022 In addition, two indicators provide insights from the Center's recent work on technology in education. The first previews key findings from the Center's upcoming report, Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom. For example, the percentage of students who use the Internet at home varied by parental education level in 2015, ranging from 42 percent for children whose parents had not completed high school to 71 percent for those whose parents had completed a bachelor's or higher degree. The second presents findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress's 8th-grade Technology and Engineering Literacy (TEL) assessment. For example, in 2014 female students scored higher than male students on the TEL assessment. As new data are released throughout the year, indicators will be updated and made available on the Condition of Education website. In addition, the Center produces a wide range of reports and datasets designed to help inform policymakers and the public. For more information on our latest activities and releases, please visit us online or follow us on Twitter and Facebook. The Condition of Education contains indicators on the state of education in the United States, from prekindergarten through postsecondary education, as well as labor force outcomes and international comparisons. This report is available on the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) website as a full PDF, as individual indicator PDFs, and in HTML. In both the PDF and HTML versions, indicators are hyperlinked to tables in the Digest of Education Statistics. These tables contain the source data used in the most recent edition of the Condition of Education."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Estimates", "text": "The data in these indicators were obtained from many different sources-including students and teachers, state education agencies, local elementary and secondary schools, and colleges and universities-using surveys and compilations of administrative records. Users should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. Differences in aspects such as procedures, timing, question phrasing, and interviewer training can affect the comparability of results across data sources. Most indicators in The Condition of Education summarize data from surveys conducted by NCES or by the Census Bureau with support from NCES. Brief descriptions of the major NCES surveys used in these indicators can be found in the Guide to Sources. More detailed descriptions can be obtained on the NCES website under \"Surveys and Programs.\" The Guide to Sources also includes information on non-NCES sources used to develop indicators, such as the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) and Current Population Survey (CPS). For further details on the ACS, see http://www.census.gov/acs/www/. For further details on the CPS, see http://www.census.gov/cps/. Data for The Condition of Education indicators are obtained from two types of surveys: universe surveys and sample surveys. In universe surveys, information is collected from every member of the population. For example, in a survey regarding certain expenditures of public elementary and secondary schools, data would be obtained from each school district in the United States. When data from an entire population are available, estimates of the total population or a subpopulation are made by simply summing the units in the population or subpopulation. As a result, there is no sampling error, and observed differences are reported as true. Since universe surveys are often expensive and time consuming, many surveys collect data from a sample of the population of interest (sample survey). For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assesses a representative sample of students rather than the entire population of students. When a sample survey is used, statistical uncertainty is introduced, because the data come from only a portion of the entire population. This statistical uncertainty must be considered when reporting estimates and making comparisons. For more information, please see the section on standard errors below. Various types of statistics derived from universe and sample surveys are reported in The Condition of Education. Many indicators report the size of a population or a subpopulation, and often the size of a subpopulation is expressed as a percentage of the total population. In addition, the average (or mean) value of some characteristic of the population or subpopulation may be reported. The average is obtained by summing the values for all members of the population and dividing the sum by the size of the population. An example is the annual average salaries of full-time instructional faculty at degree-granting postsecondary institutions. Another measure that is sometimes used is the median. The median is the midpoint value of a characteristic at or above which 50 percent of the population is estimated to fall, and at or below which 50 percent of the population is estimated to fall. An example is the median annual earnings of young adults who are full-time, full-year wage and salary workers."}, {"section_title": "Standard Errors", "text": "Using estimates calculated from data based on a sample of the population requires consideration of several factors before the estimates become meaningful. When using data from a sample, some margin of error will always be present in estimations of characteristics of the total population or subpopulation because the data are available from only a portion of the total population. Consequently, data from samples can provide only an approximation of the true or actual value. The margin of error of an estimate, or the range of potential true or actual values, depends on several factors such as the amount of variation in the responses, the size and representativeness of the sample, and the size of the subgroup for which the estimate is computed. The magnitude of this margin of error is measured by what statisticians call the \"standard error\" of an estimate. Larger standard errors typically mean that the estimate is less accurate, while smaller standard errors typically indicate that the estimate is more accurate. When data from sample surveys are reported, the standard error is calculated for each estimate. The standard errors for all estimated totals, means, medians, or percentages are reported in the reference tables. In order to caution the reader when interpreting findings in the indicators, estimates from sample surveys are flagged with a \"!\" when the standard error is between 30 and 50 percent of the estimate, and suppressed with a \" \u2021\" when the standard error is 50 percent of the estimate or greater. The Condition of Education 2017 | v"}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis and Interpretation", "text": "When estimates are from a sample, caution is warranted when drawing conclusions about whether one estimate is different in comparison to another; about whether a time series of estimates is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same; or about whether two variables are associated. Although one estimate may appear to be larger than another, a statistical test may find that the apparent difference between them is not measurable due to the uncertainty around the estimates. In this case, the estimates will be described as having no measurable difference, meaning that the difference between them is not statistically significant. Whether differences in means or percentages are statistically significant can be determined using the standard errors of the estimates. In the indicators in The Condition of Education and other reports produced by NCES, when differences are statistically significant, the probability that the difference occurred by chance is less than 5 percent, according to NCES standards. For all indicators that report estimates based on samples, differences between estimates (including increases and decreases) are stated only when they are statistically significant. To determine whether differences reported are statistically significant, most indicators use two-tailed t tests at the .05 level. The t test formula for determining statistical significance is adjusted when the samples being compared are dependent. The analyses are not adjusted for multiple comparisons, with the exception of indicators that use NAEP data. All analyses in the NAEP indicators are conducted using the NAEP Data Explorer, which makes adjustments for comparisons involving a variable with more than two categories. The NAEP Data Explorer makes such adjustments using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate. When the variables to be tested are postulated to form a trend over time, the relationship may be tested using linear regression or ANOVA trend analyses instead of a series of t tests. Indicators that use other methods of statistical comparison include a separate technical notes section. For more information on data analysis, please see the NCES Statistical Standards, Standard 5-1, available at http://nces.ed.gov/ statprog/2012/pdf/Chapter5.pdf. Multivariate analyses, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models, provide information on whether the relationship between an independent variable and an outcome measure (such as group differences in the outcome measure) persists, after taking into account other variables, such as student, family, and school characteristics. For COE indicators that include a regression analysis, multiple categorical or continuous independent variables are entered simultaneously. A significant regression coefficient indicates an association between the dependent (outcome) variable and the independent variable, after controlling for other independent variables included in the regression model. Data presented in the indicators typically do not investigate more complex hypotheses or support causal inferences. We encourage readers who are interested in more complex questions and in-depth analysis to explore other NCES resources, including publications, online data tools, and public-and restricted-use datasets at http://nces.ed.gov. A number of considerations influence the ultimate selection of the data years to feature in the indicators. To make analyses as timely as possible, the latest year of available data is shown. The choice of comparison years is often also based on the need to show the earliest available survey year, as in the case of the NAEP and the international assessment surveys. In the case of surveys with long time frames, such as surveys measuring enrollment, a decade's beginning year (e.g., 1990 or 2000) often starts the trend line. In the figures and tables of the indicators, intervening years are selected in increments in order to show the general trend. The narrative for the indicators typically compares the most current year's data with those from the initial year and then with those from a more recent period. Where applicable, the narrative may also note years in which the data begin to diverge from previous trends."}, {"section_title": "Rounding and Other Considerations", "text": "All calculations within the indicators in this report are based on unrounded estimates. Therefore, the reader may find that a calculation, such as a difference or a percentage change, cited in the text or figure may not be identical to the calculation obtained by using the rounded values shown in the accompanying tables. Although values reported in the reference tables are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent), values reported in each indicator are generally rounded to whole numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above rounded to the next highest whole number). Due to rounding, cumulative percentages may sometimes equal 99 or 101 percent rather than 100 percent. While the data labels on the figures have been rounded to whole numbers, the graphical presentation of these data is based on the unrounded estimates."}, {"section_title": "Race and Ethnicity", "text": "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for the standards that govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. The OMB revised the guidelines on racial/ ethnic categories used by the federal government in October 1997, with a January 2003 deadline for implementation. The revised standards require a minimum of these five categories for data on race: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. The standards also require the collection of data on ethnicity categories, at a minimum, Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino. It is important to note that Hispanic origin is an ethnicity rather than a race, and therefore persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Origin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. The race categories White, Black, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaska Native, as presented in these indicators, exclude persons of Hispanic origin unless noted otherwise. The categories are defined as follows: \u2022 American Indian or Alaska Native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and maintaining tribal affiliation or community attachment. \u2022 Asian: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. \u2022 Black or African American: A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. \u2022 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. \u2022 White: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. The indicators in this report draw from a number of different data sources. Many are federal surveys that collect data using the OMB standards for racial/ethnic classification described above; however, some sources have not fully adopted the standards, and some indicators include data collected prior to the adoption of the OMB standards. This report focuses on the six categories that are the most common among the various data sources used: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native. Asians and Pacific Islanders are combined into one category in indicators for which the data were not collected separately for the two groups. Some of the surveys from which data are presented in these indicators give respondents the option of selecting either an \"other\" race category, a \"Two or more races\" or \"multiracial\" category, or both. Where possible, indicators present data on the \"Two or more races\" category; however, in some cases this category may not be separately shown because the information was not collected or due to other data issues. In general, the \"other\" category is not separately shown. Any comparisons made between persons of one racial/ethnic group to \"all other racial/ ethnic groups\" include only the racial/ethnic groups shown in the indicator. In some surveys, respondents are not given the option to select more than one race. In these surveys, respondents of Two or more races must select a single race category. Any comparisons between data from surveys that give the option to select more than one race and surveys that do not offer such an option should take into account the fact that there is a potential for bias if members of one racial group are more likely than members of the others to identify themselves as \"Two or more races.\" 1 For postsecondary data, foreign students are counted separately and are therefore not included in any racial/ethnic category. The American Community Survey (ACS), conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, collects information regarding specific racial/ethnic ancestry. Selected indicators include Hispanic ancestry subgroups (such as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Salvadoran, Other Central American, and South American) and Asian ancestry subgroups (such as Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese). In addition, selected indicators include \"Two or more races\" subgroups (such as White and Black, White and Asian, and White and American Indian/Alaska Native). For more information on the ACS, see the Guide to Sources. For more information on race/ethnicity, see the Glossary."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Data", "text": "The relatively small sizes of the American Indian/Alaska Native and Pacific Islander populations pose many measurement difficulties when conducting statistical analyses. Even in larger surveys, the numbers of American Indians/Alaska Natives and Pacific Islanders included in a sample are often small. Researchers studying data on these two populations often face small sample sizes that reduce the reliability of results. Survey data for American Indians/Alaska Natives often have somewhat higher standard errors than data for other racial/ethnic groups. Due to large standard errors, differences that seem substantial are often not statistically significant and, therefore, not cited in the text. Data on American Indians/Alaska Natives are often subject to inconsistencies that can result from respondents self-identifying their race/ethnicity. According to research on the collection of race/ethnicity data conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1995, the categorization of American Indian and Alaska Native is the least stable selfidentification. The racial/ethnic categories presented to a respondent, and the way in which the question is asked, can influence the response, especially for individuals who consider themselves as being of mixed race or ethnicity. As mentioned above, Asians and Pacific Islanders are combined into one category in indicators for which the data were not collected separately for the two groups. The combined category can sometimes mask significant differences between subgroups.

Scores on the reading assessments reflect performance on questions measuring basic skills (print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming words, and word recognition); vocabulary knowledge; and reading comprehension, including identifying information specifically stated in text (e.g., definitions, facts, and supporting details), making complex inferences from texts, and considering the text objectively and judging its appropriateness and quality. Possible scores for the reading assessment range from 0 to 141. Estimates pertain to a sample of children who were enrolled in kindergarten for the first time in the 2010-11 school year. Most of the children were in first grade in 2011-12, second grade in 2012-13, and third grade in 2013-14, but some of the children were in other grades. In 2013-14, for example, 6 percent of the children were not in third grade (e.g., were in second grade, fourth grade, or ungraded classrooms). Information on risk factors and student and family characteristics are based on data collected during the kindergarten year. Parents' highest level of education is the highest level of education achieved by either of the parents or guardians in a two-parent household, by the only parent in a single-parent household, or by any guardian in a household with no parents. Poverty status is based on preliminary U.S. Census income thresholds for 2010, which identify incomes determined to meet household needs, given family size and composition. For example, a family of three with one child was below the poverty threshold if its income was less than $17,552 in 2010. Students who were living in poverty and who did not have a parent who completed high school tended to score lower in reading, mathematics, and science over each of their first four years of school compared to their peers who had neither risk factor at kindergarten entry. In reading, for instance, fall kindergarten scores were higher, on average, for students who had neither risk factor (54 points) than for students who had the single risk factor of living in poverty (48 points), the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school (47 points), and both the risk factor of living in poverty and the risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school (45 points).7 This pattern persisted in the spring data collections in kindergarten, first grade, second grade, and third grade. For example, spring third-grade reading scores were higher, on average, for students who had neither risk factor (114 points) than for those with the single risk factor of living in poverty (106 points), those with the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school (105 points), and those with both risk factors (102 points). In addition, students with the single risk factor of living in poverty at kindergarten entry scored higher in reading across all data collections than students with both risk factors.  Neither risk factor One risk factor: No parent completed high school Scale score NOTE: Estimates weighted by W7C17P_7T170. Scores on the mathematics assessments reflect performance on questions on number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability (measured with a set of simple questions assessing children's ability to read a graph); and prealgebra skills such as identification of patterns. Possible scores for the mathematics assessment range from 0 to 135. Estimates pertain to a sample of children who were enrolled in kindergarten for the first time in the 2010-11 school year. Most of the children were in first grade in 2011-12, second grade in 2012-13, and third grade in 2013-14, but some of the children were in other grades.

For example, a family of three with one child was below the poverty threshold if its income was less than $17,552 in 2010. In mathematics, while students who had neither risk factor scored highest at each data collection, differences in scores among the other risk factor groups varied by grade level. In the fall of kindergarten, the average score was highest for first-time kindergartners who had neither risk factor (37 points), and the average score for those who had the single risk factor of living in poverty (30 points) was higher than the average scores for those with the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school (27 points) and for those who had both the risk factor of living in poverty and the risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school (26 points).8 In the spring data collections for kindergarten and first grade, students with neither risk factor had the highest average scores, and students with the single risk factor of living in poverty had higher average scores than students with both risk factors. In the spring data collections for second and third grade, average mathematics scores were highest for students with neither risk factor and lowest for students with both risk factors; no measurable differences were observed between the average scores for students having either of the single risk factors. For instance, students with neither risk factor had the highest average spring thirdgrade score (101 points), and students who had either the single risk factor of living in poverty or the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school had higher average scores (94 and 95 points, respectively) than students who had both risk factors (89 points).\n\nHomeless Children and Youth in Public Schools Figure 1. Percentage of public school students who were identified as homeless: School years 2009-10 through 2014-15 The number of U.S. public elementary and secondary students reported as homeless increased from 910,000 in 2009-10 to 1.3 million in 2014-15.6 During this time, the percentage of public school students who were reported as homeless increased from 1.8 percent in 2009-10 to 2.5 percent in 2014-15. In 2014-15, larger numbers of homeless students were enrolled in early elementary grades (excluding preschool) than in later grades. Over 100,000 students were reported as homeless at each grade level from kindergarten to 3rd grade. In contrast, 68,700 students in 11th grade and 83,000 students in 12th grade were reported as homeless.  Hotels or motels Unsheltered 2 Shelters, transitional housing, or awaiting foster care placement 1 Refers to temporarily sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or other reasons (such as domestic violence). 2 Includes living in cars, parks, campgrounds, temporary trailers-including Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) trailers-or abandoned buildings.

The Department of Education also collects data on the primary nighttime residences of students reported as homeless. In 2014-15, some 76 percent of homeless students reported that they were doubled up with another family due to a loss of housing, economic hardship, or other reasons (such as domestic violence). An additional 14 percent were housed in shelters or transitional housing, or were awaiting foster care placement. Seven percent resided in hotels or motels and 3 percent were unsheltered.  Youth who are not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian. Includes youth living on their own and youth living with a caregiver who is not their legal guardian. 2 Students who met the definition of limited English proficient students as outlined in the EDFacts workbook. For more information, see http://www2.ed.gov/ about/inits/ed/edfacts/eden-workbook.html. 3 Students who met the definition of eligible migrant children as outlined in the EDFacts workbook. Such students are either migratory workers or the children or spouses of migratory workers and have moved within the preceding 36 months in order to obtain, or to accompany parents or spouses who moved in order to obtain, temporary or seasonal employment in agricultural or fishing work. For more information, see http://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/ eden-workbook.html. Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Rhode Island, and West Virginia did not operate a migrant education program during the 2014-15 school year and therefore had no data to provide on migrant homeless students. 4 Includes only students with disabilities who were served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).

Data include all homeless students enrolled at any time during the school year. Data exclude Puerto Rico and the Bureau of Indian Education. This figure is based on state-level data. While most homeless students experience homelessness together with their family unit, 8 percent of homeless students in 2014-15 (94,800 students) were not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian. This group of students, known as unaccompanied homeless youth, includes individuals experiencing a range of personal circumstances, including runaway youth and youth who have been separated from their family due to conflict or loss of contact. The group also includes youth living with a caregiver who is not their legal guardian. In addition, 14 percent of homeless students in 2014-15 were identified as English language learners, compared to 9 percent of all public school students (see indicator English Language Learners in Public Schools).7 Seventeen percent of homeless students were identified as students with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), compared to 13 percent of all public school students (see indicator Children and Youth With Disabilities).8 Around 1 percent of homeless students were identified as migrant students.9 The Condition of Education 2017 | 17\nHomeless Children and Youth in Public Schools Figure 5.

In 2014-15, the number of homeless students enrolled in public schools was higher than in 2009-10 in 44 states and the District of Columbia. The increases during this time period ranged from 1 percent in Rhode Island to 84 percent in Michigan, 94 percent in Nevada, 98 percent in Missouri, 99 percent in West Virginia, 113 percent in Montana, and 267 percent in North Dakota. In contrast, the number of homeless students enrolled in public schools was lower in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 in four states: Louisiana (19 percent lower), Arizona (6 percent lower), Delaware (4 percent lower), and Utah (1 percent lower).10 The Condition of Education 2017 | 18\nHomeless Children and Youth in Public Schools Figure 6.

NOTE: Homeless students are defined as children/youth who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. For more information, see \"C118-Homeless Students Enrolled\" at https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/sy-14-15-nonxml.html. Data include all homeless students enrolled at any time during the school year. This figure is based on state-level data. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding The percentages of homeless students in each primary nighttime residence category varied across states in 2014-15, although in all 50 states the largest share were doubled up with other families. The percentage of homeless students living doubled up with other families ranged from 43 percent in Massachusetts to 93 percent in Mississippi. In the District of Columbia, however, a slightly larger share were in shelters (46 percent) than doubled up (45 percent). In addition to the District of Columbia, the percentage of homeless students in shelters was greater than 30 percent in New York (32 percent), Minnesota (32 percent), and Massachusetts (37 percent). The percentage of homeless students in hotels and motels ranged from less than 1 percent in Hawaii to 22 percent in Vermont, and the percentage of homeless students who were unsheltered ranged from less than one half of 1 percent in New Jersey and Delaware to 32 percent in North Dakota. Similarly, the percentage of unaccompanied youth among homeless students varied widely across states in 2014-15. New Jersey, West Virginia, and Wyoming reported zero unaccompanied homeless youth, while two states reported that more than 20 percent of their homeless students were unaccompanied youth: Alaska (22 percent) and Maine (23 percent).  In 2014-15, a higher percentage of students in city districts were homeless (3.7 percent) than in town (2.6 percent), rural (2.4 percent), and suburban districts (2.0 percent). Nevertheless, there was a large number of homeless students enrolled in suburban districts (422,000), which was second only to the number in city districts (578,000). Smaller numbers of homeless students were enrolled in rural (149,000) and town (139,000) districts. \"Doubled up\" was the most common primary nighttime residence across the four locale categories (city, suburban, town, and rural) in 2014-15. The percentage of homeless students who were doubled up with other families ranged from 70 percent in city districts to 81 percent in rural districts. The percentage of homeless students who were housed in shelters was higher in city districts (21 percent) than in suburban (11 percent), town (10 percent), and rural districts (9 percent). The percentages of homeless students who were unsheltered or living in hotels and motels varied less widely across locale categories. Among the 120 largest school districts in the country in 2014-15, Santa Ana Unified (California) and New York City reported the highest percentages of students experiencing homelessness (10.6 and 10.1 percent, respectively). In New York City alone, 100,000 students were reported as homeless. The district with the next largest number of homeless students enrolled in public schools was Chicago, where 19,900 students were reported as homeless. Persistence in postsecondary education is important as continued enrollment is a necessary condition for timely completion of a bachelor's or associate's degree. In this Spotlight, students are considered to have persisted if they were enrolled at any institution or had attained a degree or certificate 3 years after first enrolling. Research indicates that persistence and attainment rates for college students vary by socioeconomic, academic, and postsecondary institution characteristics. A National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) study found that male students were less likely than female students to attain an associate's or bachelor's degree 6 years after enrollment when controlling for other student, family, high school, and postsecondary institutional characteristics.1 Moreover, among students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, high school noncompleters as well as completers with weak academic credentials (low scores and/or grades) were less likely to enroll at 4-year institutions and ultimately complete undergraduate studies than their high school peers with stronger academic credentials.2 Another NCES report found that persistence and attainment rates 5 years after first enrolling in college were lower for nontraditional students (identified as those who worked full time or had children, among other characteristics) than for traditional students.3 This Spotlight, using the latest data from NCES's Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) longitudinal study, explores differences in postsecondary persistence rates 3 years after initial enrollment. BPS follows a cohort of students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 2011-12 and collects data on student persistence, attainment, demographic characteristics, employment, marital status, income, and debt.   In spring 2014, the persistence rate for students who began at 2-year institutions (57 percent) in 2011-12 was 23 percentage points lower than for students who began at 4-year institutions (80 percent). This gap was observed for students who were White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and of Two or more races. The difference in persistence rates between students who began at 2-and 4-year institutions ranged from 19 percentage points for Hispanic students (59 versus 79 percent) to 25 percentage points for White students (58 versus 82 percent) and Asian students (65 versus 90 percent). Among first-time students who began at 4-year institutions in 2011-12, Asian students had a higher persistence rate (90 percent) as of spring 2014 than White students (82 percent). Both Asian and White students had a higher persistence rate than Hispanic (79 percent), Black (69 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native students (64 percent). Black students who began at 2-year institutions had a lower persistence rate (48 percent) than their White (58 percent), Hispanic (59 percent), and Asian (65 percent) peers. However, there was no measurable difference in persistence rates among the other racial/ ethnic groups. For instance, unlike at 4-year institutions, the persistence rate for Hispanic students who began at 2-year institutions was not measurably different from the persistence rates for Asian and White students. Students 19 years old or younger as of December 2011 accounted for the majority of first-time postsecondary students in 2011-12, and students in this age group had higher persistence rates than students who began their postsecondary education when they were 20 to 23 years old, 24 to 29 years old, and 30 years or older. However, the distribution of students by age group differed by level of institution (i.e., 2-and 4-year institutions). At 4-year institutions, students who were 19 years old or younger made up 85 percent of first-time students. This was nearly 20 percentage points higher than the share of students who were 19 years old or younger at 2-year institutions (66 percent). Conversely, students from the three older age groups combined to account for 15 percent of students who began at 4-year institutions, compared to 34 percent at 2-year institutions.   Among students who began at 4-year institutions, the persistence rate for students who were 19 years old or younger (85 percent) was higher than students who were 20 to 23 years old (53 percent), 24 to 29 years old (48 percent), and 30 years old or over (57 percent). There was no measurable difference between the persistence rates for the oldest three age groups who began at 4-year institutions. The same pattern was observed for firsttime students who began at 2-year institutions. Students 19 years old or younger had the highest persistence rate (62 percent), while there was no measurable difference in persistence rates between the three older age groups, which ranged from 48 to 49 percent. The persistence rate for students 19 years old or younger who began at 2-year institutions (62 percent) was 24 percentage points lower than the rate for their sameaged peers who began at 4-year institutions (85 percent). There were no measurable differences in persistence rates by level of institution for students who began their postsecondary education when they were 20 to 23 years old, 24 to 29 years old, and 30 years old or over. Initial enrollment at 4-year institutions and persistence varied by SAT or ACT scores.4 Some 41 percent of students who scored in the lowest quarter of SAT/ ACT scores began at 4-year institutions, compared to 82 percent of students who scored in the highest quarter of SAT/ACT scores.  Highest quarter SAT/ACT (1,150 or higher) Third quarter SAT/ACT (1,000 to 1,140) NOTE: Students who first enrolled during the 2011-12 academic year are considered to have persisted if they were enrolled at any institution in Spring 2014 or had attained a degree or certificate by that time. Score quarters are based on the SAT combined critical reading and mathematics score; scale ranges from 400 to 1600. ACT scores for students who only took the ACT exam were converted to SAT scores using a concordance Among students who began at 4-year institutions, students who scored in the highest quarter of SAT/ ACT scores had higher persistence rates (91 percent) than students who scored in the third quarter (86 percent), second quarter (79 percent), and lowest quarter (71 percent) of SAT/ACT scores. There was no measurable difference in persistence rates between the SAT/ACT score groups for students who began at 2-year institutions, which typically do not require SAT/ACT scores for admission. Within each SAT/ACT score quarter, persistence rates were higher for students who began at 4-year institutions than for students who began at 2-year institutions.   Persistence rates at 4-year institutions varied by control of institution (public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit). Students who began at private nonprofit 4-year and public 4-year institutions had persistence rates (88 percent and 82 percent, respectively) more than 30 percentage points higher than students who began at private, for profit 4-year institutions (50 percent). Among students who began at at 2-year institutions, there was no measurable difference in persistence rates by control of institution.   The persistence rate for students who began at 4-year institutions and were full-time students5 from 2011-12 to spring 2014 (83 percent) was 12 percentage points higher than for students who began at 4-year institutions and were part-time students for at least one semester (71 percent). Likewise, students who began at 2-year institutions and remained full-time students throughout had a higher persistence rate (61 percent) than their peers who began at 2-year institutions and were part-time students for at least one semester (54 percent). https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=97578. Nontraditional students were identified as those who delayed postsecondary entry by 1 or more years, enrolled part time in the fall of first year, were financially independent, worked 35 or more hours per week, were single parents, had children, or did not receive a standard high school diploma. 4 SAT/ACT score quarters were derived from SAT I combined (critical reading and math) scores or an ACT composite score converted to an estimated SAT I combined score using a College Board concordance "}, {"section_title": "Risk Factors and Academic Outcomes in Kindergarten Through Third Grade", "text": "During the 2010-11 school year, 6 percent of first-time kindergartners had both the risk factor of living in poverty and the risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school, 2 percent had the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school, and 18 percent had the single risk factor of living in poverty.

Research has shown that children experiencing homelessness face a range of challenges related to their health, emotional well-being, and safety.1 Unstable housing situations may lead to increased rates of transfer among public schools, resulting in further disruptions to the education of homeless students.2 The U.S. Department of Education collects data on homeless students under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. This authority was recently renewed under the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. The McKinney-Vento Act requires that school districts identify students who are experiencing homelessness and guarantees their right to enroll in public schools and access educational and transportation services. Under this law, states report data to the Department of Education on the number of homeless students enrolled in public schools, as well as the characteristics of these students. Under the McKinney-Vento Act, students are identified as homeless if they lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.3 Students experiencing homelessness may be temporarily doubled up with other families or sharing housing due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or other reasons (such as domestic violence); living in hotels or motels; living in shelters or other forms of temporary housing; or living in unsheltered situations (e.g., living in cars, parks, campgrounds, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) trailers, or abandoned buildings). Over time, the capacity of school systems to identify students experiencing homelessness, collect information, and report data to the Department of Education has improved.4 Some of the change over time in the rates of homelessness among public school students may be attributable to improved reporting practices.5 In addition, some of the variation across jurisdictions in the rates of homelessness and the characteristics of homeless students may be related to variation in reporting practices."}, {"section_title": "First-Time Postsecondary Students' Persistence After 3 Years", "text": "Seventy percent of all first-time postsecondary students who began at 2-and 4-year institutions in 2011-12 were still enrolled or had attained a certificate or degree by spring 2014.

For example, among 20-to 24-year-olds, the employment rate was 88 percent for those with a bachelor's or higher degree and 48 percent for those who did not complete high school.\nIn 2016, the employment rate was higher for people with higher levels of educational attainment than for those with lower levels of educational attainment. For example, among 20-to 24-year-olds, the employment rate was 88 percent for those with a bachelor's or higher degree and 48 percent for those who did not complete high school. This indicator examines recent trends in two distinct yet related measures of labor market conditions-the employment rate and the unemployment rate. The employment rate (also known as the employment to population ratio) is the number of persons in a given group who are employed as a percentage of the civilian population in that group. The unemployment rate is the percentage of persons in the civilian labor force (i.e., all civilians who are employed or seeking employment) who are not working and who made specific efforts to find employment sometime during the prior 4 weeks. Both the employment and unemployment rates exclude 20-to 24-year-olds (also referred to as \"young adults\" in this indicator) who are enrolled in school. Trends in the unemployment rate reflect net changes in the relative number of people who are looking for work, while the employment rate reflects whether the economy is generating jobs relative to population growth in a specific age group. In 2016, the employment rate was higher for those with higher levels of educational attainment. For example, the employment rate was highest for young adults with a bachelor's or higher degree (88 percent). The employment rate for young adults with some college1 (77 percent) was higher than the rate for those who had completed high school2 (69 percent), which was, in turn, higher than the employment rate for those who had not finished high school (48 percent). This pattern of a positive relationship between employment rates and educational attainment was also seen for 25-to 64-year-olds (also referred to as \"older adults\" in this indicator). Among young adults, employment rates were higher for males than for females at most levels of educational attainment in 2016. The employment rate for young adult males was higher than the rate for young adult females both overall (75 vs. 69 percent) and among those with some college (80 vs. 73 percent), those who had completed high school (73 vs. 64 percent), and those who had not completed high school (55 vs. 38 percent). However, there was no measurable difference between the employment rates of young adult males and females with a bachelor's or higher degree. For older adults, employment rates were higher for males than for females at each level of educational attainment. From December 2007 through June 2009, the U.S. economy experienced a recession.3 For young adults, the employment rate was lower in 2008, near the beginning of the recession, than it was in 2000, prior to the recession (73 vs. 77 percent). The employment rate was even lower in 2010 (65 percent), after the end of the recession, than it was in 2008. While the employment rate for young adults was higher in 2016 (72 percent) than in 2010 (65 percent), the 2016 rate was lower than the rate in 2000 (77 percent) and not measurably different from the rate in 2008 (73 percent). During these years, patterns in the employment rate for young adults varied by educational attainment. For young adults who had not completed high school, the employment rate in 2016 (48 percent) was lower than in 2000 (61 percent) and 2008 (55 percent), but not measurably different from the rate in 2010. For young adults with a bachelor's or higher degree, the employment rate in 2016 (88 percent) was not measurably different from the rates in 2000, 2008, and 2010. For older adults, the overall employment rate in 2016 (74 percent) was lower than in 2000 (78 percent) and 2008 (76 percent), but higher than in 2010 (72 percent). This pattern was also found among older adults who had a bachelor's or higher degree and those with some college.  Generally, unemployment rates in 2016 were lower for those with higher levels of educational attainment. For example, the unemployment rate for young adults with a bachelor's or higher degree (5 percent) was lower than the rates for young adults with some college (10 percent), those who had completed high school (12 percent), and those who had not completed high school (17 percent). However, the unemployment rate for young adults with some college was not measurably different from the rate for those who had completed high school. For both young adult males and young adult females, unemployment rates were lowest for those who had a bachelor's or higher degree (5 percent for both). For young adult males the rate was also lower for those who had some college (9 percent) than for those who had completed high school (13 percent) and those who had not completed high school (18 percent). For young adult females, there was no significant difference between the unemployment rates for those who had some college, those who had completed high school, and those who had not completed high school. The same pattern of lower unemployment rates for individuals with higher levels of education was also observed for older adult males and older adult females. In 2016, the overall unemployment rate for young adults was higher for males than for females (12 vs. 9 percent). However, there were no measurable differences between the unemployment rates of male and female young adults at any individual level of educational attainment. For older adults, there were no measurable differences between the unemployment rates of males and females, neither overall nor at any individual level of educational attainment.  Both overall and for each of the four levels of educational attainment, the unemployment rates for both young adults and older adults were lower in 2016 than they were in 2010. For young adults, the post-recession unemployment rate in 2010 (19 percent) was higher than it was both at the beginning of the recession in 2008 (11 percent) and prior to the recession in 2000 (9 percent). In 2016, while the unemployment rate for young adults (11 percent) was lower than it was in 2010 (19 percent), it was not measurably different from the rates in 2008 and 2000. Similar patterns were found for young adults with a bachelor's or higher degree, those who had completed high school, and those who had not completed high school. Endnotes: 1 In this indicator, \"some college\" includes those who have attended college, but did not obtain a bachelor's degree. This includes those who have completed an associate's degree for all years except 2001 and 2002. In 2001 and 2002, \"some college, no degree\" and \"associate's degree\" data were collected separately. percentages of children whose parents had not completed high school, had only completed high school, and who attended some college but did not receive a degree were lower in 2015 than in 2010. The percentage of children under age 18 whose parents had attained different levels of education varied across racial/ethnic groups in 2015. For example, the percentage of children whose parents had completed a bachelor's or higher degree was highest for Asian children (66 percent), followed by children who were White (50 percent), of Two or more races (44 percent), and Black (24 percent). Also, the percentage of children whose parents had completed a bachelor's or higher degree was higher for American Indian/Alaska Native children (21 percent) than for Hispanic children (18 percent); however, the percentages for these two groups were not measurably different from the percentage for Pacific Islander children (18 percent). In contrast, the percentage of children in 2015 whose parents did not complete high school was highest for Hispanic children (26 percent), followed by American Indian/Alaska Native children (11 percent) and Black children (10 percent). Also, the percentage of children whose parents did not complete high school was higher for Asian children (7 percent) than for children who were of Two or more races (5 percent) and White (4 percent); however, the percentages for these three groups were not measurably different from the percentage for Pacific Islander children (5 percent).

These states, most of which are located in the West, were Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. California reported the highest percentage of ELLs among its public school students, at 22.4 percent, followed by Nevada at 17.0 percent. Eighteen states had percentages of ELL students that were 6.0 percent or higher but less than 10.0 percent, and 12 states had percentages that were 3.0 percent or higher but less than 6.0 percent. The percentage of students who were ELLs was less than 3.0 percent in 13 states, with Vermont (1.7 percent), Mississippi (1.6 percent), and West Virginia (1.0 percent) having the lowest percentages.

In 2014-15, the percentage of students who were ELLs was generally higher for school districts in more urbanized areas, such as cities and suburbs, than for those in less urbanized areas. For example, ELL students in cities made up an average of 14.2 percent of total public school enrollment, ranging from 10.3 percent in small cities to 16.8 percent in large cities. In suburban areas, ELL students constituted an average of 8.9 percent of public school enrollment, ranging from 6.2 percent in midsize suburban areas to 9.2 percent in large suburban areas. Towns and rural areas are subdivided according to their proximity to urban centers into the categories fringe, distant, and remote, with fringe being the closest to an urban center and remote being the farthest from one. In towns, ELL students made up an average of 6.2 percent of public school enrollment, ranging from 5.9 percent in distant areas to 6.9 percent in remote areas. In rural areas, ELL students constituted an average of 3.5 percent of public student enrollment, ranging from 2.2 percent in distant areas to 4.6 percent in fringe areas. Spanish was the home language of 3.7 million ELL students in 2014-15, representing 77.1 percent of all ELL students and 7.6 percent of all public K-12 students. Arabic, Chinese, and Vietnamese were the next most common home languages (spoken by approximately 109,000, 104,000, and 85,300 students, respectively). English was the fifth most commonly reported home language for ELL students (83,200 students), which may reflect students who live in multilingual households or students adopted from other countries who had been raised speaking another language but currently live in households where English is spoken. Hmong (37,400 students), Somali (33,700 students), Russian (32,500 students), Haitian (31,400 students), Tagalog (28,500 students), and Korean (28,500 students) were the next most commonly reported home languages of ELL students in 2014-15. The 30 most commonly reported home languages also include several whose prevalence has increased rapidly in recent years. For example, the number of ELLs who reported that their home language was a Karen language5 or Nepali more than quadrupled between 2008-09 and 2014-15 (from 3,000 to 12,600 students for Karen languages and from 3,200 to 14,400 students for Nepali). In 2014-15, there were about 3.7 million Hispanic ELL students, and Hispanic students made up over threequarters (77.8 percent) of ELL student enrollment. Asian students were the next largest racial/ethnic group among ELLs, with 517,000 students (10.7 percent of ELL students). In addition, there were 283,000 White ELL students (5.9 percent of ELL students) and 172,000 Black ELL students (3.6 percent of ELL students). In each of the other racial/ethnic groups for which data were collected (Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and individuals of Two or more races), fewer than 50,000 students were identified as ELLs.   Separate data on special education services for males and females are available only for students ages 6-21, rather than children and youth ages 3-21. Among those 6-to 21-year-old students enrolled in public schools in 2014-15, a higher percentage of males (16 percent) than females (9 percent) received special education services under IDEA. The percentage distribution of students who received various types of special education services in 2014-15 differed by sex. For example, the percentage of students served under IDEA who received services for specific learning disabilities was higher among female students (44 percent) than among male students (36 percent), while the percentage served under IDEA who received services for autism was higher among male students (11 percent) than among female students (4 percent).    Of the students ages 14-21 served under IDEA who exited school in 2013-14, the percentage who graduated with a regular high school diploma, received an alternative certificate, or dropped out differed by race/ethnicity. The percentage of exiting students who graduated with a regular high school diploma was highest among White students (73 percent) and lowest among Black students (57 percent). The percentage of exiting students who received an alternative certificate was highest among Hispanic students and Black students (both at 17 percent) and lowest among Pacific Islander students (8 percent). The percentage of exiting students who dropped out in 2013-14 was highest among American Indian/Alaska Native students (29 percent) and lowest among Asian students (8 percent). Of the students ages 14-21 served under IDEA who exited school in 2013-14, the percentages who graduated with a regular high school diploma, received an alternative certificate, or dropped out also differed by type of disability. The percentage of exiting students who graduated with a regular high school diploma was highest among students with visual impairments and speech or language impairments (both at 78 percent) and lowest among those with intellectual disabilities (41 percent). The percentage of exiting students who received an alternative certificate was highest among students with intellectual disabilities (35 percent) and lowest among students with speech or language impairments (8 percent). The percentage of exiting students who dropped out in 2013-14 was highest among students with emotional disturbances (35 percent) and lowest among students with visual impairments (6 percent).  In fall 2015, female students made up 56 percent of total undergraduate enrollment at 9.5 million, and male students made up 44 percent at 7.5 million. Between 2000 and 2015, enrollment for both groups showed similar patterns of change: female enrollment increased by 29 percent and male enrollment increased by 30 percent. Most of these increases occurred between 2005 and 2010, when female enrollment increased by 20 percent and male enrollment increased by 22 percent. However, between 2010 and 2015 both female and male enrollment decreased by 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Between 2015 and 2026, female enrollment is projected to increase by 16 percent (from 9.5 million to 11.0 million students), and male enrollment is projected to increase by 11 percent (from 7.5 million to 8.3 million students). Of the 17.0 million undergraduate students in fall 2015, some 9.3 million were White, 3.0 million were Hispanic, 2.3 million were Black, 1.1 million were Asian/ Pacific Islander, and 132,000 were American Indian/ Alaska Native. Between 2000 and 2015, Hispanic enrollment more than doubled (a 126 percent increase from 1.4 million to 3.0 million students). In contrast, enrollment for other racial/ethnic groups fluctuated during this period. Between 2000 and 2010, Black enrollment increased by 73 percent (from 1.5 million to 2.7 million students), Asian/Pacific Islander enrollment increased by 29 percent (from 846,000 to 1.1 million students), American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment increased by 29 percent (from 139,000 to 179,000 students), and White enrollment increased by 21 percent (from 9.0 million to 10.9 million students). However, between 2010 and 2015, American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment decreased by 26 percent (from 179,000 to 132,000 students), White enrollment decreased by 15 percent (from 10.9 million to 9.3 million students), Black enrollment decreased by 14 percent (from 2.7 million to 2.3 million students), and Asian/Pacific Islander enrollment remained relatively unchanged (at 1.1 million students).  In fall 2015, there were 10.6 million full-time and 6.4 million part-time undergraduate students. Enrollment for both full-and part-time students has generally increased since 2000, particularly between 2000 and 2010, when full-time enrollment increased by 45 percent and part-time enrollment increased by 27 percent. More recently, the pattern of enrollment has changed: between 2010 and 2015, full-time enrollment decreased by 7 percent and part-time enrollment decreased by 3 percent. Between 2015 and 2026, full-time enrollment is projected to increase by 13 percent (from 10.6 million to 11.9 million students) and part-time enrollment is projected to increase by 15 percent (from 6.4 million to 7.4 million students).    In fall 2015, the 10.5 million students at 4-year institutions made up 62 percent of total undergraduate enrollment; the remaining 38 percent (6.5 million students) were enrolled at 2-year institutions. Between 2000 and 2010, enrollment increased by 44 percent at 4-year institutions and by 29 percent at 2-year institutions. More recently, enrollment patterns have changed: enrollment was 1 percent higher at 4-year institutions and 16 percent lower at 2-year institutions in 2015 than in 2010. Between 2010 and 2015, enrollment patterns varied by control and level of institution. For example, undergraduate enrollment at private nonprofit 2-year institutions was 53 percent higher in 2015 than in 2010, whereas enrollment at private for-profit 2-year institutions was 48 percent lower in 2015 than in 2010. Between 2015 and 2026, undergraduate enrollment at 2-year institutions is projected to increase by 21 percent (from 6.5 million to 7.8 million students), while enrollment at 4-year institutions is projected to increase by 9 percent (from 10.5 million to 11.5 million students). Distance education1 courses and programs provide students with flexible learning opportunities. In fall 2015, more than a quarter of undergraduate students (4.9 million) participated in distance education, with 2.1 million students, or 12 percent of total undergraduate enrollment, exclusively taking distance education courses. Of the 2.1 million undergraduate students who exclusively took distance education courses, 1.3 million were enrolled at institutions located in the same state in which they resided, and 767,000 were enrolled at institutions in a different state."}, {"section_title": "Children and Youth With Disabilities", "text": "In 2014-15, the number of children and youth ages 3-21 receiving special education services was 6.6 million, or 13 percent of all public school students.

In fall 2015, the percentage of students at private for-profit institutions who exclusively took distance education courses (49 percent) was more than three times that of students at private nonprofit institutions (14 percent) and more than five times that of students at public institutions (9 percent). In particular, 61 percent of students at private for-profit 4-year institutions exclusively took distance education courses. This percentage is larger than the percentage of students at any other control and level of institution who exclusively took distance education courses.

In fall 2015, there were 2.9 million students enrolled in postbaccalaureate degree programs. Postbaccalaureate degree programs include master's and doctoral programs, as well as programs such as law, medicine, and dentistry. Between 2000 and 2010, postbaccalaureate enrollment increased by 36 percent.

Nevertheless, in 2015 the Hispanic status dropout rate (9.2 percent) remained higher than the Black (6.5 percent) and White (4.6 percent) status dropout rates.\nThe status dropout rate decreased from 10.9 percent in 2000 to 5.9 percent in 2015. During this time, the Hispanic status dropout rate decreased by 18.6 percentage points, while the Black and White status dropout rates decreased by 6.6 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively. Nevertheless, in 2015 the Hispanic status dropout rate (9.2 percent) remained higher than the Black (6.5 percent) and White (4.6 percent) status dropout rates. The status dropout rate represents the percentage of 16-to 24-year-olds (referred to as youth in this indicator) who are not enrolled in school and have not earned a high school credential (either a diploma or an equivalency credential such as a GED certificate). In this indicator, status dropout rates are estimated using both the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). The CPS is a household survey that has been collected annually for decades, allowing for the analysis of long-term trends, or changes over time, for the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The ACS covers a broader population, including individuals living in households as well as individuals living in noninstitutionalized group quarters (such as college or military housing) and institutionalized group quarters (such as correctional or nursing facilities).1 ACS data are available for fewer years than CPS data, but can provide detail on smaller demographic groups. Based on data from the CPS, the status dropout rate decreased from 10.9 percent in 2000 to 5.9 percent in 2015. Over the most recent 5-year period, from 2010 to 2015, the status dropout rate fell from 7.4 to 5.9 percent. Between 2000 and 2015, the male status dropout rate declined from 12.0 to 6.3 percent, and the female status dropout rate declined from 9.9 to 5.4 percent. While the rate for male youth was 2.1 percentage points higher than the rate for female youth in 2000, there was no measurable difference between the rates for males and females in 2015.  In each year from 2000 to 2015, the status dropout rate was lower for White youth than for Black youth, and the rates for both groups were lower than the rate for Hispanic youth. During this period, the status dropout rate declined from 6.9 to 4.6 percent for White youth; from 13.1 to 6.5 percent for Black youth; and from 27.8 to 9.2 percent for Hispanic youth. As a result, the gap between White and Black youth narrowed from 6.2 percentage points in 2000 to 1.9 percentage points in 2015. The gap between White and Hispanic youth narrowed from 20.9 percentage points in 2000 to 4.6 percentage points in 2015.  The decline in the overall status dropout rate from 10.9 percent in 2000 to 5.9 percent in 2015 coincided with a shift in the distribution of years of school completed by status dropouts, as fewer status dropouts completed less than 9 years of schooling, while more completed 11 or 12 years of schooling. The percentage of status dropouts with less than 9 years of schooling decreased from 21.5 percent in 2000 to 14.5 percent in 2015. Conversely, the percentage of status dropouts who had completed 11 or 12 years of schooling but did not receive a diploma or GED certificate increased from 40.0 percent in 2000 to 50.2 percent in 2015. Based on data from the ACS (which covers a broader population than the CPS), the overall status dropout rate in 2015 was 6.0 percent. The status dropout rate was lower for individuals living in households and noninstitutionalized group quarters (5.7 percent) than for individuals living in institutionalized group quarters (34.6 percent). According to data from the ACS, the status dropout rate varied by race/ethnicity in 2015. The status dropout rate was lower for Asian youth (2.4 percent), White youth (4.5 percent), and youth of Two or more races (4.7 percent), than for Black (7.2 percent), Hispanic (9.9 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native youth (13.2 percent). The rate for Pacific Islander youth (5.4 percent) was lower than the rates for Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native youth, but not measurably different from those of other racial groups.  Data from the ACS can also be used to estimate the status dropout rate for many specific Hispanic and Asian subgroups, including, for example, youth of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Chinese, and Vietnamese descent. In 2015, the total status dropout rate for Hispanic youth was 9.9 percent. Status dropout rates for youth of Guatemalan (22.8 percent), Honduran (18.9 percent), and Salvadoran (13.8 percent) descent were higher than the total rate for all Hispanic youth. In addition, the overall status dropout rate for Central American2 youth (15.8 percent) was higher than the total Hispanic rate. The status dropout rates for Dominican, Mexican, and Nicaraguan youth were not measurably different from the total Hispanic rate. The rates for the remaining Hispanic subgroups presented were lower than the total Hispanic rate. For example, the status dropout rate was 8.7 percent for Puerto Rican youth and 4.1 percent for Cuban youth.  Among Asian youth, the total status dropout rate was 2.4 percent in 2015. Three Asian subgroups had status dropout rates that were higher than the total Asian rate: Burmese (23.8 percent), Cambodian (9.4 percent), and Nepalese (7.8 percent). In addition, the overall status dropout rate for Southeast Asian3 youth (5.0 percent) was higher than the total Asian rate. Status dropout rates for Asian Indian (1.7 percent), Chinese4 (1.5 percent), and Korean (1.4) youth were lower than the total rate for all Asian youth. Status dropout rates for the remaining Asian subgroups presented were not measurably different from the total rate for all Asian youth.

Schooling and work are considered core activities in the transition from childhood to adulthood. Youth who are detached from these core activities, particularly if they are detached for several years, may have difficulty building a work history that contributes to future employability and higher wages.1 Youth who are neither enrolled in school nor working2 may be detached from these activities for several reasons. They may be seeking educational opportunities or work but are unable to find them. They may have left the workforce or school temporarily or permanently, for personal, family, or financial reasons.

For example, the percentage of 20-to 24-year-olds neither in school nor working was higher for American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic youth (31, 26, and 20 percent, respectively) than for their White and Asian peers (13 and 12 percent, respectively). In addition, the percentage neither in school nor working was higher for Black and American Indian/Alaska Native 20-to 24-year-olds than for their peers of Two or more races (14 percent), while the percentage for Pacific Islander 20-to 24-year-olds (18 percent) was not measurably different from that of any other racial/ethnic group. Among 18-and 19-year-olds, the percentage neither in school nor working was higher for Hispanic youth (15 percent) than for White youth (11 percent), and the percentages for both groups were higher than the percentage for Asian youth (5 percent). The percentage for Black 18-and 19-year-olds (13 percent) was higher than the percentage for Asian 18-and 19-year-olds, but not measurably different from the percentages for White and Hispanic youth in the same age range. Among 16-and 17-year-olds, the percentage neither in school nor working was higher for Hispanic (5 percent) and Black youth (7 percent) than for youth of Two or more races (3 percent), but there were no other measurable differences among racial/ethnic groups (excluding Pacific Islander youth, for whom reliable estimates were not available). In 2016, the percentage of youth in each age group who were neither in school nor working was higher for youth in poor households than for youth in nonpoor households. For the purposes of this indicator, poor is defined to include families below the Census-defined poverty threshold, and nonpoor is defined to include families at or above the poverty threshold.5 For example, 31 percent of poor 20-to 24-year-olds were neither in school nor working compared with 13 percent of nonpoor 20-to 24-year-olds. Similar patterns were observed in 2006 and 2011. Across all racial/ethnic groups except Asian and Pacific Islanders, the percentage of 20-to 24-year-olds who were neither in school nor working was higher for those in poor households than for those in nonpoor households. For Asian 20-to 24-year-olds, there was no measurable difference between the percentages for those in poor and nonpoor households. Reliable estimates were not available for Pacific Islander 20-to 24-year-olds. The gap between the percentages of poor and nonpoor 20-to 24-year-olds who were neither in school nor working ranged from 16 percentage points for White and Black youth to 31 percentage points for American Indian/Alaska Native youth.  In 2016, the percentage of 20-to 24-year-olds neither in school nor working was generally higher for those with lower levels of educational attainment than for those with higher levels of educational attainment. The percentage neither in school nor working was higher for 20-to 24-year-olds who had not completed high school (42 percent) than for those who had completed high school (26 percent), and the percentages for both groups were higher than the percentages for those with some college (9 percent) and those with a bachelor's degree or higher (8 percent). Among 20-to 24-year-olds who had not completed high school, the percentage neither in school nor working was 42 percent in 2016, compared with 44 percent in 2011 and 37 percent in 2006. Meanwhile, among 20-to 24-year-olds with a bachelor's degree or higher, the percentage neither in school nor working was 8 percent in 2016, which was not measurably different from the percentages in 2006 or 2011. However, the percentage for the same group in 2011 (11 percent) was higher than the percentage in 2006 (8 percent).  In 2016, the percentage of 20-to 24-year-olds who were neither in school nor working was higher for females (18 percent) than for males (16 percent). This gap ranged from 14 percentage points for 20-to 24-year-olds who had not completed high school to 2 percentage points for those with some college. Among 20-to 24-year-olds with a bachelor's degree, there was no measurable difference between the percentages of males and females who were neither in school nor working.  Higher percentages of high school completers immediately enrolled in 4-year colleges than in 2-year colleges in every year from 2000 to 2015. In 2015, about 44 percent of high school completers enrolled in a 4-year college and 25 percent enrolled in a 2-year college. The immediate enrollment rate at 2-year colleges increased from 21 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2015. The immediate enrollment rate at 4-year colleges in 2015 (44 percent) was not measurably different from the rate in 2000.  In 2015, the immediate college enrollment rate was higher for females (73 percent) than for males (66 percent  In each year from 2000 to 2015, the immediate college enrollment rate for students2 from high-income families was higher than both the rate for students from middleincome families and the rate for students from low-income families. In 2015, the immediate college enrollment rate for students from high-income families was 83 percent, compared with 63 percent for students from both middleincome families and low-income families.3 In most years, the enrollment rate for students from middle-income families was higher than the rate for students from lowincome families. However, in 2015, the immediate college enrollment rate for students from middle-income families was not measurably different from the rate for students from low-income families. The gap between the immediate college enrollment rates for students from high-income and low-income families narrowed between 2000 and 2015; similarly, the gap between the enrollment rates for students from middleincome and low-income families narrowed between 2000 and 2015. The gap between the immediate college enrollment rates for students from high-income and low-income families was 10 percentage points smaller in 2015 (20 percentage points) than in 2000 (30 percentage points). However, the gap between the enrollment rates for students from high-income and middle-income families in 2015 (21 percentage points) was not measurably different from the gap in 2000.  In 2015, the immediate college enrollment rate for White students (70 percent) was not measurably different from the rates for Black (63 percent) and Hispanic students (67 percent), even though the rate for White students has been higher than the rates for Black and Hispanic students in most years since 2000.3 For example, in 2000 the immediate college enrollment rate was 65 percent for White students, compared with 56 percent for Black students and 49 percent for Hispanic students. The 2015 immediate college enrollment rate for Asian students (87 percent) was higher than the rates for White students, Black students, and Hispanic students. The enrollment rate for Asian students was higher than the rates for Black students and Hispanic students every year since 2003, when the collection of separate data on Asian students began.4 In addition, the enrollment rate for Asian students was higher than the rate for White students every year since 2004. The immediate college enrollment rate for White students was higher in 2015 (70 percent) than in 2000 (65 percent), as was the rate for Hispanic students (67 percent in 2015 and 49 percent in 2000). The enrollment rate for Asian students was also higher in 2015 (87 percent) than in 2003 (74 percent).

In academic year 2015-16, there were 4,147 degreegranting institutions in the United States with first-year undergraduates: 2,584 were 4-year institutions offering programs at the bachelor's or higher degree level and 1,563 were 2-year institutions offering associate's degrees. Some of the differences in characteristics of 2-year and 4-year institutions may be related to their differing institutional missions. The instructional missions of 2-year institutions generally focus on student instruction and related activities that often include providing a range of career-oriented programs at the certificate and associate's degree levels and preparing students for transfer to 4-year institutions. Four-year institutions tend to have a broad range of instructional programs at the undergraduate level leading to bachelor's degrees. Many 4-year institutions offer graduate-level programs as well, and some 4-year institutions have a strong research focus. Degree-granting institutions may be governed by publicly appointed or elected officials, with major support from public funds (public control) or by privately elected or appointed officials, with major support from private sources (private control). Private institutions may be operated on a nonprofit or for-profit basis. All institutions in this analysis enroll first-year undergraduates in degree-granting programs.  In 2015-16, the number of public 4-year institutions (669) was 15 percent higher than in 2000-01 (580) and the number of private nonprofit 4-year institutions (1,298) was 4 percent higher than in 2000-01 (1,247). In contrast, there was fluctuation in the number of private for-profit 4-year institutions. Between 2000-01 and 2012-13, the number of private for-profit 4-year institutions more than tripled, from 207 to 710. After peaking in 2012-13, the number of private for-profit 4-year institutions declined to 617 in 2015-16. The number of public 2-year institutions declined from 1,067 in 2000-01 to 933 in 2012-13 and 909 in 2015-16. The number of private nonprofit 2-year institutions fluctuated from 136 in 2000-01 to 95 in 2012-13 and 102 in 2015-16. The number of private for-profit 2-year institutions also fluctuated during this period, but not as widely as the number of private for-profit 4-year institutions. Between 2000-01 and 2012-13, the number of private for-profit 2-year institutions increased from 480 to 658, and then declined to 552 in 2015-16. Admissions policies varied among public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit institutions at both the 2-year and 4-year levels in 2015-16. For example, the percentage of 4-year institutions that had open admissions policies (i.e., accepted all applicants) ranged from 63 percent at private for-profit institutions to 19 percent at public institutions and 16 percent at private nonprofit institutions. In contrast, 19 percent of private nonprofit 4-year institutions and 12 percent of public 4-year institutions accepted less than one-half of their applicants, whereas 2 percent of private for-profit 4-year institutions did so. Most 2-year institutions (91 percent) had open admissions policies in 2015-16. Open admissions policies were in operation at 98 percent of public 2-year institutions and 83 percent of private for-profit 2-year institutions, compared to 65 percent at private nonprofit 2-year institutions. A higher percentage of private nonprofit 2-year institutions were selective than public and private for-profit 2-year institutions. Ten percent of private nonprofit 2-year institutions accepted less than one-half of their applicants, whereas less than 1 percent of public 2-year institutions and 1 percent of private for-profit 2-year institutions did so.  Research universities with a very high level of research activity. 2 Research universities with a high level of research activity. 3 Institutions that award at least 20 doctor's degrees per year, but did not have a high level of research activity. 4 Institutions that award at least 50 master's degrees per year but fewer than 20 doctorates. 5 Institutions that primarily emphasize undergraduate education. Also includes institutions classified as 4-year under the IPEDS system, which had been classified as baccalaureate/associate's colleges in the Carnegie system because they primarily award associate's degrees. 6 Institutions that award degrees primarily in single fields of study, such as medicine, business, fine arts, theology, and engineering. NOTE: Degree-granting institutions grant associate's or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. Relative levels of research activity for research universities were determined by an analysis of research and development expenditures, science and engineering research staffing, and doctoral degrees conferred, by field. Further information on the research index ranking may be obtained from http://carnegieclassifications. Another way to classify institutions beyond just the level (2-year vs. 4-year) is by Carnegie classification, which takes into account such considerations as the types of degrees offered as well as institutional mission. Institutions that confer 4-year or higher degrees are classified in broad aggregate categories: doctoral and research universities (institutions that award at least 20 doctor's degrees per year); master's colleges and universities (institutions that award at least 50 master's degrees per year but fewer than 20 doctorates); baccalaureate colleges (institutions that have at least one baccalaureate degree program and primarily emphasize undergraduate education); and special focus 4-year (institutions that award degrees primarily in single fields or related fields of study, such as medicine, business, fine arts, theology, and engineering, at both undergraduate and graduate levels). In 2015-16, there were more baccalaureate colleges (934) and master's colleges and universities (739) than doctoral universities (328). Doctoral universities are further classified into one of three categories based on a measure of research activity. Among the 328 doctoral universities, 219 institutions were classified as research institutions with a very high (115) or high (104) level of research activity. The remaining 109 institutions awarded at least 20 doctor's degrees per year, but did not have a high level of research activity. Special focus institutions accounted for approximately one-third of all 4-year institutions in 2015-16. There were more doctoral (193), master's (271), and baccalaureate institutions (198) than special focus 4-year institutions (48) among public institutions in 2015-16. On the other hand, the number of special focus 4-year institutions was higher than the number of doctoral, master's, and baccalaureate institutions in both the private nonprofit and private for-profit institution categories. (Among private nonprofit institutions, there were 599 special focus 4-year, 118 doctoral, 406 master's, and 469 baccalaureate institutions; among private for-profit institutions, there were 337 special focus 4-year, 17 doctoral, 62 master's, and 267 baccalaureate institutions.)  Institutions that conferred associate's degrees as the highest degree level offering are further divided into subcategories according to program focus (i.e., transfer, career and technical, mixed transfer/career, and special focus 2-year). Among schools classified at the 2-year level, 315 out of 336 mixed transfer/career and technical institutions and 352 out of 369 high transfer institutions were under public control. As for special focus 2-year institutions, 378 out of 476 were private for-profit institutions and 70 were private nonprofit institutions. In addition, out of 396 high career and technical institutions, 215 were public, 162 were private for-profit institutions, and 19 were private nonprofit institutions.

Despite the faster growth in the number of faculty at private for-profit institutions over this period, only 7 percent of all faculty were employed by private for-profit institutions in 2015, while 63 percent were employed by public institutions and 30 percent by private nonprofit institutions. The ratio of full-time equivalent (FTE) students to faculty in 2015 was lower than in 2005 or 1995 at degreegranting postsecondary institutions. The ratio was 15:1 in 1995, 15:1 in 2005, and 14:1 in 2015.

Average faculty salaries varied by academic rank. In academic year 2015-16, the average salary for full-time instructional faculty on 9-month contracts at degreegranting postsecondary institutions was $82,100; average salaries ranged from $57,300 for lecturers to $115,400 for professors. The average salary for all full-time instructional faculty increased by 7 percent between 1995-96 and 2010-11 (from $76,000 to $81,300), and was 1 percent higher in 2015-16 ($82,100) than in 2010-11 (salaries are expressed in constant 2015-16 dollars).

Despite the greater increase in salary for females, the inflation-adjusted salary gap between male and female instructional faculty overall was slightly higher in 2015-16 than in 1995-96 ($15,400 vs. $15,300). The male-female salary gap among professors also increased between 1995-96 and 2015-16 (from $11,800 to $18,100). Faculty salaries also varied according to type of degreegranting postsecondary institution. In academic year 2015-16, the average salary for full-time instructional faculty at private nonprofit institutions ($90,000) was higher than the average salaries for full-time instructional faculty at public institutions ($78,900) and at private for-profit institutions ($52,400). Among the specific types of private nonprofit institutions and public institutions, average salaries for instructional faculty were highest at private nonprofit doctoral institutions ($105,300) and public doctoral institutions ($89,500). Average salaries were lowest for instructional faculty at private nonprofit 2-year institutions ($28,900), public 4-year institutions other than doctoral and master's degree-granting institutions ($63,600), and public 2-year institutions ($66,000). Average salaries for instructional faculty were 2 percent higher in 2015-16 than in 1999-2000 at public institutions ($78,900 vs. $77,400), 10 percent higher at private nonprofit institutions ($90,000 vs. $81,900), and 26 percent higher at private for-profit institutions ($52,400 vs. $41,600). In academic year 2015-16, approximately 52 percent of degree-granting postsecondary institutions had tenure systems. A tenure system guarantees that professors will not be terminated without just cause after a probationary period. The percentage of institutions with tenure systems ranged from 1 percent at private for-profit institutions to almost 100 percent at public doctoral institutions. Of fulltime faculty at institutions with tenure systems, 47 percent had tenure in 2015-16, compared with 54 percent in 1999-2000. From 1999-2000 to 2015-16, the percentage of full-time faculty with tenure decreased by 7 percentage points at public institutions, by 5 percentage points at private nonprofit institutions, and by 60 percentage points at private for-profit institutions. At institutions with tenure systems, the percentage of full-time instructional faculty with tenure was higher for males than for females. In 2015-16, some 56 percent of males had tenure, compared with 42 percent of females. About 39 percent of the bachelor's degrees conferred in 2014-15 were concentrated in three fields of study: business (19 percent, or 364,000 degrees); health professions and related programs (11 percent, or 216,000 degrees); and social sciences and history (9 percent, or 167,000 degrees). Business and social sciences and history were also among the top three fields in 2004-05. Education, which was the field in which the third most degrees were conferred in 2004-05, dropped to eighth in 2014-15 (from 105,000 to 91,600). The three next largest fields of study among bachelor's degrees conferred in 2014-15 were in the fields of psychology (6 percent, or 118,000 degrees); biological and biomedical sciences (6 percent, or 110,000 degrees); and engineering (5 percent, or 97,900 degrees). For every racial/ethnic group, business was the most common field of study for bachelor's degrees conferred in 2014-15. As with associate's degrees, the racial/ethnic distribution of graduates earning bachelor's degrees in STEM fields differed from the overall racial/ethnic distribution of bachelor's degrees. The percentage of STEM bachelor's degrees conferred to Asian/Pacific Islander graduates (13 percent) was higher than their percentage among all bachelor's degree recipients (7 percent). The percentages of STEM bachelor's degrees conferred to White (66 percent), Hispanic (10 percent), and Black (7 percent) graduates were lower than the percentages of overall White (67 percent), Hispanic (12 percent), and Black (11 percent) bachelor's degree recipients.

Of the 179,000 doctor's degrees conferred, almost two-thirds were concentrated in health professions and related programs (71,000 degrees) and legal professions and studies (40,300 degrees). Between 2004-05 and 2014-15, the total number of master's degrees conferred by postsecondary institutions increased by 31 percent, from 580,000 to 759,000. During the same period, the overall number of doctor's degrees conferred increased by 33 percent, from 134,000 to 179,000. This indicator examines the fields of study in which these degrees were conferred, and how the number awarded in each field has changed across time. Of the 759,000 master's degrees conferred in 2014-15 by postsecondary institutions, the largest percentages were in three fields of study: business (24 percent, 185,000 degrees), education (19 percent, 147,000 degrees), and health professions and related programs (14 percent, 103,000 degrees). The fields in which the next largest percentages of master's degrees were conferred were engineering (6 percent, 46,100 degrees) and public administration and social services (6 percent, 46,100 degrees). These five fields also accounted for the largest percentages conferred in 2004-05 and 2013-14.  Of the 20 fields in which the most master's degrees were conferred in 2014-15, more degrees were conferred in 2014-15 than in 2004-05 for all fields except education. During this period, the largest percentage increase in the number of master's degrees conferred was in the field of homeland security, law enforcement, and firefighting (142 percent, from 4,000 to 9,600 degrees). The next largest percentage increase was in the field of health professions and related programs (120 percent, from 46,700 to 103,000 degrees). Of these 20 fields, the field with the smallest percentage increase since 2004-05 in degrees conferred was English language and literature/ letters (5 percent, from 8,500 to 8,900 degrees). The number of degrees conferred in education was lower in 2014-15 (147,000) than in 2004-05 (167,000). More recently, between 2013-14 and 2014-15 the number of business degrees conferred decreased by 2 percent (from 189,000 to 185,000 degrees) and the number of education degrees conferred decreased by 5 percent (from 155,000 to 147,000 degrees). In comparison, the overall number of master's degrees conferred by postsecondary institutions increased by 1 percent. In 2014-15, the top three master's degree fields were the same for all racial/ethnic groups: business, education, and health professions and related programs, although the rank order of these fields differed across groups. The racial/ethnic distribution of graduates earning degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)1 fields differed from the racial/ethnic distribution of master's degree graduates overall. The percentage of STEM master's degrees conferred to Asian/Pacific Islander graduates (15 percent) was higher than the percentage of master's degrees conferred to Asian/Pacific Islander graduates overall (7 percent). In contrast, the percentages of STEM master's degrees conferred to White (65 percent), Black (8 percent), and Hispanic (8 percent) graduates were lower than the percentages of master's degrees conferred to each group overall (68 percent, 14 percent, and 9 percent, respectively). Similar to master's degrees, of the 179,000 doctor's degrees conferred by postsecondary institutions, almost two-thirds of degrees were concentrated in two fields of study: health professions and related programs (40 percent, 71,000 degrees) and legal professions and studies (23 percent, 40,300 degrees). The three fields in which the next largest percentages of doctor's degrees were conferred were education (7 percent, 11,800 degrees), engineering (6 percent, 10,200 degrees), and biological and biomedical sciences (5 percent, 8,100 degrees). The largest number of doctor's degrees were conferred in health professions and related programs and in legal professions and studies in each year from 2004-05 through 2014-15. The number of degrees conferred in health professions and related programs increased by 61 percent over this period (from 44,200 to 71,000 degrees); however, the number of degrees conferred in legal professions and studies was lower in 2014-15 than in 2004-05 (40,300 vs. 43,500 degrees). Among the 20 largest fields of study in 2014-15, the field of business had the largest percentage increase in the number of doctor's degrees conferred between 2004-05 and 2014-15 (108 percent, from 1,500 to 3,100 degrees). The field with the next largest percentage increase during this period was computer and information sciences (79 percent, from 1,100 to 2,000 degrees). Of these 20 fields, the field with the smallest percentage increase between 2004-05 and 2014-15 was English language and literature/letters (17 percent, from 1,200 to 1,400 degrees). More recently, between 2013-14 and 2014-15, the number of health professions and related programs degrees conferred increased by 5 percent (from 67,400 to 71,000 degrees) and the number of legal professions and studies degrees conferred decreased by 9 percent (from 44,200 to 40,300 degrees). In comparison, the overall number of doctor's degrees conferred by postsecondary institutions increased by 1 percent. In 2014-15, the top two doctor's degree fields were the same for all racial/ethnic groups: health professions and related programs, and legal professions and studies; however, the rank order of these fields differed across groups. As with master's degrees, the racial/ethnic distribution of graduates earning doctor's degrees in STEM fields differed from the racial/ethnic distribution of graduates earning doctor's degrees overall.

The retention rate (i.e., the percentage of students returning the following fall) among first-time, fulltime degree-seeking students who enrolled at 4-year degree-granting institutions in 2014 was 81 percent. Retention rates were higher at institutions that were more selective, regardless of institutional control (public, private nonprofit, or private for-profit). At public 4-year institutions, the overall retention rate was 81 percent; at the least selective institutions (i.e., those with open admissions) the retention rate was 62 percent, while at the most selective institutions (i.e., those that accept less than 25 percent of applicants) the retention rate was 96 percent. The retention rate for private nonprofit 4-year institutions was 82 percent overall, ranging from 63 percent at institutions with open admissions to 96 percent at institutions that accept less than 25 percent of applicants. The retention rate for private for-profit 4-year institutions was 55 percent overall, ranging from 51 percent at institutions with open admissions to 76 percent at institutions that accept between 25 and 50 percent of applicants. In 2014 and 2015, no students attended private for-profit institutions with an acceptance rate under 25 percent. At 2-year institutions, the overall retention rate for students was 61 percent; at this institution level, the retention rate for private for-profit institutions (66 percent) was higher than for both private nonprofit and public institutions (61 percent each). The 1990 Student Right-to-Know Act requires postsecondary institutions to report the percentage of students who complete their program within 150 percent of the normal time for completion (e.g., within 6 years for students pursuing a bachelor's degree). The graduation rates in this indicator are based on this measure. Students who transfer without completing a degree are counted as noncompleters in the calculation of these rates regardless of whether they complete a degree at another institution.  The 6-year graduation rate for first-time, full-time undergraduate students who began seeking a bachelor's degree at a 4-year degree-granting institution in fall 2009 was 59 percent. That is, 59 percent had completed a bachelor's degree by 2015 at the same institution where they started in 2009. The 6-year graduation rate was 59 percent at public institutions, 66 percent at private nonprofit institutions, and 23 percent at private for-profit institutions. The 6-year graduation rate was 62 percent for females and 56 percent for males; it was higher for females than for males at both public (61 vs. 55 percent) and private nonprofit institutions (68 vs. 62 percent). However, at private for-profit institutions, males had a higher 6-year graduation rate than females (24 vs. 22 percent).  Six-year graduation rates for first-time, full-time students who began seeking a bachelor's degree in fall 2009 varied according to institutional selectivity. In particular, 6-year graduation rates were highest at institutions that were the most selective (i.e., had the lowest admissions acceptance rates) and were lowest at institutions that were the least selective (i.e., had open admissions policies). For example, at 4-year institutions with open admissions policies, 32 percent of students completed a bachelor's degree within 6 years. At 4-year institutions where the acceptance rate was less than 25 percent of applicants, the 6-year graduation rate was 88 percent. Between 2010 and 2015, the overall 6-year graduation rate for first-time, full-time students who began seeking a bachelor's degree at 4-year degree-granting institutions increased by 1 percentage point, from 58 percent (for students who began their studies in 2004 and graduated within 6 years) to 59 percent (for students who began their studies in 2009 and graduated within 6 years). During this period, 6-year graduation rates were higher in 2015 than in 2010 at public institutions (59 vs. 56 percent) and private nonprofit institutions (66 vs. 65 percent), but lower at private for-profit institutions (23 vs. 29 percent). In addition, the 6-year graduation rate for females increased during this period (from 61 to 62 percent), and the 6-year graduation rate for males was approximately 1 percentage point higher (56 percent in both years).  At 2-year degree-granting institutions, 29 percent of first-time, full-time undergraduate students who began seeking a certificate or associate's degree in fall 2012 attained it within 150 percent of the normal time required for these programs (an example of completing a credential within 150 percent of the normal time is completing a 2-year degree within 3 years). This graduation rate was 22 percent at public 2-year institutions, 56 percent at private nonprofit 2-year institutions, and 60 percent at private for-profit 2-year institutions. At 2-year institutions overall, as well as at public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit 2-year institutions, the graduation rates were higher for females than for males. At private for-profit 2-year institutions, for example, 61 percent of females versus 58 percent of males who began pursuing a certificate or associate's degree in 2012 completed it within 150 percent of the normal time required.     From 2004-05 to 2014-15, the number of bachelor's degrees conferred by public institutions increased by 30 percent (from 932,000 to 1.2 million), the number conferred by private nonprofit institutions increased by 21 percent (from 458,000 to 554,000), and the number conferred by private for-profit institutions increased by 170 percent (from 49,000 to 132,000). As a result, over this period the proportion of all bachelor's degrees conferred by public institutions decreased (from 65 to 64 percent), as did the proportion conferred by private nonprofit institutions (from 32 to 29 percent), and the proportion conferred by private for-profit institutions increased (from 3 to 7 percent). The number of master's degrees conferred by public institutions from 2004-05 to 2014-15 increased by 20 percent (from 292,000 to 351,000), although the percentage of all master's degrees conferred by these institutions declined from 50 to 46 percent over this period. While the number of master's degrees conferred by private nonprofit institutions increased by 33 percent (from 254,000 to 336,000) over the period, the percentage of all master's degrees conferred by these institutions was 44 percent at both the beginning and the end of the period. In contrast, the number of master's degrees conferred by private for-profit institutions increased by 104 percent (from 35,000 to 71,000) over the period, resulting in an increase in these institutions' proportion of total master's degrees conferred, from 6 to 9 percent. From 2004-05 to 2014-15, the number of doctor's degrees conferred increased by 34 percent at public institutions (from 68,000 to 90,000), by 23 percent at private nonprofit institutions (from 65,000 to 80,000), and by 413 percent at private for-profit institutions (from 2,000 to 8,000). At public institutions, the proportion of doctor's degrees conferred was 50 percent in 2004-05 and 51 percent in 2014-15. At private nonprofit institutions, the proportion of all doctor's degrees conferred decreased over the period (from 49 to 45 percent), while at private for-profit institutions, the proportion conferred increased (from 1 to 5 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Certificates and Degrees Conferred", "text": "The number of postsecondary certificates and degrees conferred at each degree level increased between 2004-05 and 2014-15.

Prior research has found associations among family risk factors and poor educational outcomes, including low achievement scores, having to repeat a grade, and dropping out of high school.1 Family risk factors include coming from a low-income family or single-parent household, not having a parent who completed high school, and living in a household where the primary language is not English. Young children vary in their academic skills at kindergarten entry, with those who have one or more family risk factors tending to score lower in reading and mathematics in kindergarten and over the first few years of elementary school compared to their peers with fewer or no risk factors. This Spotlight focuses on the characteristics of students who had two of these types of risk factors at kindergarten entry: living in households with income below the federal poverty threshold and not having a parent who completed high school. It then describes associations between the presence or absence of these two family risk factors and students' academic achievement from kindergarten through third grade.2 In the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011), information on family risk factors was collected through parent interviews. Household poverty status in kindergarten was based on whether the household's income fell below poverty thresholds defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. These thresholds reflect the amount of income that is considered sufficient to meet household needs, given family size and composition.3 Parents' highest level of education was measured in the fall of students' kindergarten year and reflects the highest level of education achieved by either of the parents or guardians in a two-parent household, by the only parent in a single-parent household, or by any guardian in a household with no parents.4 For this spotlight, children living in households whose income fell below the federal poverty threshold are identified as \"living in poverty,\" and children living in households in which no parent or guardian had completed high school are identified as \"not having a parent who completed high school.\" In addition, the ECLS-K:2011 assessed children's skills in reading, mathematics, and science in kindergarten through grade 3. Trained assessors conducted individually administered, two-stage adaptive assessments (with the exception of the spring kindergarten science assessment, which was a nonadaptive one-stage assessment) in which assessors asked children questions related to images presented on a small easel and entered the children's responses into a study computer. Reading and mathematics assessments were administered in the fall and spring of kindergarten through grade 2 and in the spring of grade 3. Science assessments were administered in the spring of kindergarten, in the fall and spring of grades 1 and 2, and in the spring of grade 3.5 Possible scores on the assessments range from 0 to 141 in reading, 0 to 135 in mathematics, and 0 to 87 in science.  . Estimates pertain to a sample of children who were enrolled in kindergarten for the first time in the 2010-11 school year. Estimates represent characteristics as of 2010-11, when the first wave of data collection occurred, and include the entire sample of 2010-11 first-time kindergartners. Parents' highest level of education is the highest level of education achieved by either of the parents or guardians in a two-parent household, by the only parent in a single-parent household, or by any guardian in a household with no parents. Poverty status is based on preliminary U.S. Census income thresholds for 2010, which identify incomes determined to meet household needs, given family size and composition. For example, a family of three with one child was below the poverty threshold if its income was less than $17,552 in 2010. During the 2010-11 school year, 6 percent of first-time kindergartners had both the risk factor of living in poverty and the risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school, 18 percent had the single risk factor of living in poverty, and 2 percent had the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school. About 75 percent of first-time kindergartners had neither of these two risk factors present during their kindergarten year.   \u2021 Reporting standards not met.

Estimates represent characteristics as of 2010-11, when the first wave of data collection occurred, and include the entire sample of 2010-11 first-time kindergartners. Parents' highest level of education is the highest level of education achieved by either of the parents or guardians in a two-parent household, by the only parent in a single-parent household, or by any guardian in a household with no parents. Poverty status is based on preliminary U.S. Census income thresholds for 2010, which identify incomes determined to meet household needs, given family size and composition. For example, a family of three with one child was below the poverty threshold if its income was less than $17,552 in 2010. The percentage of first-time kindergartners who had family risk factors analyzed in this report differed with respect to their race/ethnicity, household type, and primary home language. The percentage of first-time kindergartners who had both risk factors of living in poverty and not having a parent who completed high school was higher for Hispanic students (15 percent) than for Black and Asian students (8 percent each), and the percentages for these three racial/ethnic groups were all higher than the percentage for White students (1 percent). Having the single risk factor of living in poverty was more common for Black (31 percent) and Hispanic kindergartners (27 percent) than it was for kindergartners of Two or more races (15 percent), Asian kindergartners (13 percent), White kindergartners (11 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native kindergartners (9 percent). The percentages of Hispanic and Asian kindergartners with the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school (6 and 5 percent, respectively) were higher than the percentages for Black (1 percent) and White kindergartners (less than 1 percent). In contrast, the percentage of first-time kindergartners who had neither risk factor were higher for White kindergartners (88 percent), kindergartners of Two or more races (83 percent), and Asian and American Indian/Alaska Native kindergartners (75 percent each) than for Black (60 percent) and Hispanic kindergartners (52 percent). In addition, the percentage who had neither risk factor was higher for Black kindergartners than for Hispanic kindergartners, and was higher for White kindergartners than for Asian and American Indian/ Alaska Native kindergartners.  \u2021 Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater. NOTE: Estimates weighted by W7C17P_7T170. Estimates pertain to a sample of children who were enrolled in kindergarten for the first time in the 2010-11 school year. Estimates represent characteristics as of 2010-11, when the first wave of data collection occurred, and include the entire sample of 2010-11 first-time kindergartners. Parents' highest level of education is the highest level of education achieved by either of the parents or guardians in a two-parent household, by the only parent in a single-parent household, or by any guardian in a household with no parents. Poverty status is based on preliminary U.S. Census income thresholds for 2010, which identify incomes determined to meet household needs, given family size and composition. For example, a family of three with one child was below the poverty threshold if its income was less than $17,552 in 2010. A two-parent household may have two biological parents, two adoptive parents, or one biological/adoptive parent and one other parent/partner. A mother-only or father-only household has one biological or adoptive parent only, without another parent/partner. In other household types, which do not include biological or adoptive parents, the guardian or guardians may be related or unrelated to the child. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and survey item nonresponse. With respect to household type,6 the percentage of firsttime kindergartners who had both the risk factor of living in poverty and the risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school was higher for students living in mother-only households (10 percent) than for students living in two-parent households (4 percent). Having the single risk factor of living in poverty was more common for students in mother-only (39 percent) and fatheronly households (28 percent) than it was for students in two-parent households (12 percent). No measurable differences by household type were found with respect to the percentage of students with the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school. The percentage of first-time kindergartners who had neither risk factor was highest for students from two-parent households (82 percent) and lowest for students from mother-only households (48 percent); about 63 percent each of first-time kindergartners from father-only households and from other household types had neither risk factor.  \nIn 2014-15, instruction expenses per full-time-equivalent (FTE) student (in constant 2015-16 dollars) was the largest expense category at public institutions ($8,433) and private nonprofit institutions ($17,426). At private for-profit institutions, the combined category of student services, academic support, and institutional support expenses per FTE student was the largest expense category ($9,905). In academic year 2014-15, postsecondary institutions in the United States spent $536 billion (in current dollars). Total expenses were $336 billion at public institutions, $182 billion at private nonprofit institutions, and $18 billion at private for-profit institutions. Some data may not be comparable across institutions by control categories (i.e., public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit) because of differences in accounting standards. Comparisons by institutional level (i.e., between 2-year and 4-year institutions) may also be limited because of different institutional missions. The instructional missions of 2-year institutions generally focus on student instruction and related activities that often include providing a range of career-oriented programs at the certificate and associate's degree levels and preparing students for transfer to 4-year institutions. Four-year institutions tend to have a broad range of instructional programs at the undergraduate level leading to bachelor's degrees. Many 4-year institutions offer graduate-level programs as well. Also, research activities, on-campus student housing, teaching hospitals, and auxiliary enterprises can have a substantial impact on the financial structure of 4-year institutions. In this indicator, expenses are grouped into the following broad categories: instruction, research, public service, academic support, student services, institutional support, operation and maintenance of plant, depreciation, scholarships and fellowships, auxiliary enterprises, hospitals, independent operations, interest, and other.  Instruction, including faculty salaries and benefits, was the largest single expense category at public and private nonprofit postsecondary institutions in 2014-15, accounting for 27 percent of total expenses at public institutions and 32 percent of total expenses at private nonprofit institutions. The largest expense category at private for-profit institutions in that year was for the combined expenses of student services, academic support, and institutional support, which includes expenses associated with noninstructional activities, such as admissions, student activities, libraries, and administrative and executive activities. At private for-profit institutions, these expenses accounted for 63 percent of total spending, more than twice the percentage spent on instruction (27 percent). By comparison, student services, academic support, and institutional support made up 20 percent of total expenses at public institutions and 30 percent of total expenses at private nonprofit institutions. Combined expenses for research and public service (such as expenses for public broadcasting and community services) constituted 13 percent of total expenses at public institutions; hospital expenses constituted 11 percent and auxiliary enterprises (i.e., self-supporting operations, such as residence halls) constituted 7 percent of total expenses at public institutions. At private nonprofit institutions, research and public service combined, hospitals, and auxiliary enterprises constituted 12, 11, and 9 percent of total expenses, respectively. In 2014-15, across all types of postsecondary institutional control, 2-year institutions spent a greater share of their total expenses on instruction than did 4-year institutions. For example, instructional expenses accounted for 35 percent of total expenses at public 2-year institutions, compared with 25 percent at public 4-year institutions. In 2014-15, total expenses per full-time-equivalent (FTE) student were higher at private nonprofit 4-year postsecondary institutions ($54,157) than at public 4-year institutions ($41,074) and private for-profit 4-year institutions ($15,470). Expenses per FTE student in this indicator are adjusted for inflation using constant 2015-16 dollars, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Private nonprofit 4-year institutions spent nearly twice as much per FTE student on instruction ($17,567) as public 4-year institutions ($10,221) and more than four times as much as private for-profit 4-year institutions ($3,948). Similarly, for the combined expenses of student services, academic support, and institutional support, $16,309 per FTE student was spent at private nonprofit 4-year institutions, which was higher than the amount spent at private for-profit 4-year institutions ($10,168 per FTE student), which was, in turn, higher than the amount spent at public 4-year institutions ($7,490 per FTE student). Expenses per FTE student for research and public service were higher at private nonprofit 4-year institutions ($6,268) and public 4-year institutions ($6,131) than at private for-profit 4-year institutions ($19). Among 2-year institutions, private nonprofit institutions spent more per FTE student on instruction ($6,931) than did private forprofit ($5,219) and public institutions ($5,131). Changes in inflation-adjusted instruction expenses per FTE student between 2009-10 and 2014-15 varied by postsecondary institution control and level. Among 2-year institutions, instruction expenses per FTE student were higher in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 at public (11 percent higher) and private for-profit institutions (18 percent higher). At private nonprofit 2-year institutions, instruction expenses per FTE student were 2 percent lower in 2014-15 than in 2009-10. Among 4-year institutions, instruction expenses per FTE student were higher in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 at public (3 percent higher), private nonprofit (6 percent higher), and private for-profit institutions (23 percent higher)."}, {"section_title": "Risk factors", "text": "Percent # Rounds to zero.

Science was not assessed in the fall of kindergarten. Scores on the science assessment reflect performance on questions on physical sciences, life sciences, environmental sciences, and scientific inquiry. Possible scores for the science assessment range from 0 to 87. Estimates pertain to a sample of children who were enrolled in kindergarten for the first time in the 2010-11 school year. Most of the children were in first grade in 2011-12, second grade in 2012-13, and third grade in 2013-14, but some of the children were in other grades. In 2013-14, for example, 6 percent of the children were not in third grade (e.g., were in second grade, fourth grade, or ungraded classrooms). Information on risk factors and student and family characteristics are based on data collected during the kindergarten year. Parents' highest level of education is the highest level of education achieved by either of the parents or guardians in a two-parent household, by the only parent in a single-parent household, or by any guardian in a household with no parents. Poverty status is based on preliminary U.S. Census income thresholds for 2010, which identify incomes determined to meet household needs, given family size and composition. For example, a family of three with one child was below the poverty threshold if its income was less than $17,552 in 2010. Differences in science scores among the risk factor groups also varied by grade level. In the spring data collections for kindergarten and first grade, students with neither risk factor had the highest average science scores. In addition, students with the single risk factor of living in poverty had higher average scores than students with the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school as well as higher average scores than students with both the risk factor of living in poverty and the risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school. For example, the average spring kindergarten science score was highest for first-time kindergartners who had neither risk factor (33 points), and the average score for those who had the single risk factor of living in poverty (29 points) was higher than the average score for those with the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school and higher than the average score for those with both risk factors (25 points each).9 Similar to the pattern observed in mathematics, average science scores in the spring data collections for second and third grade were highest for students who had neither risk factor and lowest for students who had both risk factors; no measurable differences were observed between the average scores for students who had either of the single risk factors. For instance, students with neither risk factor had the highest average spring third-grade score (58 points), and students who had either the single risk factor of living in poverty or the single risk factor of not having a parent who completed high school had higher average scores (52 and 51 points, respectively) than students who had both risk factors (47 points). 4 Parents are identified as having completed high school if they reported receiving a high school diploma or acquiring a GED (high school equivalency based on passing the GED exam). 5 Although assessment data were also collected in the fall of grades 1 and 2, results are not included in this spotlight because the assessments were only administered to a subsample of ECLS-K:2011 students. 6 A two-parent household may have two biological parents, two adoptive parents, or one biological/adoptive parent and one other parent/partner. A mother-only or father-only household has one biological or adoptive parent only, without another parent/partner. In other household types, which do not include biological or adoptive parents, the guardian or guardians may be related or unrelated to the child. 7 The fall kindergarten reading score for the full ECLS-K:2011 sample has a mean of 51 and a standard deviation (SD) of 11.1. Scale score gaps that are greater than or equal to 2.2 points (0.2 of an SD) are considered substantively meaningful for the purposes of this analysis. For example, the scale score gap between students who had neither risk factor (54 points) and those who had both risk factors (45 points) was 0.8 SD. 8 The fall kindergarten mathematics score for the full ECLS-K:2011 sample has a mean of 33 and a standard deviation (SD) of 11.4. Scale score gaps that are greater than or equal to 2.3 points (0.2 of an SD) are considered substantively meaningful for the purposes of this analysis. For example, the scale score gap between students who had neither risk factor (37 points) and those who had both risk factors (26 points) was 1.0 SD. 9 The spring kindergarten science score for the full ECLS-K:2011 sample has a mean of 31 and a standard deviation (SD) of 6.9. Scale score gaps that are greater than or equal to 1.4 points (0.2 of an SD) are considered substantively meaningful for the purposes of this analysis. For example, the scale score gap between students who had neither risk factor (33 points) and those who had both risk factors (25 points) was 1.2 SD.

Overall, 14.4 million, or 9 percent, of the 25-to 64-year-old population reported at least one of these disabilities in 2015. The number of 25-to 64-year-olds with disabilities was higher in 2015 than in 2010 (13.6 million). To some extent, this change reflects population growth between 2010 and 2015, as there was no measurable change over this period in the percentage of persons with disabilities. A higher percentage of older persons had disabilities compared to younger persons in 2015. For example, the disability rate was 15 percent for 55-to 64-year-olds, compared to 10 percent for 45-to 54-year-olds, 6 percent for 35-to 44-year-olds, and 4 percent for 25-to 34-yearolds. The disability rate for 25-to 34-year-olds was higher in 2015 (4.2 percent) than in 2010 (3.7 percent). For other age groups, the disability rate in 2015 was not measurably different from the rate in 2010. In 2015, the disability rate was higher for persons with less education than for those with higher educational attainment, both overall and within each age group. The disability rate was 16 percent for 25-to 64-year-olds who had not completed high school, compared to 11 percent for those who had completed high school, 10 percent for those who had completed some college, 8 percent for those with an associate's degree, 4 percent for those with a bachelor's degree, and 3 percent for those with a master's or higher degree. These patterns were generally observed within each age group, with few exceptions. For example, among 25-to 34-year-olds, there was no measurable difference between the disability rates for those who had not completed high school and those who had completed high school (both 7 percent), but both were higher than the disability rates for those with more education. The gap in disability rates between the lowest and highest educational attainment groups is larger for the oldest group (55-to 64-year-olds) than for the youngest group (25-to 34-year-olds). Specifically, among 55-to 64-year-olds, the disability rate was 23 percentage points higher for persons who had not completed high school (29 percent) than for those with a master's or higher degree (6 percent). In contrast, among 25-to 34-year-olds, the disability rate was 6 percentage points higher for those who had not completed high school (7 percent) than for those who had completed a master's or higher degree (1 percent). While disability rates are generally higher for older adults than for younger adults, the gaps by educational attainment within each age group are large enough that the disability rate for 25-to 34-year-olds who had not completed high school was not measurably different from the rate for 55-to 64-year-olds who had completed a master's degree. There was no measurable difference between the disability rates for male and female 25-to 64-year-olds in 2015 (both were 9 percent). However, there were differences by race/ethnicity. Among 25-to 64-year-olds, disability rates were lower for those who were Asian (3 percent), Pacific Islander (5 percent), and Hispanic (7 percent) than for those who were White (9 percent), Black (12 percent), of Two or more races (14 percent), and American Indian/ Alaska Native (15 percent). The pattern of higher disability rates for persons who had not completed high school compared to those with a bachelor's or higher degree was observed across all racial/ethnic groups with available data in 2015 (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Two or more races). "}, {"section_title": "Employment of 25-to 64-year-olds with and without disabilities", "text": "Studies by BLS have found that persons with disabilities participate in the labor force at lower rates than persons without disabilities.1 The analysis below builds on those findings by examining patterns in labor force outcomes (percentages of individuals who were employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force) by educational attainment. Overall, 27 percent of 25-to 64-year-olds with disabilities were employed in 2015, compared to 77 percent of those without disabilities. On the other hand, 70 percent of those with disabilities were not in the labor force, compared to 19 percent of those without disabilities. There was no measurable difference between the overall unemployment percentages for individuals with and without disabilities (3 and 4 percent, respectively). Note that the unemployment percentage presented here is not comparable to unemployment rates produced by BLS, which exclude individuals not in the labor force. In 2015, among each age group examined in this indicator, employment percentages were higher for persons without disabilities than for those with disabilities. The gap ranged from 43 percentage points for 25-to 34-yearolds to 53 percentage points for 45-to 54-year-olds. Among persons with disabilities, a higher percentage of 25-to 34-year-olds were employed (35 percent) than of 35-to 44-year-olds (29 percent), 45-to 54-year-olds (28 percent), and 55-to 64-year-olds (24 percent). The pattern of employment by age group was somewhat different for persons without disabilities. Although the percentage of 25-to 34-year-olds who were employed (78 percent) was higher than the percentage for 55-to 64-year-olds (69 percent), it was lower than the percentages for 35-to 44-year-olds and 45-to 54-yearolds (both 81 percent). Among 25-to 64-year-olds in 2015, the employment percentage for males was higher than for females, regardless of disability status. The male-female gap in employment percentages was smaller for persons with disabilities (5 percentage points) than for those without disabilities (13 percentage points). This pattern was also observed among those who had not completed high school and those who had a high school credential. For example, among persons who had not completed high school, the male-female gap in employment percentages was 6 percentage points for those with disabilities and 29 percentage points for those without disabilities.

It is important to keep in mind when interpreting these unemployment percentages that the employment percentage is lower for 25-to 64-year-olds with disabilities than for those without disabilities. Thus, the number of unemployed persons relative to employed persons (i.e., the unemployment rate as defined by BLS) is higher for 25-to 64-year-olds with disabilities (11.0 percent) than for those without disabilities (4.5 percent).1 For persons without disabilities, higher educational attainment was often associated with lower unemployment percentages. For example, those who had completed an associate's degree and those who had completed a bachelor's or higher degree had lower unemployment percentages than those who had not completed high school. Among those who had not completed high school, the unemployment percentage for persons with disabilities (2.4 percent) was lower than for persons without disabilities (6.1 percent). In contrast, among those who had completed a bachelor's or higher degree, the unemployment percentage was higher for persons with disabilities (3.5 percent) than for those without disabilities (2.0 percent).

The percentage of 25-to 64-yearolds with disabilities who were not in the labor force (70 percent) was higher than the percentage for those without disabilities (19 percent). While higher percentages of persons with disabilities were not participating in the labor force for all educational attainment groups in 2015, the largest differences were observed among those with lower levels of educational attainment. For example, among those who had not completed high school, the percentage of persons with disabilities not in the labor force (83 percent) was 51 percentage points higher than the percentage for those without disabilities (32 percent). The differences in the percentages for those not participating in the labor force were smaller at higher levels of educational attainment. For example, among those who had completed a bachelor's or higher degree, the not-in-labor force percentage for persons with disabilities (51 percent) was 38 percentage points higher than the percentage for those without disabilities (14 percent). In summary, this indicator finds that in 2015, higher percentages of 25-to 64-year-olds with lower levels of education had disabilities compared to those with higher levels of education. Differences in the employment and not-in-labor-force percentages between persons with and without disabilities are substantial, amounting to about 50 percentage points each. Among those who had obtained higher levels of education, the differences were smaller.   Between 2000 and 2016, the percentage of 25-to 29-yearolds who had completed at least a high school diploma or its equivalent increased for those who were White (from 94 to 95 percent), Black (from 87 to 91 percent), Hispanic (from 63 to 81 percent), and Asian/Pacific Islander (from 94 to 97 percent). The percentage of American Indian/ Alaska Native 25-to 29-year-olds with at least a high school diploma or its equivalent in 2016 (84 percent) was not measurably different from the percentage in 2000, and the percentage of 25-to 29-year-olds of Two or more races who had attained this level of education in 2016 (95 percent) was not measurably different from the percentage in 2003, the first year for which data on persons of Two or more races were available. Between 2000 and 2016, the percentage of White 25-to 29-year-olds who had attained at least a high school diploma or its equivalent remained higher than the percentages of Black and Hispanic 25-to 29-yearolds who had attained this education level. However, the White-Black attainment gap at this education level narrowed from 7 to 4 percentage points over this period. The White-Hispanic gap at this education level narrowed from 31 to 15 percentage points, primarily due to the increase in the percentage of Hispanic 25-to 29-year-olds who had completed at least a high school diploma.     From 2000 to 2016, the percentage of 25-to 29-year-olds who had attained a bachelor's or higher degree increased for those who were White (from 34 to 43 percent), Black (from 18 to 23 percent), Hispanic (from 10 to 19 percent), and Asian/Pacific Islander (from 54 to 64 percent). The percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native 25-to 29-year-olds who had attained a bachelor's or higher degree (10 percent) in 2016 was not measurably different from the corresponding percentage in 2000. Similarly, the percentage of 25-to 29-year-olds of Two or more races (28 percent) who had attained this level of education in 2016 was not measurably different from the percentage in 2003. In 2016, neither the gap between White and Black 25-to 29-year-olds nor the gap between White and Hispanic 25-to 29-year-olds at this education level was measurably different from its corresponding gap in 2000. From 2000 to 2016, the percentage of 25-to 29-year-olds who had attained a master's or higher degree increased for those who were White (from 6 to 10 percent), Hispanic (from 2 to 4 percent), and Asian/Pacific Islander (from 16 to 24 percent). The 2016 percentage of Black 25-to 29-year-olds who had attained a master's or higher degree (5 percent) was not measurably different from the percentage in 2000. Similarly, the percentage of 25-to 29-year-olds of Two or more races with a master's or higher degree in 2016 (5 percent) was not measurably different from the percentage in 2003. 1 The gap between the percentages of White and Black 25-to 29-year-olds who had attained this level of education widened from 2 to 5 percentage points from 2000 to 2016.

In nearly all of the 28 OECD countries6 that reported data on high school completion rates in both 2001 and 2015, the percentage of 25-to 64-year-olds who had completed a high school education was higher in 2015 than in 2001. The exceptions were Norway, where the high school completion rate was 3 percentage points lower in 2015 than in 2001, and Denmark and New Zealand, where high school completion rates were not measurably different between the two years. The OECD average percentage of the adult population with a high school education rose from 64 percent in 2001 to 78 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, the percentage of adults in the United States who had completed high school rose from 88 to 90 percent during this period. For 25-to 34-year-olds, the OECD average percentage with a high school education rose from 74 to 84 percent during this period, while the corresponding percentage for U.S. 25-to 34-year-olds increased from 88 to 90 percent. In each of the 28 OECD countries7 that reported data on postsecondary attainment rates in both 2001 and 2015, the percentage of 25-to 64-year-olds who had earned any postsecondary degree was higher in 2015 than in 2001. During this period, the OECD average percentage of the adult population with any postsecondary degree increased by 12 percentage points to 35 percent in 2015, while the corresponding percentage for U.S. adults increased by 7 percentage points to 45 percent. For 25-to 34-year-olds, the OECD average percentage with any postsecondary degree rose from 28 percent in 2001 to 42 percent in 2015. The corresponding percentage for 25-to 34-year-olds in the United States rose from 39 to 47 percent. As a result of the relatively larger increases in postsecondary degree attainment among the 25-to 34-year-old populations in several OECD countries, the attainment gap at this level of education between the U.S. and OECD average percentages decreased between 2001 and 2015. In 2001, the rate of attainment of any postsecondary degree among 25-to 34-year-olds in the United States was 11 percentage points higher than the OECD average; by 2015, this gap had decreased to 4 percentage points. In nearly all of the 31 OECD countries that reported 2015 data on high school completion rates, higher percentages of 25-to 34-year-olds than of 55-to 64-year-olds had completed high school. Across OECD countries, the average high school completion percentage was generally higher for 25-to 34-year-olds (84 percent) than for 55-to 64-year-olds (69 percent). The exceptions were Estonia and Latvia, where high school completion rates for 55-to 64-year-olds were 3 and 4 percentage points higher, respectively, than high school completion rates for 25-to 34-year-olds. In Norway, high school completion percentages of 25-to 34-year-olds and 55-to 64-yearolds were not measurably different from each other (both 81 percent). In 24 countries, including the United States, over 80 percent of 25-to 34-year-olds had completed high school in 2015. In comparison, the percentage of 55-to 64-year-olds who completed high school was more than 80 percent in only 10 countries (Norway, Switzerland, Canada, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Germany, the Czech Republic, Latvia, the United States, and Estonia). The same general pattern of higher percentages of the youngest age group attaining a given level of education also applied to the attainment of postsecondary degrees in 2015. In all of the 31 OECD countries that reported 2015 data on postsecondary attainment rates, a higher percentage of 25-to 34-year-olds than of 55-to 64-year-olds had earned any postsecondary degree in 2015. Across OECD countries, 42 percent of 25-to 34-year-olds had earned any postsecondary degree in 2015 compared with 26 percent of 55-to 64-year-olds. In the United States, 47 percent of 25-to 34-year-olds and 41 percent of 55-to 64-year-olds had earned any postsecondary degree. Canada was the only other country where more than 40 percent of 55-to 64-year-olds had earned any postsecondary degree. In comparison, more than 40 percent of 25-to 34-year-olds had earned any postsecondary degree in 14 countries in 2015.  Country \uf070 The percentage of 25-to 34-year-olds with any postsecondary degree is higher than the percentage of 55-to 64-year-olds with any postsecondary degree. year round. The percentage of young adults in the labor force working full time, year round was generally higher for those with higher levels of educational attainment. For example, 78 percent of young adults with a bachelor's degree worked full time, year round in 2015, compared with 69 percent of young adult high school completers (those with only a high school diploma or its equivalent).  Changes over time in the percentage of young adults in the labor force who worked full time, year round varied by level of educational attainment. From 2000 to 2015, the percentage of young adult high school completers who worked full time, year round decreased from 71 to 69 percent. The corresponding percentage for young adults with an associate's degree decreased from 75 to 69 percent. In contrast, the percentage of young adults with a master's or higher degree who worked full time, year round increased from 73 to 76 percent during the same period. However, in 2015 the percentages of young adults who did not complete high school (i.e., without a high school diploma or its equivalent) (59 percent) and those with a bachelor's degree (78 percent) who worked full time, year round were not measurably different from the corresponding percentages in 2000. Between 2014 and 2015, the percentages of young adults working full time, year round did not change measurably for any individual level of educational attainment. For young adults ages 25-34 who worked full time, year round, higher educational attainment was associated with higher median earnings;1 this pattern was consistent from 2000 through 2015. For example, in 2015 the median earnings of young adults with a bachelor's degree ($50,000) were 64 percent higher than those of young adult high school completers ($30,500). The median earnings of young adult high school completers were 22 percent higher than those of young adults who did not complete high school ($25,000). In addition, median earnings of young adults with a master's or higher degree were $60,000 in 2015, some 20 percent higher than those of young adults with a bachelor's degree. This pattern of higher earnings associated with higher levels of educational attainment also held for both male and female young adults as well as for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian young adults. Median earnings (in constant 2015 dollars)2 of young adults who worked full time, year round declined from 2000 to 2015 at most educational attainment levels, except for those who did not complete high school and those with a master's or higher degree, both of whom saw no measurable change in median earnings between these two years. During this period, the median earnings of young adult high school completers declined from $34,400 to $30,500 (an 11 percent decrease), and the median earnings of those with some college education declined from $39,700 to $34,600 (a 13 percent decrease). In addition, the median earnings of young adults with an associate's degree declined from $41,300 to $36,900 (a 10 percent decrease), and the median earnings of young adults with a bachelor's degree declined from $54,900 to $50,000 (a 9 percent decrease). The difference in median earnings between young adult high school completers and those who did not complete high school was smaller in 2015 than in 2000. In 2000, median earnings of young adult high school completers were $9,400 higher than median earnings of those who did not complete high school; in 2015, this difference was $5,600. Differences between median earnings of those with a bachelor's degree and high school completers and between those with a bachelor's degree and those with a master's or higher degree did not change measurably during the same period. In 2015, median earnings of young adult males who worked full time, year round were higher than the corresponding median earnings of young adult females at every level of educational attainment. For example, median earnings of young adult males with an associate's degree were $42,900 in 2015, while those of their female counterparts were $31,600. The median earnings of young adult males with a high school credential were $34,000, compared with $27,000 for their female counterparts. In the same year, median earnings of White young adults who worked full time, year round exceeded the corresponding median earnings of Black young adults at all attainment levels, except for those with less than high school completion and master's or higher degrees, where there were no measurable differences in median earnings between White and Black young adults. For instance, median earnings in 2015 for young adults with a bachelor's degree were $50,000 for White young adults, compared with $42,800 for Black young adults. In addition, median earnings of White young adults were higher than those of their Hispanic peers among individuals who did not complete high school ($29,800 and $24,000, respectively) and high school completers ($34,600 and $29,700, respectively). At other attainment levels, there was no measurable difference between the median earnings of White and Hispanic young adults. Among those with a bachelor's degree and those with a master's or higher degree, Asian young adults had higher median earnings than their Black, Hispanic, and White peers. For example, median earnings in 2015 for young adults with at least a master's degree were $74,800 for Asian young adults, $60,000 for White young adults, $54,300 for Hispanic young adults, and $54,200 for Black young adults. \n1 Distance education uses one or more technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor as well as to support regular and substantive interaction between the student and the instructor synchronously or asynchronously.   In school year 2014-15, there were 98,180 public schools in the United States, including 91,430 traditional public schools and 6,750 public charter schools. The total number of public schools was higher in 2014-15 than in 2004-05, when there was a total of 96,510 public schools, which included 93,110 traditional public schools and 3,400 public charter schools. Between school years 2004-05 and 2014-15, the percentage of all public schools that were traditional public schools decreased from 96 to 93 percent, while the percentage that were charter schools increased from 4 to 7 percent. See indicator Public Charter School Enrollment for additional information about charter schools and charter school legislation.  In school year 2014-15, in 59 percent of traditional public schools more than half of students were White. In 9 percent of traditional public schools more than half of students were Black and in 16 percent more than half of students were Hispanic. In comparison, 36 percent of charter schools had more than 50 percent White enrollment, 24 percent had more than 50 percent Black enrollment, and 24 percent had more than 50 percent Hispanic enrollment. For both traditional public and public charter schools, the percentages of schools that had more than 50 percent White enrollment or more than 50 percent Black enrollment were lower in 2014-15 than in 2004-05, while the percentage of schools that had more than 50 percent Hispanic enrollment was higher in 2014-15 than in 2004-05. These shifts reflect, in part, general changes in student demographics.   In school year 2014-15, a higher percentage of public charter schools were located in cities and a smaller percentage were located in all other locales compared to traditional public schools. During this school year, 56 percent of public charter schools were located in cities compared to 25 percent of traditional public schools. In contrast, 11 percent of public charter schools were in rural areas compared to 29 percent of traditional public schools. The percentage of public charter schools located in the West was higher than the percentage of traditional public schools in the region in school year 2014-15, while the percentages of public charter schools located in all other regions were lower than the percentages of traditional public schools. About 23 percent of traditional public schools were located in the West compared with 37 percent of public charter schools. In contrast, 16 percent of traditional public schools were located in the Northeast compared with 10 percent of public charter schools. Endnotes: 1 Combined elementary/secondary schools are schools beginning with grade 6 or below and ending with grade 9 or above. In school year 2014-15, some 20 percent of public school students attended low-poverty schools, and 24 percent of public school students attended high-poverty schools.  While the overall percentages of public school students in low-and high-poverty schools were similar (20 and 24 percent, respectively), they varied by race/ethnicity. In school year 2014-15, the percentages of Asian students (37 percent), White students (29 percent), and students of Two or more races (23 percent) who attended low-poverty schools were higher than the national average (20 percent), while the percentages of American Indian/Alaska Native (12 percent), Pacific Islander (12 percent), Hispanic (8 percent), and Black (7 percent) students who attended low-poverty schools were lower than the national average. In contrast, the percentages of Hispanic (46 percent), Black (45 percent), American Indian/Alaska Native (33 percent), and Pacific Islander students (25 percent) who attended high-poverty schools were higher than the national average (24 percent), while the percentages of students of Two or more races (17 percent), Asian students (15 percent), and White students (8 percent) who attended high-poverty schools were lower than the national average. The distribution of public schools at different poverty concentrations varied by school locale (i.e., city, suburb, town, or rural). In school year 2014-15, a majority of students attending city (67 percent) and town (59 percent) schools were in a high-poverty or mid-high poverty school while a majority of students attending suburban (60 percent) and rural (52 percent) schools were in a low-poverty or mid-low poverty school. Some 41 percent of students attending city schools were in a highpoverty school, compared with 19 percent of students attending town schools, 18 percent of students attending suburban schools, and 14 percent of students attending rural schools. In contrast, the percentage of students attending suburban schools who were in a low-poverty school (32 percent) was about four times as large as the corresponding percentage of students attending town schools (8 percent). The percentage of students attending suburban schools who were in a low-poverty school was also higher than the percentages of students attending city and rural schools who were in a low-poverty school (13 and 17 percent, respectively).\n1 For more information on eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch and its relationship to poverty, see NCES blog post \"Free or reduced price lunch: A proxy for poverty?\"   Between 2001 and 2015, the percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months decreased overall (from 6 to 3 percent), as did the percentages of students who reported theft (from 4 to 2 percent) and violent victimization (from 2 to 1 percent). While there was no pattern of decline in the percentage of serious violent victimizations, the percentage in 2015 was lower than in 2001 (0.2 vs. 0.4 percent). The percentage of students who reported being victimized at school decreased between 2001 and 2015 for both male (from 6 to 3 percent) and female students (from 5 to 3 percent), as well as for White (from 6 to 3 percent), Black (from 6 to 2 percent), and Hispanic students (from 5 to 2 percent). In addition, the percentage of students who reported being victimized decreased between 2001 and 2015 for most grades from 6 through 12, with the exception of grade 11. In 2015, the percentage of students who reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months was higher for 6th-, 7th-, and 9th-graders (3 percent each) as well as 11th-graders (4 percent) than for 12th-graders (1 percent). Also, a higher percentage of 7th-and 11thgraders reported being victimized at school than of 10thgraders (2 percent). The percentage of 8th-graders who reported being victimized at school was not measurably different from the percentages of students in the other grades. No measurable differences were observed by sex or race/ethnicity in reports of victimization overall in 2015. The SCS also includes a series of questions on student bullying. The 2015 SCS asked students ages 12-18 if they had been bullied at school during the school year.3 Students were also asked about whether bullying had a negative effect on various aspects of their life.  The percentage of students reporting being bullied at school during the school year decreased from 28 percent in 2005 to 21 percent in 2015.4 However, there was no measurable difference between the percentages in 2013 and 2015. A declining trend between 2005 and 2015 in the percentage of students who reported being bullied at school was also observed for some of the student and school characteristics examined. For example, the percentage of male students who reported being bullied at school decreased from 27 percent in 2005 to 19 percent in 2015. During the same period, the percentage of students who reported being bullied at school decreased for students in both suburban (from 29 to 21 percent) and rural areas (from 29 to 18 percent), as well as for students in public schools (from 29 to 21 percent). However, similar to the findings for students overall, there were no measurable differences between the percentages in 2013 and 2015 by any of the student and school characteristics mentioned above. In 2015, a higher percentage of female than of male students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year (23 vs. 19 percent). Higher percentages of Black students (25 percent) and White students (22 percent) than of Hispanic students (17 percent) reported being bullied at school. A higher percentage of students in grade 6 (31 percent) than of students in grades 8 through 12 reported being bullied at school, where reports of bullying ranged between 15 and 22 percent. In addition, a higher percentage of 7th-graders (25 percent) than of 11th-graders (16 percent) and 12thgraders (15 percent) reported being bullied at school. The percentage was also higher for 8th-graders (22 percent) and 10th-graders (21 percent) than for 12th-graders. No measurable differences were observed in the percentage of students who reported being bullied at school for students from urban, suburban, and rural areas, or between those in public and private schools in 2015.  In the 2015 SCS, students who reported being bullied at school during the school year were asked to indicate the extent to which bullying had a negative effect on various aspects of their life. About 19 percent of bullied students responded that bullying negatively affected how they felt about themselves either \"somewhat\" or \"a lot.\" The percentage of bullied students responding that the negative effect bullying had on their relationships with friends or family was either \"somewhat\" or \"a lot\" was the same as the percentage responding that the negative effect it had on their school work was either \"somewhat\" or \"a lot\" (14 percent). The percentage of bullied students who responded that the negative effect bullying had on their physical health was either \"somewhat\" or \"a lot\" was 9 percent.\n1 \"At school\" includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school. 2 \"Theft\" includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. 3 Students who reported being bullied are those who responded that another student had done one or more of the following: made fun of them, called them names, or insulted them; spread rumors about them; threatened them with harm; tried to make them do something they did not want to do; excluded them from activities on purpose; destroyed their property on purpose; or pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on them. 4 Prior data are excluded from the time series due to a significant redesign of the bullying items in 2005. The number of students per teacher, or the pupil/ teacher ratio,3 has generally decreased since 1955 at both public and private schools. In fall 1955, there were 1.1 million public and 145,000 private elementary and secondary school teachers in the United States. By fall 2014, these numbers had nearly tripled to 3.1 million for public school teachers and to 436,000 for private school teachers.4 However, increases in student enrollment were proportionately smaller over this period: from 30.7 million to 50.3 million public school students (a 64 percent increase) and from 4.6 million to 5.3 million private school students (a 16 percent increase). Among public schools, the pupil/teacher ratio fell from 26.9 in 1955 to 15.8 in 2004. The ratio continued to decline until 2008, when it was 15.3. In the years after 2008, however, the pupil/teacher ratio rose, reaching 16.1 in 2014. The private school pupil/teacher ratio decreased more steeply (from 31.7 to 12.2 students per teacher) between 1955 and 2014 than did the public school ratio. The pupil/teacher ratio has been lower for private schools than for public schools since 1972. The Civil Rights Data Collection reports information on years of teaching experience for all public elementary and secondary school teachers. Of the 3.1 million public school teachers in 2011-12, some 310,000 teachers, or 10 percent, had less than 2 years of teaching experience. In 42 states, between 7 and 20 percent of public school teachers had less than 2 years of teaching experience. However, in seven states (Rhode Island, Washington, Oregon, New York, Ohio, California, and Georgia), less than 7 percent of public school teachers had less than 2 years of teaching experience, and in Florida and the District of Columbia, more than 20 percent of public school teachers had less than 2 years of teaching experience. Six percent of public school teachers overall were in their first year of teaching in 2011-12, ranging from 2 percent in Pennsylvania to 19 percent in Florida. 3 The pupil/teacher ratio measures the number of students per teacher. It reflects teacher workload and the availability of teachers' services to their students. The lower the pupil/teacher ratio, the higher the availability of teacher services to students. The pupil/teacher ratio is not the same as class size, however. Class size can be described as the number of students a teacher faces during a given period of instruction. The relationship between these two measures of teacher workload is affected by a variety of factors, including the number of classes a teacher is responsible for and the number of classes taken by students. 4 Data for private schools are projected for 2014. In school year 2013-14, the percentages of public school revenues coming from state sources were highest in Vermont and Hawaii (90 and 87 percent, respectively) and lowest in South Dakota and Illinois (31 and 26 percent, respectively). The percentages of revenues coming from federal sources were highest in Louisiana and Mississippi (15 percent each) and lowest in Connecticut and New Jersey (4 percent each). Among all states, the percentages of revenues coming from local sources were highest in Illinois and New Hampshire (66 and 60 percent, respectively), and lowest in Vermont and Hawaii (4 and 2 percent, respectively). Ninety percent of the revenues for the District of Columbia were from local sources; the remaining 10 percent were from federal sources.   2013-14 NOTE: \"Instruction,\" \"Student support,\" \"Instructional staff services,\" \"Operation and maintenance,\" \"Administration,\" \"Transportation,\" and \"Food services\" are subcategories of current expenditures. \"Student support\" includes expenditures for guidance, health, attendance, and speech pathology services. \"Instructional staff services\" include expenditures for curriculum development, staff training, libraries, and media and computer centers. \"Administration\" includes both general administration and school administration. \"Transportation\" refers to student transportation.     A country's wealth (defined as GDP per capita) is positively associated with its education expenditures per FTE student at the elementary/secondary level and at the postsecondary level. Of the 15 countries with a GDP per capita greater than the OECD average, 13 countries had education expenditures per FTE student that were also higher than the OECD average at both the elementary/ secondary and postsecondary levels. These 13 countries were Switzerland, Norway, the United States, the Netherlands, Austria, Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, Finland, France, and the United Kingdom. The two exceptions were Ireland and Iceland, both of which had lower postsecondary expenditures per FTE student ($13,400 and $11,300, respectively) than the OECD average ($14,800). Of the 17 countries with a lower GDP per capita than the OECD average, 15 also had education expenditures per FTE student that were lower than the OECD average at both the elementary/secondary and postsecondary levels (Mexico, Turkey, Chile, Latvia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Slovak Republic, Portugal, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Korea, Spain, Italy, and New Zealand). The two exceptions were Japan and Israel. Both Japan and Israel reported higher postsecondary expenditures per FTE student ($17,900 and $15,200, respectively) than the OECD average ($14,800). Japan also reported higher expenditures per FTE student at the elementary/secondary level ($9,500) than the OECD average ($9,200). Among the 33 OECD countries reporting data in 2013, sixteen countries spent a higher percentage of GDP on total education expenditures than the OECD average of 5.2 percent. Six countries, including the United States, spent over 6.0 percent of GDP on total education expenditures: the United Kingdom (6.7 percent), New Zealand (6.5 percent), Denmark (6.4 percent), Norway (6.3 percent), the United States (6.2 percent), and Portugal (6.1 percent). In terms of countries' education expenditures by education level in 2013, the percentage of GDP that the United States spent on elementary and secondary education (3.5 percent) was slightly lower than the OECD average (3.7 percent). Fifteen other countries also spent a lower percentage of GDP on elementary and secondary education than the OECD average of 3.7 percent. In contrast, 17 countries spent 3.7 percent or more of GDP on elementary and secondary education, including 9 countries that spent 4.0 percent or more. The United Kingdom spent the highest percentage (4.8 percent) of GDP on elementary and secondary education. At the postsecondary level, expenditures on education as a percentage of GDP by the United States (2.6 percent) were higher than the OECD average (1.5 percent) and were higher than those of all other OECD countries reporting data. In addition to the United States, only three countries spent 2.0 percent or more of GDP on postsecondary education: Chile (2.4 percent), the Republic of Korea (2.3 percent), and Estonia (2.0 percent). In 2015, the average reading score for 4th-grade students (223) was not measurably different from the 2013 score, but it was higher than the score in 1992 (217). For 8thgrade students, the average reading score in 2015 (265) was lower than in 2013 (268), but it was higher than in 1992 (260). In 2015, the average reading score for 12th-grade students (287) was not measurably different from the score in 2013, but it was 5 points lower than in 1992 (292).\n1 High school completers are individuals ages 16 to 24 who graduated from high school or completed a GED prior to October of the calendar year. 2 The terms \"high school completers\" and \"students\" are used interchangeably throughout the indicator. 3 Due to some short-term data fluctuations associated with small sample sizes, estimates for the income groups and racial/ethnic groups were calculated based on 3-year moving averages with the following exceptions: The percentages for 2015 were calculated based on a 2-year moving average (an average of 2014 and 2015), and the 2003 percentage for Asians was based on a 2-year moving average (an average of 2003 and 2004). 4 Prior to 2003, data were collected for the combined race category of Asian/Pacific Islander. The college enrollment rate has increased since 2000. Different factors, such as changes in the labor market and the economic downturn, may have contributed to this increase.1 , 2 In this indicator, college enrollment rate is defined as the percentage of 18-to 24-year-olds (referred to as young adults in this indicator) enrolled as undergraduate and graduate students in 2-or 4-year degree-granting postsecondary institutions. The overall college enrollment rate for young adults increased from 35 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2015. During this period, the rates increased at both 4-year (from 26 to 30 percent) and 2-year (from 9 to 11 percent) institutions. Despite this general increase, over the more recent time period from 2010 to 2015 the enrollment rate at 2-year institutions declined from 13 to 11 percent, while the rate at 4-year institutions did not change measurably.  From 2000 to 2015, college enrollment rates increased for young adults who were White (from 39 to 42 percent), Black (from 31 to 35 percent), and Hispanic (from 22 to 37 percent). The rates did not measurably differ between 2000 and 2015 for young adults who were Asian and American Indian/Alaska Native. College enrollment was lower for Pacific Islander young adults in 2015 than in 2005 (24 vs. 51 percent), and showed no measurable change during this time for young adults of Two or more races.3 More recently, college enrollment rates in 2015 compared to in 2010 were higher for Hispanic young adults (37 vs. 32 percent) and lower for American Indian/ Alaska Native young adults (23 vs. 41 percent), but not measurably different for young adults who were White, Black, Asian, Pacific Islander, and of Two or more races. In 2015, the college enrollment rate was higher for Asian young adults (63 percent) than for young adults who were White (42 percent), Black (35 percent), and Hispanic (37 percent); and the rate for White young adults was higher than the rates for young adults who were Black and Hispanic. This pattern has held since 2000. The 2015 enrollment rate was also higher for Asian young adults than for young adults who were Pacific Islander (24 percent), American Indian/Alaska Native (23 percent), and of Two or more races (38 percent). In addition, the 2015 enrollment rate for White young adults was higher than the rates for Pacific Islander and American Indian/ Alaska Native young adults; and the rates for Black and Hispanic young adults were higher than the rate for American Indian/Alaska Native young adults.  Figure 3. Enrollment rates of 18-to 24-year-olds in degree-granting postsecondary institutions, by sex and race/ethnicity: 2000 and 2015 Between 2000 and 2015, college enrollment rates increased overall for both young adult males (from 33 to 38 percent) and young adult females (from 38 to 43 percent). For young adult males, enrollment rates were higher in 2015 than in 2000 for White (39 vs. 36 percent), Black (34 vs. 25 percent), and Hispanic (33 vs. 18 percent). For young adult females, rates were also higher for White (44 vs. 41 percent) and Hispanic (41 vs. 25 percent). The rate for Black young adult females in 2015 (36 percent) was not measurably different from the rate in 2000. In every year since 2000, the college enrollment rate was higher for young adult females than for young adult males; the same was true for White and Hispanic young adults. In 2015, for example, higher percentages of young adult females than males overall (43 vs. 38 percent), as well as of White (44 vs. 39 percent) and Hispanic (41 vs. 33 percent) young adults, were enrolled in college. Among Black young adults, the college enrollment rate was generally higher for females than for males, except in 2007, 2012, and 2015, when no measurable differences between female and male college enrollment rates were observed. The indicators in this chapter of The Condition of Education examine features of postsecondary education, many of which parallel those presented in the previous chapter on elementary and secondary education. The indicators describe characteristics of postsecondary students, postsecondary programs and courses of study, finance and resources, and postsecondary completions. Postsecondary education is characterized by diversity both in the types of institutions and in the characteristics of students. Postsecondary institutions vary by the types of degrees awarded, control (public or private), and whether they are operated on a nonprofit or for-profit basis. In addition, postsecondary institutions have distinctly different missions and provide students with a wide range of learning environments. \n1 Degree-granting institutions grant associate's or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. 2 Throughout this indicator, comparisons by race/ethnicity exclude nonresident alien students. \n1 The number of certificates below the associate's level conferred in 1994-95 is not available; therefore, certificates are not included in these comparisons.   The total cost of attending a postsecondary institution includes tuition and required fees, books and supplies, and the average cost for room, board, and other expenses. In academic year 2015-16, the total cost of attendance for first-time, full-time undergraduate students1 differed by institution control (public,2 private nonprofit, and private for-profit) and institution level (2-year and 4-year). In addition, the total cost of attendance varied by student living arrangement (on campus, off-campus living with family, and off-campus not living with family). The average total cost of attendance for students living on campus ranged from $14,300 at public 2-year institutions to $47,400 at private nonprofit 4-year institutions. The average total cost of attendance was higher at private nonprofit institutions than at private for-profit institutions, which was in turn higher than at public institutions. At every institutional control category and level, the average total cost of attendance was lowest for students living with family. For example, for students at public 2-year institutions living with family, the average total cost of attendance was $8,800, compared with $14,300 for students living on campus and $16,900 for students living off campus but not with family. Average undergraduate tuition and fees (in constant 2015-16 dollars) for first-time, full-time undergraduate students attending 4-year degree-granting postsecondary institutions were higher in 2015-16 than in 2012-13 at both public and private nonprofit institutions. In 2015-16, public 4-year institutions reported average tuition and fees of $8,700-a 6 percent increase over the 2012-13 amount ($8,200). Among 4-year institutions, private nonprofit institutions had the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees (8 percent, from $29,900 to $32,400) during this period. At private for-profit 4-year institutions, however, tuition and fees were 6 percent lower in 2015-16 ($15,700) than in 2012-13 ($16,800). Similar to public 4-year institutions, public 2-year institutions reported an increase in average undergraduate tuition and fees in 2015-16 over the 2012-13 amount (7 percent, from $3,200 to $3,400). At private nonprofit 2-year institutions, tuition and fees were 11 percent higher in 2015-16 ($16,400) than in 2012-13 ($14,800). In contrast, tuition and fees at private for-profit 2-year institutions in 2015-16 were 2 percent lower than in 2012-13 ($14,600 vs. $14,900). Many students and their families pay less than the full price of attendance because they receive financial aid to help cover expenses. The primary types of financial aid are grant and scholarship aid, which do not have to be repaid, and loans, which must be repaid. Grant and scholarship aid may be awarded on the basis of financial need, merit, or both, and may include tuition aid from employers. In 2014-15, the average amount of grant and scholarship aid for first-time, full-time undergraduate students who received Title IV aid3 (in constant 2015-16 dollars) was higher for students at private nonprofit institutions than for those at public and private for-profit institutions. Students at private nonprofit 4-year institutions received an average of $20,100 in grant and scholarship aid, compared with $7,100 at public and $5,200 at private forprofit 4-year institutions. The net price of attendance is the estimate of the actual amount of money that students and their families need to pay in a given year to cover educational expenses. Net price is calculated here as the total cost of attendance minus grant and scholarship aid. Net price provides an indication of what the actual financial burden is upon students and their families. In 2014-15, among 4-year institutions, the average net price of attendance for first-time, full-time undergraduate students who received Title IV aid (in constant 2015-16 dollars) was lower for students at public institutions ($13,200) than for those at both private nonprofit ($25,400) and private for-profit ($21,500) institutions. Similarly, the average net price at 2-year institutions in 2014-15 was lowest at public institutions ($7,100) and highest at private nonprofit and private for-profit institutions ($20,500 and $20,700 respectively).  Figure 3. Average total cost, net price, and grant and scholarship aid for first-time, full-time undergraduate students paying in-state tuition and receiving aid at public 4-year institutions, by family income level: Academic year 2014-15 The average amount of grant and scholarship aid received and the net price paid (in constant 2015-16 dollars) differed by students' family income level. In general, the lower the income, the greater the average amount of grant and scholarship aid received. For example, at public 4-year institutions, the average amount of grant and scholarship aid received by first-time, full-time undergraduate students paying in-state tuition in 2014-15 was highest for those with family incomes of $30,000 or less ($10,300 in aid) and lowest for those with family incomes of $110,001 or more ($2,000 in aid). Accordingly, the lowest average net price ($9,400) was for students with family incomes of $30,000 or less, and the highest average net price ($20,900) was for those with family incomes of $110,001 or more. The pattern of average net price increasing with family income was also observed at private nonprofit 4-year institutions. However, in 2014-15 the average amount of grant and scholarship aid received (in constant 2015-16 dollars) followed a different pattern. It was highest for students with family incomes between $30,001 and $48,000 ($23,700 in aid), followed by those with family incomes between $48,001 and $75,000 ($22,400 in aid), those with family incomes of $30,000 or less ($21,100 in aid), those with family incomes between $75,001 and $110,000 ($19,900 in aid), and those with family incomes of $110,001 or more ($16,300 in aid).\n1 Includes only students who are seeking a degree or certificate. 2 All data for public institutions only include students who paid the in-state or in-district tuition and fees. 3 Title IV aid includes grant aid, work-study aid, and loan aid. All net price and grant and scholarship aid data only include students who received Title IV aid.   Between academic years 2009-10 and 2014-15, average undergraduate tuition and fees for full-time students across all degree-granting postsecondary institutions increased by 15 percent, from $10,000 to $11,600.1 Among 4-year institutions, the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees between 2009-10 and 2014-15 was at public institutions (16 percent, from $7,400 to $8,600); however, the largest dollar amount increase was at private nonprofit institutions (a $2,900 increase, from $28,100 to $31,000). By contrast, tuition and fees at private forprofit 4-year institutions decreased by 7 percent between 2009-10 and 2014-15 (from $15,100 to $14,000). As at 4-year institutions, the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees among 2-year institutions during this period was at public institutions (19 percent, from $2,500 to $3,000). Tuition and fees at private nonprofit 2-year institutions were 4 percent higher in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 ($14,400 versus $13,900). By contrast, tuition and fees at private for-profit 2-year institutions were 14 percent lower in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 ($14,300 versus $16,600).    Figure 3. Average annual loan amounts for first-time, full-time students awarded loan aid at degree-granting postsecondary institutions, by control and level of institution: 2009-10 through 2014-15 Overall, the average loan amount that undergraduate students were awarded in 2014-15 was 10 percent lower than in 2009-10. Average annual student loan amounts for first-time, full-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students awarded loan aid were $7,700 in 2009-10 and $7,000 in 2014-15.1 At public 4-year institutions, average loan amounts were 1 percent higher in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 (the amounts for both years round to $6,700). At private nonprofit 2-year institutions, average loan amounts were 3 percent higher in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 ($6,900 compared to $6,700). The largest percentage decrease in loan amount between 2009-10 and 2014-15 was at private for-profit 4-year institutions (22 percent, from $10,600 to $8,300). The average annual loan amount was 13 percent lower at private for-profit 2-year institutions in 2014-15 ($7,700) than it was in 2009-10 ($8,800), 9 percent lower at public 2-year institutions ($4,600 compared with $5,100), and 2 percent lower at private nonprofit 4-year institutions ($8,100 compared with $8,200). Among all types of institutions, students at private for-profit 4-year institutions had the largest average annual student loan amount in 2014-15 ($8,300). For undergraduate students ages 18 to 24 in their 4th year of college or above, the average cumulative amount borrowed in 2011-12 was $26,600.1 , 3 This amount varied by control and level of institution. Students at private forprofit 2-year and above institutions borrowed the most, with an average cumulative loan amount of $40,800. Students at public 4-year nondoctoral institutions borrowed the least, with an average cumulative loan amount of $21,900. Students at public 4-year doctoral institutions borrowed an average cumulative loan amount of $24,300, students at private nonprofit 4-year doctoral institutions borrowed $31,800, and students at private nonprofit 4-year nondoctoral institutions borrowed $32,900.\n1 Dollar amounts are expressed in constant 2015-16 dollars. 2 Data in 2009-10 are for students receiving aid, while later data are for students awarded aid. Students receiving aid are those who were not only awarded aid, but also accepted it. \n1 For academic year 2009-10, the percentage of students with financial aid represents students who received aid, rather than students who were awarded aid, as some students who were awarded aid did not receive it. After academic year 2009-10, institutions began reporting the percentage of students who were awarded aid. The primary sources of revenue for degree-granting institutions were tuition and fees; investments; and government grants, contracts, and appropriations. The percentages from these revenue sources varied by institutional control (i.e., public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit). In 2014-15, public institutions received 44 percent of overall revenues from government sources (which include federal, state, and local government1 grants, contracts, and appropriations). In 2014-15, student tuition and fees constituted the largest percentage of total revenues at private nonprofit institutions and private forprofit institutions (35 and 90 percent, respectively). It is important to note that public and private institutions report financial information according to the accounting standards that govern institution types. Pell Grants are included in federal grant revenues at public institutions but tend to be included in tuition and fees and auxiliary enterprise revenues at private nonprofit and private forprofit institutions. Thus, some categories of revenue data are not directly comparable across public, nonprofit, and for-profit institutions. Between 2009-10 and 2014-15, the percentage change in revenues from tuition and fees per full-time-equivalent (FTE) student varied by institutional control. Revenues per FTE student are presented in constant 2015-16 dollars, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). During this period, both public and private nonprofit institutions received higher tuition and fee revenues per FTE student. The largest increase in revenues from tuition and fees per FTE student was at public institutions, where they increased by 22 percent (from $5,724 to $6,963), more than three times the percentage increase at private nonprofit institutions (6 percent, from $19,586 to $20,820). Although revenues from tuition and fees remained the primary revenue source at private for-profit institutions, revenues from tuition and fees per FTE student were 9 percent lower in 2014-15 ($15,089) than in 2009-10 ($16,531).  Total revenues per FTE student from federal, state, and local government sources combined were lower in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 across all institutional control categories. The largest percentage decrease was at private for-profit institutions, where revenues per FTE student from combined government sources decreased by 42 percent (from $1,330 in 2009-10 to $769 in 2014-15). Revenues per FTE student from government sources were 2 percent lower in 2014-15 ($14,338) than in 2009-10 ($14,683) at public institutions and 11 percent lower in 2014-15 ($7,734) than in 2009-10 ($8,721) at private nonprofit institutions. Revenues per FTE student from federal government sources alone also decreased between 2009-10 and 2014-15 across all institutional control categories. The largest percentage decrease was at private for-profit institutions, where federal revenues per FTE student fell by 43 percent, roughly 5 times the percentage decrease in federal revenues per FTE student at public institutions (8 percent) and roughly 4 times the percentage decrease at private nonprofit institutions (10 percent). The percentage change in state and local government revenues per FTE student also varied by institutional control. Revenues per FTE student from these sources were 1 percent higher in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 at public institutions but 24 percent lower in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 at private nonprofit institutions. At private for-profit institutions, revenues from state and local government sources were 35 percent lower in 2014-15 than in 2009-10 but accounted for only a small percentage (less than one-half of 1 percent) of total revenues at institutions of this category of control. The percentage of revenues from investment returns, or investment income, was higher at private nonprofit institutions than at public or private for-profit institutions. In 2014-15, revenues from these investments accounted for 11 percent of total revenues at private nonprofit institutions but accounted for less than one-half of 1 percent of total revenues at public institutions as well as at private for-profit institutions. "}, {"section_title": "Married-couple household", "text": "Mother-only household Father-only household 1 Total includes races/ethnicities not reported separately. NOTE: Data does not include foster children, children in unrelated subfamilies, children living in group quarters, and children who were reported as the householder or spouse of the householder. A \"mother-only household\" has a female householder, with no spouse present (i.e., the householder is unmarried or their spouse is not in the household), while a \"father-only household\" has a male householder, with no spouse present. Includes all children who live either with their parent(s) or with a householder to whom they are related by birth, marriage, or adoption (except a child who is the spouse of the householder). Children are classified by their parents' marital status or, if no parents are present in the household, by the marital status of the householder who is related to the children. The householder is the person (or one of the people) who owns or rents (maintains) the housing unit.   In 2015, the overall poverty rate for Hispanic children under age 18 (30 percent) was higher than the national average of 20 percent. However, there was a range of rates among Hispanic subgroups, with some rates being lower or higher than the national average. For example, the poverty rates for Chilean children (9 percent) as well as Panamanian and Spaniard children (12 percent each) were lower than the national average, while the rates for Guatemalan children (37 percent) and Dominican children (36 percent) were higher than the national average. The overall poverty rate for Asian children under age 18 in 2015 (11 percent) was lower than the national average, but there was a range of rates among Asian subgroups, with some rates being lower or higher than the national average. For example, the poverty rates for Asian Indian (5 percent), Filipino (6 percent), and Japanese children (6 percent) were lower than the national average, while the rates for Burmese (51 percent) and Hmong children (38 percent) were higher than the national average. For additional information about racial/ethnic subgroups, please refer to the Status and Trends in the Education of Racial and Ethnic Groups report.   In 2015, the poverty rate for children under age 18 was highest for those whose parents had not completed high school (52 percent) and lowest for those whose parents had attained a bachelor's or higher degree (4 percent). The pattern of higher poverty rates for children whose parents had lower levels of educational attainment was observed across most racial/ethnic groups. For example, the poverty rate among Asian children was highest for those whose parents had not completed high school (43 percent) and lowest for those whose parents had attained a bachelor's degree or higher (5 percent). The  For children under age 18 in 2015, those living in a mother-only household had the highest poverty rate (43 percent) and those living in a father-only household had the next-highest rate (27 percent). Children living in a married-couple household had the lowest poverty rate, at 10 percent. This pattern of children living in marriedcouple households having the lowest rate of poverty was observed across most racial/ethnic groups. For example, among Black children the poverty rates were 50 percent for those living in a mother-only household, 38 percent for those living in a father-only household, and 13 percent for those living in a married-couple household. The exception is that the apparent difference between the poverty rates for Pacific Islander children in a married-couple household and those in a father-only household was not statistically significant. While the national average poverty rate for children under age 18 was 20 percent in 2015, the poverty rates among states ranged from 10 percent in New Hampshire to 31 percent in Mississippi. Twenty-three states had poverty rates for children that were lower than the national average, 15 states and the District of Columbia had rates that were higher than the national average, and 12 states had rates that were not measurably different from the national average. Of the 16 jurisdictions (15 states and the District of Columbia) that had poverty rates higher than the national average, the majority (13) were located in the South. In 10 states, the poverty rates were lower in 2015 than in 2010. In the remaining 40 states and the District of Columbia, there was no measurable difference between the poverty rates in 2010 and 2015.   In the years between 2010 and 2015,5 it was more common for older children than for younger children to use the Internet from home. In 2015, the percentage of all children using the Internet from home was highest among 15-to 18-year-olds (76 percent), followed by 11-to 14-year-olds (65 percent), 5-to 10-year-olds (54 percent), and 3-and 4-year-olds (39 percent In the years between 2010 and 2015,5 the percentage of children ages 3 to 18 using the Internet from home was higher for children who were White, Asian, and of Two or more races than for those who were Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native. In 2015, higher percentages of children who were White (66 percent), of Two or more races (64 percent), and Asian (63 percent) used the Internet from home than did Black (53 percent), Hispanic (52 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native children (49 percent In general, the percentage of children ages 3 to 18 using the Internet from home was higher for children whose parents had attained higher levels of education. For instance, 71 percent of children whose parents had attained a bachelor's or higher degree used the Internet from home in 2015, compared with 42 percent of children whose parents had not completed high school and 52 percent of children whose parents had completed high school only. The percentage of children using the Internet from home was higher in 2015 than in 2010 for children whose parents had not completed high school (42 vs. 29 percent) and those who had completed high school only (52 vs. 47 percent), but was not measurably different for those whose parents had at least some college education. Consequently, from 2010 to 2015, the gap in home internet use between children whose parents had attained a bachelor's or higher degree and children whose parents had not completed high school narrowed from 42 to 28 percentage points, and the gap between children whose parents had a bachelor's or higher degree and children whose parents had completed high school narrowed from 24 to 19 percentage points. The percentage of children ages 3 to 18 using the Internet from home was also generally higher for children with higher family income. In 2015, about 72 percent of children with a family income of $100,000 or more and 70 percent of children with a family income between $75,000 and $99,999 used the Internet from home, compared with 39 percent of children with a family income of less than $10,000 and 40 percent of children with a family income between $10,000 and $19,999. The percentage of children using the Internet from home was higher in 2015 than in 2010 for children with a family income of less than $10,000 (39 vs. 26 percent), but it was lower in 2015 than in 2010 for children with a family income of $100,000 or more (72 vs. 77 percent). As a result, the home internet use gap between children in these two groups narrowed from 51 percentage points in 2010 to 33 percentage points in 2015.    Among children ages 3 to 18 who used the Internet anywhere, there were differences in children's internet access at home across various child and family characteristics. For instance, among children who used the Internet anywhere in 2015, the percentage using it at home was higher for children who were Asian (91 percent), White (89 percent), and of Two or more races (87 percent) than for those who were Hispanic (81 percent), Black (80 percent), and American Indian/ Alaska Native (74 percent). The percentage of children who used the Internet at home was also generally higher for older children, children whose parents had higher levels of educational attainment, and children with higher family incomes. Compared to children's internet use at home, fewer differences by child and family characteristics were observed for children's internet use at school. In 2015, among children ages to 18 who used the Internet anywhere, a higher percentage of American Indian/ Alaska Native children (75 percent) used it at school than did children who were White (65 percent), Hispanic (64 percent), of Two or more races (64 percent), and Asian (61 percent); additionally, the percentage for White children was higher than for Asian children. There was no measurable difference in internet use at school among children who were White, Black, Hispanic, and of Two or more races. The percentage of children who used the Internet at school was generally higher for older children than for younger children. The only exception was that a higher percentage of children ages 11 to 14 than children ages 15 to 18 (72 vs. 69 percent) used the Internet at school. There were no measurable differences in the percentages of children using the Internet at school by family income or by highest level of education attained by either parent. Children's internet use at libraries, community centers, or other public places6 also varied by child and family characteristics. For instance, among children ages 3 to 18 who used the Internet anywhere in 2015, the percentage using it at a library, community center, or other public place was higher for children who were Pacific Islander (46 percent), Black (34 percent), of Two or more races (34 percent), Asian (32 percent), and Hispanic (29 percent) than for White children (23 percent); additionally, it was higher for Black children than for Hispanic children and higher for Pacific Islander children than for American Indian/Alaska Native children (25 percent). Furthermore, the percentage of children ages 3 to 18 who used the Internet at a library, community center, or other public place was lower for children whose parents had completed high school only (24 percent) than for those whose parents had not completed high school (30 percent), had some college education (28 percent), and had attained a bachelor's or higher degree (27 percent). The percentage of children who used the Internet at a library, community center, or other public place was higher for children with family incomes of less than $20,000 than for children with family incomes of $40,000 or higher. For example, among children who used the Internet anywhere, 32 percent of children with a family income of less than $10,000 and 33 percent of children with a family income between $10,000 and $19,999 used the Internet at a library, community center, or other public place, while 25 percent of children with a family income between $75,000 and $99,999 and 26 percent of children with a family income of $100,000 or more did so. 4 Data for 2015 were collected in the July supplement to the CPS, while data for 2010 were collected in the October supplement. Measurable differences in estimates across years could reflect actual changes in the population; however, differences could also reflect seasonal variations in data collection or differences between the content of the July and October supplements. Therefore, caution should be used when making year-to-year comparisons. The indicators in this chapter of The Condition of Education describe enrollment trends across all levels of education. Enrollment is a key indicator of the scope of and access to educational opportunities and functions as a basic descriptor of American education. Changes in enrollment may impact the demand for educational resources such as qualified teachers, physical facilities, and funding levels, all of which are required to provide high-quality education for our nation's students. The indicators in this chapter include information on enrollment rates by age group as well as by level of the education system, namely, preprimary, elementary and secondary, undergraduate, and graduate and professional education. Some of the indicators in this chapter provide information about the characteristics of the students who are enrolled in formal education and, in some cases, how enrollment rates of different types of students vary across schools.   The percentages of 3-year-olds, 4-year-olds, and 5-yearolds enrolled in preprimary programs fluctuated between 2000 and 2015. In 2015, some 38 percent of 3-year-olds, 67 percent of 4-year-olds, and 87 percent of 5-year-olds were enrolled in preprimary programs, which were not measurably different from the percentages enrolled in 2000 (39 percent, 65 percent, and 88 percent, respectively). In 2015, the percentage of children enrolled in preprimary programs remained higher for 5-year-olds than for 4-year-olds, and higher for 4-year-olds than for 3-year-olds.   Among 3-to 5-year-olds who were enrolled in preschool programs in 2015, some 51 percent attended full-day programs. The percentage of 3-to 5-year-old preschool students attending full-day programs in 2015 was not measurably different from the percentage attending full-day programs in 2000. Among 3-to 5-year-olds attending kindergarten, the percentage attending full-day programs increased from 60 percent in 2000 to 81 percent in 2015. In every year from 2000 to 2015, the percentage of 3-to 5-year-old kindergarten students enrolled in full-day programs was greater than the percentage of 3-to 5-year-old preschool students enrolled in full-day programs.  In 2015, most 3-and 4-year-old children who were enrolled in preprimary programs attended preschool programs, while most 5-year-old children who were enrolled in preprimary programs attended kindergarten. A higher percentage of 4-year-olds (60 percent) than of 3-year-olds (36 percent) attended preschool.  In 2015, a lower percentage of Hispanic 3-to 5-year-olds (30 percent) were enrolled in preschool programs than of 3-to 5-year olds who were White (40 percent), Black (39 percent), Asian (40 percent), American Indian/ Alaska Native (48 percent), and of Two or more races (42 percent). There were no measurable differences in enrollment among children who were White, Black, Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and of Two or more races. In terms of attendance status, a higher percentage of Black children attended full-day than part-day preschool programs (27 vs. 11 percent). In contrast, a lower percentage of Hispanic children attended full-day than part-day preschool programs (13 vs. 17 percent). For children in the other racial/ethnic groups, there were no measurable differences in the percentages enrolled in full-day compared to part-day programs. Enrollment in full-day preschool programs was higher for Black children (27 percent) than for White (19 percent), Hispanic (13 percent), and Asian (20 percent) children. The percentage of 3-to 5-year-olds enrolled in full-day preschool programs was also higher for children who were White, Asian, and of Two or more races (22 percent) than for Hispanic children. The corresponding percentage for Pacific Islander 3-to 5-year-olds was not measurably different from that of any other racial/ethnic group.  Enrollment in preschool programs varied by parents' highest level of education, defined as the highest level of education attained by the most educated parent in the child's household. In 2015, the overall percentage of 3-to 5-year-olds enrolled in preschool programs was higher for those children whose parents had a graduate or professional degree (48 percent) than for those whose parents had a bachelor's degree (42 percent), an associate's degree (37 percent), some college (37 percent), a high school credential (29 percent), and less than a high school credential (29 percent). The overall preschool enrollment percentage was also higher for those children whose parents had a bachelor's degree, an associate's degree, and some college than for those whose parents had a high school credential and less than a high school credential. The percentage of 3-to 5-year-olds enrolled in part-day and full-day preschool programs also varied by parents' highest level of education. In 2015, for full-day preschool enrollment, the percentages were higher for those children whose parents had a graduate or professional degree (22 percent) and a bachelor's degree (21 percent) than for those children whose parents had a high school credential (16 percent) and less than a high school credential (14 percent). Among children whose parents' highest level of education was a high school credential, a greater percentage were enrolled in full-day than in part-day preschool programs (16 vs. 12 percent). There was no measurable difference between the percentages of children enrolled in full-day and part-day programs for children whose parents had other levels of educational attainment (graduate's degree or professional degree, bachelor's degree, associate's degree, some college, and less than a high school credential).  NOTE: Enrollment rates should be interpreted with care. For each country, this figure shows the number of persons who are enrolled in that country as a percentage of that country's total population in the 3-and 4-year-old age group. However, some of a country's population may be enrolled in a different country, and some persons enrolled in the country may be residents of a different country. \"OECD average\" refers to the mean of the data values for all reporting Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, to which each country reporting data contributes equally. In 2014, some 55 percent of 3-and 4-year-olds in the United States were enrolled in school, compared to the average enrollment of 79 percent for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The OECD is an organization of 35 countries whose purpose is to promote trade and economic growth. The OECD also serves as a statistical agency, collecting and publishing an array of data on its member countries. Among the 31 OECD countries reporting data that year, the percentage of 3-and 4-year-olds enrolled in school ranged from 20 percent in Turkey to 100 percent in France.  Shifts in the overall enrollment rates in schools of any type varied by age group. From October 2000 to October 2015, the enrollment rate for students ages 5-6, who are typically enrolled in kindergarten or grade 1, decreased from 96 to 94 percent, and the enrollment rate for students ages 7-13 decreased by less than 1 percentage point to 98 percent. However, during this period the enrollment rate increased for students ages 18-19 in secondary education (from 16 to 20 percent) and did not change measurably for students ages 3-4, 14-15, and 16-17.  Between fall 2000 and fall 2014, total enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools (prekindergarten [preK] through grade 12) increased by 7 percent, reaching 50.3 million students. Of the 50.3 million students enrolled in fall 2014, some 70 percent were enrolled in preK through grade 8, and the remaining 30 percent were enrolled in grades 9 through 12. Enrollment in preK through grade 8 increased by 5 percent from fall 2000 to fall 2014, reaching 35.4 million students. While enrollment in grades 9 through 12 increased by 12 percent between fall 2000 and fall 2007 to 15.1 million students, enrollment in fall 2014 (14.9 million) was 1 percent lower than in fall 2007. Total public school enrollment is projected to continue increasing through fall 2026 (the last year for which projected data are available). From fall 2014 to fall 2026, total public school enrollment is projected to increase by 3 percent to 51.7 million students. During this period, public school enrollment in preK through grade 8 is projected to increase by 3 percent to 36.4 million students in fall 2026. Meanwhile, enrollment in grades 9 through 12 is projected to increase by 5 percent to 15.6 million between fall 2014 and fall 2022, and then decline by 2 percent to 15.4 million in fall 2026. Changes in public elementary and secondary school enrollment varied by state. From fall 2000 to fall 2014, total public school enrollment in preK through grade 12 increased in 32 states and the District of Columbia, with increases of 15 percent or more occurring in the District of Columbia and nine states (Delaware, Idaho, North Carolina, Georgia, Colorado, Arizona, Texas, Utah, and Nevada). Enrollment declined during this period in the other 18 states, with decreases of 10 percent or more occurring in four states (Michigan, New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont).   Between fall 2014 and fall 2026, changes in total public school enrollment are projected to differ by state in preK through grade 8 as well as in grades 9 through 12. During this period, the District of Columbia is projected to have the largest increase (42 percent) in total enrollment, while the state with the largest projected increase is North Dakota (28 percent). The states that are projected to have the largest decreases in total public school enrollment are Connecticut and New Hampshire (14 percent each). Reflecting the projected total public school enrollment increase between fall 2014 and fall 2026, some 30 states and the District of Columbia are projected to have enrollment increases in both preK through grade 8 and in grades 9 through 12. However, in 18 other states, enrollment is projected to decrease in both grade ranges. New Mexico is projected to have an increase in enrollment in preK through grade 8, but a decrease in enrollment in grades 9 through 12; New York is projected to have a decrease in enrollment in preK through grade 8, but an increase in enrollment in grades 9 through 12. In preK through grade 8, enrollment is projected to increase by 15 percent or more in the District of Columbia and three states (North Dakota, Utah, and Arizona), but is projected to decrease by 10 percent or more in three states (Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine). During the same time period, enrollment in grades 9 through 12 is projected to increase by 15 percent or more in the District of Columbia and five states (North Dakota, Utah, Nevada, Texas, and Wyoming), but is projected to decrease by 10 percent or more in five states (New Hampshire, Connecticut, Michigan, Maine, and Vermont). "}, {"section_title": "Public Charter School Enrollment", "text": "Between fall 2004 and fall 2014, overall public charter school enrollment increased from 0.9 million to 2.7 million. During this period, the percentage of public school students who attended charter schools increased from 2 to 5 percent. A public charter school is a publicly funded school that is typically governed by a group or organization under a legislative contract (or charter) with the state, district, or other entity. The charter exempts the school from certain state or local rules and regulations. In return for flexibility and autonomy, the charter school must meet the accountability standards outlined in its charter. A school's charter is reviewed periodically by the entity that granted it and can be revoked if guidelines on curriculum and management are not followed or if the accountability standards are not met.1  Between school years 2004-05 and 2014-15, the percentage of all public schools that were charter schools increased from 4 to 7 percent, and the total number of charter schools increased from 3,400 to 6,750. In addition to increasing in number, public charter schools have also generally increased in enrollment size over the last decade. From fall 2004 to fall 2014, the percentages of public charter schools with 300-499, 500-999, and 1,000 or more students each increased, while the percentage of charter schools with fewer than 300 students decreased. The percentage of public school students who attended public charter schools increased from 2 to 5 percent between fall 2004 and fall 2014. The number of students enrolled in public charter schools increased by 1.8 million students (from 0.9 million to 2.7 million), while the number of students attending traditional public schools decreased by 0.4 million (see indicator Elementary and Secondary Enrollment). In each school year during that period, larger numbers of public charter school students were enrolled in elementary schools than in any of the other types of charter schools: secondary, combined, and other types that were not classified by grade span. Between fall 2004 and fall 2014, public charter schools experienced changes in their demographic composition similar to those seen in public schools overall (see indicator Racial/Ethnic Enrollment in Public Schools). The percentage of public charter school students who were Hispanic increased (from 22 to 31 percent), as did the percentage who were Asian/Pacific Islander (from 3 to 4 percent). In contrast, the percentage of public charter school students who were White decreased from 42 to 34 percent. The percentages decreased for Black (from 31 to 27 percent) and American Indian/Alaska Native (from 2 to 1 percent) public charter school students as well. Beginning in fall 2009, data were collected on students of Two or more races attending public charter schools. Students of Two or more races accounted for 3 percent of public charter school students in fall 2014, compared to 1 percent in fall 2009. In fall 2014, the percentage of students attending highpoverty schools-schools in which more than 75 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) under the National School Lunch Program-was higher for public charter school students (35 percent) than for traditional public school students (24 percent). In the same year, 21 percent of public charter school students and 20 percent of traditional public school students attended low-poverty schools-those in which 25 percent or less of students qualify for FRPL. "}, {"section_title": "Private School Enrollment", "text": "Private school enrollment in prekindergarten (preK) through grade 12 increased from 5.9 million students in 1995-96 to 6.3 million in 2001-02, and then declined to 5.4 million in 2013-14. In school year 2013-14, some 5.4 million students (or 10 percent of all elementary and secondary students) were enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools.1 The percentage of all elementary and secondary students enrolled in private schools decreased from 12 percent in 1995-96 to 10 percent in 2013-14, and is projected to continue to decrease to 9 percent in 2025-26 (the last year for which projected data are available).    In 2013-14, the percentage of private elementary2 students enrolled in Catholic schools was 47 percent, which was higher than the percentage of students enrolled in nonsectarian (22 percent), unaffiliated religious (14 percent), affiliated religious (10 percent), and conservative Christian (6 percent) schools. Similarly, a higher percentage of private secondary3 students were enrolled in Catholic schools (71 percent) than in any other school orientation. In contrast to the large percentages of private school students enrolled in Catholic elementary and secondary schools, Catholic students made up a smaller percentage (10 percent) of private school students enrolled in combined4 elementary/secondary schools.   There were also differences in private school enrollment by school orientation within racial/ethnic groups. Among Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian/Alaska Native students as well as students of Two or more races, higher percentages of private school students were enrolled in Catholic schools than other religious schools in 2013-14. For example, 57 percent of Hispanic private school students were enrolled in Catholic schools, while 26 percent were enrolled in other religious schools. In contrast, lower percentages of Black (36 percent) and Pacific Islander (39 percent) private school students were enrolled in Catholic schools in 2013-14 than in other religious schools (40 and 44 percent, respectively). In addition, for all racial/ethnic groups other than Asian, higher percentages of private school students were enrolled in Catholic schools than nonsectarian schools.   In fall 2014, the percentage of students enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools who were White was less than 50 percent (49.5 percent) for the first time since these data were reported1 and represents a decrease from 58 percent in fall 2004. The number of White students decreased from 28.3 million in 2004 to 24.9 million in 2014. In contrast, the number of Hispanic students during this period increased from 9.3 million to 12.8 million, and the percentage of students who were Hispanic increased from 19 to 25 percent. Additionally, the number of Asian/Pacific Islander students increased from 2.2 million in fall 2004 to 2.6 million in fall 2014, and the percentage of students who were Asian/Pacific Islander increased from 4 to 5 percent. From fall 2004 to fall 2014, the number of Black students decreased from 8.4 million to 7.8 million, and the percentage of students who were Black decreased from 17 to 16 percent. The number of American Indian/Alaska Native students from fall 2004 to fall 2014 decreased from 0.6 million to 0.5 million, and the percentage of students who were American Indian/ Alaska Native remained around 1 percent. In 2014, the number of students who were Two or more races was 1.6 million and the percentage of students was 3 percent.2 The number of White students enrolled in public schools is projected to continue decreasing between fall 2014 and fall 2026 (from 24.9 million to 23.4 million). In 2026, White students are expected to account for 45 percent of total enrollment as the enrollments of Hispanic students and Asian/Pacific Islander students continue to increase. The number of Hispanic students is projected to increase from 12.8 million in 2014 to 14.9 million in 2026 and to account for 29 percent of total enrollment in 2026. The number of Asian/Pacific Islander students is projected to increase from 2.6 million to 3.1 million between 2014 and 2026 and to account for 6 percent of total enrollment in 2026. The number of Black students is projected to increase from 7.8 million to 7.9 million during this period, and to account for 15 percent of total enrollment in 2026. Additionally, the number of American Indian/Alaska Native students is projected to remain around 0.5 million and to account for 1 percent of total enrollment in 2026. The number of students who were Two or more races is projected to increase from 1.6 million to 1.9 million and to account for 4 percent of total enrollment in 2026. Changes in the racial/ethnic distribution of public school enrollment between 2004 and 2014 differed by state.3 In the 49 states for which data were available, the percentage of students enrolled who were White was lower in 2014 than in 2004, with the decrease ranging from 14 percentage points in Washington to 2 percentage points in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. However, in the District of Columbia the percentage of public school students who were White increased by 5 percentage points over the same period. Across the 49 reporting states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of students who were Hispanic was higher in 2014 than in 2004; the increase was largest in Washington (9 percentage points) and smallest in Vermont and West Virginia (less than 1 percentage point each). The percentage of public school students who were Black was higher in 2014 than in 2004 in 12 states; all increases were 2 percentage points or less. In the remaining 37 states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of public school students who were Black was lower in 2014 than in 2004; the largest decrease occurred in the District of Columbia (13 percentage points).  The extent to which minority students attend public schools with nonminority students has changed over time. In fall 2014, public schools where minority students4 comprised at least 75 percent of the student population enrolled 30 percent of all public school students, compared with 24 percent in fall 2004. The percentage of students enrolled in these schools increased from 2004 to 2014 across all racial/ethnic groups.5 The percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students in such schools increased by 7 percentage points, from 30 percent in 2004 to 37 percent in 2014. Increases in enrollments in these schools for the remaining racial/ethnic groups ranged from 2 to 5 percentage points.   As noted above, in fall 2014 approximately 30 percent of public elementary and secondary students attended public schools in which the combined enrollment of minority students was at least 75 percent of total enrollment. Over half of Hispanic (60 percent), Black (57 percent), and Pacific Islander students (53 percent) attended such schools. In contrast, less than half of Asian students (38 percent), American Indian/Alaska Native students (37 percent), students of Two or more races (19 percent), and White students (5 percent) attended this type of school.  Examining the enrollment data for individual racial/ ethnic groups can yield more detailed insights on school enrollment patterns. These data show the extent to which students attend public schools with peers of the same racial/ethnic group. In fall 2014, some 52 percent of White students were enrolled in public schools that were predominantly composed of students of their own race (i.e., 75 percent or more of enrollment was White). Lower percentages of students who were of Two or more races (less than 1 percent), Asian (3 percent), Pacific Islander (3 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native (17 percent) were enrolled in public schools that were predominantly composed of students of their own racial/ ethnic group. Instead, more than half of students of these races were enrolled in public schools in which less than a quarter of the students were of their own race, while 5 percent of White students were enrolled in such schools. About 27 percent of Black students were enrolled in public schools that were predominantly Black, while 31 percent of Black students were enrolled in schools in which less than a quarter of the students were Black. Similarly, 33 percent of Hispanic students were enrolled in public schools that were predominantly Hispanic, while 21 percent were enrolled in schools in which less than a quarter of the students were Hispanic. "}, {"section_title": "The Condition of Education 2017 | 157", "text": "Chapter: 3/ In 2015, the percentage of 4th-grade students performing at or above the Basic achievement level (69 percent) was not measurably different from the percentage in 2013, but it was higher than the percentage in 1992 (62 percent). In addition, the percentage of 4th-grade students performing at or above the Proficient achievement level in 2015 (36 percent) was not measurably different from the percentage in 2013, but it was higher than the percentage in 1992 (29 percent). Among 8th-grade students, the percentage performing at or above Basic in 2015 (76 percent) was lower than in 2013 (78 percent). However, the percentage was higher in 2015 than in 1992 (69 percent). Similarly, a lower percentage of 8thgrade students performed at or above Proficient in 2015 (34 percent) than in 2013 (36 percent), but the percentage in 2015 was higher than in 1992 (29 percent). Among 12th-grade students, the percentage performing at or above Basic in 2015 (72 percent) was lower than the percentage in 2013 (75 percent) and 1992 (80 percent). The percentage of 12th-graders performing at or above Proficient in 2015 (37 percent) was not measurably different from the percentage in 2013, but it was lower than the percentage in 1992 (40 percent). At grade 4, the average 2015 reading scores for White (232), Black (206), Hispanic (208), and Asian/Pacific Islander students (239) were not measurably different from the corresponding scores in 2013, but their average scores were all higher in 2015 than in 1992. At grade 8, average 2015 reading scores for White (274), Black (248), and Hispanic (253) students were lower than the scores in 2013 (276, 250, and 256, respectively), while the average 2015 reading score for Asian/Pacific Islander (280) students was not measurably different from the score in 2013. Consistent with the findings at grade 4, the average reading scores for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian/ Pacific Islander 8th-grade students were higher in 2015 than in 1992. In 2015, the average scores for American Indian/Alaska Native 4th-graders (205) and 8th-graders (252) were not measurably different from the scores in 2013 and 1994, the first year that data were available for American Indian/Alaska Native students at both grades. Starting in 2011, separate data for Asian students, Pacific Islander students, and students of Two or more races were collected. At both grades 4 and 8, the 2015 average reading scores for Asian students, Pacific Islander students, and students of Two or more races were not measurably different from the scores in 2013 and 2011. Closing achievement gaps is a goal of both national and state education policies. From 1992 through 2015, the average reading scores for White 4th-and 8th-graders were higher than those of their Black and Hispanic peers. Although the White-Black and White-Hispanic achievement gaps did not change measurably from 2013 to 2015 at either grade 4 or 8, some of the racial/ethnic achievement gaps have narrowed since 1992. At grade 4, the White-Black gap narrowed from 32 points in 1992 to 26 points in 2015; at grade 8, the White-Hispanic gap narrowed from 26 points in 1992 to 21 points in 2015.  At grade 4, the average reading scores for male (219) and female (226) students in 2015 were not measurably different from those in 2013 but were higher than those in 1992 (213 and 221, respectively). At grade 8, the average reading score for male students in 2015 (261) was lower than in 2013 (263) but higher than the score in 1992 (254). Similarly, the average score for female 8th-grade students was lower in 2015 (270) than in 2013 (273) but higher than in 1992 (267). Since 1992, female students have scored higher than male students at both grades 4 and 8. The 2015 gender gap for 4th-grade students was not measurably different from the corresponding gaps in 2013 and 1992. The 2015 gender gap for 8th-grade students was not measurably different from the corresponding gap in 2013, but the 2015 gap (10 points) was smaller than the gap in 1992 (13 points). Since 1998, NAEP has collected data regarding student English language learner (ELL) status.1 For all available assessment years, the NAEP average reading scores for non-ELL 4th-and 8th-grade students were higher than the scores for their ELL peers. In 2015, the achievement gap between non-ELL and ELL students was 37 points at the 4th-grade level and 45 points at the 8th-grade level; these gaps were not measurably different from the achievement gaps observed in 2013 and 1998. In 2015, the average reading score for 4th-grade students in high-poverty2 schools (205) was lower than the average scores for 4th-grade students in mid-high poverty schools (219), mid-low poverty schools (228), and low-poverty schools (241). At grade 8, the average 2015 reading score for students in high-poverty schools (248) was lower than the average scores for students in mid-high poverty schools (261), mid-low poverty schools (269), and low-poverty schools (281). In 2015, the achievement gap between the students at high-poverty schools and low-poverty schools was 36 points at grade 4 and 33 points at grade 8. These 2015 achievement gaps were not measurably different from the corresponding achievement gaps between students at high-poverty and low-poverty schools at grades 4 and 8 in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013.  At grade 12, the average 2015 reading scores for White (295), Hispanic (276), and Asian/Pacific Islander students (297) were not measurably different from the scores in 2013 and 1992. For Black students, the 2015 average score (266) was lower than the 1992 score (273) but was not measurably different from the 2013 score. The average score for American Indian/Alaska Native students in 2015 (279) was not measurably different from the 2013 score. Starting in 2011, separate data for Asian students, Pacific Islander students, and students of Two or more races were collected. The 2015 average scores for Asian students and students of Two or more races were not measurably different from the scores in 2013.3 Achievement gaps in reading were also evident for 12th-grade students. The White-Black gap was wider in 2015 (30 points) than in 1992 (24 points), while the White-Hispanic gap in 2015 (20 points) was not measurably different from the gap in any previous assessment year. The 2015 average reading scores for male (282) and female (292) 12th-grade students were not measurably different from the scores in 2013 but were lower than the scores in 1992 (287 and 297, respectively). The achievement gap between male and female students at grade 12 in 2015 (10 points) was not measurably different from the corresponding gaps in 2013 and 1992. In 2015, non-ELL 12th-grade students scored higher than their ELL peers by 49 points. The achievement gap between non-ELL and ELL students in 2015 was not measurably different from the gaps in both 2013 and 1998.1 In 2015, the average reading score for 12th-grade students in high-poverty schools (266) was lower than the average scores for 12th-grade students in mid-high poverty schools (282), mid-low poverty schools (289), and low-poverty schools (298). The achievement gap between the students at high-poverty schools and low-poverty schools was 32 points in 2015, which was not measurably different from the gap in previous assessment years. NAEP results also permit state-level comparisons of the reading abilities of 4th-and 8th-grade students in public schools. In 2015, the average reading scores across the states varied for public school students in both grades. At grade 4, the national public school average score was 221 and scores across states ranged from 207 to 235. In 21 states, average scores for public school students were higher than the national public school average score. Average scores for public school students in 16 states were not measurably different from the national public school average. However, average scores in the District of Columbia and the remaining 13 states were lower than the national public school average. At grade 8, the national public school average score was 264 and scores across states ranged from 248 to 275. In 2015, 8th-grade average scores for public school students in 27 states were  higher than the national public school average, and public school students in 10 states had average scores that were not measurably different from the national public school average. However, 8th-grade public school students in the District of Columbia and 13 states had average scores that were lower than the national public school average. While there was no measurable change from 2013 to 2015 in the average reading score for 4th-grade public school students nationally, average scores were higher in 2015 than in 2013 in the District of Columbia and 12 states. Average 4th-grade scores were lower in 2015 than in 2013 in Maryland and Minnesota, while scores in all remaining states did not change measurably from 2013 to 2015. The average reading score for 8th-grade public school students was lower in 2015 than in 2013 nationally and in 8 states. However, 8th-grade students in West Virginia scored higher in 2015 than in 2013. In the remaining states, scores did not change measurably from 2013 to 2015. NAEP also collects public school data from urban districts at grades 4 and 8 based on the same reading assessment used to report national and state results. Twenty-one urban districts participated in 2015. The Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA) is intended to focus attention on urban education and to measure the educational progress of participating large urban districts.  In 2015, the average reading score for 4th-grade public school students in large cities4 (214) was lower than the national public school average reading score (221). Additionally, at grade 4, average scores for public school students in urban districts participating in TUDA ranged from 186 to 230. Public school 4th-grade students in 4 urban districts (Charlotte, Duval County, Hillsborough County, and Miami-Dade) had average scores higher than the national public school average, while students in 3 urban districts (Austin, Boston, and Jefferson County) had scores that were not measurably different from the national public school average. However, public school 4th-grade students in 14 urban districts had scores lower than the national public school average. Similarly, the average reading score for 8th-grade public school students in large cities (257) was lower than the national public school average score (264). At grade 8, average scores for public school students in urban districts participating in TUDA in 2015 ranged from 237 to 265. None of the urban districts had average 8th-grade scores higher than the national public school average. Eighth-grade public school students in 7 urban districts had average scores that were not measurably different from the national public school average. Eighth-grade public school students in the remaining 14 districts had average scores lower than the national public school average. Of the 20 urban districts that participated in the Trial Urban District Assessment in both 2013 and 2015, average 4th-and 8th-grade reading scores in some districts changed over time. Fourth-grade public school students in 4 urban districts (Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and the District of Columbia) performed better in reading in 2015 than in 2013. While there was a decline in 4th-grade public school students' average scores in Baltimore City, the average scores for students in the remaining 15 urban districts showed no measurable change between 2013 and 2015. Eighth-grade public school students in Miami-Dade scored higher in 2015 than in 2013 while 8th-grade students in 3 urban districts (Albuquerque, Baltimore City, and Hillsborough County) had lower average scores in 2015 than in 2013. Average scores for 8th-grade students in all other participating urban districts did not change measurably. Endnotes: 1 In the mid-to late-1990s, NAEP began a transition to include accommodations for ELL students and other students with special needs. Thus, 2015 data for ELL students are compared with data for 1998 instead of 1992 as in the remainder of the indicator. "}, {"section_title": "Mathematics Performance", "text": "The average 4th-and 8th-grade mathematics scores in 2015 were lower than the scores in 2013 but were higher than the scores in 1990, according to data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. At grade 12, the average mathematics score in 2015 was lower than the score in 2013, but not measurably different from the score in 2005. In 2015, for the first time, the average mathematics scores for 4th-and 8th-grade students were lower than the average scores in the previous assessment year. The average 4th-grade mathematics score in 2015 (240) was lower than the score in 2013 (242), although it was higher than the score in 1990 (213). The average 8th-grade mathematics score in 2015 (282) was lower than the score in 2013 (285). However, the average 8th-grade score in 2015 was higher than the score in 1990 (263). The average 12thgrade mathematics score in 2015 (152) was lower than the score in 2013 (153), but not measurably different from the score in 2005, the first year the revised assessment was administered.1  In 2015, some 82 percent of 4th-grade students performed at or above the Basic achievement level in mathematics, and 40 percent performed at or above the Proficient level. While the percentage of 4th-grade students performing at or above Basic in 2015 was lower than in 2013 (83 percent), it was higher than the percentage in 1990 (50 percent). The percentage of 4th-grade students performing at or above Proficient in 2015 (40 percent) was lower than in 2013 (42 percent). However, the percentage of 4thgrade students performing at or above Proficient in 2015 was higher than in 1990 (13 percent). In 2015, some 71 percent of 8th-grade students performed at or above Basic in mathematics, and 33 percent performed at or above Proficient. The percentage of 8th-grade students performing at or above Basic was lower in 2015 than in 2013 (74 percent), but was higher than the percentage in 1990 (52 percent). The percentage of 8th-grade students who scored at or above Proficient in 2015 (33 percent) was also lower than the percentage in 2013 (35 percent), but was higher than the percentage in 1990 (15 percent). At grade 4, the average mathematics score in 2015 for White students (248) was lower than the score in 2013 (250), while the average scores in 2015 for Black (224), Hispanic (230), and Asian/Pacific Islander (257) students were not measurably different from the 2013 scores. However, the 4th-grade average scores for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander students were all higher in 2015 than in 1990. The 2015 average score for 4th-grade American Indian/Alaska Native students (227) was not measurably different from the scores in 2013 and in 1996, the first year that data were available for these students. At grade 8, the average scores for White (292), Black (260), and Hispanic students (270) were lower in 2015 than in 2013 (294, 263, and 272, respectively). The 2015 average score for Asian/Pacific Islander students (306) was not measurably different from the score in 2013. However, the average scores for 8th-grade White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander students were all higher in 2015 than in 1990. The 2015 average score for 8th-grade American Indian/Alaska Native students (267) was not measurably different from the scores in 2013 and in 2000, the first year data were available for these students. Starting in 2011, separate data for Asian students, Pacific Islander students, and students of Two or more races were collected. At grades 4 and 8, the 2015 average mathematics scores for Asian students, Pacific Islander students, and students of Two or more races were not measurably different from the scores in 2013 and 2011. Closing achievement gaps is a goal of both national and state education policies. In 2015, and in all previous assessment years since 1990, the average mathematics scores for White students in grades 4 and 8 have been higher than the scores of their Black and Hispanic peers. For both grades, there was some narrowing of racial/ ethnic achievement gaps since the early 1990s. For example, the White-Black achievement gap at grade 4 narrowed from 32 points in 1990 to 24 points in 2015. Additionally, this 4th-grade White-Black achievement gap narrowed from 26 points in 2013 to 24 points in 2015, due to a decrease in White students' scores from 2013 to 2015. The 4th-grade White-Hispanic achievement gap in 2015 (18 points) was not measurably different from the gap in 2013. In 2015, the 8th-grade achievement gaps between White and Black students' average scores (32 points) and between White and Hispanic students' scores (22 points) were not measurably different from 2013. The average mathematics score in 2015 for male 4thgrade students (241) was not measurably different from the score in 2013, but was higher than the score in 1990 (214). For female 4th-grade students, the 2015 average score (239) was lower than the score in 2013 (241), but was higher than the score in 1990 (213). The average mathematics score in 2015 for male 8th-grade students (282) was lower than the score in 2013 (285), but was higher than the score in 1990 (263). Similarly, for female 8th-grade students, the average score in 2015 (282) was lower than in 2013 (284), but was higher than the score in 1990 (262). In 2015, there was a 2-point gap between the mathematics scores for male and female students at grade 4, which was not measurably different from the gaps in 2013 and 1990. At grade 8, no measurable gender achievement gap was observed in 1990, 2013, and 2015. Since 1996, NAEP has collected data on student English language learner (ELL) status for grades 4 and 8.2 For all available years of data, the average mathematics scores for non-ELL 4th-and 8th-grade students were higher than their ELL peers' scores. In 2015, the achievement In 2015, the average mathematics score for 4th-grade students in high-poverty3 schools (226) was lower than the average scores for 4th-grade students in mid-high poverty schools (237), mid-low poverty schools (245), and low-poverty schools (257). At grade 8, the average 2015 mathematics score for students in high-poverty schools (264) was lower than the average scores for students in mid-high poverty schools (276), mid-low poverty schools (287), and low-poverty schools (301). In 2015, the achievement gap between the students at highpoverty schools and low-poverty schools was 30 points at grade 4 and 38 points at grade 8. At both grades 4 and 8, this achievement gap was not measurably different from the gap observed in any assessment year since 2005.  In 2015, the average mathematics score for 12th-grade students in high-poverty schools (129) was lower than the average scores for 12th-grade students in mid-high poverty schools (145), mid-low poverty schools (154), and lowpoverty schools (164). The achievement gap between the students at high-poverty schools and low-poverty schools was 36 points in 2015, which was not measurably different from the gap in previous assessment years. NAEP results also permit state-level comparisons of the mathematics achievement of 4th-and 8th-grade students in public schools. In 2015, the average mathematics scores varied across the states for public school students in both grades. At grade 4, the national public school average score was 240, and scores across states ranged from 231 to 251. In 20 states, the average score for public school 4thgrade students was higher than the national public school average score. In 14 states, the average mathematics score for 4th-grade public school students was not measurably different from the national public school average. However, average scores in the District of Columbia and the remaining 16 states were lower than the national public school average. At grade 8, the 2015 national public school average score was 281, and scores among public school students across states ranged from 263 to 297. In 2015, 8th-grade average scores for public school students in 22 states were higher than the national public school average, and in 14 states, the average scores for public school 8th-grade students were not measurably different from the national public school average. However, public school 8th-grade students in the District of Columbia and 14 states had average scores that were lower than the national public school average.  The average mathematics score for 4th-grade public school students across the nation was lower in 2015 (240) than in 2013 (241). Average 4th-grade mathematics scores for public school students were also lower in 2015 than in 2013 in 16 states. However, the mathematics average score for 4th-grade students in Mississippi and the District of Columbia were higher in 2015 than in 2013. Scores were not measurably different in the other states during this period. The national public school average mathematics score for 8th-grade students was lower in 2015 (281) than in 2013 (284). Similarly, 22 states had lower 8th-grade average scores in 2015 than in 2013, while scores for the remaining 28 states and the District of Columbia were not measurably different between 2013 and 2015. During this time, no state experienced a score increase at the 8thgrade level.   In 2015, average mathematics scores across participating urban districts varied for both grades. The average mathematics scores of 4th-grade public school students in large cities5 (234) was lower than the national public school average score (240). At grade 4, average urban district scores for public school students in participating districts ranged from 205 to 248. Students in four urban districts (Austin, Charlotte, Duval County, and Hillsborough County) had average scores higher than the national public school average, while students in three urban districts had scores that were not measurably different from the national public school average. However, students in the remaining 14 urban districts had average scores lower than the national public school average. At grade 8, average urban district scores for public school students in participating districts in 2015 ranged from 244 to 286. The average mathematics score of 8th-grade public school students in large cities (274) was lower than the national public school average score (281). Eighth-grade students in Austin and Charlotte had average scores that were higher than the national public school average, and 8th-grade students in Boston and San Diego had average scores that were not measurably different from the national public school average. However, students in the remaining 17 urban districts had scores lower than the national public school average. Of the 20 urban districts that participated in the Trial Urban District Assessment in both 2013 and 2015, average mathematics scores at 4th and 8th grade in some urban districts changed over time. The average scores for 4th-grade students in Dallas, the District of Columbia, and Miami-Dade were higher in 2015 than in 2013. The averages scores for 4th-grade students in 10 participating urban districts were not measurably different between 2013 and 2015. However, the average scores for 4th-grade students in the remaining seven urban districts were lower in 2015 than in 2013. At grade 8, students in Chicago had higher average scores in 2015 than did their peers in 2013. Average mathematics scores for 8th-grade students in 16 participating urban districts were not measurably different during this same period. However, 8th-grade students in the remaining three districts (Dallas, Hillsborough County, and Houston) scored lower in 2015 on average than in 2013.  In 2015, the average 4th-grade science score (154) was higher than the score in 2009 (150). The average 8th-grade science score in 2015 (154) was higher than the scores in In 2015, about 76 percent of 4th-grade students performed at or above the Basic achievement level in science, and 38 percent performed at or above the Proficient level. These percentages were higher than the corresponding 2009 percentages for at or above Basic (72 percent) and at or above Proficient (34 percent   At grade 4, the average scores for Asian/Pacific Islander students (167), White students (166), students of Two or more races2 (158), Hispanic students (139), American Indian/Alaska Native students (139), and Black students (133) in were higher than the corresponding scores in 2009.

In the assessment framework, technology is defined as \"any modification of the natural world done to fulfill human needs or desires,\" and engineering is defined as \"a systematic and often iterative approach to designing objects, processes, and systems to meet human needs and wants.\" The TEL assessment is designed to measure three content areas. The first, Technology and Society, involves the effects that technology has on society and on the natural world and the ethical questions that arise from those effects. The second content area, Design and Systems, covers the nature of technology, the engineering design process by which technologies are developed, and basic principles of dealing with everyday technologies such as maintenance and troubleshooting. The final content area, Information and Communication Technology, includes computers and software learning tools; networking systems and protocols; handheld digital devices; and other technologies for accessing, creating, and communicating information and for facilitating creative expression.1 The TEL assessment was administered in 2014 to 8thgrade students in both public and private schools across the nation. In addition to the assessment, TEL included a questionnaire on demographics and students' experiences with technology and engineering, both inside and outside of school. The questionnaire covered student experiences related to each of the three content areas. This indicator first describes students' overall performance on the TEL assessment using scale scores2 and achievement levels. Next, the indicator describes differences in students' technology and engineering experiences in school and outside of school, with respect to student and school characteristics. It also explores associations between students' technology and engineering experiences and their TEL scores. In 2014, the average overall TEL score for 8th-grade students was 150 points on a scale ranging from 0 to 300. Student achievement on the TEL assessment varied by student and school characteristics. For example, female students scored higher on average than male students (151 vs. 149). The average TEL score for White and Asian students (both at 160) was higher than the average scores for Black (128), Hispanic (138), Pacific Islander (142), and American Indian/Alaska Native students (146), and not measurably different from the average score for students of Two or more races (154). In addition, English language learners (ELL) had lower average scores (108) than non-ELL students (152). The average TEL score was highest for students whose parents graduated from college (159) and lowest for students whose parents did not finish high school (133). TEL scores also varied by school poverty status. The average TEL score was highest for students in low-poverty schools (167) and lowest for students in highpoverty schools (132).3 The The TEL questionnaire, administered in addition to the TEL assessment, included questions about 8th-grade students' in-school and outside-school experiences in each of the three content areas. In the Technology and Society content area, students reported how frequently they learned about or discussed various topics in school and outside of school using the response options of \"never,\" \"rarely,\" \"sometimes,\" or \"often.\" More than two-thirds of 8th-graders reported sometimes or often learning about or discussing topics related to Technology and Society in school in 2014. For example, 43 percent of students reported sometimes and 28 percent reported often learning about or discussing the ways people work together to solve problems in their community or the world.  The percentage of students who reported learning about or discussing technology-and society-related topics in school varied by student and school characteristics. In general, higher percentages of female students than male students and higher percentages of Black students than White and Hispanic students reported often learning about or discussing technology-and society-related topics in school. For example, the percentage of students who reported they often learned about or discussed in school the ways people work together to solve problems in their community or the world was higher for female students (30 percent) than for male students (26 percent); and the percentage was higher for Black students (32 percent) than for Hispanic (28 percent) and White students (26 percent). In general, the percentages of students who reported often learning about or discussing various technology-and society-related topics in school were not measurably different by school poverty status.  Students who reported sometimes or often learning about or discussing various technology-and society-related topics in school scored, on average, higher than those who reported rarely or never having such experiences. For example, the average overall TEL scores were 153 for 8th-grade students who reported that they often or sometimes learned about or discussed the ways people work together to solve problems in their community or the world, compared with 148 for those who reported they rarely had such an experience and 133 for those who reported that they never had such an experience.  In the Design and Systems content area, students were asked how frequently they performed or learned about various tasks or topics in school using the response options of \"never,\" \"once or twice,\" \"three to five times,\" or \"more than five times.\" For example, in 2014, about 37 percent of 8th-grade students reported that they figured out why something was not working in order to fix it more than five times outside of school, and 18 percent of 8th-grade students reported performing this task more than five times in school. Additionally, about 30 percent of 8thgrade students reported taking something apart in order to fix it or see how it works more than five times outside of school, and 12 percent reported doing so more than five times in school.  Students who reported performing various design-and systems-related activities more than five times outside of school in 2014 scored, on average, higher than those who reported never performing such activities. For example, the average overall TEL score was 160 for 8th-grade students who reported that they figured out why something was not working in order to fix it more than five times outside of school, compared with 137 for those who reported never performing such an activity.  In the Information and Communication Technology content area, students were asked how frequently they use a computer or other digital technology to perform activities, both related to school and not related to school, using the categories of \"never/almost never,\" \"a few times a year,\" \"1-2 times a month,\" \"once or twice a week,\" or \"almost daily.   The percentage of 8th-grade students who reported using a computer or other digital technology to perform various activities for school work varied by student and school characteristics in 2014. However, the patterns of these differences were not consistent across these activities. For example, 21 percent of students from high-poverty schools, compared to 14 percent of students from lowpoverty schools, reported using digital technology to create a spreadsheet for school work at least once a week. On the other hand, a higher percentage of students from  5 Nearly satisfied guidelines for sample participation rates after replacement schools were included. 6 Exclusion rates for Azerbaijan and Georgia are slightly underestimated as some conflict zones were not covered and no official statistics were available. 7 The PIRLS International Study Center has reservations about the reliability of the average achievement score because the percentage of students with achievement too low for estimation exceeds 15 percent, though it is less than 25 percent. 8 The PIRLS International Study Center has reservations about the reliability of the average achievement score because the percentage of students with achievement too low for estimation exceeds 25 percent. NOTE: Education systems are ordered by 2011 average score. Italics indicate participants identified and counted in this report as an education system and not as a separate country. The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the scale average set at 500 and the standard deviation set at 100. The PIRLS average includes only education systems that are members of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), which develops and implements PIRLS at the international level. In 2011, the average reading literacy score for 4th-grade students in the United States (556) was higher than the average score for participating countries (500). The United States was among the top 13 education systems in reading literacy (five education systems had higher average scores, and seven had scores that were not measurably different). The United States scored higher, on average, than 40 education systems. The five education systems with average reading scores above the U.S. score were Finland, Hong Kong (China), the Russian Federation, Singapore, and, within the United States, Florida. Additionally, Florida's average score (569) was higher than the PIRLS scale average. No education system scored higher than Florida, although four had scores that were not measurably different. Forty-eight education systems scored lower than Florida. In 2015, TIMSS mathematics and science data were collected by 54 education systems at 4th grade and 43 education systems at 8th grade.2 TIMSS Advanced data were also collected by nine education systems from students in the final year of their secondary schools (in the U.S., 12th-graders). Education systems include countries (complete, independent, and political entities) and other benchmarking education systems (portions of a country, nation, kingdom, or emirate, and other non-national entities).3 In addition to participating in the U.S. national sample, Florida participated individually as a state at the 4th and 8th grades.  4 Norway collected data from students in their fifth year of schooling rather than in grade 4 because year 1 in Norway is considered the equivalent of kindergarten rather than the first year of primary school.  4 Norway collected data from students in their fifth year of schooling rather than in grade 4 because year 1 in Norway is considered the equivalent of kindergarten rather than the first year of primary school. At grade 8, the U.S. average science score (530) in 2015 was higher than the TIMSS scale centerpoint of 500. Seven education systems had higher average science scores than the United States, 9 had scores that were not measurably different, and 26 education systems had lower average scores. The seven education systems with average science scores above the U.S. score were Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong (China), Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Singapore, and Slovenia. Florida's average science score was below the U.S. national average.  The TIMSS Advanced assessment measures the advanced mathematics and physics achievement of students in their final year of secondary school who are taking or have taken advanced courses. In TIMSS Advanced, the U.S. average advanced mathematics score (485) in 2015 was lower than the TIMSS Advanced scale centerpoint (500). Two education systems had higher average advanced mathematics scores than the United States, two (Portugal and the Russian Federation) had scores that were not measurably different, and five education systems had lower average scores. The education systems with higher average advanced mathematics scores than the United States were Lebanon and the Russian Federation's intensive track (i.e., advanced students taking 6 or more hours of advanced mathematics per week6). Such comparisons, however, should take into account the \"coverage index,\" which represents the percentage of students eligible to take the advanced mathematics assessment.

Four education systems had higher average physics scores than the United States, one (Sweden) had a score that was not measurably different, and three education systems had lower average scores. The education systems with higher average advanced science scores than the United States were Norway, Portugal, the Russian Federation, and Slovenia. The physics coverage index ranged from 3.9 percent in Lebanon to 21.5 percent in France. 5 The IEA differentiates between IEA members, referred to always as \"countries\" and \"benchmarking participants.\" IEA member countries include both \"countries,\" which are complete, independent political entities and \"other education systems,\" or non-national entities (e.g., England, the Flemish community of Belgium). Non-national entities that are not IEA member countries (i.e., Florida, Abu Dhabi) are designated as \"benchmarking participants.\" For convenience, the generic term \"education systems\" is used when summarizing across results.

This indicator examines the percentage of public high school students who graduate on time, as measured by the adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR). State education agencies calculate the ACGR by identifying the \"cohort\" of first-time 9th-graders in a particular school year. The cohort is then adjusted by adding any students who transfer into the cohort after 9th grade and subtracting any students who transfer out, emigrate to another country, or die. The ACGR is the percentage of students in this adjusted cohort who graduate within four years with a regular high school diploma. The U.S. Department of Education first collected the ACGR in 2010-11.  The ACGR increased over the first 5 years in which it was collected, from 79 percent in 2010-11 to 83 percent in 2014-15. In other words, more than 4 out of 5 public school students received a regular high school diploma within 4 years of starting 9th grade. In 2014-15, the state-level ACGRs ranged from 69 percent in the District of Columbia and New Mexico to 90 percent in New Jersey and 91 percent in Iowa.1 Roughly two-thirds of states (34) reported graduation rates between 80 and 89 percent.2 1 Represents either the value reported by the state for the \"Asian/Pacific Islander\" group or an aggregation of values reported by the state for separate \"Asian,\" \"Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander or Pacific Islander,\" and \"Filipino\" groups. NOTE: The adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) is the percentage of public high school freshmen who graduate with a regular diploma within 4 years of starting 9th grade. In 2014-15, the ACGRs for American Indian/Alaska Native (72 percent), Black (75 percent), and Hispanic (78 percent) students were below the national average of 83 percent. The ACGRs for White (88 percent) and Asian/Pacific Islander3 (90 percent) students were above the national average. Across states, ACGRs for White students ranged from 74 percent in New Mexico to 94 percent in New Jersey and were higher than the overall national ACGR of 83 percent in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The rates for Black students ranged from 56 percent in Nevada to 85 percent in Texas. Texas was the only state in which the ACGR for Black students was higher than the overall national ACGR. The ACGRs for Hispanic students ranged from 66 percent in Minnesota and New York to 87 percent in Texas and were higher than the overall national ACGR in four states (Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas). For Asian/Pacific Islander students, ACGRs ranged from 76 percent in Vermont to 96 percent in Maryland and New Jersey4 and were higher than the overall national ACGR in 40 states. The ACGRs for American Indian/Alaska Native students ranged from 45 percent in Wyoming to 89 percent in New Jersey and were higher than the overall national ACGR in seven states (Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Texas).5 The  Public High School Graduation Rates \u2021 Reporting standards not met. The Alabama State Department of Education has indicated that their adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) data was misstated.

These gaps may vary slightly from those that would be calculated using unrounded rates. NOTE: The adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) is the percentage of public high school freshmen who graduate with a regular diploma within 4 years of starting 9th grade. The national ACGR for White students (88 percent) was 13 percentage points6 higher than the national ACGR for Black students (75 percent) in 2014-15. White public high school students had higher ACGRs than Black public high school students in every state and the District of Columbia. Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin reported the largest gaps between White and Black students. In each of these five states, the ACGR for White students was at least 20 percentage points higher than the ACGR for Black students.  4 In addition, the ACGR for Asian/Pacific Islander students in West Virginia was greater than or equal to 95 percent. To protect student privacy, the exact value is not displayed. 5 Discussion of ACGRs for American Indian/Alaska Native students excludes data for three jurisdictions: the District of Columbia, Vermont, and Virginia. Data for the District of Columbia were suppressed to protect student privacy, data for Vermont were displayed as greater than or equal to 50 percent to protect student privacy, and data for Virginia were unavailable. 6 Percentage point gaps were calculated using the most precise graduation rates available for public use, which includes some rates rounded to one decimal place and some rates rounded to whole numbers. These gaps may vary slightly from those that would be calculated using unrounded rates.

Average total cost, net price, and grant and scholarship aid for first-time, full-time undergraduate students receiving aid at private for-profit 4-year institutions, by family income level: Academic year 2014-15 At private for-profit 4-year institutions, the average amount of grant and scholarship aid received (in constant 2015-16 dollars) followed the pattern of public 4-year institutions: the lower the family income level, the greater the average amount of grant and scholarship aid received. The average amount of grant and scholarship aid received by first-time, full-time undergraduate students in 2014-15 was highest for those with family incomes of $30,000 or less ($5,700 in aid) and lowest for those with family incomes of $110,001 or more ($1,800 in aid). The lowest average net price ($20,900) was for students with family incomes of $30,000 or less, and the highest average net price ($31,100) was for those with family incomes of $110,001 or more. In addition to the differences observed for each institution type by family income level, the average amount of grant and scholarship aid received and the average net price of attendance (in constant 2015-16 dollars) also varied among 4-year institutions by institution control.

For all institutions making changes, the changes resulted in different employee counts. For both institutional and aggregate differences, however, the changes had little impact on the original employee count submissions. A large number of institutions reported different staff data to IPEDS and Thomson Peterson; however, the magnitude of the differences was small-usually no more than 17 faculty members for any faculty variable. The Salaries section collected data for full-time instructional faculty (except those in medical schools in the EAP section, described above) on the institution's payroll as of November 1 of the collection year by contract length/teaching period, gender, and academic rank. The reporting of data by faculty status in the Salaries section was required from 4-year degree-granting institutions and above only. Salary outlays and fringe benefits were also collected for full-time instructional staff on 9/10-and 11/12-month contracts/teaching periods. This section was applicable to degree-granting institutions unless exempt. Between 1966-67 and 1985-86, this survey differed from other HEGIS surveys in that imputations were not made for nonrespondents. Thus, there is some possibility that the salary averages presented in this report may differ from the results of a complete enumeration of all colleges and universities. Beginning with the surveys for 1987-88, the IPEDS data tabulation procedures included imputations for survey nonrespondents. The unweighted response rate for the 2008-09 Salaries survey section was 99.9 percent. The response rate for the 2009-10 Salaries section was 100.0 percent (4,453 of the 4,455 required institutions responded), and the response rate for 2010-11 was 99.9 percent (4,561 of the 4,565 required institutions responded). Imputation methods for the 2010-11 Salaries survey section are discussed in Employees in Postsecondary Institutions, Fall 2010, and Salaries of Full-Time Instructional Staff, 2010-11 (NCES 2012-276). Although data from this survey are not subject to sampling error, sources of nonsampling error may include computational errors and misclassification in reporting and processing. The electronic reporting system does allow corrections to prior-year reported or missing data, and this should help alleviate these problems. Also, NCES reviews individual institutions' data for internal and longitudinal consistency and contacts institutions to check inconsistent data. \nThe revised mathematics framework focuses on two dimensions: mathematical content and cognitive demand. By considering these two dimensions for each item in the assessment, the framework ensures that NAEP assesses an appropriate balance of content, as well as a variety of ways of knowing and doing mathematics. Since the 2005 changes to the mathematics framework were minimal for grades 4 and 8, comparisons over time can be made between assessments conducted before and after the framework's implementation for these grades. The changes that the 2005 framework made to the grade 12 assessment, however, were too drastic to allow grade 12 results from before and after implementation to be directly compared. These changes included adding more questions on algebra, data analysis, and probability to reflect changes in high school mathematics standards and coursework; merging the measurement and geometry content areas; and changing the reporting scale from 0-500 to 0-300. For more information regarding the 2005 mathematics framework revisions, see http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/mathematics/ frameworkcomparison.asp. Results are available for the reading assessments administered in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015. In 2009, a new framework was developed for the 4th-, 8th-, and 12th-grade NAEP reading assessments. Both a content alignment study and a reading trend, or bridge, study were conducted to determine if the new reading assessment was comparable to the prior assessment. Overall, the results of the special analyses suggested that the assessments were similar in terms of their item and scale characteristics and the results they produced for important demographic groups of students. Thus, it was determined that the results of the 2009 reading assessment could still be compared to those from earlier assessment years, thereby maintaining the trend lines first established in 1992. For more information regarding the 2009 reading framework revisions, see http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/reading/ whatmeasure.asp. In spring 2013, NAEP released results from the NAEP 2012 economics assessment in The Nation's Report Card: Economics 2012 (NCES 2013-453). First administered in 2006, the NAEP economics assessment measures 12th-graders' understanding of a wide range of topics in three main content areas: market economy, national economy, and international economy. The 2012 assessment is based on a nationally representative sample of nearly 11,000 students in the 12th grade. In Trend results for previous assessment years in these three subjects, as well as information on school and student participation rates and sample tasks and student responses, are also presented. In 2014, the first administration of the NAEP Technology and Engineering Literacy (TEL) Assessment asked 8th-graders to respond to questions aimed at assessing their knowledge and skill in understanding technological principles, solving technology and engineering-related problems, and using technology to communicate and collaborate. The online report The Nation's Report Card: Technology and Engineering Literacy (NCES 2016-119) presents national results for 8th-graders on the TEL assessment. The Nation's Report Card: 2015 Mathematics and Reading Assessments (NCES 2015-136) is an online interactive report that presents national and state results for 4th-and 8th-graders on the NAEP 2015 mathematics and reading assessments. The report also presents TUDA results in mathematics and reading for 4th-and 8th-graders. The online interactive report The Nation's Report Card: 2015 Mathematics and Reading at Grade 12 (NCES 2016-018) presents grade 12 results from the NAEP 2015 mathematics and reading assessments. Results from the 2015 NAEP science assessment are presented in the online report The Nation's Report Card: 2015 Science at Grades 4, 8, and 12 (NCES 2016-162). The assessment measures 4th-, 8th-, and 12th-graders' knowledge in three science content areas (physical science, life science, and Earth and space sciences) and their understanding of four science practices (identifying science principles, using science principles, using scientific inquiry, and using technological design). National results are reported for grades 4, 8, and 12, and results from 46 participating states and one jurisdiction are reported for grades 4 and 8. Since a new NAEP science framework was introduced in 2009, results from the 2015 science assessment can be compared to results from the 2009 and 2011 science assessments, but cannot be compared to the science assessments conducted prior to 2009. NAEP is in the process of transitioning from paperbased assessments to technology-based assessments; consequently, data are needed regarding students' access to and familiarity with technology, at home and at school. The Computer Access and Familiarity Study (CAFS) is designed to fulfill this need. CAFS was conducted as part of the main administration of the 2015 NAEP. A subset of the grade 4, 8, and 12 students who took the main NAEP were chosen to take the additional CAFS questionnaire. The main 2015 NAEP was administered in a paper-and-pencil format to some students and a digitalbased format to others, and CAFS participants were given questionnaires in the same format as their NAEP questionnaires.\nNCVS estimates presented may differ from those in previous published reports. This is because a small number of victimizations, referred to as series victimizations, are included using a new counting strategy. High-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, are six or more similar but separate victimizations that occur with such frequency that the victim is unable to recall each individual event or describe each event in detail. As part of ongoing research efforts associated with the redesign of the NCVS, BJS investigated ways to include high-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, in estimates of criminal victimization. Including series victimizations results in more accurate estimates of victimization. BJS has decided to include series victimizations using the victim's estimates of the number of times the victimizations occurred over the past 6 months, capping the number of victimizations within each series at a maximum of 10. This strategy for counting series victimizations balances the desire to estimate national rates and account for the experiences of persons who have been subjected to repeat victimizations against the desire to minimize the estimation errors that can occur when repeat victimizations are reported. Including series victimizations in national rates results in rather large increases in the level of violent victimization; however, trends in violence are generally similar regardless of whether series victimizations are included. For more information on the new counting strategy and supporting research, see Methods for Counting High-Frequency Repeat Victimizations in the National Crime Victimization Survey at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/mchfrv.pdf. Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was modified. A question on Hispanic origin is now followed by a new question on race. The new question about race allows the respondent to choose more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate category from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. An analysis conducted by the Demographic Surveys Division at the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the new race question had very little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of the NCVS respondents, with one exception: There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percentage of respondents who reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories, comparisons of race/ ethnicity across years should be made with caution. The number of NCVS-eligible households in the sample in 2015 was 95,760. Households were selected using a stratified, multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done proportionate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample. The final sample was augmented to account for households constructed after the decennial census. Within each sampled household, the U.S. Census Bureau interviewer attempts to interview all household members age 12 and over to determine whether they had been victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview. The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. About 80,000 persons age 12 and over are interviewed each 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals. Since the survey's inception, the initial interview at each sample unit has been used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from the initial interview have been adjusted to account for the effects of bounding and have been included in the survey estimates. After a household has been interviewed its seventh time, it is replaced by a new sample household. In 2015, the household response rate was about 82 percent and the completion rate for persons within households was about 86 percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates for the total U.S. population 12 years and older. Further information on the NCVS may be obtained from Rachel E. Morgan Victimization Statistics Branch Bureau of Justice Statistics rachel.morgan@usdoj.gov http://www.bjs.gov/\nIn 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and urbanicity variables. White students and students of other races/ethnicities had higher response rates than did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households located in rural areas had higher response rates than those from households located in urban areas. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2011, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age variable. Respondents 12 to 17 years old had higher response rates than did 18-year-old respondents in the NCVS and SCS interviews. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities and for the effects of nonresponse. The weighting adjustments that correct for differential response rates are created by region, age, race, and sex, and should have reduced the effect of nonresponse. In 2013, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age variable in the SCS respondent sample. Students age 14 and those from the western region showed percentage bias exceeding 5 percent; however, both subgroups had the highest response rate in their respective categories. All other subgroups evaluated showed less than 1 percent nonresponse bias and had between 0.3 and 2.6 percent difference between the response population and the eligible population. In the 2015 SCS, evidence of potential nonresponse bias was found in the race, urbanicity, region, and age subgroups. In addition, respondents in the age 14 and rural subgroups had significantly higher nonresponse bias estimates compared to other age and urbanicity subgroups, while respondents who were Asian and respondents who were from the Northeast had significantly lower response bias estimates compared to other race and region subgroups. Thus, the analysis indicates that there are significant nonresponse biases in the 2015 SCS data and that caution should be used when comparing responses among subgroups in the SCS. For most survey items in most years of the SCS survey, however, response rates have been high-typically over 97 percent of all eligible respondents, meaning there is little potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in the survey. Weights have been developed to compensate for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in all SCS data years. Further information about the SCS may be obtained from The international bodies that coordinate international assessments vary in the labels they apply to participating education systems, most of which are countries. IEA differentiates between IEA members, which IEA refers to as \"countries\" in all cases, and \"benchmarking participants.\" IEA members include countries such as the United States and Ireland, as well as subnational entities such as England and Scotland (which are both part of the United Kingdom), the Flemish community of Belgium, and Hong Kong (a Special Administrative Region of China). IEA benchmarking participants are all subnational entities and include Canadian provinces, U.S. states, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (among others). Benchmarking participants, like the participating countries, are given the opportunity to assess the comparative international standing of their students' achievement and to view their curriculum and instruction in an international context. Some IEA studies, such as TIMSS and PIRLS, include an assessment portion, as well as contextual questionnaires for collecting information about students' home and The Condition of Education 2017 | 326 Guide to Sources school experiences. The TIMSS and PIRLS scales, including the scale averages and standard deviations, are designed to remain constant from assessment to assessment so that education systems (including countries and subnational education systems) can compare their scores over time as well as compare their scores directly with the scores of other education systems. Although each scale was created to have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100, the subject matter and the level of difficulty of items necessarily differ by grade, subject, and domain/dimension. Therefore, direct comparisons between scores across grades, subjects, and different domain/dimension types should not be made. Further information on the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement may be obtained from http://www.iea.nl.\nPIRLS guidelines call for a minimum of 150 schools to be sampled, with a minimum of 4,000 students assessed. The basic sample design of one classroom per school was designed to yield a total sample of approximately 4,500 students per population. Because PIRLS was also administered at grade 4 in spring 2011, TIMSS and PIRLS in the United States were administered in the same schools to the extent feasible. Students took either TIMSS or PIRLS on the day of the assessments. About 13,000 U.S. students participated in PIRLS in 2011, joining 300,000 other student participants around the world. Accommodations were not provided for students with disabilities or students who were unable to read or speak the language of the test. These students were excluded from the sample. The IEA requirement is that the overall exclusion rate, which includes exclusions of schools and students, should not exceed more than 5 percent of the national desired target population. In order to minimize the potential for response biases, the IEA developed participation or response rate standards that apply to all participating education systems and govern whether or not an education system's data are included in the TIMSS or PIRLS international datasets and the way in which its statistics are presented in the international reports. These standards were set using composites of response rates at the school, classroom, and student and teacher levels. Response rates were calculated with and without the inclusion of substitute schools that were selected to replace schools refusing to participate. In the 2011 PIRLS administered in the United States, the weighted school participation rate was 80 percent before the use of substitute schools and 85 percent after the use of replacement schools; the weighted student response rate was 96 percent."}, {"section_title": "Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study", "text": "The Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) provides information on persistence, progress, and attainment for 6 years after initial time of entry into postsecondary education. BPS includes traditional and nontraditional (e.g., older) students and is representative of all beginning students in postsecondary education in a given year. Initially, these individuals are surveyed in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) during the year in which they first begin their postsecondary education. These same students are surveyed again 2 and 5 years later through the BPS. By starting with a cohort that has already entered postsecondary education and following it for 6 years, the BPS can determine the extent to which students who start postsecondary education at various ages differ in their progress, persistence, and attainment, as well as their entry into the workforce.  Once SEAs have completed their submissions, the CCD survey staff analyzes and verifies the data for quality assurance. Even though the CCD is a universe collection and thus not subject to sampling errors, nonsampling errors can occur. The two potential sources of nonsampling errors are nonresponse and inaccurate reporting. NCES attempts to minimize nonsampling errors through the use of annual training of SEA coordinators, extensive quality reviews, and survey editing procedures. In addition, each year, SEAs are given the opportunity to revise their state-level aggregates from the previous survey cycle. classroom teacher count, low/high grade span offered, congressional district code, school level, students eligible for free lunch, students eligible for reduced-price lunch, total students eligible for free and reduced-price lunch, and student totals and detail (by grade, by race/ethnicity, and by sex).

The data collected are useful to (1) chief officers of state education agencies; (2) policymakers in the executive and legislative branches of federal and state governments; (3) education policy and public policy researchers; and (4) the public, journalists, and others. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011) provides detailed information on the school achievement and experiences of students throughout their elementary school years. The students who participated in the ECLS-K:2011 were followed longitudinally from the kindergarten year (the 2010-11 school year) through the spring of 2016, when most of them were expected to be in 5th grade. This sample of students is designed to be nationally representative of all students who were enrolled in kindergarten or who were of kindergarten age and being educated in an ungraded classroom or school in the United States in the 2010-11 school year, including those in public and private schools, those who attended full-day and part-day programs, those who were in kindergarten for the first time, and those who were kindergarten repeaters. Students who attended early learning centers or institutions that offered education only through kindergarten are included in the study sample and represented in the cohort. The ECLS-K:2011 places emphasis on measuring students' experiences within multiple contexts and development in multiple domains. The design of the study includes the collection of information from the students, their parents/ guardians, their teachers, and their schools. Information was collected from their before-and after-school care providers in the kindergarten year. A nationally representative sample of approximately 18,170 children from about 1,310 schools participated in the base-year administration of the ECLS-K:2011 in the 2010-11 school year. The sample included children from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Asian/Pacific Islander students were oversampled to ensure that the sample included enough students of this race/ethnicity to make accurate estimates for the group as a whole. Eight data collections have been conducted to date: fall and spring of the children's kindergarten year (the base year), fall 2011 and spring 2012 (the 1st-grade year), fall 2012 and spring 2013 (the 2nd-grade year), spring 2014 (the 3rd-grade year), and spring 2015 (the 4th-grade year). The final data collection was conducted in the spring of 2016. Although the study refers to later rounds of data collection by the grade the majority of children are expected to be in (that is, the modal grade for children who were in kindergarten in the 2010-11 school year), children are included in subsequent data collections regardless of their grade level. A total of approximately 780 of the 1,310 originally sampled schools participated during the base year of the study. This translates to a weighted unit response rate (weighted by the base weight) of 63 percent for the base year. In the base year, the weighted child assessment unit response rate was 87 percent for the fall data collection and 85 percent for the spring collection, and the weighted parent unit response rate was 74 percent for the fall collection and 67 percent for the spring collection. Fall and spring data collections were conducted in the 2011-12 school year, when the majority of the children were in the 1st grade. The fall collection was conducted within a 33 percent subsample of the full base-year sample, and the spring collection was conducted within the full base-year sample. The weighted child assessment unit response rate was 89 percent for the fall data collection and 88 percent for the spring collection, and the weighted parent unit response rate was 87 percent for the fall data collection and 76 percent for the spring data collection. In the 2012-13 data collection (when the majority of the children were in the 2nd grade) the weighted child assessment unit response rate was 84.0 percent in the fall and 83.4 percent in the spring. In the 2014 spring data collection (when the majority of the children were in the 3rd grade), the weighted child assessment unit response rate was 79.9 percent.

As a large-scale, longitudinal survey, its primary purpose is to observe the educational and occupational plans and activities of young people as they pass through the American educational system and take on their adult roles. The study contributes to the understanding of the development of young adults and the factors that determine individual education and career outcomes. The availability of this longitudinal data encourages research in such areas as the strength of secondary school curricula, the quality and effectiveness of secondary and postsecondary schooling, the demand for postsecondary education, problems of financing postsecondary education, and the adequacy of postsecondary alternatives open to high school students. The HS&B survey gathered data on the education, work, and family experiences of young adults for the pivotal years during and immediately following high school. The student questionnaire covered school experiences, activities, attitudes, plans, selected background characteristics, and language proficiency. Parents were asked about their educational aspirations for their children and plans for how their postsecondary education would be financed. Teachers were surveyed regarding their assessments of their students' futures. The survey also collected detailed information, from complete high school transcripts, on courses taken and grades achieved. The base-year survey (conducted in 1980) was a probability sample of 1,015 high schools with a target number of 36 sophomores and 36 seniors in each school. A total of 58,270 students participated in the base-year survey. Substitutions were made for nonparticipating schools-but not for students-in those strata where it was possible. Overall, 1,120 schools were selected in the original sample and 810 of these schools participated in the survey. An additional 200 schools were drawn in a replacement sample. Student refusals and absences resulted in an 82 percent completion rate for the survey. Several small groups in the population were oversampled to allow for special study of certain types of schools and students. Students completed questionnaires and took a battery of cognitive tests. In addition, a sample of parents of sophomores and seniors (about 3,600 for each cohort) was surveyed. HS&B first follow-up activities took place in the spring of 1982. The sample for the first follow-up survey included approximately 30,000 individuals who were sophomores in 1980. The completion rate for sample members eligible for on-campus survey administration was about 96 percent. About 89 percent of the students who left school between the base-year and first follow-up surveys (e.g., dropouts, transfer students, and early graduates) completed the first follow-up sophomore questionnaire. As part of the first follow-up survey of HS&B, transcripts were requested in fall 1982 for an 18,150member subsample of the sophomore cohort. Of the 15,940 transcripts actually obtained, 12,120 transcripts represented students who had graduated in 1982 and thus were eligible for use in the overall curriculum analysis presented in this publication. All courses in each transcript were assigned a 6-digit code based on the Classification of Secondary School Courses (a coding system developed to standardize course descriptions; see http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hst/courses.asp). Credits earned in each course are expressed in Carnegie units. (The Carnegie unit is a standard of measurement that represents one credit for the completion of a 1-year course. To receive credit for a course, the student must have received a passing grade-\"pass,\" \"D,\" or higher.) Students who transferred from public to private schools or from private to public schools between their sophomore and senior years were eliminated from public/private analyses. In designing the senior cohort first follow-up survey, one of the goals was to reduce the size of the retained sample while still keeping sufficient numbers of various racial/ ethnic groups to allow important policy analyses. A total of about 11,230 (93.6 percent) of the 12,000 individuals subsampled completed the questionnaire. Information was obtained about the respondents' school and employment experiences, family status, and attitudes and plans. The samples for the second follow-up, which took place in spring 1984, consisted of about 12,000 members of the senior cohort and about 15,000 members of the sophomore cohort. The completion rate for the senior cohort was 91 percent, and the completion rate for the sophomore cohort was 92 percent. HS&B third follow-up data collection activities were performed in spring 1986. Both the sophomore and senior cohort samples for this round of data collection were the same as those used for the second follow-up survey. The completion rates for the sophomore and senior cohort samples were 91 percent and 88 percent, respectively. HS&B fourth follow-up data collection activities were performed in 1992 but only covered the 1980 sophomore class. These activities included examining aspects of these students' early adult years, such as enrollment in postsecondary education, experience in the labor market, marriage and child rearing, and voting behavior. An NCES series of technical reports and data file user's manuals, available electronically, provides additional information on the survey methodology.

The study focuses on understanding students' trajectories from the beginning of high school into postsecondary education, the workforce, and beyond. to provide data on mathematics and science education, the changing high school environment, and postsecondary education. This study features a new student assessment in algebra skills, reasoning, and problem solving and includes surveys of students, their parents, math and science teachers, and school administrators, as well as a new survey of school counselors. The HSLS:09 base year took place in the 2009-10 school year, with a randomly selected sample of fall-term 9th-graders in more than 900 public and private high schools that had both a 9th and an 11th grade. Students took a mathematics assessment and survey online. Students' parents, principals, and mathematics and science teachers and the school's lead counselor completed surveys on the phone or online. The HSLS:09 student questionnaire includes interest and motivation items for measuring key factors predicting choice of postsecondary paths, including majors and eventual careers. This study explores the roles of different factors in the development of a student's commitment to attend college and then take the steps necessary to succeed in college (the right courses, courses in specific sequences, etc.). Questionnaires in this study have asked more questions of students and parents regarding reasons for selecting specific colleges (e.g., academic programs, financial aid and access prices, and campus environment). The first follow-up of HSLS:09 occurred in the spring of 2012, when most sample members were in the 11th grade. Data files and documentation for the first follow-up were released in fall 2013 and are available on the NCES website. A between-round postsecondary status update survey took place in the spring of students' expected graduation year (2013). It asked respondents about college applications, acceptances, and rejections, as well as their actual college choices. In the fall of 2013 and the spring of 2014, high school transcripts were collected and coded. Beginning in 2008-09, the first-professional degree category was combined with the doctor's degree category. However, some degrees formerly identified as firstprofessional that take more than two full-time-equivalent academic years to complete, such as those in Theology (M.Div, M.H.L./Rav), are included in the Master's degree category. Doctor's degrees were broken out into three distinct categories: research/scholarship, professional practice, and other doctor's degrees. IPEDS race/ethnicity data collection also changed in 2008-09. The \"Asian\" race category is now separate from a \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\" category, and a new category of \"Two or more races\" has been added. The degree-granting institutions portion of IPEDS is a census of colleges that award associate's or higher degrees and are eligible to participate in Title IV financial aid programs. Prior to 1993, data from technical and vocational institutions were collected through a sample survey. Beginning in 1993, all data are gathered in a census of all postsecondary institutions. Beginning in 1997, the survey was restricted to institutions participating in Title IV programs. The classification of institutions offering college and university education changed as of 1996. Prior to 1996, institutions that had courses leading to an associate's or higher degree or that had courses accepted for credit toward those degrees were considered higher education institutions. Higher education institutions were accredited by an agency or association that was recognized by the U.S. Department of Education or were recognized directly by the Secretary of Education. The newer standard includes institutions that award associate's or higher degrees and that are eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. Tables that contain any data according to this standard are titled \"degreegranting\" institutions. Time-series tables may contain data from both series, and they are noted accordingly. The impact of this change on data collected in 1996 was not large. For example, tables on faculty salaries and benefits were only affected to a very small extent. Also, degrees awarded at the bachelor's level or higher were not heavily affected. The largest impact was on private 2-year college enrollment. In contrast, most of the data on public 4-year colleges were affected to a minimal extent. The impact on enrollment in public 2-year colleges was noticeable in certain states, such as Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, and Washington, but was relatively small at the national level. Overall, total enrollment for all institutions was about one-half of 1 percent higher in 1996 for degree-granting institutions than for higher education institutions. Prior to the establishment of IPEDS in 1986, HEGIS acquired and maintained statistical data on the characteristics and operations of higher education institutions. Implemented in 1966, HEGIS was an annual universe survey of institutions accredited at the college level by an agency recognized by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. These institutions were listed in NCES's Education Directory, Colleges and Universities. HEGIS surveys collected information on institutional characteristics, faculty salaries, finances, enrollment, and degrees. Since these surveys, like IPEDS, were distributed to all higher education institutions, the data presented are not subject to sampling error. However, they are subject to nonsampling error, the sources of which varied with the survey instrument. The NCES Taskforce for IPEDS Redesign recognized that there were issues related to the consistency of data definitions as well as the accuracy, reliability, and validity of other quality measures within and across surveys. The IPEDS redesign in 2000 provided institution-specific web-based data forms. While the new system shortened data processing time and provided better data consistency, it did not address the accuracy of the data provided by institutions. Beginning in 2003-04 with the Prior Year Data Revision System, prior-year data have been available to institutions entering current data. This allows institutions to make changes to their prior-year entries either by adjusting the data or by providing missing data. These revisions allow the evaluation of the data's accuracy by looking at the changes made. NCES conducted a study (NCES 2005-175) of the 2002-03 data that were revised in 2003-04 to determine the accuracy of the imputations, track the institutions that submitted revised data, and analyze the revised data they submitted. When institutions made changes to their data, it was assumed that the revised data were the \"true\" data. The data were analyzed for the number and type of institutions making changes, the type of changes, the magnitude of the changes, and the impact on published data. Because NCES imputes for missing data, imputation procedures were also addressed by the Redesign Taskforce. For the 2003-04 assessment, differences between revised values and values that were imputed in the original files were compared (i.e., revised value minus imputed value). These differences were then used to provide an assessment of the effectiveness of imputation procedures. The size of the differences also provides an indication of the accuracy of imputation procedures. To assess the overall impact Financial aid data are collected for undergraduate students. Data are collected regarding federal grants, state and local government grants, institutional grants, and loans. The collected data include the number of students receiving each type of financial assistance and the average amount of aid received by type of aid. Beginning in 2008-09, student financial aid data collected includes greater detail on types of aid offered. In the winter 2015-16 data collection, the Student Financial Aid component collected data about financial aid awarded to undergraduate students, with particular emphasis on full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students awarded financial aid for the 2014-15 academic year. In addition, the component collected data on undergraduate and graduate students receiving benefits for veterans and members of the military service. Finally, student counts and awarded aid amounts were collected to calculate the net price of attendance for two subsets of full-time, first-time degree/ certificate-seeking undergraduate students: those awarded any grant aid, and those awarded Title IV aid.

In the IPEDS 2013-14 data collection year, however, the Graduation Rates and 200 Percent Graduation Rates collections were moved to the winter data collection. The 2015-16 Graduation Rates component collected counts of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students beginning their postsecondary education in the specified cohort year and their completion status as of 150 percent of normal program The Condition of Education 2017 | 309 Guide to Sources completion time at the same institution where the students started. If 150 percent of normal program completion time extended beyond August 31, 2015, the counts as of that date were collected. Four-year institutions used 2009 as the cohort year, while less-than-4-year institutions used 2012 as the cohort year. Of the 6,353 institutions that were expected to respond to the Graduation Rates component, responses were missing for 4 institutions, resulting in a response rate that rounded to 100 percent. The 2015-16 Graduation Rates 200 Percent component was designed to combine information reported in a prior collection via the Graduation Rates component with current information about the same cohort of students. From previously collected data, the following elements were obtained: the number of students entering the institution as full-time, first-time degree/certificateseeking students in a cohort year; the number of students in this cohort completing within 100 and 150 percent of normal program completion time; and the number of cohort exclusions (such as students who left for military service). Then the count of additional cohort exclusions and additional program completers between 151 and 200 percent of normal program completion time was collected. Four-year institutions reported on bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking students and used cohort year 2007 as the reference period, while less-than-4-year institutions reported on all students in the cohort and used cohort year 2011 as the reference period. Of the 5,869 institutions that were expected to respond to the Graduation Rates 200 Percent component, responses were missing for 4 institutions, resulting in a response rate that rounded to 100 percent. Beginning with the fall 1986 survey and the introduction of IPEDS (see above), the survey was redesigned. The survey allows (in alternating years) for the collection of age and residence data. Beginning in 2000, the survey collected instructional activity and unduplicated headcount data, which are needed to compute a standardized, full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollment statistic for the entire academic year. As of 2007-08, the timeliness of the instructional activity data has been improved by collecting these data in the fall as part of the 12-Month Enrollment component instead of in the spring as part of the Fall Enrollment component. The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Data Quality Study (NCES 2005-175) showed that public institutions made the majority of changes to enrollment data during the 2004 revision period. The majority of changes were made to unduplicated headcount data, with the net differences between the original data and the revised data at about 1 percent. Part-time students in general and enrollment in private not-for-profit institutions were often underestimated. The fewest changes by institutions were to Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code data. (The CIP is a taxonomic coding scheme that contains titles and descriptions of primarily postsecondary instructional programs.)

Substantial changes were made in the financial survey instruments in fiscal year (FY) 1976, FY 1982, FY 1987, FY 1997, and FY 2002. While these changes were significant, considerable effort has been made to present only comparable information on trends in this report and to note inconsistencies. The FY 1976 survey instrument contained numerous revisions to earlier survey forms, which made direct comparisons of line items very difficult. Beginning in FY 1982, Pell Grant data were collected in the categories of federal restricted grant and contract revenues and restricted scholarship and fellowship expenditures. The introduction of IPEDS in the FY 1987 survey included several important changes to the survey instrument and data processing procedures. Beginning in FY 1997, data for private institutions were collected using new financial concepts consistent with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) reporting standards, which provide a more comprehensive view of college finance activities. The data for public institutions continued to be collected using the older survey form. The data for public and private institutions were no longer comparable and, as a result, no longer presented together in analysis tables. In FY 2001, public institutions had the option of either continuing to report using Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) standards or using the new FASB reporting standards. Beginning in FY 2002, public institutions had the option of using either the original GASB standards, the FASB standards, or the new GASB Statement 35 standards (GASB35). Possible sources of nonsampling error in the financial statistics include nonresponse, imputation, and misclassification. The unweighted response rate has been about 85 to 90 percent for most years these data appeared in NCES reports; however, in more recent years, response rates have been much higher because Title IV institutions are required to respond. Since 2002, the IPEDS data collection has been a full-scale web-based collection, which has improved the quality and timeliness of the data. For example, the ability of IPEDS to tailor online data entry forms for each institution based on characteristics such as institutional control, level of institution, and calendar system and the institutions' ability to submit their data online are aspects of full-scale web-based collections that have improved response. and winter collections begin on the same date, but the reporting deadline for the spring collection is several weeks later than the reporting deadline for the winter collection)."}, {"section_title": "IPEDS Collection Years 2012-13 and Later", "text": "In "}, {"section_title": "IPEDS Collection Years Prior to 2012-13", "text": "In collection years before 2001-02, IPEDS conducted a Fall Staff survey and a Salaries survey; in the 2001-02 collection year, the Employees by Assigned Position survey was added to IPEDS.

Participants include students who do not receive aid and those who do receive financial aid. Since NPSAS identifies nationally representative samples of student subpopulations of interest to policymakers and obtains baseline data for longitudinal study of these subpopulations, data from the study provide the base-year sample for the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) longitudinal study and the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) longitudinal study. Originally, NPSAS was conducted every 3 years. Beginning with the 1999-2000 study (NPSAS:2000), NPSAS has been conducted every 4 years.

An evaluation of past projections revealed that, at the elementary and secondary level, projections of enrollments have been quite accurate: mean absolute percentage differences for enrollment ranged from 0.3 to 1.3 percent for projections from 1 to 5 years in the future, while those for teachers The CRDC has generally been conducted biennially in each of the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The 2009-10 CRDC was collected from a sample of approximately 7,000 school districts and over 72,000 schools in those districts. It was made up of two parts: part 1 contained beginning-of-year \"snapshot\" data and part 2 contained cumulative, or end-of-year, data. The 2011-12 CRDC survey, which collected data from approximately 16,500 school districts and 97,000 schools, was the first CRDC survey since 2000 that included data from every public school district and school in the nation. The 2013-14 CRDC survey also collected information from a universe of every public school district and school in the nation. Since all participants in programs for persons with disabilities are reported to OSEP, the data are not subject to sampling error. However, nonsampling error can arise from a variety of sources. Some states only produce counts of students receiving special education services by disability category because Part B of the EHA requires it. In those states that typically produce counts of students receiving special education services by disability category without regard to EHA requirements, definitions and labeling practices vary.

Aggregated over time, these data serve as a replacement for the Long Form of the Decennial Census. The survey includes questions mandated by federal law, federal regulations, and court decisions.

A The Condition of Education 2017 | 318 Guide to Sources larger proportion of addresses in small governmental units (e.g., American Indian reservations, small counties, and towns) also receive the survey. The monthly sample size is designed to approximate the ratio used in the 2000 Census, which requires more intensive distribution in these areas. The ACS covers the U.S. resident population, which includes the entire civilian, noninstitutionalized population; incarcerated persons; institutionalized persons; and the active duty military who are in the United States. In 2006, the ACS began interviewing residents in group quarter facilities. Institutionalized group quarters include adult and juvenile correctional facilities, nursing facilities, and other health care facilities. Noninstitutionalized group quarters include college and university housing, military barracks, and other noninstitutional facilities such as workers and religious group quarters and temporary shelters for the homeless.

The CPS is the primary source of labor force statistics on the U.S. noninstitutionalized population (e.g., it excludes military personnel and their families living on bases and inmates of correctional institutions). In addition, supplemental questionnaires are used to provide further information about the U.S. population. The March supplement (also known as the Annual Social and Economic [ASEC] supplement) contains detailed questions on topics such as income, employment, and educational attainment; additional questions, such as items on disabilities, have also been included. In the July supplement, items on computer and internet use are the principal focus. The October supplement also contains some questions about computer and internet use, but most of its questions relate to school enrollment and school characteristics. The current sample design, introduced in July 2001, includes about 72,000 households. Each month about 58,900 of the 72,000 households are eligible for interview, and of those, 7 to 10 percent are not interviewed because of temporary absence or unavailability. Information is obtained each month from those in the household who are 15 years of age and over, and demographic data are collected for children 0-14 years of age. In addition, supplemental questions regarding school enrollment are asked about eligible household members age 3 and over A major redesign of the CPS was implemented in January 1994 to improve the quality of the data collected. Survey questions were revised, new questions were added, and computer-assisted interviewing methods were used for the survey data collection. Further information about the redesign is available in Current Population Survey, October 1995: (School Enrollment Supplement) Technical Documentation at http://www.census.gov/prod/techdoc/ cps/cpsoct95.pdf. Caution should be used when comparing data from 1994 through 2001 with data from 1993 and earlier. Data from 1994 through 2001 reflect 1990 census-based population controls, while data from 1993 and earlier reflect 1980 or earlier census-based population controls. Changes in population controls generally have relatively little impact on summary measures such as means, medians, and percentage distributions; they can, however, have a significant impact on population counts. For example, use of the 1990 census-based population controls resulted in about a 1 percent increase in the civilian noninstitutional population and in the number of families and households. Thus, estimates of levels for data collected in 1994 and later years will differ from those for earlier years by more than what could be attributed to actual changes in the population. These differences could be disproportionately greater for certain subpopulation groups than for the total population. Beginning in 2003, the race/ethnicity questions were expanded. Information on people of Two or more races were included, and the Asian and Pacific Islander race category was split into two categories-Asian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. In addition, questions were reworded to make it clear that self-reported data on race/ethnicity should reflect the race/ethnicity with which the responder identifies, rather than what may be written in official documentation. The estimation procedure employed for monthly CPS data involves inflating weighted sample results to independent estimates of characteristics of the civilian noninstitutional population in the United States by age, sex, and race. These independent estimates are based on statistics from decennial censuses; statistics on births, deaths, immigration, and emigration; and statistics on the population in the armed services. Generalized standard error tables are provided in the Current Population Reports; methods for deriving standard errors can be found within the CPS technical documentation at http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technicaldocumentation/complete.html.

This report includes data from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 collections. The 1989 data are not included in this report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS. The SCS was designed to assist policymakers, as well as academic researchers and practitioners at federal, state, and local levels, to make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The survey asks students a number of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on the school bus, or on the way to or from school. Students are asked additional questions about security measures used by their school, students' participation in after-school activities, students' perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school. Students are also asked attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at school. The SCS survey was conducted for a 6-month period from January through June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity variable beginning in 2003). Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were those household members who had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview, were enrolled in grades 6-12, and were not home schooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was changed and household members who attended school sometime during the school year of the interview were included. The age range of students covered in this report is 12-18 years of age. Eligible respondents were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their entire NCVS interview. It should be noted that the first or unbounded NCVS interview has always been included in analysis of the SCS data and may result in the reporting of events outside of the requested reference period. The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 was calculated by using NCVS incident variables appended to the SCS data files of the same year. The NCVS type The Condition of Education 2017 | 324 Guide to Sources of crime variable was used to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident happened (at school) and what the victim was doing when it happened (attending school or on the way to or from school) were used to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. Only incidents that occurred inside the United States are included. In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, \"at school\" was defined for respondents as in the school building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the definition for \"at school\" was changed to mean in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order to be consistent with the definition of \"at school\" as it is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the definition in subsequent SCS collections. Cognitive interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the definition of \"at school\" would not have a substantial impact on the estimates. In terms of the numbers of students participating in the SCS in recent years, 6,300 participated in 2005, 6,500 participated in 2007, 5,000 participated in 2009, 6,500 in 2011, 5,700 in 2013, and 4,700 in 2015. In the 2005,2007,2009,2011,2013, and 2015 SCS, the household completion rates were 91 percent, 90 percent, 92 percent, 91 percent, 86 percent, and 83 percent, respectively, and the student completion rates were 62 percent, 58 percent, 56 percent, 63 percent, 60 percent, and 58 percent, respectively. The overall SCS unit response rates (calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student completion rate) were about 56 percent in 2005, 53 percent in 2007, 51 percent in 2009, 57 percent in 2011, 51 percent in 2013, and 48 percent in 2015. (Starting in 2011, overall SCS unit response rates are weighted.) There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. NCES requires that any stage of data collection within a survey that has a unit base-weighted response rate of less than 85 percent be evaluated for the potential magnitude of unit nonresponse bias before the data or any analysis using the data may be released (NCES Statistical Standards, 2002, at https://nces. ed.gov/statprog/2002/std4_4.asp). Due to the low unit response rate in 2005,2007,2009,2011,2013, and 2015, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done. Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different from the respondents. In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates and responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has four key student or school characteristic variables for which data are known for respondents and nonrespondents-sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity-all of which are associated with student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern. In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias for the race, household income, and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households with an income of $35,000-$49,999 and $50,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500-$14,999, $15,000-$24,999, and $25,000-$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates, should have reduced the problem. In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower response rates than other races/ethnicities. Respondents from households with an income of $25,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $25,000. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates.
