[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Information on fertilizer use commonly is needed in investigations of surface and ground water quality and particularly in investigations of the variability of surface and groundwater nutrient concentrations over time and space. To date, information on fertilizer use taken from annual reports by the Department of .Agriculture (1966, 1976, (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) has been available only at the state level, which does not provide enough spatial detail for most water-quality investigations. Moreover, state-level fertilizer use data from the Department of Agriculture is currently difficult to'use for water-quality investigations because of the limited availability of data in a machine-readable form.\nThe purpose of this report is to document the compilation of machine-readable estimates of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use by county for the period 1945 to 1985. The technique used to disaggregate state-level fertilizer use data to the county level is described in detail. Numerical values of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use by county are not presented in the text of this report because of the size of the data file, but may be obtained in machine-readable form upon request. 1 Several graphical summaries of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use are provided to give a general impression of the spatial and temporal variability that exist in the data."}, {"section_title": "DATA SOURCES AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "FERTILIZER USE DATA", "text": "State-level information on the use of nitrogen (as N) and phosphorus (as in fertilizer products were obtained from the U.

Fertilizer use data for the states and years listed in Table 1 reflect these types of problems. For states with annual fertilizer use data that were incomplete, the SRS estimated current use from the previous year's use data as well as from any monthly data that may have been available for the current year. Annual survey data (as described above) were also used by SRS to supplement state fertilizer use data that was found to be incomplete."}, {"section_title": "FERTILIZED ACREAGE DATA", "text": "Estimates of county fertilized acreage compiled as part of the 1974, 1978, and 1982 Census of Agriculture were obtained from the U.

In responding to the Census, farm operators with annual sales in excess of $1000 were requested to report the total amount of acreage including cropland, pastureland, and rangeland that was treated with fertilizer chemicals. Farm acreage that received multiple fertilizer treatments was to be reported only once in the Census."}, {"section_title": "COUNTY DISAGGREGATION OF STATE-LEVEL FERTILIZER USE DATA", "text": "The method used here for disaggregation of state-level fertilizer use assumes that county-level fertilizer use is directly proportional to the amount of fertilized acreage present within counties. Thus, state-level fertilizer use was (1966, 1976, (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) Because of the availability of only three annual estimates (1974, 1978, 1982) of county fertilized acreage, state-level fertilizer use was disaggregated to the county level by using fertilized acreage data that most closely corresponded in time to the fertilizer use data. The temporal correspondence of fertilizer use and fertilized acreage data that was used to estimate county-level fertilizer use is shown in Table 2 . 1945-1976 1974 1977-1980 1978 1981 -1985________________1982____________ 1 U.

This is especially true in those states where the amount of fertilized acreage in 1974 is believed to be significantly different than existed in years prior to this date."}, {"section_title": "Fertilizer Use1_________Fertilized Acreage2_____", "text": "Although state-level fertilizer use data reported by USDA (1966, 1976, (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) should generally include farm and non-farm uses of fertilizer, this data was disaggregated to U. S. counties in proportion to only reported county farm uses of fertilizer chemicals. Consequently, this disaggregation method underestimates fertilizer use in those counties with large non-farm fertilizer uses.\nIn general, the accuracy of the county-level estimates of fertilizer use is potentially affected by differences that may exist in fertilizer application rates among counties. For a given state, the degree of proportionality between county fertilized acreage and fertilizer use is dependent upon the magnitude of differences in fertilizer application rates among counties. Intrastate variability in fertilizer application rates, which should generally reflect variability in nutrient requirements of different crops, would be expected to be smaller (and estimates of county fertilizer use more accurate) in those states where crop types are not very diverse or where crop types are uniformly distributed throughout the state.\nEvaluation of the accuracy of the disaggregation method in light of these factors requires information on county-level crop types and acreages as well as estimates of typical fertilizer application rates for various crop types. Because this information was not readily available during the preparation of the report, this analysis was not undertaken. Improvements in the accuracy of county fertilizer use could probably be attained in future studies with the use of an algorithm that disaggregates state-level fertilizer use according to estimated fertilized acreage and fertilizer application rates in counties."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "County-level estimates of nitrogen (as N) and phosphorus (as P) fertilizer use (expressed as kilograms per year) were generated according to the above methods, and are available in machine-readable form upon request.2 Counties are identified by the standard FIPS code designation in the files. Data for Alaska and Hawaii are not included as part of these files.\nSeveral graphical summaries of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use are provided as examples of the spatial and temporal variability that exist in the data. County maps of estimated nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use are shown in figures 1 and 2, respectively, for the year 1985. County nitrogen fertilizer use for 1985 is mostly between 640,000 kilograms per year (25th percentile) and 4.7 million kilograms per year (75th percentile) with a median of nearly 2 million kilograms per year (see Figure 3) . County phosphorus fertilizer use for 1985 is typically about 15 percent of that estimated for nitrogen. Phosphorus fertilizer use for 1985 ranged mostly from 128,000 kilograms per year to 833,000 kilograms per year with a median of 272,OOC> kilograms per year. Nationally, the spatial pattern of fertilizer use for 1985 is very similar for nitrogen and phosphorus (see Figure 1 and 2). As expected, the highest fertilizer use was observed in those states with the greatest amounts of cropland. These included states in the northern portions of the Midwest, many throughout the Central Plains, and several in the extreme western and northwestern portions of the U.S. State estimates of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application rates were computed for 1982 as the ratio of state fertilizer use to state fertilized acreage. These application rates are displayed in Figure 6 and 7 and expressed as kilograms per acre. Estimated nitrogen fertilizer application rates ranged from a minimum of 20 kilograms per acre to a maximum of 90 kilograms per acre with a median of 40 kilograms per acre. The highest nitrogen application rates are found in states in the northern midwest, central plains, and far west. Estimated phosphorus fertilizer application rates ranged from a minimum of 4 kilograms per acre to a maxium of 24 kilograms per acre with a median of 9 kilograms per "}]
