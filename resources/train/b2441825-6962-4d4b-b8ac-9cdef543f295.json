[{"section_title": "", "text": "'What do schoolteachers and Sumo wrestlers have in common?\" \"How is the Ku Klux Klan like a group of real-estate agents?\" \"Why do drug dealers still live with their Moms?\" These intriguing questions are the titles of the first three chapters of the thought-provoking book Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything, written by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. I Levitt is a young economics professor at the University of Chicago who has a penchant for doing things that are not usually thought of as being done by an economist. He looks into all kinds of social issues and believes real answers may be found if one collects enough data.\nOne of the topics that interested me most was his chapter on what makes a perfect parent. Concerned parents want to provide their children with the tools and experiences to make them smart, successful, and happy adults, so whether they are fetuses, little tikes, or schoolchildren their days are crammed full from music in the womb to every sort of lesson and sports activity starting at birth and lasting until they escape home and go off to centers of higher learning. But does it work?\nIn the 1990s the US Department of Education started a project called the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) wherein the academic performance of 20 000 children was measured from kindergarten through fifth grade. A mountain of other data about the children and their families was gathered by survey. The ECLS data show that 8 factors are strongly correlated with test scores, either positively or negatively: highly educated parents (positive), parents with high socioeconomic status (positive), a mother aged 30 years or more when her first child was born (positive), low birth weight (negative), parents speaking English in the home (positive), the child is adopted (negative), parents are active in the school's Parent Teacher Association (positive), and the presence of many books in the home (positive).\nThe ECLS data also show that 8 factors are not correlated with test scores, some of which are contrary to \"accepted\" wisdom. They are the child's family is intact and has 2 parents, the family recently moved into a better neighborhood, mother did not work between birth and kindergarten, the child attended a Head Start program, parents regularly take children to museums, the parents use regular spanking for discipline, the child frequently watches television, and the parents read to the child nearly every day.\nAs far as children's achievement is concerned, what the parents are is important (educated, of higher economic status, speak English in the home, older, have an interest in the child's school, and buyers of books), and many of the things they do are not (putting child in Head Start, scheduling cultural enrichment outings, spanking, allowing television watching, and daily reading.) Some of us will take comfort in the article and letter to the editor by Coldiron that appear in this issue of the Journal, and some of us will be distressed by them (see pages 179-189 and 215, the announcement of the California Court decision on p. 167). There is no doubt that patient safety is a very important subject for medical organizations, legislatures, and regulatory bodies. And there is no doubt that there is a turf war in medicine between general plastic surgeons and dermatologists and other cosmetic surgeons. In his article, Coldiron updates data gathered from the state of Florida on patient deaths and hospital transfers resulting from outpatient surgery. He has carefully ascertained the surgeon's specialty, board certification status, and the presence or absence of hospital privileges, as well as the accreditation of the surgical facility. It is clear that plastic surgeons account for the overwhelming majority of misadventures, be they deaths or complications serious enough to require hospitalization.\nFor one cosmetic procedure, liposuction, a report of data obtained from the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery shockingly shows that board-certified plastic surgeons in North America performing liposuction under sedation or general anesthesia have a mortality rate of 1 in 5000, which is greater than the fatality rate for motor vehicle crashes in the United States.\" On the other hand, dermatologists performing liposuction under tumescent local anesthesia have a mortality rate of essentially zero. 3 It is as though plastic surgeons are telling the world, \"We told you this liposuction business is so dangerous that only plastic surgeons should be allowed to do it.\" But I predict Levitt would say, \"If you collect enough data, the real answers are found. The data show that plastic surgeons are so dangerous that only a dermatologist should be allowed to perform liposuction, provided it is done under tumescent local anesthesia.\"\nThe American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery Vol. 23, No.4, 2006 Just as in raising children, for liposuction it is what one is that is important. For patient safety, if one is a dermatologist performing liposuction under tumescent local anesthesia, then that is statistically good. If one is a plastic surgeon performing liposuction under sedation or general anesthesia, then that is statistically bad.\nMany specialties have liposuction in their armamentarium. We are doing cosmetic surgery. Thus, what we are (a cosmetic surgeon performing liposuction under tumescent local anesthesia) is the more important factor.\nNoone is suggesting that an attempt should be made to limit what plastic surgeons do. I trust that legislative and regulatory bodies will see the irrationality of attempting to limit what dermatologists do when the evidence so clearly indicates the contrary."}]
