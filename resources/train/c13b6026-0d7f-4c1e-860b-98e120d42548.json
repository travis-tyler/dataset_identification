Thus, they concluded that sampling Koreans with the single surname Kim can produce a representative sample of the Korean American population. This study extends Shin and Yu's work in three ways. First, we use more recent Korean survey data to show that not only Kim but also other common Korean surnames remain distributed evenly across Korea without geographic variation. Then, using Korean census microdata, we show that sociodemographic characteristics also do not vary by surname. Next, we use the 2005 Korean Retirement and Income Study (KReIS) to compare Kims to others in terms of health and attitude variables not available in the census. Finally, we examine the U.S. Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) to determine whether sociodemographic characteristics differ for Kims compared to other Korean surnames and how both compare to Koreans without Korean surnames. Specifically, this article seeks to determine whether it is appropriate to sample on a limited basis of surnames, such as Kim only or a limited set of surnames, instead of a more complete list that might include names that are less specifically Korean and less frequent, potentially increasing the survey cost. It also aims to understand the extent to which surname sampling results in a representative and unbiased sample of individuals with Korean ancestry in the United States."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data and Analysis", "text": "The Korean 1985 Census microdata (N \u00bc 1,044,742) are used to examine the geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic status of persons with the five most common Korean surnames (Kim, Lee, Park, Choi, and Chung). Although the data are not recent, the report from the Korean National Statistical Office for the 2000 census shows a similar distribution of last names (see Table 1). Data currently available from the 2000 Census only allow a comparison of geography. We found almost no variation by region and urbanicity for the five most common surnames in 2000. With the 1985 Korean Census microdata, we first examine whether various sociodemographic variables are associated with specific surnames in Korea. The KReIS is a longitudinal study conducted in 2005, 2007, and 2009. The study aims to understand health insurance, employment, pension, savings, inheritance, wealth, family relationships, and life satisfaction. The first wave interviewed 8,684 individuals from 5,109 households and included those aged 50 and over. To test differences in the level of these items between Kims and non-Kims, independent sample t-tests were utilized for nine-item life satisfaction questions (5-point Likert-type scale) on home environment, neighborhood, economic situation, relationship with friends, family relationship, spouse relationship, work, health, and life in general. The life satisfaction questions are the only attitude items in the survey. There were also questions on self-rated physical and mental health (5-point Likert-type scale), number of household members, and subjective life expectancy. The SED is an annual census of all new research doctorate recipients from accredited U.S. institutions; for our analysis, we used cumulative SED data up to fiscal year 2009. The survey is sponsored by six federal agencies, and the cumulative file (from 1920 to 2009) includes about 1.9 million records. It has 131 variables, including birth place, citizenship status, field, and doctoral institutions (see 2009 report from http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ nsf11306/ for more detailed information). For the sake of confidentiality and privacy of doctorate recipients, the National Science Foundation (NSF) allowed only the last name to be linked to other data. Of the 1.9 million records, the top five foreign birthplaces are China (4.3%), India (2.6%),  Korea 2003). Surnames that occur in Korea, and also among non-Korean Asians or non-Asians (i.e., Lee), are considered to be Korean surnames. With the SED, we examine whether the proportion and sociodemographic characteristics of Kims and non-Kim Koreans are similar by citizenship status. We also examine Korean married women's surnames to find out the proportion of married women with Korean surnames."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Koreans in Korea", "text": "The distribution of surnames in Korea is highly concentrated in a few names. Table 1 shows the distribution of the 10 most frequent Korean surnames in the three Korean data sources: the 1985 and 2000 censuses and the KRelS 2005 study of older Koreans. The two censuses show the same order of the 10 most common surnames, and there is just a small difference in order in the KRels in ranks 6 through 10. In all three, Kim is the most common surname. In Korea, according to the 2000Korean Census (Statistics Korea 2003, there are 728 surnames (286 among Korean citizens and 442 among naturalized Korean citizens), but the top 10 surnames comprise 64% of the Korean population, and Kim alone comprises 22% of the Korean population. This is a much higher concentration of surnames compared to the United States, where the top 10 surnames comprise only 5% of the population (calculated using top 10 surnames provided by http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/2000surnames/ index.html divided by the U.S. 2000 Census population of 281,421,906). Using the Korean 1985 Census microdata (N \u00bc 1,044,742), Table 2 shows the geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic status of persons with the five most common Korean surnames (Kim, Lee, Park, Choi, and Chung) compared to all Koreans. For persons with each of the five surnames, we compare the proportions in categories defined by gender, marital status, education, work status, home ownership, religion, urbanicity, and province. We find very little variation across categories for the different surnames. For example, 31.0% of the entire population is single. That percentage only varies from 30.6% of Chungs to 31.2% of Lees. Similarly, while 15.8% of the entire population is Protestant, the percentage only varies from 14.8% of Chungs to 15.9% of Kims and Chois. There is slightly greater evidence of geographic variation, but the percentage living in urban locations ranges from just 64.9% of Chungs to 65.7% of Lees. As indicated in Table 3, we found no significant differences between persons with the surname Kim and all other surnames (non-Kim) in terms of diverse indicators of attitudes and health. These results suggest that Kim sampling would yield a highly representative study population in terms of all of the variables we have examined. There may be differences for some other survey domains that we did not examine or were not included in this survey, but this seems unlikely."}, {"section_title": "Koreans and Korean Americans in the United States", "text": "We use the Frequently Occurring Surnames category from the 2000 U.S. Census, which provides information about how specific surnames are distributed across racial categories (see File A: Top 1,000 names from http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/2000surnames/index.html) to examine the racial and Hispanic distribution of the surname Kim and other common Korean surnames and their frequency. This list uses the broad ''Asian and Pacific Islander'' race category and does not include the Asian ethnic subgroups (such as Korean or Chinese). When we examine the five most common surnames in Korea (Lee, Kim, Park, Chung, and Choi) in the United States, only three of them are specifically Asian, and more than 90% belong to the Asian and Pacific Islander category (Kim, Choi, and Chung). Forty percent of Lees and 30% of Parks are non-Hispanic white. Kim is by far the most frequent of the three common Korean surnames, with 194,067 occurrences in the 2000 Census. Ninety-five percent of Kims report Asian and Pacific Islander race only. We can estimate the percentage of the U.S. Korean population named Kim using the total number who identified as Korean in the census. Barnes and Bennett (2002) reported that 1,076,872 persons indicated a single Asian group of Korean in the 2000 U.S. Census. If we assume that Kims identified as non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islander only represent 95% of all Kims, then Kims are about 17% of the total Korean American population ((194,067/1,076,872) \u00c2 0.95), which is smaller than the 22% with surname Kim in the Korean Census, but still substantial. Table 4 presents the distribution of the 10 most frequent surnames by citizenship status among Koreans (persons born in Korea or with Korean citizenship) earning doctoral degrees in the United States; these data can be used as an indicator of whether surnames are associated with immigration. The surname distribution is very similar for Korean citizens and Korean permanent residents in the United States, with the percentage of Kims (20%) being just slightly lower than for the entire population in Korea (22%). For the three most common surnames, there is a consistent pattern of somewhat lower percentages among U.S. citizens than Korean citizens (regardless of whether or not they are U.S. permanent residents). Several factors may contribute to this difference. This may reflect in part intermarriage with non-Koreans in the United States, either in the parent generation (for men or women) or in the current generation (for women). Another factor is the adoption of Korean children by non-Koreans in the United States.   Note: For a few of the surnames, differences between this list and the Korean census could in part reflect some heterogeneity of Romanization in the United States. For example, Im is the 10th most common surname in the Korean Census, but may be spelled in English as Im, Lim, or Yim. When we examine whether the top 10 surname distribution differs for males and females among Korean U.S. citizens and permanent residents in the SED (Table 4), there is little difference among male citizens (53%), male permanent residents (58%), and female permanent residents (55%). However, there is a 10% difference between men and women (53% vs. 43%) who are citizens. This difference is likely due to Korean women's out-group marriage with a last name change, or greater numbers of adoptions for Korean girls than boys among non-Koreans in the United States. For Korean men, about 5.3% have non-Korean names (not shown in the table: 4% non-Asian names, 0.1% two names, and 1.2% non-Korean Asian names). For Korean women, about 20% have non-Korean names (16% non-Asian names; 2.8% for two names, and 0.9% for non-Korean Asian names). If it is rare for men to change their surname, we may attribute the male non-Korean names to adoptions. There were at least 100,000 Korean children adopted by Americans in recent decades (see Kim 1995 and http://adoption.state.gov/abou-t_us/statistics.php). Some of the adoptive families were Korean. Table 5 compares sociodemographic characteristics for Koreans who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents in the SED by surname: Kim, non-Kim Korean names, and non-Korean names. Kims and non-Kim Korean names are similar in terms of age, number of children, father's education, mother's education, gender, and citizenship, while those with non-Korean surnames are quite different. Those with non-Korean surnames are more likely to have higher levels of father's and mother's education and are less likely to be married. The largest differences are gender and citizenship status: 73% of Kims are male versus 37% of Koreans with non-Korean names, and 41% of Kims are citizens versus 80% of those with non-Korean names."}, {"section_title": "Surnames of Married Women Who Are U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents", "text": "To gain some perspective on whether there is a trend in outmarriage or in name change with outmarriage, we categorized married women's last names by decade of graduation in the SED. Of the 1,509 married women who are either citizens or permanent residents (selected mainly by Korean birthplace), half of the married women received their doctoral degree in the 2000s, 28% in the 1990s, and 21% before 1990. When we look at the three categories, non-Korean surnames have increased slightly from 18% before 1990 to 24% in the 2000s. In other words, in the 2000s, women were more likely to have non-Korean surnames and less likely to have a Korean name Table 5.

This finding suggests that about 24% of Korean married women doctorates in the 2000s are not covered by Korean surname sampling. This percentage may not generalize to women with less education or to women who are second-generation or higher U.S. citizens. We also examined the distribution of Kim, non-Kim Korean, and non-Korean surnames, by high school country among married Korean women in the SED. The married women who went to high school in the United States or other foreign countries are less likely to have a Korean last name compared to those who went to high school in Korea: 62% of Korean women who went to high school in the United States, 68% of those who went to high school in foreign countries, and 87% of those who went to high school in Korea. In other words, the surname sampling based on Korean surnames may be biased against Korean women who grew up in the United States."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We have used several new data sources in Korea and in the United States to evaluate surname sampling of Korean populations. Shin and Yu (1984) proposed sampling Koreans by simply selecting those with the surname Kim, and this sampling has facilitated a number of studies of Korean Americans (Hovey et al. 2006;Min 1990;Min and Kim 2009b;Sohn and Harada 2004). First, we extend Shin and Yu's work by demonstrating that not only Kim but indeed any of the five most common Korean surnames would produce highly representative samples in Korea in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and attitudes, which had not previously been compared by surname. In the United States, we found that Kim sampling produces a representative sample of Korean Americans among those who have a Korean surname. While Kim sampling generates a sample of Korean American men that appears to be representative of the target population, there is an important limitation to surname sampling for Korean American women: American-born or American-raised women will be underrepresented. Although our evaluation of surnames in Korea provides strong evidence that surnames are unrelated to sociodemographic, psychological, and health characteristics in Korea, there are limitations to the analyses of Korean Americans. The SED is not an ideal data source to study Korean Americans because highly educated individuals may not be generalizable to the larger population and because there is no indicator of Korean ancestry or ethnicity except for Korean birth and citizenship. We include citizenship status because there are some persons born in the United States who choose to retain Korean citizenship. Although this is an unusual data source, there is no reason to expect that educational attainment is itself related to surname. Unfortunately, there are no publicly available data in the United States that include surnames and detailed race/ethnicity and also have sufficient numbers of Koreans. Surnames are unavailable in public data because they are treated as highly sensitive data. The SED is not publicly available. The limitations of surname identification for Korean American women are both that a smaller proportion of the target population can be identified and there is the potential for selection bias by nativity. Intermarriage rates are very high for Asian women who grew up in the United States. Le (2012) estimated marriage rates within the same ethnic group for ''U.S.-raised Asians'' (born in the United States or living in the United States by age 13): 71% of Indian women, 52% of Chinese women, 37% of Filipino women, 49% of Japanese women, 35% of Korean women, and 56% of Vietnamese women. Generally consistent figures were calculated for U.S.-born Asian American women born since 1965: 40% of Koreans, 40% of Chinese, 33% of Filipinos, 71% of Indians, 29% of Japanese, and 60% of Vietnamese married within their ethnic group (Min and Kim 2009a). Thus, both estimates suggest that more than half of Korean American women born or raised in the United States marry non-Koreans, but the extent of name change with intermarriage is not known. Despite the limitations of the SED, it does provide an estimate of how much surname sampling underrepresents women. Both outmarriage and name-changing behavior may vary by social, economic, and geographic factors. For U.S.born women, there is evidence of education effects on name changing: Using the 2004 American Community Survey (48,459), Gooding and Kreider (2009) showed that 94% of women have the same surname as their husbands, but that surname similarity varies by education: 96% of high school graduates, 94% of BAs, 88% of MAs, and 67% of doctoral degree holders have the same surname as their husbands. Given that they focused on U.S.born women, as far as we know, there is no information about surnames of foreign-born women in the United States. We found that only 60% of married Korean women earning doctorates who went to high school in the United States have a Korean surname. The future utility of surname sampling is largely dependent on a number of social factors: the marital exogamy of Korean American men and women, the aging population of Korean women who married U.S. servicemen in Korea, the number of adopted children, and the number of children of out-group married women. The underrepresentation of out-group married women has implications for all surname sampling, such as Nguyen for Vietnamese (Falkenstein 2002;Taylor et al. 2011). To reduce the underrepresentation of out-group married women when surname sampling an ethnic minority, we may consider using middle names or hypernetwork sampling. Many women keep their maiden name as a middle name, and these data are available in some administrative data sources or computer files that allow access by all of the name components. Hypernetwork sampling may be another option because older individuals are less likely to use cell phones and therefore more likely to be in a directory. A researcher could identify them and ask about their children. While this may be a relatively efficient strategy for finding intermarried women, it would differentially identify second-or higher generation women. Historically, surname sampling has been most often used for telephone surveys using directories. The increasing number of cell phone-only households severely limits the coverage of telephone directories. A recent report shows that 34% of U.S. households are wireless telephone-only households, and there are marked differences among age groups, with about 60% of aged 25-29 and only 9% of aged 65 and over in wireless-only households (Blumberg and Luke 2012). Surname sampling may be used in other contexts, though, where this is not a problem, such as administrative or health care files. In theory, there may be one other practical concern for Kim sampling. If the Kims with landlines are repeatedly interviewed, it could eventually lead to respondent fatigue and lower response rates. However, the Korean American population is not so small that the same individuals are likely to be repeatedly sampled. This is not a problem for administrative data uses of surname sampling because individuals are not contacted. Surname sampling has contributed to the study of smaller immigrant groups, avoiding the limitations of using nonprobability samples. Since the development of surname lists for sampling is itself a complicated research project with limited data sources available, one-name sampling is an attractive alternative when it can yield an adequate number of individuals. For Koreans, Kim sampling is an efficient strategy that appears to produce a sample representative of Korean American men, as does a larger set of common Korean surnames. The serious limitation for all surname sampling of Asian Americans is the underrepresentation of outmarried women, since Korean women without Korean surnames differ in key demographic characteristics from women with Korean surnames. Given slowing immigration from Korea to the United States, a growing proportion of Korean Americans born in the United States, and increasing outgroup marriage, this limitation may become an insurmountable obstacle to surname sampling for surveys, but may be less of an issue for the use of administrative data when maiden names or middle names can be identified in the data."}]
