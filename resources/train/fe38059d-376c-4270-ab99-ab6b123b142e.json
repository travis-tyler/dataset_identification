Although the causative gene, COL3A1, was identified >20 years ago, there has been limited progress in understanding the disease mechanisms or identifying treatments. Methods and Results-We studied inflammatory and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling biomarkers in plasma and from dermal fibroblasts from patients with VEDS. Analyses were done in terms of clinical disease severity, genotype-phenotype correlations, and body composition and fat deposition alterations. VEDS subjects had increased circulating TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and leptin and decreased interleukin-8 versus controls. VEDS dermal fibroblasts secreted more TGF-\u03b22, whereas downstream canonical/noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling was not different. Patients with COL3A1 exon skipping mutations had higher plasma intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and VEDS probands had abnormally high plasma C-reactive protein versus affected patients identified through family members before any disease manifestations. Patients with VEDS had higher mean platelet volumes, suggesting increased platelet turnover because of ongoing vascular damage, as well as increased regional truncal adiposity. Conclusions-These findings suggest that VEDS is a systemic disease with a major inflammatory component. C-reactive protein is linked to disease state and may be a disease activity marker. No changes in downstream TGF-\u03b2 signaling and increased platelet turnover suggest that chronic vascular damage may partially explain increased plasma TGF-\u03b21. Finally, we found a novel role for dysregulated TGF-\u03b22, as well as adipocyte dysfunction, as demonstrated through reduced interleukin-8 and elevated leptin in VEDS.

[14] [15] [16] 30, 31 However, features such as bifid uvula, hypertelorism, and craniosynostosis are not found in VEDS. TGF-\u03b22 deficiency is known to cause developmental defects involving the heart, lung, limb, spinal column, and craniofacial systems in animal models and inactivating mutations in TGFB2 lead to familial thoracic aortic aneurysm with paradoxically elevated TGF-\u03b22 in tissue. 15, 32, 33 We found that proinflammatory markers TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, MCP-1, CRP, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 were elevated, and IL-8 was decreased in circulation in VEDS subjects versus controls. No differences were found between probands and patients with VEDS who were identified through relatives and who had no complications themselves, indicating that elevated TGF-\u03b21 and -\u03b22 may correlate to having the disease but not necessarily to disease severity or activity. MPV, a platelet turnover indicator, was significantly increased in VEDS. TGF-\u03b21 is known to be abundant in platelets, 34 which was the rationale for performing measurements in platelet-free plasma. Ongoing microvascular damage, even in younger patients without complications, may lead to increased platelet turnover, degranulation, and subsequent TGF-\u03b21 release into circulation as recently described in a mouse model of cardiac pressure overload. 35 Interestingly, we found that CRP was not significantly elevated in MFS, suggesting a different biomarker profile from VEDS.\nCardiovascular medication use in patients with VEDS modulated TGF-\u03b21, MCP-1, CRP, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and leptin levels. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 correlated with VEDS severity. Although the exact role of these proteins is unclear, both markers are increased in atherosclerotic lesions in human coronary arteries, 36 indicating a role in injury response. MCP-1 mediates vascular inflammatory cell adhesion and contributes to neointimal hyperplasia in arterial injury. 37 Elevated CRP is seen in acquired autoimmune disorders and concentrations correlate with inflammation extent and severity. 38 Increased CRP has been found in patients with osteoarthritis and progressive joint damage, 39 as well as coronary disease. 40 We postulate that there is underlying chronic vascular damage in VEDS that alters the vascular environment and may lead to a state of systemic inflammation (MCP-1 and CRP elevation), which may contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. Although CRP levels did not correlate with mutation type, the significant increase in probands versus patients with ITFH suggests that CRP may be a disease activity indicator; therefore, monitoring CRP levels in patients with VEDS should be considered. If elevated, we would recommend shorter arterial surveillance intervals and a low threshold for working up new symptoms/signs with imaging studies. We would also recommend aggressively addressing all cardiovascular risk factors that increase aneurismal event risk (eg, elevated blood pressure, abnormal lipids, smoking) to improve outcomes.\nSecreted TGF-\u03b22, but not TGF-\u03b21, from VEDS fibroblasts was elevated versus controls. TGF-\u03b22 is much less abundant than TGF-\u03b21 in circulation and in tissues, 34 and the finding of excess circulating levels and increased secretion ex vivo in extracellular matrix-producing cells allows the possibility for a role of TGF-\u03b22 in VEDS pathogenesis, different from that of TGF-\u03b21. Interestingly, Western blot analysis of downstream TGF-\u03b2 biomarkers and mRNA analysis of TGF-\u03b2 pathway genes in fibroblasts did not reveal any differences between VEDS subjects and controls. Furthermore, treating fibroblasts of a patient with VEDS with allele-specific siRNA, which converted the gly-type mutation to a null-type, showed that suppressing the structurally abnormal type III collagen did not alter TGF-\u03b2 signaling downstream of the receptors. Dermal fibroblasts historically have been used to study VEDS because the disease has a strong skin phenotype, mimicking the fragility found in vascular tissues. Therefore, we found it noteworthy that the underlying genetic defect did not impair intracellular TGF-\u03b2 signaling in this setting when the expectation would be that it should. Although intracellular changes were not found in fibroblasts, it is possible that studying other cell types (eg, vascular smooth muscle) may demonstrate an effect. The lack of available direct tissue for study precluded the investigation of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 or downstream targets in VEDS arteries. However, this could be undertaken in the future, especially through development of an animal model recapitulating the vascular complications of VEDS, specifically, medium-sized artery aneurysms and dissections. An appropriate animal model does not currently exist.\nInterestingly, TGF-\u03b22 and IL-8 were the only analytes in plasma unaffected by the drug treatments. IL-8 was decreased in VEDS versus controls. IL-8 plays an important role in angiogenesis, 41, 42 and TGF-\u03b21 inhibits IL-8 secretion during active inflammation in the vascular endothelium, consistent with our findings. 43 A potential role for reduced IL-8 in VEDS and related aneurismal disorders is intriguing and warrants further study. Although the absence of modulation by cardiovascular medications suggests that TGF-\u03b22 and IL-8 may have intrinsic correlations to the disease, caution needs to be exercised in interpreting these data because the study design does not allow for a rigorous analysis of drug effects. Leptin levels were significantly increased (but adiponectin unchanged) in VEDS plasma. Body composition analysis showed that patients with VEDS have increased truncal fat mass versus controls. Excess TGF-\u03b21 release by human adipose tissue in obesity has been described but not TGF-\u03b22 44 ; however, our study subjects are not obese. In a recent study of an Italian VEDS cohort, a similar truncal fat distribution was seen versus controls, suggesting that this is not a diet-dependent effect. 45 In the general population, regional adiposity is known to be associated with arterial stiffness through the influence of leptin. 46 Abdominal adiposity markers have a graded and significant association with risk of stroke/transient ischemic attack. 47 In VEDS, the vascular condition is inborn and predates the fat deposition pattern. Although the sample size was small, we found a weak correlation between TGF-\u03b21 and trunk fat in patients who had an event. Therefore, it is possible that vascular inflammation is leading to the abnormal truncal fat accumulation rather than the reverse. However, a prospective study would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.\nThere are several limitations to this study. We used available dermal fibroblasts because an appropriate mouse model and arterial tissues were not available. Although we expect to see a phenotype in VEDS dermal fibroblasts, we acknowledge that other types of extracellular matrix-producing cells, such as vascular smooth muscle, may yield different results. A VEDS mouse model would permit a more thorough TGF-\u03b2 pathway examination at the tissue level, which again was not feasible with the study's limited human samples. Samples sizes were relatively limited in this study; therefore, analyses in a larger cohort are warranted to confirm the results. We were unable to perform uniform and exhaustive vascular imaging in all subjects to detect asymptomatic aneurysms or dissections; therefore, a rigorous correlation of vascular lesions with study biomarkers could not be done. Finally, fresh plasma samples, required for more accurate platelet turnover measurements compared with MPV values, were no longer available when we considered the possibility of excess platelet turnover as a source of elevated TGF-\u03b21.\nIn summary, we present evidence for changes in biomarker profiles in VEDS that include TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, MCP-1, CRP, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-8, and leptin. The absence of correlations with mutation type and disease severity for all but 1 (CRP) of the biomarkers studied suggests ongoing microvascular damage in patients with VEDS even in the absence of an event. TGF-\u03b22 and IL-8 are altered and not affected by current drug treatment and could underlie disease specificity, unlike TGF-\u03b21. The evidence for excess TGF-\u03b22 secretion from VEDS fibroblasts independent of the organismal milieu suggests a probable role. Regional truncal adiposity and elevated leptin in VEDS point to the role of microvascular damage in adipocyte deposition and dysfunction. Finally, these data represent the first evidence for a preinflammatory state in VEDS and, after validation in affected tissues, open the door to treatment strategies by targeting specific cytokine pathways."}, {"section_title": "CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE", "text": "We explored the role of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 pathway and other inflammatory biomarkers in plasma and dermal fibroblasts from patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (VEDS), which is caused by mutations in the COL3A1 gene.

VEDS subjects were found to have elevated transforming growth factor-\u03b21, transforming growth factor-\u03b22, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in circulation compared with controls. Adipocyte dysfunction in VEDS was demonstrated through elevated leptin and decreased interleukin-8 in circulation. Dermal fibroblasts from VEDS subjects secreted greater amounts of transforming growth factor-\u03b22 compared with controls. Patients with COL3A1 exon skipping mutations had higher plasma intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and VEDS probands had abnormally high plasma C-reactive protein compared with affected patients identified through family members before any disease manifestations. Patients with VEDS had higher mean platelet volumes, suggesting increased platelet turnover because of ongoing vascular damage, as well as increased regional truncal adiposity. C-reactive protein is linked to disease state and may be a disease activity marker. These findings suggest that VEDS is a systemic disease with a major inflammatory component, and the above biomarkers should be considered when assessing patients with VEDS in the clinic."}]
