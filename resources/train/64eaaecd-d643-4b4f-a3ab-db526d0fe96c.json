[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The price of attending a public college has increased markedly over the past several decades. Between 1985 and 2015, published tuition and fees at a typical 4-year public college increased from US$2,942 to US$9,500 in inflation-adjusted dollars-a 223% increase that far outpaced the small gains in real household income for most U.S. families (Ma, Baum, Pender, & Welch, 2016) . Although grant aid has also increased during this period, the real average net price of attending a 4-year public college (defined as the total cost of attendance less all grant aid) rose from US$11,662 to US$13,419 between 2000 and 2012, a 15% increase (authors' calculation using the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study). Approximately, 68% of students of bachelor degree completers who borrowed student loans had US$30,100 in debt in 2015, up more than 20% since 2006 (Cochrane & Cheng, 2016) . 1 One factor that is likely contributing to rising debt burdens is that students are taking longer to complete a bachelor's degree than in prior decades. Not only must students pay tuition for the additional semesters, they must also pay for the living expenses that make up a majority of the cost of attendance at 4-year public colleges (Kelchen, Goldrick-Rab, & Hosch, 2017) . In the 1972 cohort of high school graduates, 53% of BA completers obtained a college degree within 4 years of finishing high school. The percentage of completers within 4 years of high school graduation had dropped to 39% in the 1992 cohort (Bound, Lovenheim, & Turner, 2012) and was only 42% in the 2004 cohort (authors' calculation using the Education Longitudinal Study). Among completers, the average time-todegree increased from 4.34 years in the 1972 cohort, to 4.56 years in the 1992 cohort, and then to 4.83 years in the 2004 cohort (Adelman, 2004; author's calculation) .\nThis trend in delayed degree completion is predominately seen in public universities rather than private, not-for-profit institutions (Bowen, Chingos, & McPherson, 2009) . In fact, time-todegree at highly selective private universities decreased from 4.31 to 4.20 years from the 1972 to the 1992 cohort (Bound et al., 2012) . This decline for private 4-year institutions is juxtaposed with an increase in time-to-degree at top 50 public 4-year institutions (4.49-4.66 years) and an even larger increase (4.49-4.93 years) at non-top 50 public 4-year institutions over this 20-year period (Bound et al., 2012) . In the 2004 cohort of high school graduates, 59% of students who began at private nonprofit colleges graduated within 4 years, compared with just 41% of those who started at public colleges (authors' calculation using The Education Longitudinal Study [ELS] data).\nThe average time-to-degree is longer for students from lower income families, who can little afford additional tuition and living expenses. Among students who graduated from high school in 2004, 32% of bachelor's degree recipients in the lowest socioeconomic status quartile finished their degree on time, compared with 48% of students in the highest quartile (authors' calculation using ELS data). This contributed to a 6-month differential in the average time-to-degree (62.1 months vs. 56.1 months). The increase in timeto-degree is concurrent with an increase in total credits obtained. Baccalaureate completers in the 1972 cohort accumulated 130.1 credits on average, whereas those in the 1992 cohort completed an average of 138.4 credits, and students in the 2004 cohort completed 138.6 credits (Adelman, 2004; authors' calculation using ELS data) .\n2 A similar differentiation between public and private 4-year institutions can be seen regarding credits accumulated. Among 1992 high school graduates, those completing a baccalaureate degree at public 4-year universities accumulated 133.1 credits on average, compared with the 129.3 credits of their peers at private, non-forprofit 4-year institutions (McCormick, 1999; Radford & Horn, 2012) . Public college graduates in the 2004 cohort completed 140.8 credits, compared with 129.5 credits for private college graduates (authors' calculations using ELS data).\nResearch about the factors affecting time-todegree has pointed to several important considerations. Bound et al. (2012) found that the recent increase in time-to-degree at public universities is driven by a decline in institutional resources, lessening the ability of colleges to graduate students on time, not by changes in student characteristics such as college preparedness or demographic factors. In contrast, Kurlaender, Jackson, Howell, and Grodsky (2014) found that course scarcity did not delay graduation at the University of California- Davis. There are also factors outside the higher education system that may affect time-to-degree. Evidence from Italian and European universities indicate that labor market quality is also associated with the time it takes to obtain a bachelor's degree (Aina, Baici, & Casalone, 2011; Brunello & Winter-Ebmer, 2003) . In the German university system, increased time spent in part-time work outside the university is related to a lengthening time-to-degree (Behr & Theune, 2016) . Triventi (2014) distinguished between low-and high-intensity employment, and found that only the latter delayed academic progression in Europe. Bound et al. (2012) also pointed to employment hours crowding out educational time in the U.S. system, a consideration that has likely become more important as students work to fund an ever-more-expensive degree.\nBoth institutions and states have long developed policies and programs aimed at increasing student completion and reducing time-to-degree. For example, Temple University implemented a \"Fly in Four\" campaign, offering to pay for remaining credits after 4 years for students who have met numerous checkpoints. Scott-Clayton (2011) showed that West Virginia's merit aid program, which required students to complete 30 credits per year, significantly increased 4-year graduation rates. Bettinger and Baker (2014) articulated the potential benefits of the technology-aided advising as a way to reduce unneeded credits. Finally, Tinto (2010) and Calcagno, Crosta, Bailey, and Jenkins (2007) both documented the impact of structured degree pathways on timely bachelor's degree completion.\nAs a mechanism to combat increases in timeto-degree, several states-including Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas-have legislated policies designed to discourage students at public colleges and universities from taking too many credits. These excess credit hour (ECH) policies assess a tuition surcharge for credits taken beyond a predetermined cutoff, usually between 115% and 130% of the degree's usual required credits. At their core, ECH policies are designed to incentivize student completion by increasing student costs associated with untimely progress toward a bachelor's degree. The implementation of the ECH policies is not a new phenomenon-North Carolina implemented the first ECH policy in Fall 1992-however, states have become increasingly interested in adopting policies aimed at increasing student completion and minimizing state investment (Complete College America, 2011) .\nPolicies designed to curb ECHs could also have the effect of curbing student loan debt if students are able to finish in fewer semesters and pay less in tuition and living expenses. However, these policies could actually increase debt burdens for two groups of students. The first group includes those who could be induced to finish in fewer semesters but would have to borrow more money to substitute for employment income. The second group comprises those students who have to pay the higher per-credit price under ECH policies because they were unable or unwilling to complete their degree within the specified number of credits. As a result, it is entirely possible that an ECH policy is associated with rising student debt.\nUsing a generalized difference-in-difference (GDD) approach, this study examines the institution-level effect of ECH policy adoption on the intended (degree completion and time-to-degree) and the possibly unintended (student debt) outcomes. Previous evidence of the direct and indirect impact of ECH policy on student enrollment behaviors and outcomes is scarce. Our analysis of institution-level responses to ECH policies leads us to ask the following research questions:"}, {"section_title": "Research Question 1:", "text": "To what extent are degree completion and time-to-degree measures affected by the adoption of an ECH policy?"}, {"section_title": "Research Question 2:", "text": "To what extent is the presence of an ECH policy associated with student debt burdens? Research Question 3: How do underrepresented and/or low-income students respond to the adoption of ECH policies?\nResults from our study have failed to substantiate any positive impact of ECH policies on degree production or time-to-degree. Instead, our results demonstrate that the adoption of ECH policies significantly increases median student debt. Results from our study appear to demonstrate that ECH policies do not significantly alter student course-taking behaviors, but rather shift the cost burdens from the state to the individual student for actual or perceived inefficiencies in students' course-taking behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Effects of Costs on Completion and Time-toDegree", "text": "Emerging literature examines the impact of tuition policies on time-to-degree internationally. This literature stems from the introduction of tuition and fees within institutions that have traditionally been tuition free or low tuition compared with U.S. institutions. Garibaldi, Giavazzi, Ichino, and Rettore (2012) exploited discontinuities in the formula for tuition at Bocconi University to find that a 1,000-euro increase in tuition during the final regular year leads to a 5.2% decrease in the probability of late graduation. Students, they argued, view final-year tuition as a predictor for tuition in potential extra years of study and adjust their efforts to graduate on time when faced with a tuition hike. Bruckmeier, Fischer, and Wigger (2015) used a difference-indifference approach to examine the natural experiment of tuition fee introduction at German public universities in seven out of 16 states in 2007. They found that the introduction of even modest tuition fees-public universities were previously free-significantly reduced time-to-degree in states that adopted them. Gunnes, Kirkeb\u00f8en, and R\u00f8nning (2013) studied the effects of a Norwegian policy that provided an incentive of approximately US$3,000 for on-time graduation from 1990 to 1995. Evidence from their difference-indifference design suggests that the incentive reduced the average graduation delay by 0.23 semesters per year treated. A randomized experiment from the Netherlands showed that financial rewards for on-time completion of first-year requirements increased total credits completed in the first year only for high-ability students; lowability students were made worse off by the incentive, possibly because the external reward crowded out their intrinsic motivation (Leuven, Oosterbeek, & van der Klaauw, 2010) . Domestically, scholars have focused primarily on increases in tuition and fees as well as the role of need-based and merit aid programs in students' time-to-degree and completion. Hemelt and Marcotte (2011) found that for every US$100 increase in tuition and fees, institutions experienced a significant decrease in enrollment. This effect was particularly concentrated within doctoral institutions. They also found that similar increases to in-state tuition and fees significantly reduced student credit hours completed. In addition, there exists limited evidence on the effects of tuition surcharges affecting total credits accumulation, increasing persistence, or timely degree completion (Hemelt & Stange, 2016) . Other evidence from the end of the 20th century suggests that student persistence is less affected by tuition increases than by changes in financial aid (Paulsen & St John, 1997; St John, 1990) . One study of a potential increase in the tuition cap at a Wyoming community college found modest impacts on credit-taking behaviors (Davis et al., 2015) .\nRecently, scholars have focused increasing attention on the role of financial aid in promoting student persistence and completion. The significant focus on the effects of financial aid on completion has led to mixed results. Evidence from a merit-based grant program in West Virginia shows that financial aid packages with yearly renewal tied to timely credit accumulation decreased time-to-degree and increased degree attainment (Scott-Clayton, 2011) . In addition, Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos (2009) found that performance-based scholarships have a positive effect on student postsecondary grade point averages (GPAs) and persistence toward a degree. Evidence from need-based grant programs in Florida and Wisconsin shows that the aid packages increased recipients' likelihood of completion and rate of credit accumulation (Castleman & Long, 2016; Goldrick-Rab, Kelchen, Harris, & Benson, 2016) . Studies that have examined grant-in-aid programs without required academic performance metric have demonstrated even less conclusive evidence regarding positive effects on continued student persistence or degree completion (Bettinger, 2004; Glocker, 2011). 3 Prior work by DesJardins, McCall, Ott, and Kim (2010) has found little evidence that the Gates Millennium Scholarship increased retention and course-taking patterns for academically qualified and low-income students."}, {"section_title": "Prior Work on Policy Adoption and Student Debt", "text": "Prior research has affirmed the role of statewide tuition policies, specifically in the funding and support of higher education, in influencing student debt levels (Mortenson, 1998; Zumeta, 2004) . Early work by Hartman (1972) warned that a move away from state-subsidized tuition at public universities toward loan financing would have negative consequences for low-income families. Of course, such a shift has occurred, and the effect of changing state funding on student debt has been documented (Heller, 2006) . Monks (2001) found that need-blind admission policies, loan limits, and major choice have a larger impact on student debt levels than an institution's costs of attendance. Changes in both federal and state policies have produced significant increases in the prevalence and levels of student debt. Specifically, between 1996 and 2012, students at public 4-year institutions have increased their borrowing rate from 38% to 50% (Horn & Paslov, 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Prior Literature on ECH Policies", "text": "Evidence about the effects of lengthening time-to-degree has indicated several areas of concern. On a personal level, increases in the time taken to complete a baccalaureate degree may delay entry into the labor market and diminish lifetime earnings (Monks, 1997; Taniguchi, 2005) . Aina and Pastore (2012) , examining the Italian university system, suggested that delayed graduation signals educational underperformance in the labor market, dampening late graduates' wage opportunities. Findings from Brodaty, Gary-Bobo, and Prieto (2008) support this, with a 1-year delay in graduation causing a 9% decrease in average wage and a 20% decline in the probability of employment in the first five postgraduation years in France. Furthermore, evidence from the United States suggests that students who progress slowly in the beginning of their studies have a lower probability of graduating at all (Attewell, Heil, & Reisel, 2012) . These effects are compounded by the fact that lengthening the time of university study plagues students of low socioeconomic status and minority students disproportionately (Bowen et al., 2009) , implying that the costs of delayed graduation are borne by the most vulnerable students.\nWhereas the individual costs are substantial, the institutional and state-level costs may be greater-particularly for public institutions (Turner, 2004) . Given that each credit completed is subsidized either through state appropriations or institutional grants and aid, the costs directly to the student are only a fraction of the total cost as they do not include the public subsidies provided (Bowen et al., 2009) . One study of an unnamed state's community college system estimated the costs of ECHs to be at least US$6 million per year, not including failed and dropped credits (Zeidenberg, 2015) . Bound and Turner (2007) found that the supply of higher education is relatively inelastic; demand shocks produced by an increase in the college-age population lead to a lower rate of completion. Following this reasoning, an analogous demand shock in the form of late-graduating students failing to normally progress through the system is likely to crowd out the supply of higher education by occupying course seats that would otherwise be available to incoming or returning students."}, {"section_title": "Contribution", "text": "Our research explores the effect of ECH policies on both intended and unintended institutionlevel outcomes. ECH policies have gained traction within state legislative bodies and state higher education systems as pressures related to efficiency, affordability, and completion mount. Our study contributes to higher education policy literature in a number of ways. First, this study represents the first known systematic evaluation of ECH policies on degree production, 4-and 6-year graduation rates, and student debt. Whereas a few international studies have considered single policy adoptions (Bruckmeier et al., 2015; Garibaldi et al., 2012) , this study examines the systematic adoption of ECH policies in the United States through a quasi-experimental approach. Second, our study extends the literature base on policy-adoption methods, accounting for variations in policy shock implementation. Whereas traditional difference-in-difference methods focus on a single policy adoption, our approach builds on prior work (Heckman, Ichimura, & Todd, 1997) to provide a more flexible estimation parameter. Finally, our findings add to the scarce literature on the unintended effects of completion programs that create incentives for students through tuition-based surcharges."}, {"section_title": "Data and Research Design", "text": "We constructed a panel data set from 2000 to 2013 using data from the U.S. Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), the College Scorecard, and state-level factors extracted from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Carl Klarner and the National Conference of State Legislatures. The primary goal of this study was to estimate the impact of adopting ECH policies on graduation rates and student median debt. To do this, we included all public 4-year institutions 4 (n = 506) over our 14-year (2000-2013) panel-a total of 6,912 observations."}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": "All measures included within our analysis were log transformed except for percentage measures of dummy coded indicators (e.g., Democratic Governor). The decision to log transform was made to reduce our model's sensitivity to variations in institutional size and to allow our estimands to be interpreted as a percentage change (Cameron & Trivedi, 2005) . However, Meyer (1995) has argued that difference-in-differences (DiD) estimations can be sensitive to the selected functional form. Specifically, logged nonlinear transformations within a DiD specification can change signs when applied to a dependent variable. To account for this potential limitation, we ran model specifications that included our dependent variable nontransformed to test whether our specifications were sensitive to functional form. Our functional form tests indicate that our point estimates were not dependent on a functional form choice. We then chose to follow the recommendation of Wooldridge (2009) and log transformed our dependent variables for efficiency and ease of interpretation. An additional concern with our empirical design was the potential presence of various composition effects. To test for the possible presence of these effects, we reestimated our main-effects tables to include institution-by-year interaction terms. After employing these checks for composition effects, we obtained virtually the same results in both magnitude and directionality."}, {"section_title": "Independent Variable(s).", "text": "Within this study, we were primarily interested in analyzing the effect of ECH policy adoption on a variety of direct and indirect outcomes. Because there is no single comprehensive list of the ECH adopters, we developed one by examining state legislative records, institutional websites, and a variety of policy reports to generate our ECH adoption variable. 5 This included contacting administrators from institutions within adopting states to confirm not only the timing of adoption but also the mechanisms and provisions of the ECH policy. For our study, ECH policies must have met the following requirements: (a) a state adopted the policy, (b) a threshold exists based on total credits completed, and (c) the policy affects public 4-year institutions. Table 1 provides an overview of state adopted excess credit hour policies."}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variable(s).", "text": "Because the primary stated aim surrounding the adoption of ECH policies is to incentivize students to complete their baccalaureate degree within 4 years, our first set of outcomes addressed the intended outcomes of facilitating completion for students. To do so, we captured three different measures of degree completion and graduation. First, we estimated the impact of ECH policies on total degrees produced. Second, we examined both the 4-year and 6-year graduation rates, which serve as proxies for time-to-degree. 6 Taken in combination, our three completion measures will illustrate the effect of ECH polices on the ability to incentivize changes in student course-taking patterns. For example, no significant effect on total degrees produced but an increase in the 4-year graduation rate would signal that an institution is not producing more degrees, but rather a larger proportion of degree completers are graduating within 4 years.\nIn addition to analyzing the impact of ECH policies on intended completion outcomes, we also postulated that implementation of additional fiscal charges may have an unintended consequence of increased student debt. Using data from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard, we examined median student debt, median student debt of graduates, and median student debt for a variety of subgroups. With our data set, we focused primarily on changes in student debt for low-, middle-, and high-income students. A number of scholars (Avery & Kane, 2004; Grodsky & Jones, 2007; Horn, Xianglei, & Chapman, 2003) have documented that students from low-income and other disadvantaged backgrounds exhibit difficulties in estimating costs associated with tuition and fees.\nCovariates. As discussed within our \"Analytical Strategy\" section, we used a GDD technique to estimate the effects of ECH adoption. We selected covariates based on prior studies that have found statistically significant relationships among the number of degrees produced, completion rates, or levels of student debt. Our institution-level covariates included the percentage of undergraduate students receiving federal grant aid and the percentage of undergraduates who are underrepresented minority students, factors that are associated with lower completion rates and higher debt burdens (Bahr, Toth, Thirolf, & Masse, 2013; Hillman, 2015; Ishitani, 2006; Titus, 2006) . 7 We also controlled for factors such as total undergraduate enrollment, published instate tuition and fees, published out-of-state tuition and fees, and the percentage of degrees produced by broad academic subject area, which are also significant predictors of our outcomes of interest (Chen & Wiederspan, 2014; DesJardins, Kim, & Rzonca, 2003) .\nIn addition to controlling for institutional factors affecting our outcome measures, we also included state-level economic and political conditions because state legislatures and budgets ultimately direct the funding and tuition policies of public universities. To this end, we included measures of party control (i.e., if the governor was a Democrat and if the state legislative body was under Democratic control) and overall economic conditions in each state (i.e., poverty rate and adjusted per capita income) that have been shown to affect public universities (Doyle, 2012; Humphreys, 2000; McLendon, Hearn, & Mokher, 2009; Weerts & Ronca, 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Analytical Strategy", "text": "To estimate the overall impact of the adoption of ECH policies, we borrowed similar methodological approaches from S. Dynarski (2000) , Hillman, Tandberg, and Gross (2014) , and Zhang and Ness (2010) , who each used a combination of the traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) fixedeffects regression parameters and the DiD approach to study institutional and student responses to statelevel policy adoption. In an environment where there is a single policy shock at a single time period, we specified Equation 1 as follows: \nwhere ECH s is an indicator valued at 1 if an institution was located within a state that adopted an ECH policy at any time during the analytical sample and zero otherwise, Post t has a value of 1 when the time period is after the adopting yearfor example, if we were evaluating Florida's adoption, this would be 2009 and afterwardand zero otherwise. ECH s \u00d7 Post t is the DiD coefficient that represents the estimate of causal effects of ECH adoption on outcome Y for institution i during time t.\nAlthough a traditional DiD approach is most efficient in estimating the impact of a single policy shock, the adoption of ECH policies across multiple states has not occurred during a single period. To account for the varying adoption periods, we implemented a generalized DiD model. Building on the logic provided by Belasco, Rosinger, and Hearn (2014) , we specify Equation 2 as our GDD:\nwhere ECH it is a dichotomous indicator equal to 1 during the year of first-year post-state adoption of an ECH policy and afterward and 0 prior to adoption or if an institution is located within a state that has not adopted an ECH policy. W it is a vector of institution-level continuous covariates that affect our dependent variable (as discussed previously). V st is a vector of state-level factors that not only affect the postsecondary environment but also directly affect our dependent variable. \u03b4t is the year fixed-effect, \u03bb i is the institutional fixed-effect, and \u03b5 st is the state-clustered robust standard error. The decision to cluster at the state level is an attempt to relax assumptions about heteroskedasticity and serial correlation between institutions within states.\nThe causal estimates from Equation 1 are approximated within Equation 2 through twoway fixed effects (Bertrand, Duflo, & Mullainathan, 2004) . To this end, the first difference between institutions in adopting and nonadopting states is accounted for within our institution fixed effects (\u03bb i ), and the second difference between pre-and post-time periods is accounted for within our year fixed effects ( \u03b4t ). The resulting coefficient on \u03b2 1 ECH it is our causal GDD estimate."}, {"section_title": "Robustness Checks", "text": "The difficulty in policy-based research is approximating what would have happened for institutions within adopting states had the state never adopted an ECH policy. To account for this, we implemented a variety of robustness checks to present plausible scenarios of what could have occurred in the absence of an ECH policy.\nControl Groups. Within our difference-in-difference framework, it is important that the treated group (i.e., institutions in adopting states) and the comparison group (i.e., institutions in nonadopting states) followed parallel (or similar) trends prior to the introduction of the policy (Blundell & Costa Dias, 2000) . Because this is difficult to accomplish, we utilized three different control groups to illustrate that our results are not sensitive to the varying preadopting trends associated with any one group of institutions in nonadopting states.\nGroup 1, National Comparison: Our analysis began with the most general control group-institutions within states that have not adopted an ECH policy-and then narrowed to states that share regional commonalities. Within the national comparison, we included public 4-year institutions located within 41 nonadopting states. As a robustness check, we included states that adopted an ECH policy after the time frame of our analytical sample as a control and achieved similar results. Group 2, Regional Association: In addition to using our nonadopting states as a control group, second, we limited our sample to regions where states have adopted ECH policies. We also limited our sample to regions with ECH policies to account for any region-based tuition reciprocity agreements (Cornwell, Mustard, & Sridhar, 2006; DesJardins, Ahlburg, & McCall, 2006) or other policy-relevant set of counterfactuals. Including all regions in which ECH policies have been adopted yielded a comparison group of 217 distinct nonadopting institutions from 24 unique states. 8 In total, this comparison included 31 states, 318 unique institutions, and a total of 4,449 observations. Group 3, Border States: As is common with difference-in-differences approaches, we utilized a second set of geographic boundaries to specify our third control group (S. Dynarski, 2000; Flores, 2010; Zhang & Ness, 2010) . Specifically, we leveraged geographic proximity and included states that share a physical border with adopting states. These \"border states\" share similar demographics and regional characteristics with adopting states. The nonadopting border states group consists of 23 different states, 246 unique institutions, and a total of 3,442 nonadopting observations. Table  2 provides an overview of descriptive statistics for ECH adopters and our three comparison groups.\nTiming. First, we utilized falsification tests (Cook & Campbell, 1986) to overcome a major concern with quasi-experimental approaches, untangling the policy effect from a potential corresponding time effect. To this end, we artificially created the adoption of an ECH policy a number of years prior to the actual adoption. Significant results prior to the actual adoption signaled that the estimated impact on our dependent variable was not a product of the ECH policy adoption, but rather a time effect that happened to coincide with the adoption. In addition, we also added an institution-specific trend to the set of covariates (Angrist "}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Before the presentation of our results, we acknowledge the limitations of our empirical results and generated estimates. First, our data were extracted from both IPEDS and the College Scorecard. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), while collecting similar measures, provides institutions with different technical guidance on reporting aggregates at the campus level (Jaquette & Parra, 2014) . 9 To account for this, we ran model specifications to exclude parent institutions that may have reported multiple child campuses in a single year. For our analysis on student debt-as reported by the College Scorecard and subject to the parent-child report-we also ran model specifications where our data from IPEDS were aggregated from the \"child level\" to the \"parent level\" prior to merging with our College Scorecard data. These results indicated that our point estimates were not sensitive to this reporting difference. In addition, we clustered our standard errors at the state level to produce more conservative tests of significance. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics of the variables used within our difference-in-difference specification to estimate the impact of ECH adoption. This table compares institutions within adopting and nonadopting states. In general, institutions within adopting states produced significantly more bachelor's degrees and have notably higher 6-year graduation rates, on average, than institutions within nonadopting states. In addition, ECH institutions also possess slightly lower levels of median student debt across income categories. Institutions within adopting states appear to have larger average undergraduate enrollments, a smaller percentage of in-state student enrollment, and a higher out-of-state tuition and fee level. In addition, institutions within adopting states appear to be less diverse, both economically and in their racial/ethnic composition. At the state level, adopting states were less Democratic-both in gubernatorial and legislative control-and slightly more affluent. Figure 1 provides three panels that illustrate the pre-and posttrends for institutions both within adopting states and our control institutions. The first panel provides the trends on the 4-year graduation rate. As is evident, regardless of the adoption year, institutions in adopting and nonadopting states followed similar trends both before and after adoption. We do not find visual evidence of changes, either positive or negative, in the trajectory of institutions. Our second panel examines similar trends on the 6-year graduation rate. Again, we fail to find visual evidence that the implementation of an ECH policy altered 6-year graduation rates. Unlike both our graduation rate measures, we do see visual evidence that the median student debt gap between adopting institutions and nonadopting institutions begins to close post adoption. The most notable visual impact of ECH adoption on median student debt is shown in Virginia and Wisconsin, whose preadoption trend was below that of the nonadopting controls, but by the end of our analytical sample, the median student debt had surpassed institutions within nonadopting states."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Impact of ECH Policies on Completion", "text": "In Table 3 , we present results from our fitting Equation 2 on our analytical sample, focusing on the impact of ECH policy adoption on total number of degrees awarded, 4-year graduation rate, and 6-year graduation rate. Each outcome is disaggregated by our comparison groups outlined previously: (a) national, (b) regional, and (c) border states. Across these three groups, we attempt to illustrate consistently emerging patterns not influenced by the selection of a particular control group. Each control group provides its own strength, and it is not our goal to generate the \"ideal\" control group but rather to examine the extent to which our estimation patterns are consistent across multiple counterfactuals.\n10 To account for the delayed effect of our outcome variable, we lagged our ECH policy adoption indictor 4 and 6 years. For each of total bachelor's degrees (logged), 4-year graduation rate (percent), and 6-year graduation rate (percent), we fail to find any evidence of a statistically significant relationship between ECH adoption and completion. Across our various control groups, our point estimates are robust and stable.\nAlthough we failed to find a significant effect on an institution's overall degree production and graduation rate, prior research indicates that various subgroups may respond differently to the presence of the fiscal incentives-or disincentives. To this end, Table 4 disaggregates the ECH adoption effects on degree production as well as 4-year and 6-year graduation rates by race/ethnicity. 11 Similar to the estimates for our overall completion outcomes, disaggregated results indicate no significant change in degree production and 4-year graduation rate, post adoption, for any racial/ethnic subgroup. Despite no statistical impact in degree production and 4-year graduation rate, the 6-year graduation rate for Hispanic/Latino students appears to increase significantly post adoptionbetween 2.5% and 3.4%. In contrast to the positive effects for Hispanic/Latino students, we find marginal significant evidence that the 6-year graduation rate for African American/Black students significantly decreased 6 years after ECH adoption-between 3.5% and 4.2%. The prior work of Nora, Barlow, and Crisp (2006) has provided insight into the differing responses to financial aid programs and/or financing of postsecondary education for students from variable racial/ethnic subgroups."}, {"section_title": "Impact of ECH Policies on Student Debt", "text": "Tables 5 through 8 display results from our GDDs analyses, where each table provides point estimates for the changes in median student debt by a variety of subgroups and income levels. As with our analyses of degree production and completion, each of these analyses includes both state-and institution-level time-varying covariates as well as institution and year fixed effects. First, Table 5 provides the impact of ECH adoption on the overall median student debt by various adoption lags. Consistent with the policy implementation effects-typically ECH policies do not immediately affect students who were already enrolled when the policy was enacted 12 -we see a consistent significant effect of ECH policies on median student debt beginning at 4 years post adoption. We estimate that 4 years post adoption, ECH adoption significantly increased median student debt. The estimated effect was robust across each of our three nonadopting control groups. Institutions within adopting states experienced an increase of from 5.7% (nonadopting border state controls) to 7.2% (nonadopting regional state controls) in median student debt 4 years after adoption. This significant effect continued 5 years post adoption with similar significance and magnitude levels.\nIf we focus on the marginal costs associated with ECH surcharges, the estimated point effects are plausible. Based on our calculations, the typical institution charges approximately US$300 per credit. Based on the latest complete wave of the nationally representative Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS 04/09) Longitudinal Study, a typical undergraduate completed a degree with an excess of 30 credits. If 50% of those credits were subjected to the ECH surcharge (typically an additional 100%), it would generate a total of US$4,500 in additional tuition costs. If students only financed 50% of this additional cost through student loans, it would represent an increase of about 10% for many graduates with debt. Given our previous results that ECH policies do not significantly alter timely completion or degree production, it seems plausible that our results would have similar magnitudes. Table 5 establishes the timing effects of ECH adoption on student debt. The remaining tables (Table 6 through Table 8 ) provide the impact of the 4-year lagged effect of ECH adoption on varying subgroups of students. Table 6 provides the point estimates of the policy adoption effect by student income levels. Overall, we found that the impact of ECH policy was concentrated within low-and middle-income students. Students within the high-income subgroup (nominal family incomes of greater than US$75,000) did not experience any significant increase in their median debt post adoption. Low-income students (nominal family incomes less than US$30,000) experienced between a 4.1% and 5.1% increase in their median student debt 4 years post adoption, whereas middleincome students (nominal family incomes of between US$30,000 and US$75,000) experienced the largest increase in their median debt of between 5.3% and 5.6%. Given the income thresholds for these groups, it is possible that access to Pell Grants mediated the increase in student debt slightly. The findings that highincome students are not as affected by ECH policies as more marginalized students is further supported within Table 7 , which provides the postadoption response to ECH policy by student debt level. Post ECH adoption, we find no significant evidence that cumulative loan debt for the 10th percentile was affected. However, we find systematic increases in debt levels across each of three control groups at the 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of cumulative loan debt levels. For students borrowing the most (90th percentile), we see significant increases between 4.9% and 6.3%. At the 25th percentile of median student debt, ECH adoption appears to produce the largest percentage increase between 5.6% and 7.1%. The stability of our estimates across each control group engenders confidence in our results that the debt of low-income students appears to be most affected by ECH policy adoption.\nOur study also examines the impact of ECH policies on student debt for first-generation, Pell Grant recipients, and noncompleters. These results can be found in the online appendix (available at http://epa.sagepub.com/supplemental) and support our prior findings suggesting that the most marginalized students experience the largest increases in student debt post ECH adoption. Specifically, Pell Grant recipients experienced a 6.0% increase, first-generation college students a 7.2% increase, and noncompleters a 7.7% increase in their median student debt levels. Each of these is larger than the 5.7% increase in overall median student debt."}, {"section_title": "Impact of ECH Policies on Student Debt by Institution Type", "text": "Despite finding consistent evidence that ECH adoption increases student debt, particularly for those who borrow the most and come from low-or middle-income backgrounds, there exists the potential for different effects by institutional types. Table 8 provides an extension of our analysis that interacts institutional types (doctoral, master's, or bachelor's 13 ) with ECH adoption. Overall, it appears that students enrolled in bachelor's degree-granting institutions who were under an ECH policy were most affected by the policy. Specifically, the median student debt for students enrolled at bachelor's institutions showed increases ranging between 9.5% and 10.7%, whereas the median student debt at master's degree-granting institutions experienced an increase of 7.9% to 9.6%, 14 and doctoral degree-granting institutions experienced only a 2% to 3% increase in student debt post ECH adoption.\nAcross income levels, attending a doctoral institution appears to significantly mediate the effects of ECH policies on increases in median debt. This is particularly true for students possessing high nominal family incomes, as their increase in debt is near zero compared with high-income students attending bachelor's-onlygranting (increase in median student debt of 12%-15%) and master's degree-granting (increase in median student debt of 6%) institutions. Within doctoral institutions, students from middle nominal family incomes still experienced the largest impact in student debt post ECH adoption (2.2% compared with less than 1% for students from low and high nominal family incomes). At bachelor's institutions, students from high nominal family incomes experienced the largest increase in median debt post ECH adoption at 13.8% compared with students from middle nominal family incomes (7.6%) and students from low nominal family incomes (10.6%). These results indicate varying policy impacts on debt, based on the institution type attended. The access to additional financial resources and larger institutional grants at doctoral institutions (Doyle, 2010a) may explain the overall reduced effects on debt."}, {"section_title": "ECH Adoption and Time Trends", "text": "The difficulty in any quasi-experimental design lies in identifying the counterfactual in the absence of policy adoption. The use of a GDD design allows this study to approximate the impact of ECH adoption on institutions in adopting states, using nonadopting institutions and variations in adoption year as controls. This approach produces estimates of what could have occurred within our outcomes if the state had not adopted an ECH policy. This counterfactual approach assumes that treatment and control units follow similar (or parallel) prepolicy patterns, and that the resulting variations in the outcome can be attributed to policy adoption. A chief concern around any DiD approach is distinguishing the policy impact from the time impact. To illustrate the lack of preadoption significance and to highlight potential time trends in our primary outcomes, the following uses leading and lagging adoption terms. We specifically focused on the year prior to adoption, and post adoption with unaffected students, to see whether institutions within adopting states experienced significant changes in their primary outcomes. Figure 2 illustrates the pre-and postadoption trend for median student debt. As seen in Figure  2 , there were no significant changes prior to the adoption ECH. This nonsignificance continued until Year 4 (the first year of full impact on students). We see a marginally significant effect of ECH adoption on student debt 3 years post adoption, which makes sense as about 75% of students would fall under the surcharge policy. 15 Four years after adopting the ECH, institutions experienced their first statistically significant increase (7%) in median student debt. This significant impact persisted into Years 5 and 6 post adoption. This display provides evidence that the prior-adoption parallel trend assumptions have been met, and that the estimates produced in Tables 3 and 4 are robust and attributable to the effect of ECH policy adoption."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The adoption of state postsecondary policies aimed at increasing student completion and success is not a new topic within the empirical literature. However, few have examined the impact of tuition surcharge policies on student completion and debt outcomes. The use of ECH policies is becoming an increasingly popular policy strategy for state policymakers and institutional leaders seeking to create an environment that incentivizes efficient student completion while minimizing state subsidies (Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, 2006). State policies focusing on increasing student performance while reducing state subsidies have received considerably less attention than state-adopted merit aid policies (Doyle, 2010b; S. Dynarski, 2002; Monks, 2009) or state performance funding (Hillman, Tandberg, & Fryar, 2015; Hillman et al., 2014) . Results from this study begin to answer the broader question of whether tuition-based surcharges directly affect student course-taking behaviors, much as the impact of changes in tuition levels has been shown, or if there are unintended consequences affecting student debt. Using institutional data to leverage a natural policy adoption experiment, our study makes additional contributions regarding the use of a GDDs approach.\nDeparting from prior findings on the effects of tuition increases on course-taking behaviors and time-to-degree (Bruckmeier et al., 2015; Garibaldi et al., 2012) , our results yield no systematic evidence that excess tuition surcharges affect student course-taking behaviors or provide incentive for degree completion. This is despite, on average, the tuition surcharges of ECH policies being as much as 30 times bigger than the US$100 tuition increases reported in prior work to facilitate student completion and affect student course-taking behaviors (Hemelt & Marcotte, 2011) . We postulate that this is due to the lack of information students have about ECH policies. Compared with tuition increases, which are publicly debated and widely known to students (Grodsky & Jones, 2007) , ECH policies are often less familiar. The tuition surcharge only affects students once they cross the predetermined threshold, and at that point, it is too late for significant modifications to course plans. In addition, to elicit reduction in time-to-degree and streamline course-taking behaviors, students must engage in course planning early on in their program of study (Adelman, 2006) . The potential lack of information about ECH policies and the delayed nature of their impact do not facilitate incentives for students early in their program of study.\nIn summary, we did not find systematic evidence of changes in degree production or the 4-year graduation rate, we did note differing effects for African American and Hispanic student completion rates post implementation. Although initially surprising, these results appear to be supported by the prior literature. Specifically, Gross, Torres, and Zerquera (2013) found that financial aid subsidies appear to significantly increase Hispanic/Latino student persistence and completion more than other racial/ethnic subgroups. Kim, DesJardins, and McCall (2009) also demonstrated variations in student responses to fiscal policies by race/ethnicity. Because our results demonstrate a positive effect of ECH on the 6-year graduation rate of Hispanic/Latino students, we find them to be complementary to the existing literature.\nOur results highlighted the potential of ECH policies to significantly increase student debt. We feel that our results, when combined with the lack of impact on student degree completion and graduation, further strengthen our conclusion that either ECH may most likely be unknown to incoming students until they reach (or increase in proximity to) the excess credit threshold. Scholars have long noted the presence of information asymmetry surrounding state-adopted policies (Lin, Cai, & Li, 1998) . Pusser and Doane (2001) explicitly stated that students are particularly vulnerable to information asymmetries when policies do not immediately affect their day-to-day activities. Qualitative studies on students' knowledge and perception of ECH policies upon entering college would be a valuable addition to the literature.\nIt is possible that the surcharges associated with these policies are not large enough to modify student behaviors, prior research has produced findings that demonstrate large student responses to nominal changes in prices (Bryan & Whipple, 1995; Savoca, 1990 )-leading us to believe that the surcharges are large enough to potentially induce behavioral changes. Our heterogeneous effects articulate the lack of significant effect on the median student debt of low (or zero-amount) student loan borrowers as well as high-income students. The estimates that unintended consequences of these policies increase debt for those already borrowing significant amounts of student loans as well as those from low-and middle-income families provide significant concern. As these populations of students traditionally have lower levels of educational capital (Bailey & Dynarski, 2011; Bastedo & Jaquette, 2011) , it is not surprising that their responses to nuances in tuition surcharge policies would be more affected.\nWhat is not clear within our analysis is the role of loans within this process. Our findings could potentially demonstrate the perverse impact of ECH policies on low-and middle-income students; it is also possible that students not utilizing loans (or limited loans) may feel the immediate impact of these surcharges whereas borrowing students have a delayed impact. In addition, there may be simultaneity between the surcharges related to ECH and the exhaustion of federal loan eligibility by students. Our current data would not untangle the impact of loans; however, this is an area ripe for future research.\nOur findings also provide interesting insights into the potential differential effects of tuition surcharges on students by institutional type. The results appear to suggest that doctoral institutions mitigate the potential effects of ECH policies of median student debt-this is particularly true for low-income and affluent students. Desrochers and Hurlburt (2016) reported that public 4-year research universities-analogous to doctoral institutions within our sample-spend more on scholarships and institutional aid and have significantly more operating revenues than public 4-year master's and bachelor's institutions. It stands to reason that this increase in institutional aid would reduce student debt levels. In addition, the preponderance of the no-loan programsaimed at supporting low-income students-are situated at doctoral institutions (Hillman, 2013) , supporting our results. A recent Brookings Institution report (Looney & Yannelis, 2015) found that selective institutions, and institutions with a large proportion of graduate degree programs, experience the lowest increase in the number of students engaging in student loan borrowing. In addition, the profiles of student loan borrowers indicate that they are typically more affluent at the most selective institutions.\nGiven the popularity of postsecondary policies aimed at increasing student completion and the discourse on college affordability, continued work on the effect of ECH and similar policies provides opportunities for additional contributions. Limitations aside, this study provides additional insights into the ineffectiveness and the cost-shifting mechanism associated with the implementation of ECH policies. The insights from this study extend beyond ECH policies and highlight the broader effects of tuitionbased surcharges on student course-taking behaviors and completion. This study contributes to the empirical literature on state policies aimed at increasing student completion and minimizing student debts. It is our hope that the findings of our study shed light for state policymakers considering future ECH policy adoption, while encouraging state policymakers who have already adopted ECH policies to restructure, or outright reconsider, the ways in which current policies penalize students for exceeding required credit hours."}]
