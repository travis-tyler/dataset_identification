Volume and DTI parameters of other brain structures (including 59 hippocampus) were not significantly different between glaucoma and controls. for POAG have been identified (high intraocular pressure, age, high myopia, ethnicity 77 and heredity), several aspects of its pathophysiology remain unclear. As the disease 78 could also affect intra-cerebral visual pathways in addition to optic nerve head 79 degeneration, a neurodegenerative hypothesis raises concerns 4,5 80\nCentral visual pathway degeneration in glaucoma was first suggested in experimental 81 and histological studies, which have evidenced that glaucoma is not strictly limited to 82 the optic nerve 6, 7 . In an animal model of ocular hypertension, brain changes were 83 observed in the lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus, in parallel with 84 retinal ganglion cells loss 8 . In another study, grey matter of glaucoma patients was 85 reduced compared to healthy subjects, in the approximate retinal lesion projection 86 zones in the visual cortex 9 . Moreover, a clinicopathological case in humans 87 highlighted a neural degeneration in intracranial optic nerve, lateral geniculate 88 nucleus and visual cortex 10 . This paradigmatic shift is further supported by several 89 other small-sized clinical studies using brain magnetic resonance imaging, showing 90 reduced volume of all the visual pathways (optic tracts, optic chiasm, lateral 91 geniculate nucleus, optic radiations) measured at 1.5T [11] [12] [13] or 3T field strength 14, 15 . 92 Some other experimental studies may help understand the pathogenesis of the 93 disease. Using in vivo MRI studies is a way to study metabolic and spatiotemporal 94 changes in glaucoma [16] [17] [18] . 95\nIn addition, epidemiological studies have also suggested that glaucoma might be 96 associated with other neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Alzheimer's 97 disease 19, 20 , and a few studies have found a reduced volume of brain structures, 98 beyond the visual pathways \u2212 particularly in the hippocampus \u2212 which is well known 99 to be affected in Alzheimer's disease 14, 21, 22 Exclusion criteria included any diseases that could affect the visual field, secondary 177 glaucoma including exfoliative and pigmentary glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, any 178 neurological or psychiatric disorders, and a score <26 on the MMSE for global 179 cognition.

The optic radiations were identified using deterministic 212 tractography between two seed-regions of interest (ROIs) over the proximal and distal 213 optic radiations according to previously published method and landmarks 29 . The 214 proximal ROI was placed near the lateral geniculate nuclei, while the distal ROI was 215 placed just anterior to its termination in the visual cortex.

All these 331 studies found significantly lower FA in glaucoma patients compared with control 332 patients. In the present study, which included 70 % of early stages of glaucoma, FA 333 differences between cases and controls are numerically small (about 0.02 for a mean 334 of about 0.60, i.e about 3.3 %). However, the standard deviation is also small (about 335 0.04), showing low inter-individual variability in this parameter, and the difference is 336 substantial when related to the standard deviation (about 0.5 SD), suggesting a major 337 effect of glaucoma on this highly conserved parameter. In other studies, the 338 differences in FA of optic radiations observed between glaucoma patients and controls 339 were larger, but these studies generally included more severe cases.

However, we observed a 363 significant positive correlation between mean diffusivity and disease severity 364 measured with VCDR. Two studies also showed higher mean diffusivity in glaucoma 365 patients 25, 26 . While FA measures the degree of cellular structural alignment within fiber 366 tracts and their structural integrity, mean diffusivity measures the average motion of 367 water molecules independently of fiber directionality and is considered as an additional 368 marker of axonal disruption. As these studies included patients with advanced 369 glaucoma, our findings might be explained by a lack of statistical power and a lower 370 grade of disease severity in our glaucoma group. Such converging evidence of loss of 371 fiber integrity in optic radiations in glaucoma cannot be measured in terms of length 372 and volume of the optic radiations, which were similar in both groups probably 373 because our measurements were made prior to fiber loss or major disorganization. 374"}, {"section_title": "375", "text": "We also observed an association of diffusivity parameters (mainly FA and RD), with 376 the severity of glaucoma (assessed by mean deviation of the visual field, VCDR and 377\nRNFL measured with SD-OCT), suggesting that microstructural changes to the optic 378 radiations is one of the components of the severity that could participate in the 379 clinical status of the patients and the alteration of the visual field. Although we mainly 380\nincluded early and moderate glaucoma as defined by the Hodapp-Parrish-Anderson 381 classification, our findings are consistent with some previous studies, which included 382 more advanced cases 26, [38] [39] [40] . All these studies also evidenced significant 383 associations of optic radiations FA with structural parameters of optic nerve head 384 degeneration evaluated with VCDR or time-domain RNFL thickness, as well as 385 functional visual field alterations. For example, Michelson et al. found a correlation 386 between FA and visual field 40 . Thus, all these results illustrate the fact that FA could 387 be a strong biomarker of glaucoma severity. 388\nOur study also assessed the associations of glaucoma severity according to FA of 389 homolateral and contralateral optic radiations. Interestingly, glaucoma severity 390 parameters \u2212 in particular VCDR \u2212 were more strongly associated with homolateral 391 optic radiations diffusion parameters than with contralateral parameters. As chiasmatic 392 decussation of optic pathways results in approximately 50% crossing of axons on the 393 contralateral side 41 , we would expect similar associations of glaucoma severity 394 parameters with homolateral and contralateral diffusion parameters. However, our 395 findings might also be related to an increased vulnerability of some specific retinal 396 nerve fiber bundles of the optic nerve head resulting in an atrophy of optic radiations 397 more predominant on the homolateral side of the decussation than on the 398 controlateral. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated a specific vulnerability of the 399 temporal and temporal-inferior sides of the optic nerve head to glaucoma damage [42] [43] [44] . 400\nThus, we could expect an increased atrophy of the corresponding optic radiation 401 predominant on the homolateral side that could explain our findings. However, even if 402 temporal and temporal-inferior nerve fiber layers are more vulnerable to glaucomatous 403 damage, the meaning of our findings should be interpreted with caution and would 404 need further exploration to be confirmed and to identify the exact underlying 405 mechanism. Indeed, distribution of RNFL is not homogeneous around the optic nerve 406 head with superior and inferior sectorial RNFL thicker than nasal or temporal RNFL 407 sectors. Furthermore the mean optic disc-fovea angle deliminating superior and 408 inferior nerve fiber layers, is around 8\u00b04 5 . Thus the exact distribution of nerve fiber 409 layers of the retina that decussates to the contralateral optic tract or remains on the 410 ipsilateral optic tract and finally leads to a vertical delimitation through the fovea on the 411 hemivisual field test remains unclear. Hence, in our study, the corresponding optic 412 radiations in the homo or contralateral side could not be accurately matched to specific 413 sectors of the retina or the optic nerve head. 414\nAlthough high intraocular pressure is the main risk factor of glaucoma, this disease is 415 increasingly considered as a neuro-ophthalmological and neurodegenerative 416 disease 46 . Furthermore, there are still controversies on the association between 417 glaucoma and some other neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease. In 418 particular, in a cohort of elderly subjects followed every 2 years, we observed an 419 association of POAG with incident dementia 19 . Volume changes beyond the visual 420 system in glaucoma patients have also been reported in several studies but with 421 inconsistent results. For instance, Frezzotti et al. reported that POAG patients had 422 brain atrophy in some grey matter regions and the visual cortex 21 . By contrast, 423\nWilliams et al. found five cerebral structures larger in the glaucoma group than in the 424 control group 22 . Chen et al. revealed both a decreasing grey matter volume in some 425 regions and an increasing grey matter volume in some others 14 . In the present study, 426\nwe analyzed brain globally and focused on brain regions that are well known to be 427 affected in the course of Alzheimer's disease \u2212 particularly hippocampus \u2212 and did not 428 evidence any significant difference for any of the studied regions of interest, neither in 429 volume nor in parameters of diffusivity. However, as we included subjects with MMSE 430 \u226526 at baseline, the risk of brain structures atrophy was probably limited. Regarding 431 the hippocampus, results have been particularly inconsistent, since Frezzotti et al. 432 reported decreased hippocampus volume in glaucoma patients 21 , while Williams et al. 433 reported no significant difference of hippocampus volume between glaucoma and 434 controls, but an increase in hippocampus volume with disease severity in patients with 435 glaucoma 22 . 436\nSuch differences between study results may be explained by differences in study 437 methodology, in particular regarding the selection of subjects and severity of the Green boxes are the markers placed manually on anterior and posterior parts of the optic radiations.
