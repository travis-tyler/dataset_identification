[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background/Objectives: Few longitudinal population-based cohort studies of older people have described dietary intakes over time. The objective of this study was to assess changes in the food and nutrient intake in a cohort of older Australians, using longitudinal data collected over 10 years. Subjects/Methods: Population-based cohort of people aged 49 years and over at baseline (82% of those eligible) living in two postcode areas, west of Sydney. In 1992-1994, 3654 people were examined; 2334 were reexamined after 5 years and 1952 after 10 years (75% survivors at both examinations). A 145-item food frequency questionnaire was used to assess food and nutrient intake on each occasion, and 1166 participants provided usable dietary data at all three examinations. Results: Energy and sugar intake significantly increased among women over the 10-year period (P-value for trend o0.0001). Long-chain omega-3 fatty acid and fish intake significantly increased in both men and women (P-value for trend o0.0001). Folate intake significantly increased in both men and women (women: 325 dietary folate equivalents (DFE) vs 403 DFE; men: 346 DFE vs 425 DFE, Po0.0001). Wholemeal/grain bread consumption decreased in both men and women (P-value for trend o0.0001). Conclusions: Many of the observed changes in diet over the 10-year period were consistent with current population dietary recommendations. Some changes, however, appear to have been due to poorer dietary choices. This information could be used to inform nutrition policy and programs targeted to older persons. These data highlight the need to identify barriers to better food choices."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Official dietary guidelines recommend a decrease in dietary fat, particularly saturated fat, and increases in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), fruit and vegetables, and wholegrain breads and cereals (National Heart Foundation of Australia, 1999; National Health Medical Research Council, 2003 ; US Department of Health and Human Services 2005; Colquhoun et al., 2008) . It is useful to examine the extent to which trends in dietary intakes align with these dietary recommendations and to consider implications for future policy and dietary guidelines. Although a number of studies have reported trends in dietary change from cross-sectional studies, few have reported trends from longitudinal data on large population-based cohorts. Nielsen et al. (2002) reported the trends in energy intake in the United States between 1977 and 1996 using data collected from the nationwide food consumption surveys (n \u00bc 63,380, aged 2 years and over). Total energy intake increased over this 20-year period, with a shift away from meals, an increase in snacking behavior and in food consumed away from home. In a comparison of data, among adults aged 25-64 years, from the Australian National Nutrition Surveys conducted in 1983 and 1995, significant increases were observed in intakes of energy, fiber, carbohydrate, thiamin and calcium, and the nutrients fat, vitamin C, vitamin A and zinc significantly decreased (Cook et al., 2001) .\nCross-sectional studies report changes in mean intake in similar population groups at different time periods, but do not reflect dietary changes made among the same individuals surveyed and thus could simply indicate differences in sample characteristics between surveys, in contrast to longitudinal cohorts. Three such cohort studies have been reported among adult populations. A study of 105 men in the United States, aged 27-65 years at baseline, reported increased energy intake over 25 years (Hallfrisch et al., 1990) . A Danish cohort (n \u00bc 2430) among men and women aged 20-70 years observed decreased fat intake over 10 years (Osler et al., 1997) . A UK study of 1253 men and women, aged 36 years at baseline over 17 years observed an increased consumption of fruit and vegetables and lower consumption of whole milk, butter and red meat (Prynne et al., 2005) .\nThe Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES) is a unique longitudinal study of a large population-based sample of older Australians that has examined detailed dietary intakes at several time points. It provides an ideal opportunity to examine dietary trends, including 10-year changes in food and nutrient intakes in a population-based cohort. The aim of this study is to describe the 5-and 10-year trends in food consumption and nutrient intake of older Australian men and women."}, {"section_title": "Subjects and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "The BMES is a population-based cohort study of vision and common eye diseases in residents aged 49 years and over of a defined area, west of Sydney, Australia. Of 4433 eligible residents, 3654 (aged 49-97) years attended an eye examination (response rate 82.4%) in 1992-1994. Before attending the eye examination, participants were sent a 145-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). A total of 3267 participants attempted and returned the FFQ (89.4% of participants), of which 2897 were usable (79.3% of the participants examined). Compared with the Australian population aged 49 years and over, the BMES study population was slightly older and more likely to have slightly higher socioeconomic status as indicated by a higher proportion of apartment/home ownership, a higher proportion of qualifications after leaving school and a lower proportion of manual workers than the Australian population (Webb et al., 1999 The longitudinal data set thus comprises data collected at three time points : 1992-1994 (baseline), 1997-1999 (5 years) and 2002-2004 (10 years) . Analyses in this report include 1166 persons who participated in all three examinations and whose FFQ was included in the final data set for all three data collection points.\nThis study followed recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki Principles and was approved by the Sydney West Area Health Service and University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committees. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nThe food frequency questionnaire Dietary data were collected using a 145-item self-administered FFQ, modified for Australian diet and vernacular from an early Willett FFQ (1988) , and included portion size estimates. An allowance for seasonal variation of fruit and vegetables was made by weighting seasonal fruits and vegetables. Participants were excluded from analyses if their FFQ had (1) more than 12 missing FFQ items, (2) energy intakes o2500 or 418 000 kJ and (3) implausible records after further screening of nutrient data in the upper or lower 2% of the distribution. On the basis of the above criteria, we excluded 367 FFQs at baseline, 131 FFQs at five years and 68 FFQs at ten years.\nThe FFQ was tested for validity comparing nutrient estimates with those obtained from three separate 4-day weighed food records, collected over the period of 1 year to account for seasonal variation, in a randomly selected subsample of the BMES cohort (n \u00bc 79) and was found to generally rank people well (Smith et al., 1998b; Flood et al., 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Nutrient databases", "text": "Nutrient intakes were estimated using the Australian Tables  of Food Composition (NUTTAB90 for baseline data and  NUTTAB95 for 5-and 10-year data) (Australian Department of Community Services and Health, 1990, 1995) to which folate values were added from the 1995 Australian National Nutrition Survey database, AUSNUT, with updated folate values over time; vitamin B12 content of foods was obtained from the UK Composition of Foods Royal Society of Chemistry (1991) and information about fatty acid composition of foods was obtained from food composition data compiled by Mann et al. (2003) .\nBetween the first and second time points a new version of the electronic nutrient database was used (NUTTAB90 vs 95), which had some minor variations in the nutrient content for some specific food items, such as dried fruit, juice and processed meats. To investigate whether observed changes in nutrient intakes were due to variations in the nutrient database, we further analyzed the data from baseline, using Assessment of overweight, obesity and weight gain Weight (kg) and height (m) were measured at each time period. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using measured weight at each time point divided by the square of height at baseline. We used baseline height to avoid misclassification of BMI simply due to reduction in height associated with aging (Honkanen, 2000) . Participants were classified as underweight (BMI o18.5 kg/m 2 ), normal weight (BMI 18.5-o25 kg/m 2 ), overweight (BMI 25-o30 kg/m 2 ) and obese (BMI X30 kg/m 2 ). Change in weight was classified into four categories including weight loss of X5 kg, weight loss 5-2 kg, stable weight -2 oto 42 kg, weight gain X2-o5 kg and weight gain X5 kg. These weight change categories have been reported in previous cohort studies (Rimm et al., 1995; Willett et al., 1995) , and weight gain of 5 kg or more has been documented to have increased risks of coronary heart disease, hypertension and type II diabetes ranging from 1.5 to 3 folds compared with those with stable weight Rimm et al., 1995) ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Data were expressed as mean nutrient intake at each time period and as mean weights of food groups consumed with 95% confidence intervals. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). To identify trends, and assess the statistical significance of changes over time, we used the random-effect model (Proc MIXED SAS). The time variable was coded so that the baseline measure had a value zero and successive measurements had 5-year increments. P-value for trend was assessed using mean nutrient data, and was also adjusted for energy intake. An unstructured covariance model was specified where all correlations were assumed to be different. P-values o0.05 were considered statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Selected characteristics of those who participated in all three data collection periods are shown in Table 1 (n \u00bc 1166). There was a high percentage of home ownership among the cohort, reflecting their relatively high socioeconomic status. The proportion of people who were categorized as overweight and obese (totaled together) increased from BMES1 to BMES2 but decreased slightly at BMES3 (58.8, 67.4 and 66.2%, respectively), with women more likely to have gained 2 kg or more weight than men between baseline and 5-year follow-up (54% in women compared with 45% in men). There was a similar proportion of women and men who gained weight over the 10-year follow-up period (both were about 52%), but a higher proportion of women gained 5 kg or more (32.6 vs 27.3 in men).\nThe mean intake of macronutrients and selected micronutrients is presented in Tables 2 and 3 . Women significantly increased their energy, carbohydrate and protein intakes over the 10-year period (P-value for trend o0.001). For both men and women, fat intake (g) decreased between BMES1 and BMES2, but increased again at BMES3, especially among women. Polyunsaturated fat intake decreased (in both men and women), but both the quantity and percent energy from omega-3 PUFA increased (P-value for trend o0.0001). There were no significant changes of overall percent energy contribution from the macronutrients carbohydrate, protein and total fat, with the exception of percent energy of fat for men (with a decreasing trend). There were some changes for percent energy from subtypes of fat and carbohydrate, as indicated in Table 2 . At baseline carbohydrate contributed to 45% of energy among women and 44% among men, protein contributed to 19% of energy among women and 17% among men, total fat contributed to 33% of energy among women and 32% among men. There were no significant correlations between change in weight and change in energy intake among men and women, at both the 5-and 10-year visits.\nThere were relatively few differences in mean intakes of selected micronutrients over the 10-year period. The mean folate intake increased in both men and women (P-value for trend o0.0001; Table 3 ) and there were small but significant differences for other micronutrients including an increase in calcium, iron and sodium for women, and a decrease in zinc for men (Table 3 ).\nThe energy intake changes were associated with changes in macronutrients, and were highly correlated with changes in micronutrients, including zinc, sodium, iron and calcium (data not shown). The trends for changes in nutrient intake remained significant, after adjustment for energy intake, and additional nutrients had a significant trend: a decreasing trend of protein in men, an increasing trend of fat and saturated fat in women (Table 2) ; an increasing trend of vitamin B12 in women and an increasing trend of sodium in men (Table 3) . Table 4 shows the mean intakes of various food groups after 5-and 10-year follow-up. Overall, vegetable consumption did not increase significantly among men or women, although there were some small but significant increases in the mean consumption of subgroups of vegetables, such as avocado (P-value for trend o0.0001), and a decreased consumption of brassica vegetables and potatoes (Figure 1) . Similarly, mean fruit consumption did not increase during the 10-year period, although canned fruit increased significantly among both men and women (by about 10% of a 1992-1994, 1997-1999 and 2002-2004 , using longitudinal data of people who participated and provided a usable FFQ in all three data collection times (n \u00bc 1166) Baseline, n (%) 5 years, n (%) 10 years, n (%) Food consumption trends in older Australians VM Flood et al serve) (P-value for trend o0.0001; Figure 2 ). There was a nonsignificant trend to increase total dairy products consumed by women, and a significant increase in yoghurt consumption in men and women (P-value for trend o0.0001), but a significant reduction in whole-milk intake (P \u00bc 0.002; Figure 3 ). Overall, there was little change in total red meat intake, however there was a trend toward fewer red meat cuts but more red meat dishes (such as casseroles, mince and sausages), particularly among women (P-value for trend \u00bc 0.0003; Figure 4 ). The mean consumption of both fish and eggs increased by a small but significant quantity in the 10-year period, in both men and women, each with an increase of about 10% of a standard serve (P-value for trend o0.0001). Wholemeal/grain bread consumption decreased significantly during the 10-year period, by about a third of a slice of bread (P-value for trend o0.0001; Figure 5 ).\nIn addition, we observed a high correlation between change in long-chain n-3 PUFA and change in fish intake (Pearson's correlation coefficient \u00bc 0.69, Po0.0001), as would be expected given the high contribution of fish to n-3 PUFA . We also observed a high correlation between change in low-fat dairy foods (including reduced fat milk, skim milk and reduced fat yoghurt) and change in calcium of 0.65 (Po0.0001). Food consumption trends in older Australians VM Flood et al Table 5 outlines the main food and nutrition recommendations that have been used in Australia during the period, based on guidelines from the Australian Dietary Guidelines (National Health and Medical Research Council, 1999, 2003) , Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (Smith et al., 1998a) , National Heart Foundation of Australia (1999) and the Nutrient Reference Values (National Health and Medical Research Council, 2005) . A summary of the changes observed in the BMES cohort trend is also shown. Some of the observed dietary changes are consistent with dietary recommendations, such as increased consumption of fish and reduced fat dairy products (with decreased consumption of full-cream milk) and increased folate intake (achieved by fortified foods). However, there are some critical guidelines in which the cohort is less aligned with recommendations, notably the increasing prevalence of obesity, the decreasing intake of wholemeal/grain bread and increasing sodium intake (among women)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "These data provide some useful insights into changing intake of food over 10 years in a cohort of older Australians. Our study results suggest that recommendations about healthy diet, including consumption of fish and low-fat dairy foods, have been heeded to some extent by the participants of this older Australian cohort. However, other recommendations, such as healthy weight maintenance, and greater consumption of wholegrain breads and cereals, have not been shown to have had a measurable effect.\nChanges in the types of foods consumed may be due, in part, to physical changes associated with aging. Poorer dentition may influence preference for choice of softer, easy to eat food items (Sahyoun et al., 2003) , shown with the increasing intake of canned fruit, avocado, eggs and softer meat choices. Some dietary change may be due to the convenience of easier preparation, or use of products with longer shelf life (such as canned fruit and fish), as there may be fewer opportunities to shop as people age. Some of the changes may also reflect changes to the food supply over the 10-year period, with some foods becoming more widely available, such as avocadoes, high-fiber white bread and unsweetened canned fruits.\nThere were relatively few changes in mean nutrient intake over the 10-year period. However, somewhat surprisingly, as women aged they had an increased energy intake, despite their reduced need for energy. It is interesting to note that a higher proportion of women gained more than 5 kg in weight compared to men, especially over the initial 5-year follow-up period. There was no significant correlation between change in weight and change in energy intake over the period, suggesting the possibility of reduced energy use as a part explanation for the observed weight gain. Alternatively, it may be attributable to the difficulty in measuring usual energy intake accurately in individuals and groups. Similar changes to energy intake and macronutrients were also occurring in the wider adult Australian population, as reported from the National Nutrition Surveys 1983-1995, which showed increasing intake of energy, carbohydrate, sugars and starch, in people aged 25-64 years (Cook et al., 2001) . However, no national surveys have been conducted on the Australian adult population since 1995, so we could not find any recent comparison data in relation to Australian trends among older people. Also, the national surveys assessed diet using 24 h recall, whereas we used FFQs. For this reason, the data from the two studies cannot be directly compared. We focused on the direction rather than the magnitude of changes in food and nutrient intake, and compared with data from the national surveys relating only to the change in direction.\nOverall polyunsaturated fat intake decreased, but both quantity and percent of energy from long-chain omega-3 fatty acids increased, mainly from fish. We found omega-3 fatty acid and fish consumption to be important in this cohort, with those consuming the highest quintile of omega-3 fatty acids compared to the lowest at baseline, having a 60% reduced risk for incident age-related macular degeneration 5 years later (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.75), and those consuming fish at least once per week, compared to those who consumed fish less often at baseline, having a 43% reduced mortality from stroke 10 years later (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.97) (Chua et al., 2006; Kaushik et al., 2007) . It is important to note that, as a group, consumption of both this nutrient and fish increased over the 10 years. This finding also has public health implications as these nutrients provide both to overall and to cardiovascular health. It is useful to reflect on these changes to diet, as they have implications for approaches to dietary analyses, indicating a need to take account of both baseline dietary intakes and repeated measures of diet in relation to incident health outcome data (Hu et al., 1999; Joshipura et al., 2008) .\nFolate intake also increased substantially and significantly over the 10-year period largely due to an increase in folate from fortified foods, mainly in breakfast cereals and yeast extracts, which commenced in Australia in 1997 (around the start of the second data collection period) (Abraham and Food consumption trends in older Australians VM Flood et al Flood et al., 2001) . Some authors (Hickling et al., 2005) had predicted that voluntary folate fortification may not be able to achieve any significant changes to folate intake, but these data provide evidence that significant changes have been achieved with voluntary fortification, in at least this subpopulation. In comparison to other longitudinal data sets that have reported food and nutrient changes over time, there are some notable differences. In the United States, a study of 105 men who completed 7-day records over 25 years, aged 27-65 years at baseline, collected from 1961 to 1987, found an increased proportion of energy from alcohol, carbohydrate and an increased PUFA/saturated fatty acid ratio (The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Hallfrisch et al., 1990) . In the study of Danish men and women (n \u00bc 2430) aged 20-70 years, 10-year trend data were examined from cohort and cross-sectional dietary data were collected between 1982-1984 and 1992-1994 , using an FFQ. During the study period both men and women reported a decreased intake of fat, milk, eggs, meat products, white bread and potatoes, and increased intake of low-fat margarine, fruit, raw vegetables, coarse breads, oatmeal, pasta, rice, cakes and candy (Osler et al., 1997) . In a 17-year study of adults from the UK, aged from 36 years at baseline to 53 years at followup (n \u00bc 1253), 5-day food diary-assessed dietary intake indicated decreasing consumption of fat, sodium, iron and copper, with increasing consumption of carbohydrate, protein, calcium, phosphorous, carotene, thiamin, folic acid, and vitamin C, D and E in both men and women; initially energy intake increased in men and women, but by the third assessment period, the energy intake had decreased over the 17-year period since the baseline examinations (Prynne et al., 2005) . Although there are some similarities with our study (such as increased carbohydrate intake among women), there are many differences, which are likely to reflect cultural differences in eating habits, dietary assessment methods, age and time differences in the sample (these studies were conducted 5-20 years earlier than our study).\nThe cohort design, high retention rates and a standardized dietary assessment method used at each assessment are major strengths of this study. We acknowledge the potential limitations of an FFQ for measuring absolute intakes of food and nutrient intakes. However, our work on the validity and reliability of the FFQ shows that it has good repeatability and validity, and it ranks and classifies people relatively accurately into quintiles of the distribution, and has Spearman's correlation coefficients 40.5 for most nutrients (Flood et al., 2004; Smith et al., 1998b) . Thus, although the point estimates of food and nutrient intakes may be over-or underestimated among individuals, with a tendency to overestimate at the group level, the observed changes, measured consistently by the same method over three time points, are likely to be real rather than the effects of measurement error associated with the FFQ. Although, the accuracy of reporting may diminish with age, we found reasonably good validity of the FFQ among older participants in the validation study (Smith et al., 1998b) . These longitudinal data provide valuable information from a survival cohort of older people who have a somewhat higher socioeconomic status, and are therefore likely to represent healthier individuals in the wider population of older people. The observed trends in diet provide a mixed picture of change over time, with several improvements and several declines in healthy food habits among older section of the population.\nAlthough some other large cohort studies have included dietary data from Australians (Barr et al., 2006; Hodge et al., 2007) none has reported comprehensive information about dietary trends over time in the cohorts. Our study data collected from an older population group over 10 years contribute to knowledge about the dietary choices and changes made by individuals as they age. The findings raise questions as to why some dietary recommendations appear to have been followed, such as increased consumption of fish and low-fat dairy products, whereas others have not, such as decreasing use of wholemeal/grain bread. Some observed changes may also reflect changes in the food supply over the 10 years of follow-up. Although there is some benefit to providing clear nutrition guidelines and education messages to the public, it is also important to consider potential barriers to better food choices. Further research into barriers and ways to intervene to make healthier choices, easier choices for the aging population would provide a useful contribution for future investigations."}]
