White and Hoppe (2012) showed that between 1991 and 2009, agricultural production shifted to larger farms. In 1991, for example, family farms with production of more than $1 million accounted for 21 percent of total production. By 2009, this sales class accounted for 39 percent of farm production. Over the same time period, the same study used the median rate of return on equity to document the higher profitability of these larger farms compared to farms in smaller sales categories. O'Donoghue et al. (2011) pointed to innovations in farm organization, business arrangements, and production practices as factors that have allowed farmers to produce more farm output at lower cost. Further, the study showed that a likely contributing factor to the nearly 50 percent increase in U.S. agricultural productivity since 1982, which has long been considered as the main contributor to economic growth in U.S. agriculture (see, Ball, Butault, and Nehring 2002) , was the augmented use of risk management tools (e.g., use of contracts and crop insurance, etc.).\nWhile risk consideration has been extensively examined in production agriculture (e.g., Mapp et al. 1979; Just and Pope 1979; Antle 1983; Harwood et al. 1999; Meuwissen, van Asseldonk, and Huirne 2008; Ullah et al. 2016) , exploring the relationship between risk management per se and economic performance is apt to contribute yet another perspective to the continually growing body of risk-related literature. To mitigate the risk associated with farm production, many farmers rely primarily on their participation in off-farm work and/or in farm programs. For example, Fuller and Mage (1976) noted that off-farm employment enables farm families to spread income risk. Studies by Key, Prager, and Burns (2017) and Hungerford, Motamed, and Cessna (2017) point to newly created programs in the 2014 Farm Act that are tied to fluctuations in prices, yields, and revenues, and which are aimed at risk reduction by producers.\nYet for many others, lowering the probability of adverse economic outcomes is managed by choosing among many alternatives of risk management strategies. The specific objective of this paper is to discern the impact of a farmer adopting a risk management tool, either singly or in combination with other risk management strategies, on the likelihood of achieving a favorable economic position. The paper develops a count index of risk-management strategy utilization in order to test primarily the significance of its role, along with the roles of other socio-economic determinants based on data from the 2015 Agricultural Resource Management survey (ARMS), in securing the placement of the farm operator household in an advantageous economic category. 2 The question of how best to assess the relative economic performance of a farm business has been addressed in a number of studies (see Mishra, El-Osta, and Johnson 1999; Mishra and Morehart 2001) . A commonly used indicator of a favorable financial performance by a farming operation categorizes the farm based on whether its net farm income is positive and its debt-to-asset ratio is less than forty percent (see Park et al. 2011) . Hoppe et al. (2005) characterized top-performing farms as those farm businesses in the highest quartile of the distribution of farm operator's labor and management income (OLMI)."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "A potential weakness of these indicators of financial well-being is that both primarily utilize income from farming, which is highly variable due to the vagaries in weather and/or shifts in market conditions and in prices of farm output (see Mishra and Sandretto 2002; and Dismukes and Durst 2006) . Additionally, to the extent that the relative solvency-based financial indicator depends also on the debt-to-asset ratio which has a long right tail, this measure of economic well-being hence cannot be calculated for the relatively few farming operations that own no assets (Ahrendsen and Katchova 2012) .\n4 sought an indicator of favorable economic performance for farm households by looking first at both the income and wealth levels of the farming unit in comparison to a median-income and median-wealth of all U.S. households. The result of this relative measure of well-being was the placement of the farm household in one of four quadrants: lower-income and higher-wealth, higher-income and lower-wealth, lower-income and lower-wealth, and higher-income and higher-wealth.\nThe closing of the income gap between farm and non-farm households since 1998, which has been attributed to the growth in the earnings from off-farm sources resulting primarily from greater returns to farm household skills employed off the farm (Brown and Weber 2013) , has made the use of the 'high-income, high-wealth' quadrant as developed by , and as was implemented by El-Osta, Mishra, and Morehart (2007) , as a means of categorizing advantageous economic performance less relevant. For example, in 2002, almost half of U.S. farm households had both higher incomes and greater wealth than all U.S. households ; a proportion that now, based on the 2015 ARMS, stands at 64 percent. In this paper, for example, top-performing farm households are defined as those households with farm household income and farm household wealth in excess to a median-income and median-wealth of all farm households; and not of all U.S. households as was done in the study by . As shown in the scatter plot in Figure 1 which depicts how farm households are distributed among the four quadrants delineated relative to a median-income and a median-wealth of farm households (($76,700 and $833,200, respectively) , about 34 percent of all farm households in 2015 are found in this category of top-economic performance.\n5 By the same token, about 16 percent of farm households are found located in the less desirable but nevertheless economically favorable categories of 'high-income, low wealth' and of 'low-income, high-wealth'. The main null hypothesis to be tested in this paper is that there is no significant statistical relationship between the count index of risk management strategies employed by the farm operator and the likelihood of a favorable economic outcome for the farm household. As reported by Hoppe et al. (2005) OLMI adjusts net farm income for implicit costs of capital and unpaid labor contributed by family members other than the operator which is assessed based on mean wage earned by hired farm labor in a State, as reported by the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service. 4 Data from the 2015 ARMS show 1,126 farms out of the 2.03 million farms represented in the sample with no total farm assets."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "While the percentages shown in Figure 1 reflect the distribution of all farm households in the 48 contiguous states in 2015 among the four quadrants, the figure itself excludes those income and wealth levels that exceed the range depicted in the axes of the figure. This was done to allow for a clearer depiction of where the bulk of the households are located with regard to the corresponding farm households' median-income and median-wealth reference lines depicted in the figure. Barry, Escalante, and Bard (2000) noted that agricultural economists have for long examined risk, both conceptually and empirically, with the main focus being oriented towards risk measurement, identification of risk attitudes, and the assessment of the effectiveness of various risk management practices (e.g., Barry 1984; Robison and Barry 1987; Harwoood et al. 1999; Hardaker, Huirne, and Anderson 1997; among others) . The early and important work by Gale Johnson (1947) and by Earl Heady (1952) on financial, marketing, and farm business risk, in addition to risk aversion was emphasized by Barry and Stanton (2003) ."}, {"section_title": "Previous Research", "text": "Various estimation techniques were implemented by researchers as part of investigating risk exposure in farming. Early research on the subject utilized mathematical programming with a focus on examining whole farm planning in the presence of risky alternatives, and under conditions of uncertainty (e.g. Fruend, 1956; Hazell 1971; Mapp et al. 1979) . In an effort to examine systematic (i.e., risk correlated among producers) and non-diversifiable risk, later studies, for example, implemented the use of the coefficient of variation of total indemnities paid by crop insurers in addition to a selection of parametric and non-parametric methods to estimate probability functions of crop yields, which in turn, tend to have implications on the income generating capacity and profits of farm businesses (e.g., Miranda, and Glauber. 1997; Atwood, Shaik, and Watts 2003; Tack, Harri, and Coble 2012) . Conditional quantile regression is applied along with the certainty equivalent concept and welfare measures by Chavas and Shi (2015) to analyze the effects of genetically modified (GM) seed technology and management on risk in corn production in Wisconsin. Hungerford and O'Donoghue (2016) used logistic and Tobit regression procedures in addition to simulation technique to provide detailed examination of the potential for reducing revenue risk among cotton producers by two specific programs [e.g., the Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) and the Stacked Income Protection Plan (STAX)]. The study's findings showed that under the assumption that a cotton farmer selects Revenue Protection with 70 percent coverage, which is considered by the authors as the most common policy and coverage rate among cotton producers, STAX tends to provide higher net payments to producers and greater risk reduction than SCO. Hoppe et al. (2005) used data from the 2001 ARMS and cross-tabulation to examine the characteristics of top-performing farm households. Basing top-performance on whether the farm household is in the top quartile of the distribution of farm operator's labor and management income, findings showed that operator characteristics, business organization, and farm contracting did not seem to be strongly related to financial performance. The study found that farms of top-performing farm households were very large, were more likely to be partnerships or family corporations, and that their operators were younger, and had more formal education than bottom performers. Research by D'Antoni, Mishra, and Chintawar (2009 ) used 2004 -2006 ARMS data along with the multinomial logit regression procedure to predict the likelihood of financial stress among young and beginning farmers based on a solvency measure developed by the Economic Research Service. Findings from the study pointed to farmer's age, size of operation, farm ownership, Applied Economics and Finance Vol. 5, No. 2; 2018 52 and farm type as important factors in the determination of the financial position of the farm business. Kuethe and Morehart (2012) utilized three years of ARMS data and the propensity score matching regression technique to control for the endogeneity of adoption decisions of risk management tool on farm profit. Findings indicated, among others, that the adoption of input price risk management practice improves farm-level profits by 13-17 percent."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Estimation", "text": "Allowing an index R to represent the number of risk management strategies used by the farm operator, the likelihood of a favorable economic position of the jth farm household (i.e., low-income, high-wealth; high-income, low-wealth; and high-income, high-wealth) relative to a disadvantageous position (i.e., low-income, low-wealth) is represented by a latent variable I * as in: \nwhere X is a vector of explanatory variables, and \uf062 is a vector of parameters to be estimated.

Kuethe and Morehart (2012) noted, for example, that when the likelihood of adopting a risk management strategy is directly related to the farm's economic position (e.g., net farm income), operations with certain characteristics may be more likely to implement risk management tools; hence the possibility of endogeneity exits in attempts to regress economic measures on covariates that include the adoption of certain risk management tools."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "The maximum number of risk management strategies that R represents, which will be expounded upon later in the paper, is five."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "The exclusion restriction variable used, as will be discussed in detail in the result section of the paper, is an indicator variable denoting whether the primary occupation of the operator is 'farming/ranching', a variable that is correlated with the endogenous variable R in (2) but not with the outcome variable I in (1).\nregression, called 'equi-dispersion', is restrictive.

The results from the ZIP regression estimation showed that the exclusion restriction variable used (i.e., when the primary occupation of the farmer was farming/ranching) was highly correlated, as required in terms of using valid instruments, with the endogenous variable R. 16 Findings indicated that farmers who are white, and those who work on the farm as hired managers tend to adopt more risk management strategies on their farming operation. In contrast, farmers who fully own their farmland are found with a sizeable lesser usage of risk management strategies than those farmers who partially own their land or who are full renters.\nIn terms of factors with the most impact on the expected number of strategies used by farm operators, results from the ZIP model showed size of the farming operation based on a previous year's farm sales, particularly when farm size is the largest, tend to have the biggest influence. 17 For example, the expected number of risk management strategies adopted by farms with sales of at least $500,000, while holding all other variables constant, are larger than the number used by farms with lower sales by 119% (i.e., by 100[exp(0.785) -1]).

Similar results are found when the operator has a college degree or beyond, or when the farm is organized as a family corporation, and when the farmland is fully owned by the farm household. Table 4 based on the models as described in (7) and (8) indicate that the likelihood of a farm household being in the 'high-income and low-wealth' category is higher if the farm operator has at least a college education, and if the farmer is married. Farmers working on the farm as hired managers and those who operate larger sized farms are more likely to be in this 'income-wealth' group than in the group of 'low income, low-wealth'.\nFindings also indicate that, based on equations (7) and (8) and on the statically significant estimated coefficients, the likelihood of a farmer being in the 'high-income, high-wealth' category tends to increase with age of the operator, particularly if the age is 35 years or older (Table 4) . Results also show that the probability of a farm household falling in the top economic performance is higher when the farm operator has at a college degree or a graduate education. Similarly, a farm household with a married farm operator or whose operator farms in the capacity of a hired manger and/or farms on a larger-sized farm is found with a higher likelihood of being among the top-performing group of farm households.

This information, in turn, allowed for the creation of a count index of risk management strategies, this in addition to a four-pronged economic categorization that has not previously been used in the literature.\nFindings indicate that those farmers who are generally older, with at least a college education are more likely to be 19 When Figure 3 is viewed with the information in Table 2 , 'professional advice' appears as the most likely risk-management strategy to be adopted by farmers; this is regardless of the overall number of strategies utilized. among those farm households who are in the top income-wealth category of economic performance. These findings are not surprising as earlier studies have found, among other conclusions, a positive association between higher propensities of favorable economic outcome and older age, higher levels of education (e.g., Huffman and Lange 1989; Hoppe et al. 2005) , and larger farm sizes (Perrin and Winkleman 1976; White and Hoppe 2012) . Findings also indicate that older farmers, those with a college degree or beyond, and those who are inclined to layer up in the number of adopted risk management strategies are more likely to be in a performance category that favors wealth over income; i.e., in the category of 'low-income, high-wealth'.\nThe increased interest in issues related to risk abatement has been the subject of debate by policymakers not only in the U.S. where such a debate contributed to the shaping of some recent farm programs and regulation (e.g., as was introduced in the 2014 farm bill), but also in Europe as well. 20 For example, a study by Sulewski and Kloczko-Gajewska (2014) assert that income management issues were added in the new law regulations concerning the Common Agricultural Policy after 2013. To the extent that farming is a business faced with ever-rising risks and uncertainty due to the vagaries of the weather, to crop and/or livestock diseases, and to unexpected fluctuating market conditions, how farmers manage risk becomes vital to their economic bottom line.\nFindings from this paper that indicate a higher likelihood of wealth-biased economic wellbeing to be associated with increased usage of risk management strategies should help in shedding light on what farmers could do, not only to address how to avoid the potential of negative outcomes from price or market and production factors that sometime fall beyond their control, but also to increase their likelihood in moving to a favorable economic position. As noted by Turvey (1992) , an unintended effect of using one of the risk management strategies as referenced in this paper, namely crop insurance, is the potential for increased likelihood of high-risk crops entering farmers' production plans, with such likelihood increasing with increased coverage coupled with higher levels of insurance subsidies.\nOne limitation of this research is that it only considered a partial listing of risk management strategies; primarily due to lack of needed data. For example, the 2015 ARMS did not have information on farmers' use of futures and options markets to lock in prices when crops are harvested. Other strategies with available information in the ARMS that will be explored in future research considering their potential role in lessening the variability in total income will include those related to off-farm labor participation and to participation in farm programs; despite the complexities surrounding their use due to endogeneity concerns and the need for finding appropriate instruments."}]
