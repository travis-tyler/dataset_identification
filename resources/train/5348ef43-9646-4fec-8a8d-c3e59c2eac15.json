The current animal models of AD pathogenesis and the human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not resulted in a single common origin for the irregular but common incidences of AD, thus implying extensive heterogeneity in the underlying pathophysiology. One clear underlying pathophysiologic feature of AD has been identified and this centered on \"the amyloid and tau pathology\" that is believed to lead to neuronal loss, decreased synaptic density, brain atrophy, and a subsequent progressive cognitive decline associated with AD (Yankner et al., 2008) . Nevertheless, recent research into AD provides compelling evidence for a variety of additional pathological events including oxidative stress and apoptosis (Mamelak, 2007) .\nIt is has been postulated that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) over a period time is negatively correlated with mitochondrial function and significantly contributes to the aging process (Wallace and Fan, 2009) . As the primary source of ROS, mitochondria play pivotal roles in maintaining cellular energy balance and lie at the nexus of the signaling pathways controlling apoptosis. As such, it is conceivable that mitochondria may mediate the development and clinical outcome of AD. In fact, numerous research findings suggest a link between altered cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMR glc ) in subjects with mitochondrial mutations (Lindroos et al., 2009) . PET imaging studies have demonstrated a detectable decline in cerebral metabolism prior to any brain atrophy or abnormality found by neuropsychiatric testing in subjects who later developed AD (Reiman et al., 2004) . Postmortem studies on AD brains have revealed a reduction in the mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins in the posterior cingulate (Liang et al., 2008) . The projection neurons of the cerebral cortex which tend to die first in AD, and show increased vulnerability to decreased mitochondrial efficiency (Gotz et al., 2009 ).\nThe Down-syndrome (DS) brain, with accelerated amyloid deposition and high propensity for AD, implies a possible synergy between amyloid deposition and ROS production. The structural changes that caused DS harbor APP, a precursor molecule of amyloid \u03b2 as well as gene SOD1 encoding an enzyme named superoxide dismutase 1. SOD1 marks the first important step in scavenging and neutralizing ROS in cells (Engidawork and Lubec, 2001 ). The amyloid \u03b2, a product of APP processing, has been shown to be transported into the mitochondria through the TOMM complex (Devi et al., 2006) and inhibit the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) in line with APOE (Crouch et al., 2005) . In addition, DNA sequence variations within both the APOE and TOMM40 genes have been found to be significantly associated with AD in genome-wide association studies (Potkin et al., 2009; Roses et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2010) . Mitochondria efficiency may decrease in response to amyloid toxicity and interfering proteins like APOE and Drp1 (Cho et al., 2009 ) that initiate a \"vicious cycle\" in ROS production facilitating apoptosis and leading to cell death (Reddy, 2009) . Therefore, it is plausible link AD to the functional status of mitochondria that critically relies on the mitochondrially expressed OXPHOS proteins (Fosslien, 2001) . Because the mitochondria genome differs from the nuclear genome in the rate of accumulation of mutations, it has been proposed that some common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms probably alter protein functions and compromise mitochondria efficiency (Tuppen et al., 2009) . There is growing evidence that certain mtDNA clusters and polymorphisms as well as the somatically acquired mutations could predispose to psychiatric disorders (Coskun et al., 2004; Jou et al., 2009; McMahon et al., 2000; Zecavati and Spence, 2009 ).\nTo further elucidate the relation between mitochondrial DNA sequences polymorphisms and risk of AD, we calculated the association of mitochondrial haplogroups derived from 138 mitochondrial polymorphisms in 358 ADNI subjects. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report considering mitochondrial SNPs in the context of a longitudinal clinical study of AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics", "text": "The ADNI data was previously collected across 50 research sites.

The primary goal of ADNI is to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians in the development of new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe principal investigator of this initiative is Michael W.

The nucleotide changes of the 138 mitochondrial SNPs for each subject were compared to rCRS and used to identify motifs that characterize mitochondrial haplotype (van Oven and Kayser, 2009 ). Assignment of each individual mtDNA \"sequence\" to specific haplogroups was performed according to criteria as published (Torroni et al., 1996 ) (e.g. haplogroup J is define by mutations at locations 11251, 16126, and no mutation at 16294).

In order to avoid the confounding effect due to population stratification, we assessed evidence for genetic background heterogeneity and by leveraging publicly available, well-defined populations. Briefly, Phase 2 HapMap dataset (n=270 subjects) were merged with the entire genome-wide scan of 816 ADNI subjects (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/\u223cpurcell/plink/res.shtml) (Enoch et al., 2006) .

Subsequently, Multidimensional Distance Scaling (MDS) analysis was carried out on the genome-wide IBS pair-wise-distance matrix of the merged dataset to display the structure of the distance between individuals as a geometrical picture (JMP Genomics 4.00). For the purpose of this study, the ADNI individuals that clustered with CEU founders (Utah resident with ancestry from northern and western Europe), and belonged to the diagnostic AD (n=170) or control (n=188) groups were selected for further statistical analyses.

The frequency distribution of the clusters is consistent with the reported worldwide mitochondrial haplogroup distribution reported at the MITOMAP database (www.mitomap.org).

The SNP DNA position, minor allele frequency in AD and CTRL, asymptotic p-value, odds ratio, confidence interval, functional consequence and haplogroup specificity are reported in Table  4 .\nAnalysis of individual SNP revealed that risk of AD was increased in subjects who carried minor allele MitoA11467G (OR=2.22; 95% CI, 1.30 3.78; p value\u22640.003). The MitoA11467G is a synonymous polymorphism located in gene NADH dehydroenase 4 (ND4). The encoded protein of this gene is a subunit of a large enzyme complex known as complex I. Complex I is responsible for the first step in the oxidative phosphorylation process by transferring electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. The second most significant SNP was MitoA12308G (OR=2.03; 95% CI, 1.23 3.34; p value\u22640.006) located in a tRNA which transfers the amino acid leucine for protein synthesis. This polymorphism was found highly significant in an interaction with 10398G (empirical P value = 0.0028) suggesting some women are at increased risk to develop breast cancer (Kinoshita et al., 1996) .

Defects in mitochondrial COIII gene implicated in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) (Brown et al., 1992; Eichhorn-Mulligan and Cestari, 2008) and age-dependent accumulation of mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in cytochrome c oxidase has been implicated in the onset of sporadic AD (Davis et al., 1997; Lin and Beal, 2006) MitoC16270T (OR=2.527; 95% CI, 1.16 4.41; p value=\u22640.048) is located in the hypervariable segment assumed to represent a mutational hotspot (see summary in Table 4) Besides age as a major risk for AD, APOE 4 is the most consistently replicated genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Since there is a significant APOE allele frequency difference in our cohort, a subsequent analysis was performed to assess the potential for an APOE4 cofounding or interactive effect. Logistic regression revealed no evidence for an interaction effect. However, APOE revealed strong association with AD at level of OR=4.11-5.35 independently of mtSNPs.\nThe location and potential effect on gene function of the significant mutations in relation to mtDNA are depicted in Figure 3 .\nThus, based on \u03c7 2 tests and logistic regression analysis, the APOE4 allele, and the mitochondrial haplogroup UK, as well as specific mitochondrial polymorphisms, are significantly associated with AD in the ADNI cohort. Given the functional consequences of the significant mitochondrial polymorphisms, the possession of these polymorphisms may predispose to AD."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Recent research studies have found links between mitochondrial dysfunction and common diseases of aging, such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Wang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2007) . A growing body of evidence suggests a reasonable association between amyloid-\u03b2 toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and neuronal damage in AD pathophysiology (Mancuso et al., 2006) The impact of the dysfunctional mitochondria on the integrity of neuronal cells is not fully understood. Mitochondria are exclusively positioned to play a pivotal role in neuronal cell survival or death by controlling energy metabolism and apoptotic pathways. Mitochondrial malfunction can alter the delicate bioenergetics balance making neuronal cells vulnerable to challenge (Wallace et al., 2010) . Mitochondrial haplogroups and polymorphisms have also received substantial consideration in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases (Tuppen et al., 2009) . Mitochondrial associations were found between AD and haplogroup J with increased susceptibility, while haplogroup T was found to have protective effect (Chagnon et al., 1999) . Increased risk of AD in males with haplogroup U (van der Walt et al., 2004) as well as the mitochondrial tRNA(Glu) 4336 SNP have been reported (Brown et al., 1996; Shoffner et al., 1993) . In addition, we report 5 mitochondrial SNPs, 3 of which define haplogroup UK and 2 of them specific to certain UK haplotypes in association exhibit associations with AD in the ADNI cohort.\nOne potential explanation for the associations is that mtDNA haplogroups correlates with genetic background that are distinctive between geographically separated populations. However, our population stratification analysis did not find significant difference between the major haplogroups and nuclear DNA-based genetic background and hence argues against a population substructure confounding effect. Another potential explanation is that the underlying mechanism for the predisposition for Alzheimer disease is related to energy deficiency. Observations on longevity, neurodegenerative disease susceptibility (van der Walt et al., 2004; Wallace et al., 1998 ), sperm viability (Montiel-Sosa et al., 2006 , and climate adaptation propose association between functional mtDNA variations and ATP production efficiency and correlated ROS and heat generation in different haplogroups (Arning et al., 2010) . The mtDNA haplogroup most prone to energy deficiency in Europe are haplogroups U and Uk (Hendrickson et al., 2008) . It is conceivable that additional genetic risk factors further compromise the mitochondrial ATP production causing it to fall below the threshold level needed for optimal neuronal functioning. It is important to note that mitochondria genome expresses 37 genes and other approximately 1500-2000 nuclear genes may play critical role in optimal mitochondria function (Wallace, 2008) . This interaction between the two genomes may influence brain function (Roubertoux et al., 2003) and may contribute to the complexity of AD pathophysiology.\nDespite few contradictory research findings in haplogroup association to AD (Chinnery et al., 2000; Coppede et al., 2007; Elson et al., 2006) , the design of ADNI provides the opportunity to follow up our findings with neuroimaging and psychometric examination in addition to a nuclear DNA-based GWAS interrogation. This comprehensive approach has the potential to provide novel insight into the underlying pathomechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and possibly open up a new prospect for novel pharmacological targets and therapeutic strategies (Wallace, 2005) .\nData used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Overall distribution of mtDNA haplogroups of 358 subjects in the ADNI dataset.
