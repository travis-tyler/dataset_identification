In past editions of the Summary Report, tables reporting citizenship status have displayed U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary visa holders as separate citizenship categories. Beginning with this year's edition only two citizenship categories will be reported, and the data of U.S. citizen doctorate recipients will be combined with that of permanent resident doctorate recipients. New Race Category. Respondents to the SED who indicated more than one race will now be reported in a separate \"multi-race\" category in all Summary Report tables reporting race/ethnicity data. In previous Summary Reports these respondents had been grouped into the \"Other/Unknown\" race/ethnicity category. New Publisher. The SED Summary Report is now published by the National Science Foundation on behalf of the other federal sponsors. Previous Summary Reports had been published by the SED survey contractor. T his year's edition of the Summary Report from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) reflects six changes from previous editions. Multiple Year Format. Both 2007 and2008 data are presented in this report to expedite release of 2 years of data. Only a few 2007 SED data tables could be released in 2008, pending development of new data protection procedures. The full complement of 2007 SED data tables is released in a special section in this report, without accompanying discussion. The narrative section of the report discusses the results of the 2008 SED, with figures and 2008 summary and detailed data tables. Future editions of the SED Summary Report will return to a single-year format. Report Organization. The current-year summary and detailed data tables now follow the body of the report. The 2007 data supplement follows the current-year data tables. Locating all data tables together should make it easier for readers to find the data they want. Appendix A now provides the technical notes and includes information for both the 2007 and 2008 SED cycles. Appendix B includes the questionnaires for both survey years. New Disclosure Protection Procedure. A new disclosure protection procedure has been applied to detailed data tables 36 and 37 (formerly appendix tables A-1 and A-2), resulting in minor revisions to the tables. In a series of outreach meetings held late in 2008, representatives of the SED data user community provided important insights that shaped the design of this new procedure.

Although the 2008 total is the largest number of research doctorates awarded in the history of U.S. higher education, the rate of increase over 2007 was small, 1.4% (figure 1). The long-term trend in the number of new research doctorates is characterized by considerable growth. Since the SED began in 1957, the number of doctorates granted by U.S. universities has, on average, increased by about 3.5% per year. Between 1961-when the number of annual doctorates awarded surpassed 10,000 for the first time-and 1971, the number of doctorates awarded grew at an average annual rate of nearly 12%, and the total almost tripled (31,867). From 1972 to 1985 the growth rate slowed, then declined, and the number of doctorates awarded annually stabilized at about 31,000. In 1986, a second period of growth began that persisted until 1998, when 42,638 research doctorates were awarded. From 1998 to 2002, the number of doctorates awarded fluctuated, reaching a low point in 2002. Growth resumed from 2003 to 2008, leading to an all-time high in 2008 for number of doctorates earned (figure 2, table 1)."}, {"section_title": "Doctorate-Granting Institutions", "text": "The SED project closely monitors the universe of institutions that grant research doctorates, and it annually reviews Trends among Doctorate Recipients FIGURE 1.

The data-collection contractor for the SED contacts newly identified institutions, determines whether those institutions grant research doctorates (see appendix A), and adds institutions to the SED universe when they award a qualifying degree. Detailed data tables 45a and 45b display the full list of institutions that granted research doctorates in 2008. During the 2008 academic year, there were 421 universities in the United States and Puerto Rico that awarded at least one research doctorate. The mean number of doctorates awarded per institution was 116, and the median was 43 (table 2). As the substantial difference between the mean and the median indicates, a relatively small number of institutions award a disproportionately large number of doctorates. The top 10% of institutions granted nearly half (46%) of all doctorates in 2008, and institutions in the 80th to 89th percentiles accounted for more than one fifth (22%) (figure 3). The trend data in table 2 show that the median number of degrees awarded per institution grew rapidly during the late 2 Doctorates are reported by academic year (from 1 July of one year through 30 June of the following year) and include research doctorates in all fields. Research doctoral programs are oriented toward preparing students to make original intellectual contributions in a field of study and typically entail the completion of a dissertation. Doctoral degrees, such as the PhD, DSc, and research EdD, are covered by this survey; professional degrees (e.g., MD, DDS, DVM, JD, PsyD, DMin) are not. A full list of included degrees is in appendix A. Before 2001, the SED covered only the first research doctorate earned. Since then, the SED has also covered the second research doctorate. In 2008, a total of 109 individuals earned a second research doctorate. FIGURE 2. Doctorates awarded by U.S. colleges and universities: 1957-2008 Number of doctorate recipients See Table 1.

Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1972 and the enrollment boosts that accompanied the availability of student deferments from military service, the median number quickly dropped to 42 in 1973 and has vacillated between 35 and 46 since. In 2008 the University of California-Berkeley granted the largest number of doctorates, 856, or 2% of all doctorates awarded that year, followed by the University of Texas-Austin (821), the University of , the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign (735), and the University of California-Los Angeles (724). In 2008 (as has been the case for the past several years), the 10 institutions awarding the highest number of doctoral degrees granted approximately 15% of all doctorates (table 3, detailed data tables 45a, 45b). Among the states, California universities led the nation by awarding 5,925 doctorates, or 12% of all doctorates in 2008 (figure 4, table 4). New York institutions followed with 3,986, then Texas (3,384), Massachusetts (2,591), Pennsylvania (2,463), Illinois (2,362), Florida (2,018), Ohio (1,921), and Michigan (1,599). These nine states accounted for 54% of all doctorates awarded in 2008."}, {"section_title": "Field of Study", "text": "There were 292 fields of specialization into which the SED classified research doctoral degrees in 2008 (listed in the SED questionnaire, appendix B). Because fields of specialization are dynamic entities that reflect the evolving programs of researchers and their constituencies, the SED list is assessed periodically to identify emerging fields and is modified, as needed, to accommodate changes in the world of doctoral education. Consistent with past practice in presenting the SED data, the fields of specialization are grouped into seven broad  fields: life sciences (including agricultural sciences/ natural resources, biological/biomedical sciences, and health sciences), physical sciences (including mathematics and computer and information sciences), social sciences (including psychology), engineering, education, humanities, and a heterogeneous group classified as other fields (including business, communication, social work, and theological programs). Detailed data tables 36, 37, and 47 report numbers of doctorate recipients by field of specialization. The institutions that in 2008 granted the largest numbers of doctorates in each of the seven broad fields are listed in table 3. The Johns Hopkins University led all universities in life sciences (235), the University of California-Berkeley granted the most doctorates in the physical (192) and social sciences (159), and the Georgia Institute of Technology granted the most engineering doctorates (319). Teachers College of Columbia University led all universities in education doctorates awarded (154), Harvard had the highest total in the humanities (138), and the University of Texas-Austin granted the most doctorates in the diverse \"other fields\" category (70). The numbers of doctorates awarded in the seven broad fields were also concentrated in a relatively small number of institutions. The 10 institutions that granted the largest number of doctorates awarded 15% of all doctorates in 2008, but the concentration was higher in five of the seven broad fields: 27% in engineering, 22% in humanities, and 18% in life sciences, physical sciences, and other fields (table 3). The slight overall increase of 1.4% in doctorates awarded between the 2007 and 2008 academic years was a result of increases in five of the seven broad fields: life sciences and social sciences were each up 4%, education and engineering by 2% each, and physical sciences by 1%. The increases in In the broad field of engineering, electrical and related engineering showed considerable growth. Nearly one-third of the total increase in engineering doctorate recipients from 1978 to 2008 was in this field, which increased from 539 in 1978 to 2,299 in 2008. The subfield of industrial engineering showed the greatest growth during this 30-year period; however, the absolute numbers for this field are still relatively small (281 in 2008). those fields were partially offset by a decrease in humanities (8%) and other fields (2%) (detailed data table 47). Since 1990 life sciences has been the largest broad field, and 11,088 doctorates were awarded in 2008. Over the 5-year period 2003-08, the number of doctorates awarded in engineering, physical sciences, and life sciences have shown the largest increases: 49%, 39%, and 30%, respectively (table 5). Doctorate completions in education and humanities were slightly lowerjust under 1% and 9% fewer degrees awarded, respectively, in 2008 than were awarded 5 years earlier (figures 5, 6; table 5). Life sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering-the four broad fields that together constitute \"science and engineering\" (S&E)-represented 71% of all doctorates awarded in 2008. S&E doctorates accounted for 67% of all doctorates in 1998, 65% of the total in 1988, and 58% in 1978 (table 5). The 30-year comparisons for all seven broad fields are shown in figure 7. The relative shares of graduates in life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering were greater in 2008 than in 1978, relative shares of graduates in social sciences, humanities, and education were smaller, and relative shares of graduates in other fields in 1978 and 2008 were about the same (figure 7). At the major field level, biological/biomedical sciences (within life sciences), computer and information sciences (within physical sciences), and electrical and related engineering were the fields that showed the greatest increase in their relative share over the past 30 years (5 percentage points for biological sciences, and 3 percentage points for computer and information science and electrical and related engineering). Education research showed the greatest decline in relative share, down 5 percentage points in 2008 as compared with 1978 (table 5). The numbers of doctorate recipients in the largest subfields within the seven broad fields are shown in table 5. The main fields of growth within life sciences were health sciences, which grew from 512 doctorate recipients in 1978 to 2,094 in 2008, and biological/biomedical sciences, which grew from 3,516 to 7,793. Within these two subfields, the fine fields that increased the most over the past decade are epidemiology, genetics/genomics, and neurosciences. In physical sciences, the most growth occurred in computer and information sciences, increasing from 121 doctorate recipients in 1978 to 1,786 in 2008. The largest growth in social sciences was in the diverse \"other social sciences\" subfield. Within this subfield, the fine fields of geography, area/ethnic/ cultural/gender studies, and public policy analysis experienced the most growth over the past decade (detailed data table 47). FIGURE 5. Science and engineering doctorates awarded, by broad field of study: Selected years, 1978Selected years, -2008  The numbers of new doctorate recipients increased in two of the three broad non-S&E fields (humanities and other fields); however, there was a decrease in the proportion of the cohort that earned doctoral degrees in humanities. The largest growth in humanities subfields was in \"other humanities.\" The detailed field totals in detailed data table 47 indicate that, over the past decade, the other humanities fields with increasing numbers of doctorate recipients included American/U.S. studies, archaeology, and religion/religious studies. Within other fields, the largest growth was seen in the subfield of business and management, from 713 in 1978 to 1,437 in 2008. The numbers of doctorates awarded in education dropped over the 30-year period. The only subfield within education that showed growth from 1978 to 2008 was education administration, from 1,455 doctorates to 2,248 (table 5, detailed data  table 47)."}, {"section_title": "Demographic Characteristics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sex", "text": "In 2008, the number of doctorates awarded to men rose by 95 over the previous year, and doctorates awarded to women rose by 612 (figure 8; detailed data tables 49,50). Women's share of all doctorates earned in 2008 was 46%, similar to that in 2007 (table 6). 2008 was the 13th consecutive year in which the representation of female doctorate recipients has surpassed 40%. Women constituted 45% of all doctorate recipients in 2003, 42% in 1998, and 27% in 1978 (table 6). The proportion of doctorates earned by women has also grown consistently within all of the broad fields of study. Women constituted over two thirds (67%) of all education doctorate recipients for 2008 and were the majority in social sciences (58%), life sciences (53%), and humanities (52%). The representation of women among doctorate recipients in physical sciences and engineering for 2008 was 28% and 22%, respectively (figure 9). However, these percentages represent significant increases over the last 30 years. In 1978, when 27% of all doctorate recipients were women, 10% of the doctorates in physical sciences and 2% in engineering were awarded to women. Less dramatic but similar long-term trends are discernible in other broad fields as well. Between 1978 and 2008 the proportion of female doctorate recipients increased from 23% to 53% in the life sciences, from 31% to 58% in the social sciences, and from 38% to 52% in humanities fields (figure 9, table 6). In 2008 women constituted 41% of S&E doctorate recipients and 58% of those earning doctorates in non-S&E fields. Of the major fields that evidenced greater than 60% growth in the proportion of women over the past decade, all were in engineering (table 7). The largest growth in the share of female doctorate recipients from 1998 to 2008 was observed in other engineering (80%), electrical and related engineering (72%), industrial engineering (63%), and aerospace/aeronautical engineering (63%) Race/Ethnicity of U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents A total of 6,981 U.S. citizens and permanent residents who are members of racial/ethnic minority groups were awarded of the minority groups in 2008, followed by blacks (2,030), Hispanics (1,765), persons of multiple race (520), American Indians (123), and Native Hawaiians (96). A total of 249 U.S. citizens reported that they were not Hispanic but did not report their racial background in the 2008 survey. These individuals are not counted here as racial/ethnic minorities. They doctorates in 2008, 23% of the U.S. citizens and permanent residents who earned research doctorates and reported race/ ethnicity (table 8). 3 (In this report, American Indians, Asians, blacks, Hispanics, Native Hawaiians, and individuals who reported more than one race are considered to be minority racial/ethnic groups). This number is higher than in 2007, when 6,587 minority group members earned research doctorates (22% of the total) (detailed data table 48). Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents who reported race/ethnicity, Asians earned the most doctorates (2,543) FIGURE 8. Doctorate recipients, by sex: 1998-2008 Number  1978 1988 1998 2008 and the Native Hawaiians are grouped in the \"other\" category and are not shown separately in table 8 or figure 10. 4 The number of minority doctorate recipients among U.S. citizens and permanent residents in 2008 was 21% higher than the total in 2003 and 19% higher than in 1998. Doctorate production among non-Hispanic whites showed a more modest increase (7%) from 2003 to 2008 and decreased by 4% from 1998 to 2008. Although rates of change have varied between 1988 and 2008, the historical trend has been growth in the number of doctorates awarded to racial/ethnic minorities throughout the entire 20-year period. The 20-year increases were greater for Hispanics (154%), than for blacks (110%), Asians (106%), and American Indians (31%) ( figures 10, 11; table 8). Minority group members were most highly represented in 2008 in the broad fields of engineering (27% of U.S. citizens and permanent residents earning doctorates), education (26%), and other fields (26%). The lowest percentages of minorities were in humanities (18%) and physical sciences (20%) (figure 12). The proportional representation of the different minority groups varied by broad field. Asians were the largest contingent in engineering, physical sciences, and life sciences, representing 62%, 54%, and 47%, respectively, of all minority group members earning doctorates in those broad fields during the 2008 academic year. Blacks were the largest minority population in education (53%) and other fields (44%), and Hispanics were the largest minority population in social sciences (34%) and humanities (32%). This pattern of relative representation has been consistently observed since 1988, except in the social sciences and other fields (table 8). (See table 9 for the numbers of minority doctorate recipients in each of the 25 subfields in 2008.) The pattern of growth for the aggregate U.S. citizen and permanent resident minority populations also held for most of the separate minority groups within most of the seven broad fields of study from 1988 to 2008. The general pattern for minority recipients has been one of increases from 1988 to 2008. Within the broad fields of study, however, there were some noteworthy trends. One was that the number of American Indian doctorate recipients fell in FIGURE 10. Doctorates awarded to U.S. citizen and permanent resident racial/ethnic minorities, by selected race/ethnicity: Selected years, 1988Selected years, -2008 Number 4 Following the federal standards established for the 2000 decennial census of the U.S. population, the SED changed the way in which race and ethnicity were requested starting with the 2001 questionnaire. The new format asked respondents to mark one or more racial categories that apply to them, rather than a single category as had been requested since 1974, when race and ethnicity questions were first added to the SED questionnaire. Additional changes included separating Pacific Islanders from Asians and creating a new category, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, and adding a Cuban response option to the Hispanic ethnicity question. The 2008 SED questionnaire is provided in appendix B. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, the balance of male and female doctorate recipients in 2008 varied among racial/ethnic groups. Just over half (51%) of doctorates earned by whites were awarded to women. For the third straight year, women were the majority doctorate recipients in all U.S. citizen and permanent resident minority populations: 64% of blacks, 58% of Hispanics, 59% of American Indians, 55% of Asians, and 55% of multiracial doctorate recipients (figure 13; detailed data tables 48-50). Table 10 lists the universities that awarded the largest number of doctorates to members of minority racial/ethnic groups every broad field but the life sciences in 2008 relative to 1998. 5 Moreover, increases in black and Hispanic representation within the life sciences have been especially large over the past decade (table 8). the doctorates awarded in life sciences and other fields (69% and 64%, respectively) in 2008 (table 11). Temporary visa holders earned the majority of doctorates awarded in engineering (60%) and just under one-half (48%) of the doctorates awarded in physical sciences. In absolute numbers, U.S. citizens and permanent residents earned more doctorates in life sciences than in any of the other broad fields, whereas engineering was the most prevalent broad field of degree for those in the United States on temporary visas. The trend toward increasing female representation in the doctoral cohorts is particularly striking for U.S. citizens and permanent residents. In 2008, 52% of all doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens and permanent residents went to women. This marks the sixth consecutive year in which the majority of U.S. citizens and permanent residents receiving research doctorates were women (detailed data tables 48, 50). In contrast, among those doctorate recipients holding temporary visas, 35% were women. That percentage is, like the figure for U.S. women, near an all-time high (detailed data tables 48, 50). Women holding temporary visas were more concentrated in S&E fields of study than were female U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Women holding temporary visas represented 23% of all female doctorate recipients in 2008, but they earned 28% of the doctorates granted to women in life sciences, 41% of the doctorates earned by women in physical sciences, and 50% of the doctorates earned by women in engineering (detailed data tables 38, 39). The 20 institutions awarding the largest numbers of doctorates to temporary visa holders in 2008 are listed in table 13. between 2004 and 2008 and the number of doctorates granted by each university. Over that interval, five institutions-University of California-Los Angeles, University of California-Berkeley, Stanford University, University of Southern California, and Harvard-awarded a total of 1,860 doctorates to Asians, or 16% of all doctorates awarded by U.S. universities to Asians. Howard University awarded, by far, the most doctorates to blacks (334), followed by Nova Southeastern University (170). These two institutions granted 5% of all the doctorates awarded to blacks over this period. The leading institutions awarding doctorates to Hispanics were the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras, University of California-Los Angeles, University of California-Berkeley, and the University of Texas-Austin. Oklahoma State University awarded the largest number of doctorates to American Indians (30) and University of California-Berkeley awarded the most doctorates to multiracial graduates (88). The concentration of minority doctorate recipients in certain institutions is noticeably greater than for the doctoral population as a whole. Over the 2004-08 period the 10 universities granting the largest numbers of doctorates to all doctorate recipients conferred 15% of all doctoral degrees. However, over the same time period, the 10 universities that awarded the most doctorates to Asians granted 25% of all Asian doctorates; for blacks the corresponding figure was 16%; for Hispanics it was 21%; for American Indians it was 24%; and for multiracial doctorate recipients it was 22% (table 10)."}, {"section_title": "Citizenship", "text": "Each year, the SED gathers information concerning the U.S. citizenship status and country of citizenship of the new doctorate recipients at the time of graduation. Of the 2008 doctorate recipients with known citizenship status (94% of the total), 67% were U.S. citizens or permanent residents (i.e., \"green card\" holders), and 33% were non-U.S. citizen temporary visa holders (table 11). The proportion of non-U.S. citizen temporary visa holders earning doctorates from U.S. institutions has increased over time. The 5-year snapshots shown in table 11 indicate that the percentage of new doctorates awarded to individuals on temporary visas rose from 12% of all doctorate recipients who reported citizenship in 1978 to 33% in 2008. The growing numbers of doctorates awarded to foreign students on temporary visas has accounted for the majority of the overall growth in the number of doctorate recipients since 1978. U.S. citizens and permanent residents earned more than threefourths of the doctorates awarded in social sciences, education, and humanities (77%, 91%, and 84% of those reporting citizenship status, respectively), as well as about two-thirds of baccalaureate degree. Black, Hispanic, and American Indian recipients' parents were less likely to have gone beyond high school and were far less likely than parents of white, Asian, and multiracial recipients to have attained a baccalaureate or advanced degree. Doctorate recipients who were U.S. citizens or permanent residents were more likely than those holding temporary visas to report that their mothers attained at least a baccalaureate degree (52% and 41%, respectively). Similarly, U.S. citizens and permanent residents were more likely to report that their fathers attained at least a baccalaureate degree (61%) than were non-U.S. citizens who held a temporary visa (57%). The distributions of parental education by the broad fields in table 14 reflect, in part, the different racial/ethnic and citizenship compositions of the fields. Doctorate recipients in humanities displayed the highest percentages of both mothers (65%) and fathers (55%) with at least a baccalaureate degree. The lowest percentages of baccalaureate or higher degrees achieved by fathers or mothers were reported by doctorate recipients in the broad field of education (43% for fathers and 35% for mothers). Education also had the highest percentage of parents whose formal education ended at high school or before. The broad field of humanities had the lowest percentage of parents who did not go beyond high school. Over the past 30 years the overall trend has been toward parents of doctorate recipients being more highly educated (figure 14; table 15). In 1978, 42% of doctorate recipients reported that neither of their parents had attained an education beyond a high school diploma, and about one in five (21%) reported that at least one parent had an advanced degree. By 1993 the proportion of doctorate recipients reporting an advanced degree as highest parental education (33%) surpassed those reporting a high school diploma or less (31%). By 2008 the proportions in the most-and leasteducated groups had almost completely reversed, with 21% of doctorate recipients reporting highest parental education of a high school diploma or less and 40% reporting at least one parent with an advanced degree.\nThe variable CITIZ is used to identify non-U.S. citizens for whom visa status was unknown. A new code frame for the data was introduced in 2000. (See table A-4 for descriptions of variable names.) Beginning in 2000, a logical assignment to code 4 was made if all follow-up attempts for missing citizenship were unsuccessful. The assignment was made for 1997-2003 records if three out of four variables-BIRTHPL, HSPLACE, Graduate school time-to-degree medians presented in reports published before were based only on years. Some medians would be the same regardless of the method of computation, but the new method generally yields slightly different results.

Since the start of the survey in 1957, the SED has collected detailed information about master's and baccalaureate degrees earned by research doctorate recipients. The SED has also collected information pertaining to additional postsecondary degrees earned, as well as community college enrollments. The SED The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign awarded the largest number of doctorates to temporary visa holders (374)."}, {"section_title": "Parental Education Background", "text": "Since 1963, the SED has asked new doctorate recipients to report their fathers' and mothers' highest level of educational attainment. As was the case in previous Summary Reports, responses are grouped into four categories: high school diploma or less, some college, baccalaureate degree, and advanced degree, including a master's, doctorate, or professional degree. 6 Doctorate recipients' fathers and mothers differed in educational attainment at the highest and lowest ends of the spectrum but were quite similar in terms of earning a bachelor's degree and completing some college. The 2008 data indicate that 27% of recipients' fathers had earned no more than a high school diploma; the corresponding figure for their mothers was 35% (table 14). Fourteen percent of doctorate recipients had a father who had attended college but did not attain a baccalaureate degree; 17% of the mothers of doctorate recipients in 2008 achieved this level of education. Over one-fourth (26%) of doctorate recipients indicated that their fathers earned a baccalaureate degree; the percentage whose mother earned a baccalaureate degree was also 26%. At the upper end of the parental-education range, over one third (34%) of doctorate recipients' fathers held an advanced degree, compared with the 23% whose mothers had an advanced degree. Male and female doctorate recipients showed some differences in their parents' educational backgrounds. Female doctorate recipients tended to report higher educational attainment for their mothers than did their male counterparts. Specifically, 24% of women, compared with 22% of men, reported that their mothers attained an advanced degree, whereas 32% of women, compared with 37% of men, reported that their mothers attained no more than a high school diploma. The reported educational backgrounds of fathers differed little between male and female doctorate recipients. There is considerable variation in parental education attainment by race/ethnicity, citizenship status, and broad field of study. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, Asian, white, and multiracial doctorate recipients were more likely than members of other racial/ethnic groups to come from families in which one or both parents attained at least a Overall, 73% of all 2008 research doctorate recipients reported earning a master's degree (table 16). However, there is significant variation in reported rates of master's attainment by broad field of doctoral study. Research doctorate recipients in S&E fields were less likely to earn a master's degree than were their counterparts in non-S&E fields. In particular, doctorate recipients in life sciences (51%) and physical sciences (65%) reported attaining a master's degree at lower rates than doctorate recipients in engineering (77%), social sciences (82%), or any of the non-S&E fields: humanities, other fields, and education (85%, 85%, and 89%, respectively). Men and women attained master's degrees at similar rates (men 72%, women 75%). Temporary visa holders earned master's degrees at a slightly higher rate (80%) than their U.S. citizen and permanent resident counterparts (75%). Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, master's attainment differed by the doctorate recipients' race/ethnicity (figure 15; table 16). Overall, blacks (84%) and American Indians (83%) reported earning a master's degree at higher rates than reported by multiracial doctorate recipients (75%), whites (75%), and Hispanics (74%). Asians (70%) reported the lowest rate of earning a master's degree. Differences in the racial/ ethnic composition of doctorate fields do not appear to fully account for this observed difference in master's attainment. Blacks reported attaining master's degrees at a higher rate than the other racial/ethnic groups in two of the four S&E broad fields-social sciences and engineering-and attained master's degrees at a higher rate than all but American questionnaire was modified in 2004 to improve the coverage of master's degree attainments and to ask about community college participation, and this section draws on the data from those enhancements."}, {"section_title": "Time to Degree", "text": "The amount of time needed to complete a doctorate is a key concern for those pursuing the degree, as well as for the faculties and administrations of degree-granting institutions and national public agencies and private organizations that support doctoral study. Time to degree completion is likely to be affected by a number of factors, including individual preferences, economic constraints, labor markets for new doctorate recipients, cultures of the academic disciplines, and institution-specific program characteristics. The SED measures time to degree three ways: (1) the total time elapsed from completion of the baccalaureate to completion of the doctorate, (2) the total time elapsed from the start of any graduate school to completion of the doctorate, and 3the age of the doctorate recipient at the time the doctorate is awarded. The median time-to-degree indices vary somewhat by sex, citizenship, and race/ethnicity; however, these differences are generally reflections of the broad field differences."}, {"section_title": "Baccalaureate to Doctorate", "text": "For the 2008 doctorate recipients, the median total time span from baccalaureate to doctorate was 9.4 years (table 18). The median total time span was shortest in physical sciences (7.7 years) and engineering (7.9 years) and longest in education (17.0 years). Large numbers of individuals who earn doctorates in the broad field of education work full time before starting their graduate degree programs and/or continue to work full time while earning their doctorates. Median total time to degree increased from 1983 to 1993 and has been declining since then. The 2008 median total time to Indians in the life sciences. In the non-S&E fields, there were no major differences in master's attainment by race/ethnicity. Overall, about 57% of doctorate recipients reported earning a master's degree that was related to their doctoral degree (i.e., in the same major field of study) (table 16). 7 The percentage earning a master's in the same field as the doctorate varied significantly by field of doctoral study. The broad fields of life and physical sciences, with the lowest rates of earning a master's degree, also had the lowest proportion of doctorate recipients who earned a related master's degree-36% and 55%, respectively. At least 60% of doctorate recipients in all other broad fields of study reported earning a related master's degree. In all of the broad S&E fields of study except social sciences, the percentage of temporary visa holders who reported earning a related master's degree was higher than that of their U.S. citizen and permanent resident counterparts. In social sciences, 70% of U.S. citizens and permanent residents reported earning a related master's degree, compared with 66% of temporary visa holders. Within all of the broad non-S&E fields, U.S. citizens and permanent residents reported earning a related master's degree at a higher rate than their temporary visa holder counterparts (table 16). Overall, 53% of research doctorate recipients earned their baccalaureate degree in the same major field of study as their doctoral degree. However, this percentage varied by broad field of doctoral study. Within the broad S&E fields, the percentage of doctorate recipients whose baccalaureate field was the same as their doctoral field ranged from a high of 77% of engineering doctorate recipients to a low of 48% of life scientists. Physical sciences and social sciences fell between the two with 62% and 53%, respectively (detailed data tables 38, 39). Among the non-S&E fields, 50% of the doctorate recipients in the humanities reported earning a baccalaureate degree in a related field. Doctorate recipients in other fields (34%) and education (32%) were the least likely among all the broad fields of study to earn a baccalaureate degree in the same major field of study as their doctoral degree (detailed data table 40).

The responses to this item show that 7 Refer to appendix A for details on the aggregation of subfields to determine major field.

However, in 2008 doctorate recipients in all of the broad fields except engineering had the same or longer time to degree than those in 1983. Across the whole population of new doctorate recipients, women had longer total times to degree than did men, but the   Selected years, 1983Selected years, -2008 degrees while in their early 30s. In comparison, median age at doctorate was 34.9 years in humanities, 41.5 years in education, and 35.6 years in the other fields category (table 20)."}, {"section_title": "Doctorate Recipients with Disabilities", "text": "Since 1985 the SED has included questions asking whether the doctorate recipient has a physical or other kind of disability. The current question format (items C10 and C11, appendix B) has been used since 2001 and asks respondents to indicate all applicable response options. Among the 2008 doctorate recipients, a total of 656 individuals (slightly more than 1% of the doctoral cohort) indicated having one or more disabilities (table 21). The most frequently reported disabilities were learning or cognitive disabilities, with 209 doctorate recipients indicating this disability, followed by physical or orthopedic, with 204. Doctorate recipients with disabilities were more likely to earn their degrees in non-S&E fields of study (41%) than were persons who reported no disabilities (30%). Women reported a disability more often than men. U.S. citizens and permanent residents were more likely to report one or more disabilities than were temporary visa holders. Financial Support and Education-Related Debt of Doctorate Recipients Sources of Financial Support T he SED asks two questions that, taken together, provide information on the financial sources of support that new doctorate recipients used during graduate school (for the exact formats and wordings, see appendix B). The first question asks respondents to complete a checklist of 14 different potential sources of support, such as fellowships and scholarships, grants, teaching and research assistantships, and various personal arrangements. The second question asks respondents which of the identified sources was the primary source of support and which was the secondary source of support. For reporting purposes, these 14 sources are combined into seven categories, shown in table 22. Three-fourths of the 2008 doctorate recipients reported teaching assistantships, research assistantships/traineeships, and fellowships/grants to be their primary source of support during graduate school. One in five (20%) new doctorate recipients in 2008 reported financing their graduate studies primarily through their own resources (funds from savings, loans, one's spouse and family, and nonacademic employment). Non-U.S. sources, employer contributions, and other sources accounted for the remaining 5% of the cases (figure 18; table 22). Sources of support differ substantially by field of study. For example, within each broad S&E field, at least two-thirds of doctorate recipients indicated teaching/research assistantships, traineeships, or fellowships/grants as their primary source of support. None of the S&E fields had more than 30% of doctorate recipients report relying on their own resources as a primary source of support. In contrast, humanities was the only broad non-S&E field with at least two-thirds of doctorate recipients reporting teaching/ research assistantships, traineeships, or fellowships/grants as their primary source. In the other non-S&E fields, 60% of education doctorate recipients and 31% of recipients in other fields reported relying on their own resources as their primary source of graduate school support. Overall, women were more likely than men to indicate that personal resources were their primary source of support (26% compared with 15%). This reflects both gender differences in broad fields of specialization and the differences among fields in sources of support (table 22). Temporary visa holders are more likely to receive primary support from teaching assistantships (21%) or research assistantships (50%) than are U.S. citizens and permanent residents (16% and 21%, respectively). Temporary visa holders are also less likely to rely on their own resources (5%) for primary support than are U.S. citizen and permanent resident respondents (27%). The source of support differences between the two citizenship groups was similar across all broad S&E fields of study (table 22). Differences in the various modes of financial support overall were found among racial/ethnic groups, in part reflecting differences in distributions among broad field of study (figure 18; table 22). Black doctorate recipients indicated the greatest reliance on their own resources to finance their doctoral program (41%), followed by American Indians (32%), Hispanics (29%), and multiracial recipients (25%) (table 22). Asians were the least likely of the racial/ethnic minority groups to report using their own resources (15%). Substantial racial/ethnic differences in the use of different types of financial support were found within fields. In each broad S&E field, Asians and whites were generally more likely than blacks and Hispanics to rely on research assistantships and were less likely to have fellowships or grants as their primary source of support (table 22). Racial/ ethnic differences in reliance on own resources were not as pronounced within most of the broad fields of study."}, {"section_title": "Levels of Education-Related Debt", "text": "The SED asks new doctorate recipients to indicate how much money they owe that is directly tied to their undergraduate and graduate educational programs. Just over half (53%) of the respondents in 2008 reported having no graduate or undergraduate education-related (cumulative) debt, and another 19% reported cumulative debt of $20,000 or less (table 23). However, 8% of all new doctorate recipients reported debt over $70,000. Examining the debt distributions across the seven broad fields, substantial differences were evident. Graduates in engineering (66%) and physical sciences (64%) were most likely to complete their doctorate without education-related debt, followed by graduates in life sciences (54%), other fields (49%), and education (47%). Debt levels of $70,000 or more were most common among graduates in social science fields (15%), other fields (12%), humanities (11%), and education (11%). Separating reported levels of undergraduate and graduate education-related debt shows greater indebtedness from graduate school than from undergraduate education. Overall, 74% of the 2008 doctoral cohort reported no remaining undergraduate debt, and less than 1% reported remaining undergraduate debt greater than $70,000 (table 23). In comparison, the percentage of respondents reporting no graduate school debt was lower (64%), and the percentage reporting the very highest levels of graduate school debt (i.e., greater than $70,000) was substantially higher (6%). The difference in levels of existing indebtedness between undergraduate and graduate school was particularly large for doctorate recipients in the social sciences and the broad non-S&E fields. The cumulative debt differences among the broad fields of doctoral study were greater for graduate education. The pattern of debt levels for the study's main demographic groups is shown in table 24. Cumulative debt differences between the sexes in 2008 were not large, with new male doctorate recipients about four percentage points more likely to have no debt than their female counterparts (55% compared with 51%). U.S. citizen and permanent resident doctorate recipients were less likely than temporary visa holders to have no higher-education-related debt (43% compared with 73%) and were more likely to have debt totaling over $70,000 (10% compared with 4%) (table 24). Particularly noteworthy is the much greater incidence of high levels of cumulative education-related debt among blacks, American Indians, Hispanics, and multiracial doctorate recipients (table 24). Of doctorate recipients, 24% of blacks, 14% of American Indians, 13% of Hispanics, and 13% of multiracial respondents owed over $70,000, compared with 5% of Asians and 9% of whites. Asians (60%) and whites (43%) were more likely to have no education-related debt at completion of the doctorate. Teaching assistantships Research assistantships/traineeships Fellowships/grants All other Own resources likely than doctorate recipients in other racial/ethnic groups to complete their doctorate with at least that level of graduate-school debt. Hispanics, American Indians, and multiracial doctorate recipients were more likely than whites and Asians to incur such a high level of graduate school debt, but the differences are smaller than for blacks in most broad fields. The racial/ethnic group graduate debt differences are in part a function of the racial/ethnic differences in fields of doctoral study, which, as seen in table 23, were also associated with levels of indebtedness. Table 25 and figure 19 show the percentages of racial/ethnic groups with graduate debt greater than $30,000 for each broad field of doctoral study. Black doctorate recipients in all fields were more FIGURE 19.

These included a mix of employment in elementary and secondary schools or school systems, foreign governments, and non-governmental organizations. The trend from 1988 to 2008 has been reduction in the share of government employment coupled with a relatively steady share of employment in the higher education sector, except for a noticeable dip in 1998 ( Postgraduation Plans, Employment, and Location T he SED questionnaire includes a number of questions about doctorate recipients' immediate plans for work or further training, and this section focuses on respondents who have definite postgraduation plans for work or training. The responses provide a useful overview of the number of doctorate recipients planning to enter academic positions, government and industry, and postdoctoral programs of research and further study.

As defined here, respondents indicate a definite commitment either by reporting plans to return to or continue in their predoctoral employment or by reporting they had signed a contract or had made a definite commitment for postdoctoral research or other work. Respondents were not considered to have definite commitments if they reported any of the following to the SED: negotiating with one or more specific organizations, seeking a position but having no definite commitment yet, intending to enter into another full-time degree program, not planning to work or study, or some other situation, usually described by the respondent as \"have not made a plan yet\" (see question B3 in the survey questionnaire, appendix B). Of the 31% without definite commitments, 27% were negotiating, 61% were seeking a position without a definite commitment, 4% did not plan to work or study in the next year, and the remainder were enrolling in another full-time degree program (for example, MD or JD) or reported having \"other\" plans. The 69% of respondents with definite commitments equals the percentage in 2007 that reported such commitments.

Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, Asians were less likely than blacks, Hispanics, or whites to go into academe (42%) and were more likely than those in other racial/ethnic groups to go into industry or self-employment (40%). Blacks were least likely to have work commitments in industry or self-employment (11%) and were more likely to have commitments in the \"other\" category (22%). This latter pattern reflects the high representation of blacks in the broad field of education and the high rate of employment of those doctorate recipients in elementary and secondary schools or school systems."}, {"section_title": "Postdoctoral Training or Study", "text": "Among the doctorate recipients reporting definite commitments, 36% committed to a postdoc (a temporary position primarily for gaining additional education and training in research) rather than to career employment (table 28). This percentage matches the high recorded in 2007 (see supplemental table S-28). Commitments for postdoctoral study were far more common among graduates in life sciences (66%) and physical sciences (53%) than in the other broad fields (figure 20). The relative shares of doctorate recipients in the main employment sectors varied by broad field of study (table 29). The proportion employed in academe in 2008 was highest among humanities doctorate recipients (86%) and lowest among engineering doctorate recipients (15%). The proportion employed in industry or self-employed was highest among engineering (73%) and physical sciences (56%) graduates and lowest among humanities (3%) and education (4%) doctorate recipients. Humanities doctorate recipients were the least likely to have work commitments in government (2%). The percentage of doctorate recipients classified as having \"other/ unknown\" work commitments was by far the greatest among education graduates (38%), reflecting the high rates at which these individuals are employed in elementary and secondary schools or school systems. As in other variables in this report, at least some part of employment-sector differences among doctorate recipients are reflections of demographic differences in doctoral fields of study and early career patterns across broad fields (table 30). Among women who received doctorates in 2008, 17% had plans to enter industry or some form of self-employment, compared with 36% of their male counterparts. Women were more likely than men to have commitments to academe (58% compared with 45%) and were more likely to have commitments to \"other/unknown\" employment (14% compared with 9%); this reflects the relatively high concentration of women earning doctorates in humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and education. Temporary visa holders with definite commitments to remain in the United States after graduation were less likely than were small (table 32), as were differences among Asians, blacks, Hispanics, whites, and multiracial doctorate recipients who were U.S. citizens or permanent residents. However, American Indians were more likely than all other race/ethnic groups to receive their funding from a private foundation. A number of differences in sources of support were apparent between the two citizenship groups. As might be expected, U.S. citizens and permanent residents were the most likely to have the U.S. government as their main source of postdoctoral support, although substantial numbers of temporary visa holders also received U.S. government support. The difference was made up nearly entirely by university or college funding, where temporary visa holders were more likely than U.S. citizens and permanent residents to report this type of support."}, {"section_title": "Postgraduate Location of Temporary Visa Holders", "text": "Among temporary visa holders with definite commitments for work or further training, 78% of all new doctorate recipients indicated that they would remain in the United States following graduation (table 33).

The lowest concentrations were in the broad fields of education (58%) and social sciences (61%). The number of temporary visa holders earning research doctorates in the United States has increased over the past 20 years, as has the tendency for those students with definite commitments to remain in the United States following graduation (table 33). In 1988, 60% of those with temporary visas had definite commitments to positions in the United States. A decade later it was 68%, and in 2008 it rose to 78%. The imposition of travel restrictions and other constraints on non-U.S. citizens studying in the United States in the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, raised concerns among many involved in U.S. doctoral education that the numbers of temporary visa holders pursuing U.S. doctorates and staying in the United States after graduation might decline. 10 There is no evidence yet of declining numbers of temporary visa holders receiving U.S. doctorates.

Commitments for postdoctoral study within the non-S&E fields have increased over the past two decades but remain relatively infrequent (table 28). Differences among demographic subgroups are shown in table 31. Although men continued to be more likely than women to have plans for postdoctoral study (38% compared with 34%), 2008 marked an all-time high for women with plans for postdoctoral study. The percentage of men with plans for postdoctoral study matched the all-time high level (38%) recorded in 2004. (See table 27 in the 2004 Summary Report; available at http://www.norc.org/projects/ Survey+of+Earned+Doctorates.htm.) Among those with definite commitments, temporary visa holders were more likely than U.S. citizens and permanent residents to pursue postdoctoral studies. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, Asian doctorate recipients were most likely to pursue postdoctoral study, followed by Hispanic and multiracial recipients (table 31). The differences among citizenship and racial/ethnic subgroups are consistent with the greater number of postdocs in physical and life sciences and the greater concentrations in those fields of temporary visa holders and Asian U.S. citizens and permanent residents (detailed data table 41)."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Financial Support for Postdoctoral Appointments", "text": "The SED asks respondents with definite commitments for a postdoc in the year after graduation to indicate the main source of support for their postdoctoral appointment. In 2008, 45% of these respondents indicated a college or university as their main source of funding, and 29% indicated the U.S. government (table 32). (Some college or university support may derive from federal funds channeled through the university, which may not be clear to the SED respondents.) Since 1988, the overall trend has been a decreasing share of U.S. government support and an increasing share of college or university support for postdoctoral study. In 2008, private foundations and other types of nonprofit organizations were the main support for about 8% of doctorate recipients with a commitment for a postdoc, and about 10% indicated sources of support other than those listed in the questionnaire. Specific information provided by these respondents indicated that many had support from international organizations. Among doctorate recipients in 2008, differences between men and women in the main source of postdoctoral support reported intentions to stay in the United States after earning their degree, slightly lower than in 2007 (75%) (table 35). The overall trend from 2003 onward is of increasing intent to stay in the United States except for a slight decline in 2008 (table  35). This general pattern held for doctorate recipients from all non-European regions. Doctorate recipients from East/South Asia were the most likely to stay in the United States in 2008 (79%) and have been in every year since 2002. Within that region, recipients from India (89%) and China (88%) were the most likely to report intentions to stay. dency visas has increased every year since 2000 and reached an all-time high in 2008 (detailed data table 48). But since the median time from starting graduate school to completing the doctorate is about 9 years, if there were to be a decline in the number of temporary visa holders earning doctorates, it might not be apparent until the end of this decade. The increase in the number of doctorate recipients with a temporary visa was much smaller than in the previous 5 years.
