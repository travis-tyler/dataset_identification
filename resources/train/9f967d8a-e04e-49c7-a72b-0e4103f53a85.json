Understanding pathologic mechanisms and biological risks is imperative to the discovery of biomarkers, pharmacological targets, and treatments. The preeminent explanation of AD pathogenesis, the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis', suggests that amyloid-b plaque (Ab) deposition underlies neurodegeneration, subsequent brain atrophy, cognitive impairment, and ultimately dementia [14] .\nThe definitive diagnosis of AD still requires confirmation either by biopsy or autopsy. Autopsy confirmation is based on neuropathological hallmarks-Ab plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Radiotracers for amyloid imaging now provide the opportunity to investigate fibrillar Ab deposition in vivo. Thus, PET amyloid imaging agents hold promise not only for early diagnosis of AD, but can also add to the understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, the temporal course of amyloid deposition, and its relation to clinical manifestations. The 11 C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) ligand remains the most widely studied PET amyloid imaging agent to date, but the validations against postmortem measures of neuropathology are few [1, 3, 4, 15, 18, 19, 37, 38] .\nIn vitro, 11 C-PiB binds specifically to extracellular and vascular fibrillar Ab [15, 23] . At PET tracer concentrations, 11 C-PiB does not significantly bind to other protein aggregates such as NFTs [15, 19, 21] or Lewy bodies [11, 19] . The first 11 C-PiB study in humans performed in mild AD patients [21] reported patterns of PiB retention consistent with the classic pattern of amyloid deposition described in postmortem studies of AD brains [2] and demonstrated approximately a twofold increase in 11 C-PiB retention in AD cases compared to non-demented individuals [21] . Moreover, 11 C-PiB shows promise in discriminating individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who progress versus those who remain stable [12, 22, 29, 39] and provides some utility for differential diagnosis of AD from frontotemporal dementia [9, 28, 31] .\nRegional variations in PiB binding and the extent of agreement with neuropathological assessment, however, have not been thoroughly investigated, and unbiased stereological investigations are lacking given that stereology remains a time-consuming process not easily compatible with routine neuropathologic work. In a previous study [37] , we reported variable agreement between the mean PiB cortical distribution volume ratio (DVR) and the neuritic plaque score according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD), routinely used for pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. The limited agreement may reflect the inherent methodological limitations and differences between imaging and CERAD semi-quantitative neuropathologic protocols. Here, we extend those findings of Sojkova and colleagues [37] by examining the correspondence between regional PiB retention (as opposed to mean cortical DVR) with regionmatched quantitative immunohistological assessments of Ab and NFTs (as opposed to semi-quantitative CERAD description), and regional brain atrophy in six older Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) participants."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The sample consists of six participants (5 males and 1 female) from the BLSA-neuroimaging (NI) sub-study [32, 33, 37] , who underwent 11 C PiB-PET and MRI assessments and eventually came to autopsy.

Participants were between 78 and 87 years of age at the time of 11 C-PiB-PET imaging and received concurrent MRI scans. Imaging-autopsy intervals ranged between 0.2 and 2.4 years. All studies were approved by the local institutional review boards, and all participants gave written informed consent prior to each assessment. In addition, next of kin or legally designated power of attorney provided consent for autopsy.\nThe demographic, genetic, and cognitive status data are presented in Table 1 . Participants received routine neuropsychological and neurological examinations. Interval medical history, medication review, and a structured informant and subject interview were documented at each visit [7, 20] . All participants were in general good health at the time of BLSA neuroimaging study enrollment, with exclusionary criteria encompassing CNS disease, severe cardiovascular disease, severe pulmonary disease, or metastatic cancer. None of the participants had Parkinson disease, epilepsy, or clinical stroke at the time of PiB-PET imaging.\nCognitive status was determined based on standardized consensus diagnostic procedures for the BLSA [7] .

Ab and Tau-protein immunoreactivities were measured using the area fraction-fractionator probe (counting frame 150 lm 9 150 lm), which allowed us to assess the burden of proteins of interest in these sections. We outlined a contour of cortical gray matter and selected sampling sites with a grid size = 800 lm 9 800 lm. At each sampling site, a counting frame was superimposed, containing markers equally spaced from one another. The markers that colocalized with immunoreactivity were labeled as positive, whereas the remaining markers were labeled negative. The area fraction was calculated as the number of positive markers divided by the total number of markers. All assessments were performed blinded to clinical and neuropathological diagnoses. Values for each region were averaged to arrive at the mean fraction of Ab or Tau-protein immunoreactivity. Coefficients of error ranged between 0.07 and 0.12 for both.

Extracranial tissue was removed using a semi-automated procedure followed by manual editing. Next, images were segmented into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The final step involves stereotaxic normalization and tissue quantitation for specific regions of interest with a template-based deformation approach. An International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) standard MRI anatomical template (Montreal Neurologic Institute) served as the template and a hierarchical elastic matching algorithm was used for deformation and determination of volumes of interest [36] . All images were normalized individually to the same template. Voxel-based analysis utilizes the RAVENS approach [13] , whereby local values of tissue density maps (for GM, WM, and CSF) reflect the amount of respective tissue in the vicinity of a voxel.

We compared these measures of Ab and Tau with Ab burden measured antemortem using 11 C-PiB-PET. We report an agreement between regional in vivo 11 C-PiB retention and region-matched, quantitative analyses of Ab in postmortem tissue.\nOnly a handful of studies to date have investigated the direct relationship between 11 C-PiB binding and neuropathology, one in AD [15] , one in Parkinson's disease (PD) dementia [3] , and two case reports of dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD) [3, 19] . Although sample sizes were small (AD: n = 1; PDD: n = 3; LBD: n = 1), all studies demonstrated high selectivity of 11 C-PiB for fibrillar Ab deposits. A recent study also showed good agreement between antemortem imaging and autopsy findings for the 18-F amyloid imaging radiotracer, Florbetapir [5] .\nWe recently investigated the correspondence between 11 C-PiB DVRs and CERAD-based neuropathological diagnoses in the same six individuals included in the present study. In our earlier study [37] , using the Hirano modification of the Bielschowsky silver stain, we found only limited and variable agreement between CERAD score and mean cortical 11 C-PiB DVR. The variable agreement in our prior study may have been due in part to reliance on the semi-quantitative CERAD ratings, which are based on a small volume of tissue in specific cortical regions, and analysis of cortical PiB DVR, a summary score of eight cortical regions. Our current results suggest that much better agreement is observed in the same individuals using immunohistochemistry and quantitative stereological methodology when evaluating the regions typically showing the greatest 11 C-PiB retention. In the present investigation, we systematically sampled throughout specific regions of interest to better capture the distribution of amyloid deposition. Moreover, we examined the correspondence between imaging and postmortem measures in regions showing the earliest evidence of 11 C-PiB retention, including precuneus and cingulate regions. This is especially important, given that most of the individuals evaluated here were non-demented. In nondemented individuals, early Ab deposition is observed in the precuneus/posterior cingulate and the anterior cingulate gyrus [25] , regions not included in the CERAD neuropathological assessment.\nThe 'amyloid cascade hypothesis', which suggests that Ab deposition is an initial step leading to neurodegeneration, subsequent brain atrophy, cognitive impairment, and ultimately dementia, has been the dominant explanation of AD pathogenesis to date [14] . However, neurofibrillary tangles often precede amyloid deposition and the tangles that remain in the extracellular space after the death of neurons that contain them provide direct evidence for neuronal death either caused by or at least associated with tangles [2, 10] , posing a challenge for the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis'.\nThus, we investigated the potential association between Tau immunohistochemistry and 11 C-PiB and found no significant associations. Additionally, we found no relationships between regional brain volumes obtained from MRI scans closest in time to amyloid imaging and PiB retention. Moreover, there were no significant associations of brain volume with Ab or Tau levels by immunohistochemistry. As Jack and colleagues [17] note, both Ab deposition and NFTs can be present in individuals who do not exhibit any clinical symptoms. The presence of NFTs, however, although widespread in demented individuals, tends to be confined to the entorhinal cortex (Braak stage I-II) in asymptomatic individuals [17] and all participants in our study were clinically normal at the time of the scan. The relationships between brain volume and Ab or Tau, respectively, will need to be revisited as the autopsy sample with prior imaging assessments grows, as we likely lacked power in the present sample to detect small changes. Moreover, a note of caution is in order considering that shorter MRI-PiB interval in some cases and refinement of \nimage processing techniques that would allow us to separate anterior from posterior cingulate gyrus volumes might lead to positive findings in the future. There are several limitations to our study. The strength of the relationship between amyloid by PiB versus immunohistochemistry may be affected by different forms of Ab. For example, PiB does not bind to a polymorphic form of Ab [34] , which may account for some of the discrepancyespecially in cases of low PiB retention, yet moderate scores upon neuropathologic evaluation, particularly in the hippocampus and the orbito-frontal cortex. A recent study by Ikonomovic and colleagues [16] examined Ab pathology in an individual with clinical diagnoses of probable Lewy body dementia and possible AD, but no detectable PiB-PET retention, suggesting a need for better defining the Ab concentrations and binding levels needed to produce a positive PiB-PET signal. Future studies will need to address the impact of different Ab lesion types on PiB-PET imaging. The inherent problem of varied imaging-autopsy intervals may also affect the correspondence between imaging-neuropathologic assessments. Moreover, a formal unbiased stereological investigation would involve defining, dissecting, and cutting the entire structure of interest from which then random sections would be chosen for immunohistochemistry, while ours were selected from a 0.5-mm block of tissue from the region of interest for practical purposes. Not sampling throughout the entire structure may have biased the estimation of Ab plaques in individuals with potentially sparse or sporadically distributed plaques. Limitations notwithstanding, this study represents the largest of its kind to date and the only series to date including non-demented adults with variable levels of PiB retention. Moreover, a decade of prospective cognitive follow-up and consensus diagnosis makes this sample a unique and valuable resource.\nOverall, we report an agreement between antemortem 11 C-PiB amyloid imaging and postmortem quantitative assessment of Ab deposition in a sample of six older, prospectively followed individuals. The strong correlation of in vivo PiB retention with region-matched, quantitative 11 C-PiB-PET imaging as a method for evaluation of plaque burden in vivo. Prospective studies will not only be imperative in furthering our understanding of amyloid deposition and its role in the disease process, but also in guiding preventative and therapeutic strategies. and e the precuneus.
