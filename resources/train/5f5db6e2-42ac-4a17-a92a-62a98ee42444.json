These are further developed into a comprehensive Computerized model using software such as Stella \u00ae and Vensim \u00ae. The variables identified in these CLD are translated in terms of Stocks (depicting variables that accumulate in number) and flows between the stocks as well as the information that determines the value of the flows (converter variables) [18] [19] . Feedback effects and delays are a key component of SDM.\nDifferential equations are the main drivers of the model.\nIn silico experimentations, which combine findings from literature and computerized mathematical models, allow vast numbers of experiments that may produce more accurate results that gives room for hypothesis generation [20] [21] [22] . Computerized experimentations are cost effective and are less time-consuming alternative to expensive real time laboratory and clinical experimentation. Simulation using computer software enables study of systems behavior over time and supports in silico policy analysis. SDM relies on existing qualitative and quantitative data, and where data is not available, expert opinion is sought [23] The CLDs, stocks and flows provide a common language that can be easily understood by a wide range of stakeholders.\nSDM has been recommended in analysis and understanding of the impact of different interventions in management of Covid-19 [24] [12] [25] [26] .

Thus we adapted a Susceptible( persons who have not contracted but have potential to contract the virus) , Exposed(Persons who have come into contact with an infected person and may or may not have contracted the virus and are at the same time asymptomatic), Infected(persons who have contracted the disease, they may or may not be symptomatic and may infect others), Recovered (persons who had been infected with the virus and whose infection has cleared and may no longer infect others)and Death ( is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted October 8, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.06.20204487 doi: medRxiv preprint The general structure of the model presented as stocks and flows diagram is shown in Figure   2 .
