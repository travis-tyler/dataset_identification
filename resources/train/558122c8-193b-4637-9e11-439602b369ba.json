Therefore, most efforts to confirm the CSF biomarker model proposed by Jack et al. [12] have been made using statistical synchronization techniques in sporadic AD cases [41] and crosssectional data from subjects with autosomal dominant AD mutations with a known age of clinical dementia onset [1, 9, 27] . recently, the Australian Imaging Biomarker and lifestyle study of aging (AIBl) and the Mayo Clinic Study of aging have reported the temporal dynamics of A\u03b2 amyloid deposition in the brain using Pittsburg B-compound (PiB) combined with positron emission tomography (PiB-PeT) imaging [14, 37, 38] . Based on their results, Villemagne et al. proposed that in the groups with and without pathological levels of A\u03b2 amyloid deposition there were two subgroups of subjects, i.e. one consisting of subjects who showed no changes and a second group that showed an increased deposition of A\u03b2 amyloid over time. These results have not been validated in other PeT or CSF based studies of A\u03b2 pathology, and measures of CSF t-tau and p-tau 181 were not incorporated into the studies of Villemagne et al.\nAlthough lumbar punctures to obtain CSF for biomarker measurements are mildly invasive, they are considered relatively safe, acceptable to patients and controls [23, 24] , and sampling CSF offers the possibility to measure several biomarkers at the time of lumbar puncture while CSF aliquots can be stored in biobanks for future studies of other biomarkers.

We selected this interval to maximize the number of subjects and optimize the time between visits to analyze the changes during a longer period and capture changes and patterns that might be only found for longer follow-up periods. We hypothesized that the population of subjects that have normal CSF baseline values is a mixture of subjects who will show at least two distinct longitudinal profiles, namely those who will stay stable and those who will decrease (for A\u03b2 ) or increase (for t-tau and p-tau 181 ) their measured values indicating that parenchymal deposition of tau and A\u03b2 into tangles and plaques, respectively, is taking place. Therefore, a finite mixture model [10, 11] was fitted to the CSF biomarker change values and the Bayesian information criterion was used to select the best model. In addition, we fitted power models [2] to estimate the yearly CSF changes associated with a specific CSF value and we derived the expected CSF biomarker changes using the modified euler method [33] .\nWe constructed a mixed-effects model [15] to quantify patterns of CSF biomarkers longitudinally from time of entry into the study.

We selected subjects whose last CSF sample was obtained between 36 and 48 months after the first baseline visit CSF sample (n = 89) and subtracted the baseline visit value from the last visit value.

We developed the second model to project changes in subjects who are changing to avoid the averaging subjects who remain stable during follow-up. For A\u03b2 values, the time to reach the abnormal cutpoints, i.e. 192 pg/ml, starting at 295 pg/ml was 18.6 years if the model with all subjects was used (blue), whereas this time shortened to 8.6 years when the model that excluded the A\u03b2-Sg (empty circles, red line) was applied (Fig. 4c) . Similarly in the p-tau 181 model, the time to reach the p-tau 181 pathological threshold shortened from 6.2 to 2.9 years when PT-Sg (empty circles) was excluded (Fig. 4d) . The time to reach the median A\u03b2 1-42 values present in the AD group was 35.6 years for the model with all the subjects and 26.3 years for the model that excludes the A\u03b2-Sg with normal A\u03b2 1-42 baseline values.

For the model that studied A\u03b2 1-42 we included baseline p-tau 181 values as a predictor, whereas in the models that studied t-tau and p-tau 181 we included baseline A\u03b2 1-42 as predictor to study the association between these biomarkers.\nMCI and AD diagnoses were associated with lower and higher levels of A\u03b2 1-42 and t-tau at baseline, respectively. On the other hand, baseline clinical diagnosis was not associated with baseline p-tau 181 . However, MCI and AD clinical diagnoses were significantly associated with increased p-tau 181 levels when baseline A\u03b2 was not included in the model (data not shown). A\u03b2 1-42 (t = \u22123.3, p = 0.001) and p-tau 181 (t = 3.1, p = 0.002) showed a significant decrease and increase in the serial measurements, respectively; however clinical diagnostic groups did not differ in the rate of change (Table 3) .

Based on these results, the timeframe to reach the abnormal A\u03b2 and p-tau 181 cutpoints [30] was shorter in the model that excluded subjects with normal baseline and longitudinally stable CSF values, and the trajectories did not follow a sigmoid trajectory. In addition, changes in p-tau 181 occurred in a shorter period than changes in A\u03b2 . low baseline A\u03b2 values predicted a greater p-tau 181 increase during the follow-up period here, but high baseline p-tau 181 values were not predictive of any A\u03b2 1-42 changes. Baseline values, but not longitudinal changes of biomarker levels, were associated with cognitive changes during follow-up.\nOur unsupervised finite mixture model analysis detected the presence of two distinct trends in longitudinally measured CSF A\u03b2 , and p-tau 181 biomarkers in ADNI subjects with normal baseline values. A similar approach has been applied to define AD diagnostic cutpoints based on CSF biomarker values [7] and for the analysis of PIB-PeT longitudinal changes [37] . Our findings agree with the notion that a population of individuals with normal baseline biomarker values consists of two subgroups, namely those who will remain stable and those whose CSF A\u03b2 and tau biomarker values change by becoming abnormal which, in the later situation, we interpret to reflect the progressive deposition of A\u03b2 into amyloid plaques and the formation neurofibrillary tangles composed of pathological tau in the brains of these ADNI subjects [34] . When the A\u03b2-Sg subjects with normal baseline values were excluded, the model did not follow a sigmoid function and the time to reach abnormal A\u03b2 1-42 levels shortened from 18.6 to 8.6 years. Similar results were observed for p-tau 181 although the time to reach the abnormal cutpoints was much shorter, namely 6.2 and 2.9 years for the model that included all subjects and the one that excluded the PT-Sg, respectively. recently, two cross-sectional studies in patients with autosomal dominant familial AD (FAD) mutations and a known expected time to onset of dementia have indicated that A\u03b2 1-42 CSF differences between carriers and non-carriers of pathogenic FAD mutations are already present two decades before the onset of dementia [1, 27] . However, it is not known if these results can be extrapolated to sporadic AD cases, as it has been shown that the mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of A\u03b2 deposits differ in autosomal dominant FAD and sporadic AD cases [19, 32] . Four studies have described longitudinal A\u03b2 deposition in the brain using PIB-PeT imaging in a larger number of cases [13, 14, 37, 38] with a mean follow-up of 1.5-2 years, although the last AIBl study had a mean follow-up of 3.8 years. Villain et al. [37] described \"A\u03b2 accumulators\" and \"A\u03b2 non-accumulators\" in their study which showed a u-shaped distribution for measures of A\u03b2 change when plotted against baseline values and they reported a higher percentage of \"A\u03b2 accumulators\" in subjects classified as PIB positive. In our ADNI cohort, the highest percentage of subjects in the A\u03b2-Dg had normal CSF A\u03b2 1-42 values at baseline (\u03c7 2 = 7.9, p = 0.005, 41 and 13 % A\u03b2-Dg in those with normal and abnormal CSF A\u03b2 1-42 values, respectively). This might be attributed to clinical differences in the subjects recruited for the two cohorts (i.e. comprised mostly of CN subjects in the study by Villain et al. and MCI in our study), differences in cutpoints for the assessment of A\u03b2 amyloid pathology, or the fact that PIB-PeT detects insoluble fibrillar A\u03b2, whereas the CSF A\u03b2 1-42 assay measures soluble non-fibrillar species of A\u03b2 1-42 although a high correlation between measures of A\u03b2 plaque burden and CSF A\u03b2 1-42 levels has been reported [16, 36] . Villemagne et al. [39] described an association between the APOe \u03b54 allele and a greater A\u03b2 accumulation, although their analysis was neither adjusted for baseline diagnosis or other covariates, and when they stratified by clinical diagnosis the association was not significant. A nearly significant association was observed in a more recent study, but the model was not adjusted for baseline PIB-PeT values which are higher in subjects with one or more copies of the APOe \u03b54 allele [38] . Indeed, Jack et al. [14] recently modeled PIB-PeT, and when the model they used to study the rate of A\u03b2 amyloid deposition was adjusted for baseline PIB-PeT values, the effect of the APOe \u03b54 allele was not significant in agreement with our results. Our results favor the hypothesis that harboring at least one APOe \u03b54 allele advances in time the onset of A\u03b2 accumulation in line with the effect observed on age of clinical onset of AD [6] . Notably, the model described by Villain et al. [37] describes an exponential increase in PIB-PeT values without a plateau and the model by Jack et al. proposed a sigmoid-shaped increase with a plateau, which was also present in the study by Villemagne [38] . However, in our study, when we included all ADNI samples with 3 years of follow-up (including subjects with normal baseline values who showed no changes), we found a logarithmic shaped curve for changes in the levels of A\u03b2 1-42 and or p-tau 181 , but when we excluded the ADNI subjects with normal values and stable course the shape changed for both biomarkers. The plateau only persisted for the A\u03b2 1-42 model, whereas the p-tau 181 model did not reach a plateau when the PT-Sg subjects with normal baseline value were excluded (Fig. 4d) . In our study, the AD group was underrepresented, especially for the longer follow-up. Therefore, our sample might not have had enough AD subjects with a long follow-up to assess the p-tau 181 changes which take place at a later stage than the A\u03b2 1-42 changes. These observations emphasize the importance of the process of building accurate models of biomarker trajectories of the systematic collection of longitudinal biomarker data within individual cognitively normal subjects and long-term follow-up through the various stages of progression to mild impairment and dementia.\nWhen we studied the association between baseline and longitudinal changes of these CSF biomarkers, we found an association between abnormal baseline A\u03b2 1-42 values and p-tau 181 increases during follow-up, whereas neither baseline t-tau nor p-tau 181 was associated with an A\u03b2 1-42 decrease during follow-up. T-tau and p-tau 181 changes were moderately correlated, but none of these changes were associated with A\u03b2 1-42 changes. This favors the hypothesis that pathological changes in A\u03b2 1-42 level precede those for p-tau 181 although is it well known that tau deposits in brain as neurofibrillary tangles many years before A\u03b2 deposits as amyloid plaques, although the reasons for these discrepancies in biomarker versus pathology data are not clear [8] .\nClinical diagnosis was associated with baseline of A\u03b2 1-genotype was associated with baseline A\u03b2 1-42 (a trend was present for t-tau and p-tau 181 ). However, the only association with longitudinal changes was a decrease in t-tau in AD subjects. Information from longitudinal CSF studies that also include t-tau and p-tau 181 measurements is more limited. Buchhave [5] reported that in subjects followed for up to 9.2 years baseline A\u03b2 1-42 values did not differ between early and late MCI converters. On the other hand, early converters showed higher baseline t-tau and p-tau 181 values than late converters. These results suggest the pathological changes in A\u03b2 1-42 levels plateau before or around the onset of the dementia in AD patients. Several studies have compared baseline values with a second CSF measurement obtained 2-3 years later [4, 21, 29] . These studies mainly compared changes based on clinical diagnosis; however, the use of clinical diagnosis that is not neuropathologically validated might be prone to false positive results because of the assumption that all MCI and AD cases will have only AD pathology, but this assumption is incorrect in 7-17 % of AD patients followed to autopsy while the percentage of those with MCI who do or do not have AD pathology is less clear [3, 22, 28, 35] . In addition, baseline biomarker levels have been shown to be the strongest predictor of dementia in our study and in previous PeT studies [14] . Some of these CSF biomarker studies reported increases in t-tau and p-tau 181 [4] were larger in AD subjects [29] , while most studies described a decrease of A\u03b2 1-42 values although Bouwman et al. [4] described an increase. Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 reported that only the presence of an APOe \u03b54/\u03b54 genotype (and not \u03b53/\u03b54) was associated with A\u03b2 1-42 decreases or p-tau 181 increases. Mattsson [18] followed a cohort of 30 MCI subjects and collected three CSF samples that were separated 2 years from each other, and although their study mainly focused on classification of clinical progression of MCI subjects, they found no significant changes in CSF values over time, except for p-tau which showed an increase in some subjects.\nIn our study, we analyzed CSF biomarker dynamics based on their baseline value and also studied the association between CSF tau and A\u03b2 biomarkers. However, when we studied the association with baseline clinical diagnosis in the mixed-effect models, clinical diagnosis was not associated overall with longitudinal changes in CSF biomarker values except a decrease in t-tau in the AD group. However, in the absence of neuropathological validation of the clinical diagnosis, it is not possible to ascertain that these subjects do not have an underlying cause for the cognitive impairment other than or in addition to AD [35] , but the presence of AD-like CSF signature in CN subjects indicates that CSF biomarker changes precede clinical changes and there might be a temporal dissociation between both."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "There are conflicting results regarding the association between longitudinal biomarker changes and the APOe \u03b54 genotype. In our sample, only one subject with one or more APOe \u03b54 alleles had normal baseline A\u03b2 1-42 values, and most subjects with one or more APOe \u03b54 alleles were in the A\u03b2-Sg with abnormal A\u03b2 1-42 baseline values. These results point to the fact that the APOe \u03b54 allele can be associated with a decrease of A\u03b2 1-42 at younger ages, in line with the clinical observation that individuals with an APOe \u03b54 allele have a younger onset of dementia. Our sample is composed of elderly subjects so, therefore, we cannot confirm if the presence of an APO \u03b54 is allele associated with changes starting at a younger age, a faster rate of change or both. That said, in our analysis we found that baseline biomarker values were the strongest predictors of the longitudinal cognitive changes. Therefore, differences reported in previous studies may arise from the sampling of subjects at different stages of the process and the composition of the studied cohort (age and distribution of cognitive groups in the sample). In order to assess the specific longitudinal changes associated with APOe \u03b54 allele and dissociate these changes from a difference in baseline biomarker values an analytical adjustment is necessary. This was the case in the recent study published by Jack et al. [14] that described how the association between an APOe \u03b54 genotype and longitudinal change in PIB-PeT deposition became not significant when the model was adjusted for baseline values.\nlastly, a study by le Bastard confirmed that in CN and AD subjects CSF levels of biomarkers are stable over several weeks [17] and, therefore, changes over time can be expected to reflect progression of the underlying AD neuropathology and not fluctuation of the biomarkers. Finally, in our study, CSF tau and A\u03b2 biomarker changes were not associated with changes in the ADAS-Cog scale during follow-up, and of the three groups defined based on baseline and longitudinal A\u03b2 1-42 changes, only the A\u03b2-Sg with abnormal baseline A\u03b2 1-42 levels showed worse cognitive outcomes during follow-up, which is consistent with the actual disease model [12] .\nIn conclusion, our results on the analysis of longitudinal data on CSF tau and A\u03b2 show that (1) CSF A\u03b2 1-42 changes precede p-tau 181 changes; (2) in the normal range of CSF biomarker values, there are distinctive subpopulations of subjects with a different longitudinal course; (3) factoring this variable modifies the expected modeling of biomarker changes. However, further studies of longitudinal changes in CSF tau and A\u03b2 are needed and it is especially important to study longitudinal changes in CSF tau and A\u03b2 in younger populations to establish when these CSF biomarker start to become abnormal and establish how changes are linked mechanistically to the APOe \u03b54 genotype as well last to the clinical manifestations of accumulating AD pathology."}]
