It also provides an overview of the current treatment of R&D in the national economic accounts and discusses how R&D as investment would affect gross domestic product. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), in partnership with the National Science Foundation (NSF), has developed a research and development (R&D) satellite account that provides detailed statistics on R&D activity and its effect on economic growth. In particular, the satellite account shows the impact on such measures as gross domestic product (GDP), investment, and saving if R&D spending were treated as investment rather than as an expense. Currently, the national economic accounts do not treat R&D and many other intangibles as investment and thus cannot separately identify their contribution to U.S. economic growth. The R&D satellite account provides a framework to explore the treatment of R&D as investment and to explore new methodologies for this treatment prior to its incorporation into BEA's core national accounts around 2013. This paper is part of a series of methodological papers released on the BEA web site documenting the 2007 R&D satellite account and the treatment of certain keys issues. 1 It is organized as follows. Section 1 provides an overview of the current treatment of R&D in the national economic accounts and discusses how changing the accounting treatment of R&D investment affects GDP. It also includes the methodology for avoiding a doublecount in software investment. Section 2 addresses the nature of R&D as investment and discusses the funding vs. performance of R&D. Section 3 provides an overview of the adjustments to the source data that are needed to create an unduplicated measure of R&D investment consistent with the national income and product accounts (NIPAs). Section 4 provides an overview of the cost detail and prices used. Section 5 presents the methodologies used to prepare estimates of currentdollar output of R&D by performer. Conclusions are presented in section 6. 1 R&D in the national economic accounts."}, {"section_title": "Current treatment.", "text": "In the NIPAs, expenditures on R&D by business-whether actually purchased from others or carried out inhouse-are treated as intermediate rather licensing fees, which include payments for the use of R&D protected by patents."}, {"section_title": "How treating R&D as investment affects GDP and GDI.", "text": "Treating research and development (R&D) as an investment rather than as an expense would result in important changes to the calculation of gross domestic product (GDP). These changes also need to be reflected in the calculation of gross domestic income (GDI), which is the alternative measure of and conceptually equal to GDP, that is calculated as the sum of income earned from production (see table A below)."}, {"section_title": "Business sector.", "text": "Shifting business R&D expenditures out of expenses and into investment would lead to an increase in GDP equal to the value of R&D investment. Recognizing R&D as investment would have an equal effect on GDI that would be reflected in two components: Business income and depreciation (consumption of fixed capital). Because R&D would no longer be considered an expense, it would no longer be deducted from gross business income (corporate profits and proprietors' income). Therefore, business income would increase. Depreciation would also increase because R&D investment adds to the capital stock, which is subject to a decline in value over time. That increases business income by the amount of R&D investment less depreciation. Bus Income R&D adjusted = Bus Income unadjusted + (Investment R&D \u2212 Depreciation R&D ) However, because the depreciation of capital stock is also a component of GDI, the depreciation of R&D investment would be added to the total measure of depreciation. Therefore, the net effect on GDI would be an increase equal to R&D investment, maintaining the accounting identity between GDP and GDI."}, {"section_title": "GDI R&D adjusted = GDI unadjusted + (Bus Income R&D + Depreciation R&D ) = Investment R&D", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Nonprofits and general government.", "text": "In these two sectors, R&D would be reclassified from consumption to investment. Because consumption is already part of GDP, this shift alone would not change the measure of GDP. However, recognizing R&D spending as investment by nonprofit institutions serving households (household sector) and governments would also require an estimate of the capital services generated by R&D investment in order to capture the complete economic return. Capital services measure the value of a capital asset's use in production. Conceptually, that value is the amount a producer would be willing to pay to rent the asset for a given period. Because most capital assets are owned by the same entity that uses them with no observed transaction, capital services must be estimated indirectly. In the R&D satellite account, capital services are measured as the sum of depreciation and the net returns on R&D investment. The inclusion in the R&D account of net returns to nonprofits and general government is a departure from the current calculation of GDI in the NIPAs, which includes only depreciation as a partial measure of capital services. The R&D satellite account, however, allows for exploratory approaches, and estimated returns on R&D investment are significant, suggesting that excluding these returns would substantially underestimate the actual impact of R&D investment. Therefore, estimates of R&D capital services are included. Accounting for net returns for nonprofit and government R&D is roughly parallel with the treatment in the business sector. In that sector, net returns are assumed to be included in business income, and similarly, net returns are included in nonprofits and in general government in the R&D satellite account. "}, {"section_title": "Avoiding the doublecounting of software.", "text": "For the 2007 R&D satellite account, the cost of developing software that is to be marketed outside the company as an R&D activity was subtracted from GDP to avoid a double count because the NSF source data also include these costs. Those costs were doublecounted in the 2006 R&D satellite account, once in R&D investment and once in software investment. For 2007, the doublecounted R&D software was removed from the software estimate and retained in R&D investment because the R&D satellite account is designed to treat all R&D as a capitalized asset. This adjustment lowered GDP and business investment by the amount of the double count. Beginning with 2002, the estimates of software R&D are taken from the NSF industry survey on the amount of total R&D performed for \"software development\" technologies. For 19902001, these estimates are implicitly included the NSF data on R&D, but not separately identified. For those years, software R&D was derived using the moreinclusive NIPA own account software and the available NSF data. To create a consistent time series, an estimate of R&D software was derived and added to the estimate for R&D for the years 1978 to 1989. Prior to 1978, the values were considered negligible, so no adjustment is made. The doublecount had become significant in recent years. While for most of the 1980s and 1990s, the doublecount is estimated to be about 5 to 6 percent of business funding of R&D, by 2004, this doublecurrent grows to 17 percent of business funding of R&D and to 43 percent of total ownaccount software."}, {"section_title": "Nature of R&D investment", "text": "The treatment of R&D investment in the R&D satellite account is similar to treatment of investment in tangible capital goods in the NIPAs. Investment in R&D reflects purchases of R&D by business and by governments and their expenditures on ownaccount R&D that will be used to generate future product and income streams for its owners. Conceptually, the investment should be recorded for the sector that owns the R&D asset. The satellite account provides estimates of R&D investment that are derived from NSF data and measured by source of funding. Ownership of the R&D output is needed to properly assign income flows to the various economic sectors in the NIPAs. The existing R&D survey data do not completely identify ownership. Consequently, the funder of R&D activity is treated as the owner of the R&D output. This means that currently the satellite account treats R&D funding of a grant for the performance of R&D the same way that it treats a contract for the purchase of R&D. In this satellite account, the owner is assumed to be the sole entity with the direct economic benefit from the R&D activity. Spillovers are recognized to exist and conceptually are already reflected in existing measures of GDP and GDI. However, the R&D satellite account does not separately identify these impacts for R&D. The satellite account provides two major disaggregations of R&D expenditures: 1) R&D output by performer and source of funding and 2) R&D investment by type of funder. Although R&D investment is based on source of funding, R&D output by performer is also an analytically useful measure that allows users to see each sector's contribution to the performance of R&D. In addition, performerbased R&D activity is the foundation for estimating currentdollar R&D investment because these estimates are based on the most detailed source data available."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "To derive R&D investment, the detailed performancebased R&D output by major sources of funding were reaggregated to a funding basis, and then imports were added and exports were subtracted. In the R&D satellite account, five sources of funding are distinguished: Federal Government, state and local governments, business, universities and colleges, and other nonprofit institutions serving households. Performerbased data from NSF were used wherever possible in preparing estimates of R&D output. This approach attempts to avoid at lease two problems. First, the data reported by funders would have to be adjusted to convert them from a timeofpaymenttotheperformer basis to a timeofexpenditurebytheperformer basis in order to be consistent with the timing with which purchases of goods and services are generally recorded in the NIPAs. Second, the data reported by funders would have to be adjusted to avoid doublecounting. Otherwise, R&D that is subcontracted would be counted twice-once by the primary source of funding and once by the secondary source of funded that subcontracted the R&D. When insufficient performer data were available, the estimates of R&D output were derived using funderreported data. After compiling the NSF reported R&D expenditures, any missing data were estimated and the data were adjusted to be conceptually and statistically consistent with the NIPAs. The R&D investment flows then were cumulated into an R&D capital stock with an annual depreciation rate using methods that are also consistent with the NIPAs."}, {"section_title": "Adjustments to the Source Data.", "text": "A number of adjustments were made to the NSF surveybased spending data on R&D to make them statistically and conceptually consistent with the NIPAs. The adjustments required to incorporate R&D investment into the NIPA framework are shown in Step 2. The R&D survey data were adjusted to make them consistent with the accounting conventions of the NIPAs. Data were converted to a calendar year basis when necessary and foreign performed R&D activity that was separately identified was excluded. Step 3. Conceptually, capital expenditures on physical plant should not be included in the measure of R&D investment. When capital expenditures were included in the source data or easily estimated, they were subtracted and treated separately as part of the stock of fixed capital used to create R&D. Similarly, as described in section 1.3, an adjustment for software R&D was made to NIPA software investment to avoid the doublecounting of this investment in the business sector. Lastly, R&D funds passed through from one institution to another R&D performer were removed\u037e these funds were already reported as expenses by the sector performing the R&D. Step 4. A conceptual adjustment was made to put depreciation of structures and equipment and software used in producing R&D on a basis that reflects the valuation and consistency appropriate for the NIPAs. Accounting for the full value of investment, includes the costs associated with the use of the stock of fixed capital used to create R&D. These costs include the economic depreciation on the structures, equipment (and, conceptually, software) used in production measured by a consumption of fixed capital (CFC) estimate. The full cost of production would also include an adjustment for taxes and subsidies on production. The satellite account used two basic approaches to obtain a NIPAconsistent estimate for the consumption of fixed tangible R&D capital. When data for R&D capital expenditures were available or easily estimated, they were removed from the reported total if included in the source data\u037e economic consumption of this capital was estimated using a perpetual inventory methodology and added back into the remaining R&D expenditures. When expenditure data on the investment in physical R&D capital was not available, an implied economic depreciation was calculated based on historicalcost depreciation for this physical R&D tangible capital. Step 5. Domestic investment includes R&D imports, which consist of R&D output performed abroad and used in the U.S. For business investment, an adjustment to the performer based R&D estimates was made to add the payments for imports of research, development and testing services (RTD) used in BEA's international transaction accounts (ITAs). 3 For Federal investment, an estimate of foreign performed R&D based on Federal R&D obligations data was added. Step 6. Domestic investment excludes R&D exports, which consist of R&D output performed in the U.S. and used abroad. For business investment, an adjustment was made to the performerbased estimates to subtract the cost of exports of RDT services. It was assumed that there were no exports of governmentfunded R&D output. For 2004, the derived investment that includes the adjustments described above is approximately $17 billion higher than the R&D expenditures reported by NSF. 4 "}, {"section_title": "Cost detail and prices.", "text": "R&D investment is difficult to measure largely because most R&D is not bought and sold in markets. Conceptually, the value of R&D to a company is equal to the discounted present value of the future benefits that the company will derive from the R&D. However, this value is embedded in the value of the goods and services the company sells, and there is no direct measure of either the contribution of R&D to sales or the market price underlying R&D assets. Companies can normally report on the cost of performing R&D, but not the market price of R&D. Therefore, the only available currentdollar value is the cost of its production. The issue then becomes how to deflate this currentdollar value to produce an estimate of real investment. Ideally, measures of real R&D investment would be calculated using market prices for R&D output. Without these market prices, four scenarios for approximating R&D output prices were developed. These scenarios are discussed in detail in a separate R&D satellite account price methodology paper. 5 One scenario deflates the currentdollar R&D investment expenditures based on inputcost prices for each sector. Three other scenarios use price indexes that are applied to all R&D investment in aggregate regardless of the underlying cost detail. They differ from the inputprice approach in that their assumptions reflect output prices at both the aggregate business and expanded industry levels and include certain characteristics to reflect the inherent risk of R&D investments: higher depreciation rates, profit residual prices, and higher rates of return. A Fisher chaining methodology was followed to develop real R&D expenditures in all price scenarios. 6 An obvious drawback to the inputcost approach is that it necessarily implies zero productivity growth because real output, by definition, grows at the same rate as real inputs. Thus, this approach seems particularly inappropriate for measuring a dynamic sector like R&D. However, the inputcost index is the most straightforward way to estimate real R&D and this method is currently used in the NIPAs to measure the value of real investment that companies create for their own use. Thus, it represents a lower bound for real R&D growth. Deflating R&D investment using the inputcost approach required that the estimates first be prepared by detailed cost component for each performing sector and then be adjusted to derive funderbased R&D investment. This method takes into account variations in the composition of inputs for different R&D performers. Estimates of performerbased output are the foundation for calculating real R&D using the inputcost approach since only two of the funding price indexes exist: Total Federal purchases of R&D (defense and nondefense) and the Federal intramural R&D price deflator calculated as part of the performerbased calculations. In order to derive funderbased estimates of real investment, it was necessary to first derive a chaintype price index for real performerbased R&D output using the detailed cost components by performer. Next, a chaintype price index for nonfederal funding of R&D was created by adding the two Federal sources of funding-intramural and extramural-as negative components to the detailed component structure for R&D output by performer. This index then was used in the calculation of real R&D investment by funding: All nonfederal funding components, including imports, were deflated by this price index. While this methodology is less than ideal, it is the best methodology available using the currently available prices. "}, {"section_title": "Estimate missing data.", "text": "The NSF suppressed total and federally funded R&D cost data for certain years and industries in order to avoid the disclosure of confidential survey data. In these cases, judgmental estimates of the undisclosed federally funded costs were made for the satellite account. These cost estimates were then combined with the reported \"company and otherfunded\" R&D costs to estimate total R&D costs in these industries. The judgmental estimates for federally funded R&D were prepared using a two stage approach. First, preliminary estimates of federal funding for missing industries were derived using the industry's federal R&D funds reported for nearby years. In this case, an annual growth rate was often calculated and used to fill in the missing data. This \"vertical\" approach ensured that the estimates were of the correct order of magnitude. Next, the preliminary estimates were adjusted using the next higher industry aggregate and reported funds for other industries within the same industry group. This \"horizontal\" approach ensured that the estimates fit with data reported at the larger industry group level. After the judgmental estimates were complete, a final check was performed to ensure that the annual expenditures at the allindustry, manufacturing and nonmanufacturing levels matched those reported by NSF.\nBEA relied heavily on various estimation techniques to fill in the missing data for this sector. Preliminary estimates of R&D performance by state and local governments by source of funding and of state and local funding of R&D performance were prepared by state and by local governments and then combined to an aggregated total. NSF source data were used where they existed and interpolated and extrapolated the estimates using indicator series to fill in missing years. For R&D performance, the following indicator series were used for sources of funding: \u2022 Federal funding: Federal R&D outlays to state and local governments from the Federal R&D estimates. Similarly, an indicator series was used to fill in missing years for state and local expenditures on R&D plant using the Census Bureau's \"State and Local Construction Spending\" for medical buildings beginning with 1993. For prior years, R&D plant expenditures were extrapolated back using the NIPA state and local investment series for \"Hospitals.\"\nBecause of limited source data and the limited number of data years available, BEA's estimates for the R&D performed by these institutions are relatively simple.

Because total industryadministered FFRDCs are presented as a separate performer in the R&D satellite account, it was necessary to remove these funds from the appropriate industries. Total NSF reported industryadministered FFRDC R&D expenditures were split by individual FFRDC based on the Federal obligations to the individual FFRDCs. To determine from which industries the FFRDC R&D expenses should be removed, the operations of the individual FFRDCs and the primary industry served were examined."}, {"section_title": "Valuation adjustment for purchased R&D.", "text": "The NSF values business R&D performance on a cost basis. While the value of own account output was estimated as the sum of costs, the value of purchased R&D should include the R&D seller's margin between receipts and costs. 8 In order to include this margin, it was necessary to distinguish between the types of industry R&D output: Purchases of R&D and ownaccount investment. The satellite account used a multistep process to first make the split between ownaccount and purchased R&D and then to add a profit margin when no additional data were available to measure R&D purchases based on receipts rather than costs. 9 The steps to derive business ownaccount R&D were as follows: \u2022 \ufffd Federal Government funding, which is on a cost basis, was subtracted from total business R&D costs by industry. \u2022 \ufffd Next, the BEAderived estimate for state and local funding of business less an estimated profit markup was subtracted from the nonFederal R&D costs. 10 These estimates were distributed to industries based on the industry R&D share of total non federally funded business R&D. \u2022 \ufffd Next, the cost of producing business R&D exports used in BEA's international transaction accounts was subtracted. These costs were estimated using the markup described above. Industry classifications were based on unpublished BEA data on international services transactions. \u2022 \ufffd Prior to 2004, an estimate of the overestimation of R&D costs in the wholesale trade sector was subtracted. In 2004, the NSF provided a revised industry classification structure that reassigns much of wholesale tradeclassified R&D and moves it to the manufacturing sector, primarily to the pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing, semiconductor and other electronic component manufacturing, computers and peripheral equipment manufacturing, and communications equipment manufacturing industries. This adjustment realigns R&D costs more closely to the source of industry receipts and it creates a consistent time series for these industries. 11 \u2022 \ufffd Next, the cost of R&D performed in NAICS industry 5417 (scientific research and development services) establishments that were reported in other industries on the NSF enterprisebased survey was subtracted. The NSF industry classification system assigns all multiunit company's R&D costs to one industry. This would include a freestanding R&D lab that sells its output to other firms as well as to other divisions of the company and that should be classified on an establishment basis in NAICS industry 5417. This adjustment was derived using a special tabulation for the year 2004 linking employment and payroll data for establishments from the Business Register to the NSF's industry categories for multiunit companies in the SIRD sample frame to adjust the company data to establishments. \u2022 \ufffd Lastly, the cost of R&D sold to other domestic business was subtracted. This adjustment used total domestic sales from NSF data, less an estimated markup. Insufficient data were available to completely assign these R&D sales to the industries that received payments for the sale of R&D. After estimating the magnitude of R&D sales from NAICS industry 5417, it was assumed that industries other than 5417 sold R&D output in proportion to their performance of R&D. After estimates of business ownaccount R&D costs by industry were completed, costs of R&D purchases from business were calculated as a residual.

Beginning with 2001, NSF began providing in this survey the expenditures for FFRDCs administered by industrial organizations and by other nonprofit organizations. Prior to 2001, industryadministered FFRDCs were reported by the industries which administered them in the NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development, although not separately identified\u037e total costs for these FFRDCs were identified for most years. The NSF reported expenditures of FFRDCs administered by nonprofit organizations for the years 1964, 1966, 1969, and 1973 as part of its survey of nonprofit organizations. Federal obligations for all three types of FFRDC are also available as part of Federal funding of R&D."}, {"section_title": "Federally funded research and development centers", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Administered by industry.", "text": "For years prior to 2001, it was assumed that the funding for industryadministered FFRDCs was all federal. While the NSF Industry survey provided total costs for most years, it provided no split between federal and nonfederal funding. Two adjustments were made to the NSF data. The first was to fill in any missing data using the derived Federal outlays to FFRDCs administered by industrial organizations. The second was to derive an estimate of CFC using the same methodology that was used for the federal intramural sector."}, {"section_title": "FFRDCs administered by nonprofit institutions serving households.", "text": "For years when NSF did not report R&D expenditures, estimates were derived by interpolation using estimated Federal outlays to FFRDCs administered by nonprofit organizations.

FFRDCs administered by consortia of both public and private schools in the private sector were included. Missing expenditures for earlier years were interpolated using derived Federal outlays to academic FFRDCs. Two statistical adjustments were made: For timing and for geographic coverage. The NSF convention of a July to June academic fiscal year was followed to convert the academic year data to a calendar year basis. Two FFRDCs located outside the United States were removed: The National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, located in Puerto Rico and the Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory, located in Chile. To derive an estimate of CFC, the same methodology that was used for the academic sector was used."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Presenting the R&D investment estimates in a satellite account of the GDP accounts allows BEA to refine estimates and provide additional methodological improvements prior to fully incorporating R&D as investment in the accounts. While the estimates of R&D investment were prepared using the best source data available, the NSF data were not collected with the intent of providing an economic measurement of R&D for the U.S. national economic accounts. As a result, current methodologies for developing R&D as investment rely heavily on adjusting the source data and require a number of assumptions. BEA continues to further refine and expand the scope of these estimates. More detailed information will be needed: For example, on R&D transactions, ownership and asset boundaries, and prices. The requirements of quarterly indicator series and source data timeliness must be addressed. As the development of the accounting framework for treating R&D as investment progresses, each improvement advances the attempt to measure the effect on the U.S. economy of investment in R&D."}]
