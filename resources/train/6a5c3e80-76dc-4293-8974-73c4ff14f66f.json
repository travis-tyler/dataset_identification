In fact, longitudinal data can be used to conduct cross-sectional (single point in time), longitudinal (across time with the same individuals), or trend (between different cohorts) analyses. The story told in the featured article of this issue of the Education Statistics Quarterlyan excerpt from the NCES report Coming of Age in the 1990s: The Eighth-Grade Class of 1988 12 Years Lateris longitudinala cohort of eighth-graders from NELS:88 is examined in 1988 and then again in the year 2000. Because NELS:88 followed a group of eighth-graders for 12 years, it is possible to associate past events with later educational and occupational outcomes. The members of this eighth-grade cohort were born at the end of the Vietnam War (1974), when handheld calculators were not used with great frequency and personal computers had just been invented. They grew up, though, in an era that experienced numerous changes in the fields of communication, technology, medicine, and transportation that influenced their day-to-day lives. They experienced explosive growth in the computer industry and participated in secondary and postsecondary education on the threshold of a new millennium dominated by personal computers. Given the rapidly paced society in which this cohort matured, some questions naturally arise: Have these individuals been prepared for the 21st century? How much education do they have? What occupations are they entering? Are they starting families? Coming of Age in the 1990s provides insight into these kinds of questions. Over 12,000 eighth-graders were surveyed both in the base year (1988) and in the fourth follow-up (2000) of NELS:88. Their responses were coded and then analyzed. Using the findings of these analyses, a story has been told about their livesboth the successes and the failures. In telling such stories, longitudinal studies have an advantage over crosssectional studies because they provide both background and outcome variables. The background variables (e.g., family characteristics, eighth-grade courses) can be used to predict later outcomes such as college or career success. Background variables do not always work well as predictors, however. For example, there are always groups of students who succeed when background variables suggest a higher risk of failure. There are also groups of students who fail (e.g., drop out of high school) when advantaged backgrounds suggest more favorable outcomes. These kinds of stories (both predictable and nonpredictable) can be used by researchers, policymakers, schools, and parents to better inform decisions regarding the education experiences that are selected for our nation's youth. The featured article takes a first look at the year 2000 outcomes experienced by the eighth-grade class of 1988."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY -VOLUME 4, ISSUE 2, SUMMER 2002 Steven\" Ingels, Thomas R.

This follow-up was conducted in 2000, the year when most eighth-grade cohort members turned 26. First surveyed in the spring term of the 1987-88 school year, the eighth-grade cohort provided information about its school experiences, as well as educational and occupational aspirations, and completed achievement tests in mathematics, reading, science, and social studies. The eighth-grade class of 1988 reported high educational aspirations. Some 66 percent planned to complete a bachelor's degree or 9 higher (Hafner et al. 1990). Parental expectations for their eighth-graders' higher education were also quite high. More than three-quarters of all parents (78 percent) expected their eighth-graders to attend college, and 58 percent expected them to finish (38 percent expected college graduation to be their eighth-graders' highest educational attainment while 20 percent expected their eighth-graders to earn a postbaccalaureate academic or professional degree) (Horn and West 1992). The 1988 eighth-grade class was surveyed again in four follow-ups: in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2000. Data from the follow-up interview in 2000 permit us to see what this cohort had accomplished 12 years after the eighth-grade baseline survey. EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY  VOLUME 4, ISSUE 2, SUMMER 2002 Featured Topic: National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) In trying to understand the later outcomes of the eighthgrade class of 1988, it may be helpful to review some of the educational, societal, and economic trends and developments that helped to form the context in which members of this cohort developed and made choices. The period during which this cohort attended elementary, middle, and secondary school saw major initiatives of the American school reform movement, including raising of graduation requirements and mandating of student testing standards (Medrich, Brown, and Henke 1992). With the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in 1992, the period after this cohort's graduation from high school benefited from high levels of support for students in postsecondary education (Berkner 1998), with increases in both grants and loans, but particularly the latter. Student loan volume more than doubled between 1990 and 2000, and the number of loans made annually doubled as well; the largest increases were in the period 1993-98 (American Council on Education 2001)."}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "In addition to educational influences, various social and economic forces may have affected the cohort as well. Within the strong American economy of the 1990s, the rate of economic return to college degrees outpaced the return to high school diplomas (Boesel and Fred land 1999). New technologies, particularly developments in computing, also marked the American economy in the 12 years (1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000) between the first and the final interviews of this cohort.

Many had already completed postsecondary education, started or even changed careers, and started to form families. The report begins with a look at the cohort's high school completion status in 2000. It next examines its postsecondary attainment and experiences. It also reports on the cohort's labor market experiences as of 2000, including employment, occupational fields, job satisfaction, use of computers, job training, income, and receipt of public aid. Next, the report looks at the current activities of cohort members with varying degrees of educational attainment those with no postsecondary education, those with some postsecondary education, and those with a bachelor's or higher degree. Finally, the report examines the cohort's family formation (marital and parental status) and other activities (e.g., citizenship and community service activities, computer use, reading patterns)."}, {"section_title": "High School Completio", "text": "By 2000, most members of the 1988 eighth-grade cohort (83 percent) had earned a high school diploma. An additional 9 percent had earned an alternative credential by passing the General Educational Development (GED) tests, and 8 percent had dropped out of high school and failed to complete by either method. Among eighth-grade cohort members who had not completed high school by 2000,14 percent reported that they were currently enrolled in school and working toward a high school diploma, GED, or attendance certificate.' Earning a GED can open educational opportunities that dropouts largely lack, since most colleges and universities accept the GED as a basis for admission (National Center for Education Statistics 2000). Cohort members from advantaged backgrounds (having highsocioeconomic status [SES] families, parents with bachelor's or higher degrees, mothers who expected them to graduate from college, and no dropout risk factors) were more likely than those from disadvantaged backgrounds (having low-SES families, parents who did not attend college, mothers who did not expect them to graduate from college, or one or more dropout risk factors2) to graduate from high school with a diploma, and less likely to complete high school with a GED or to drop out of high school. High school completion rates at the time of the interview (early in 2000) were related to educational experiences before high school, in addition to personal and background characteristics. Cohort members who, in eighth grade, exhibited high mathematics achievement (i.e., scored in the highest quartile of the NELS:88 mathematics test), studied algebra, attended a private school, or participated in extracurricular activities were more likely to graduate from high school with a diploma and generally less likely to complete high school with a GED or to drop out than were their counterparts with different academic characteristics in eighth grade. Mathematics achievement in particular, as measured in eighth grade, was associated with the likelihood both of earning a diploma and of not dropping out of high school."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Attainment and Experiences", "text": "By 2000, 8 years after most had graduated from high school, 29 percent of the 1988 eighth-grade cohort reported that they had attained a bachelor's degree or higher. Nearly 47 percent of the cohort reported that they had gained some postsecondary credits but had earned either no credential or one below a bachelor's degree (an associate's degree or certificate3). The remaining 24 percent of cohort members had not enrolled in any postsecondary education after high school. This report examines the relationship between postsecondary attainment by 2000 and both background factors (specifically, sex, familial advantage or disadvantage, and race/ethnicity) and factors related to schooling at eighth grade. Consistent with sex differences noted in recent work (Clune, Nuriez, and Choy 2001), females in the 1988 eighth-grade cohort were more likely than males to report that they had earned a bachelor's or higher degree by 2000 and were less likely to report that they had not enrolled in postsecondary education. In addition, disadvantaged cohort membersthose from low-SES families, whose parents did not have a college education, whose mothers did not expect them to complete college, or who had risk factors for dropping out of high schoolwere less likely than those without such characteristics to report that they had earned a bachelor's or higher degree and more likely to report that they had not enrolled in postsecondary education. Among cohort members, Asians/Pacific Islanders had a higher postsecondary enrollment rate (95 percent) than Whites (77 percent), Blacks (77 percent), Hispanics (70 percent), American Indians/Alaska Natives (66 percent), and those with multiracial backgrounds (76 percent).4 Moreover, Asians/Pacific Islanders were more likely than any other racial/ethnic group in the cohort to indicate earning a bachelor's degree by 2000.

Consistent with research that shows high premiums for college completion in the 1980s and 1990s (Boesel and Fredland 1999, p. ix), income did vary by level of education for the cohort. Indeed, the income premium for having a bachelor's degree over having no postsecondary education was about 33 percent, a notable difference in median income even at this early stage of cohort members' careers. Welfare payments and other forms of public aid provide support for people living in poverty, particularly for poor families with young children. A total of 3.4 percent of the 1988 eighth-grade cohort received some type of public aid in 1999, with most recipients (2.8 percent of the cohort) receiving food stamps.

Approximately 60 percent of male cohort members were single, compared with 46 percent of females. Not surprising, then, is the finding that women were more likely to be married in 2000: 45 percent of the women and 34 percent of the men were currently married. Cohort members from advantaged backgrounds (those having high-SES families, parents with bachelor's or higher degrees, and mothers who expected them to complete college) were in general more likely to be single in their mid-twenties than those who were less advantaged, probably as a result of pursuing postsecondary education at higher rates. Roughly two-thirds of 1988 eighth-grade cohort members with a bachelor's or higher degree were single in 2000 (66 percent of those with a bachelor's degree and 67 percent of those with a master's degree or higher), compared with one-half (52 percent) of those with some postsecondary education (but no bachelor's or higher degree) and 39 percent of those who had not gone to college.

The analyses here touch on the major areas of information collected in 2000. While these analyses describe the current status of the cohort and map some of the paths cohort members have followed, they do not utilize data from the intermediate points in time (data collected in 1990, 1992, and 1994) that would help identify the factors that acted as obstacles or sources of assistance to members of the 1988 eighth-grade class in realizing their goals. This report therefore also presents suggestions for further research using the NELS:88 data, now that information from the 2000 interview has become available. The release of the fourth follow-up to the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) serves as a vivid reminder of the importance of the Longitudinal Studies Program of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Over the past four decades, this series of studies has done more to chart the educational and social trajectories of America's youth than any other federal resource. The Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS:2002, which surveyed 10th-graders in the spring of 2002, promises to continue this trend, informing researchers, policymakers, and the public about the shifting landscape of the American education system and the implications of this landscape for individual lives and careers. Coming of Age in the 1990s: The Eighth-Grade Class of 1988 12 Years Later examines the findings of the fourth follow-up to NELS:88. The primary message of this statistical analysis report is that \"the rich get richer.\" There are many varieties of riches, but here I refer specifically to the socioeconomic status of eighth-graders' families and to eighth-grade mathematics achievement. The social advantages enjoyed by some eighth-graders translate into higher rates of high school completion, postsecondary attendance, and educational attainment. In turn, the higher postsecondary attainments of advantaged eighth-graders lead to careers in which computers are used frequently and that offer more job training. Similarly, those youth with higher mathematics achievement in eighth grade are more likely to complete high school and go on to obtain a bachelor's or higher degree. They too are much more likely to use computers frequently on the jobparticularly for technical, spreadsheet, or data work, for word-processing, or to send e-mailand to receive on-the job training. And by age 25, students who had been in the highest quartile in mathematics achievement in the eighth grade in 1988 were earning 23 percent more per year in 1999 than students who had been in the lowest quartile. Over time this gap may widen, and of course the cumulative gap in earnings rises sharply over the years. 14 Whether this pattern of cumulating advantages and disadvantages is good public policy is a very complex question, and individuals' judgments about this question often depend on whether they see themselves as advantaged or disadvantaged. In many cases there are competing explanations of how these patterns of academic and social advantage and disadvantage emerge. One of the great strengths of the fourth follow-up to NELS:88 is that it provides a new vantage point for exploring these explanations. Much has happened in the lives of these eighth-graders since they were initially surveyed in 1988, and many of the events that we associate with the transition to adulthoodcompleting full-time schooling, beginning a regular job, and forming a familyoccurred between 1994, the timing of the third follow-up to NELS:88, and 2000, the date of this most recent (and possibly final) snapshot of the accomplishments of this cohort. Our ability to comprehend this transition, and what it says about the process that guides educational and occupational success, would have been severely compromised if our last contact had been in 1994, when many of the youth in this cohort were but 20 years old. If we are likely to learn so much from studying the young adult years of ages 20 to 26, why stop there? Might we not learn as much from further follow-ups? Long-term followups of the 8th-, 10th-and 12th-grade cohorts surveyed in the NCES Longitudinal Studies Program have always seemed to be afterthoughtsluxuries rather than necessities. I can posit several reasons why this might be so. First, the Longitudinal Studies Program has not had adequate financial or political support nor has it captured the policy interests of other NCES periodic surveys. Second, there always seems to be more public and political interest in this year's crop of students than in the ongoing accomplishments of some older group of students. Third, in the early years of the Longitudinal Studies Program, there was a consensus that much of the action took place in high school, with the subsequent experiences and accomplishments of youth simply a straightforward extrapolation of the sorting and selecting that took place in the secondary school years. The design of NELS:88 reflected a growing interest in the middle grades. But the sampling of eighth-graders in the base year of the study produced logistical nightmares, as many more students changed schools between the base year and first follow-up than could have been anticipated on the basis of the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 or the High School and Beyond studies. The return of ELS:2002 to a cohort of 10th-graders reflects the high cost of tracing and resurveying highly mobile students. It is, I trust, a decision driven more by budgetary realities than by a dismissal of the importance of the middle years of K-12 education. Policymakers remain focused on elementary and secondary schooling. It is at these levels that the United States has what can best be described as a system of public (and private) education, and age-graded compulsory schooling laws make clear that the state's commitment to educating the young does not yet extend beyond high school. One would be hard-pressed to characterize postsecondary education as a system, given the tremendous variety of postsecondary institutions and the limited oversight offered by the federal government and the states. There is much more consensus on what all students should learn in elementary and secondary school than there is regarding the curricular content of postsecondary schooling. Consequently, policymakers gravitate toward issues that seem amenable to government intervention, and K-12 schooling seems much more tractable than the jumbled world of higher education. It seems only natural that NCES would respond in kind. The results from the fourth follow-up to NELS:88 tell a different story, however. They point to an important shift in the careers of America's youth. Three-quarters of the members of the eighth-grade cohort of 1988 had participated in postsecondary education by the year 2000 (roughly by age 26), and nearly one-half of the cohort reported some postsecondary schooling, but no bachelor's degree. Some fraction of these youth are likely en route to a bachelor's degree, but many of them have histories of intermittent, part-time enrollment that may not culminate in any postsecondary credential at all. Nearly two-thirds of the 1988 eighth-graders who participated in postsecondary education transferred credits, and one in nine attended more than one institution at the same time. In the year 2000, 80 percent of those still enrolled in postsecondary education were working for pay at the same time. What these data suggest is greater complexity in the individual trajectories, or careers, that characterize the movement from adolescence to adulthood. We know rather little about the lives and careers of this emerging group of postsecondary enrollees. They are schooled, but are they skilled? The social and economic drawbacks associated with dropping out of high school are well known, and the advantages of completing a bachelor's degree are equally clear. It is the expanding group in the middle that remains a mystery; some fly under the radar of statistical surveys such as the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, while those in the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study lack some of the information about prior educational experiences needed to place their postsecondary schooling in appropriate context. Education has become a recurring activity in the lives of American adults. Data from the Adult Education Survey of the National Household Education Surveys Program show that nearly one-half of all adults participated in some form of adult education in 1999. This represents a substantial increase from 1991, when approximately one in three adults participated in adult education. The rates are particularly high for 25-to 34-year-olds, 60 percent of whom reported participation in adult education. But they are not much lower for 35-to 54-year-olds, of whom roughly 50 percent participated in some form of adult education (Creighton and Hudson 2002). Understanding the role that schooling now plays in the lives of American adults may require a more expansive view than previous follow-ups in the Longitudinal Studies Program have provided. It is a truism in social research that the timing of the observations of a phenomenon of interest should be synchronized with changes in that phenomenon. Things that change quickly must be observed more frequently; things that do not change over long stretches of time need not be observed so often. Whereas it was once safe to assume that leaving school had a sense of finality about it, nowadays movement in and out of the education systemboth formal and informaloccurs frequently, and over long stretches of time. If so many young adults are participating in adult education, our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of such participation might benefit from continuing follow-ups of the NELS:88 cohort and of future cohorts such as the high school sophomores sampled in ELS:2002. \"17 Topic Nattonal (Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) 4i. Coming of Age in the 1990s also points to the importance of interinstitutional linkagesthe linkages between secondary education and postsecondary education, education and work, and education and the family. These linkages have always been a bit of a blind spot for NCES. The Longitudinal Studies Program has devised a series of studies of individuals, not of social institutions. With the exception of the secondary school as a context, most of the available data on institutional contexts for learning and human development stem from respondents' self-reports. Such self-reports are necessarily incomplete representations of complex institutions such as work and family. We learn from the report, for example, that NELS:88 cohort members who had received no postsecondary education by the year 2000 are substantially less likely than their peers with some postsecondary education or a bachelor's degree to have received job training in the previous 12 months. But we have few tools for explaining this variant of the \"rich get richer\" story. Do those with less education choose to pursue job training less often than those with more education, or do firms systematically cultivate the talents of their more educated employees? Absent heroic efforts to gather independent information on employers (e.g., firm personnel policies) and link the data to the individual NELS:88 respondents, the study design does not allow us to adjudicate between these two possibilities."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "Recent theorizing in studies of education and the life course has placed the opportunity structure in the foreground and individual decisionmaking in the background. Considering both individual agency and social structure, however, provides a more complete accounting of coming of age than focusing on one to the exclusion of the other. Longitudinal studies such as NELS:88 have been quite successful at documenting the choices that individuals make; they have been less so at illuminating the structural constraints on choice that are represented in interinstitutional linkages. This can best be remedied by gathering more data on the institutional contexts in which individuals act. It's easy to sit on the sidelines and take potshots at complex studies; it's a wonder that it doesn't happen more often. But I would not want my suggestions for enhancing the utility of the follow-ups of NELS:88 and the new ELS:2002 study to detract from my overall assessment that these studies are a sound investment in understanding contemporary American life. By illuminating the important role of secondary and postsecondary schooling in creating productive adult members of society, the Longitudinal Studies Program of NCES continues to inform public debate about quality and inequality in American education. Coming of Age in the 1990s: The Eighth-Grade Class of 1988 12 Years Later provides a comprehensive snapshot of the educational, socioeconomic, familial, and communal experiences of a cohort of 1988 eighth-graders during a period of great national and international economic transformation. To do so, the authors of the report use base-year data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) and data from its fourth follow-up, conducted in 2000. The authors use the base-year data to allocate students to different categories and to describe how students who occupied different categories earlier in their educational careers fared in the transition to adulthood. With the 2000 data, they show the overall proportion of students who have followed different paths, reached particular milestones, and more. In short, this snapshot provides important information that policymakers, researchers, educational practitioners, employers, and others need to know Were that all, the volume would be a must-read for key actors in society. Yet, at the same time, the authors, with the assistance of Jeffrey Owings and others at NCES, adroitly place this cohort in the context of the changes that have occurred during the cohort's transition from childhood to adulthood. It is easy to forget just how much has changed in the last quarter century. Throughout the volume, the authors remind the reader of the changing context the cohort encountered as it reached key points of transition. Indeed, figure 1 from the report concisely and effectively conveys the diverse and dramatic changes that have occurred since cohort members were born."}, {"section_title": "Findings of Change and Stability", "text": "Amidst such change we should not be surprised to find changes in cohort members' experiences as well, but the question, of course, is in what ways did their experiences become affected. For example, one of the most far-ranging transformations of the period was the diffusion of computing technology through virtually all sectors of the economy. This diffusion is reflected by the high proportion of cohort members (over two-thirds) who used a computer at work in 2000. Although use of a computer at work varied by socioeconomic background, nearly half of those from the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) quartile, two-thirds of those from the middle-SES quartiles, and nearly four-fifths of those from the highest-SES quartile used a computer at work. Although this socioeconomic gradient is noteworthy, interestingly, some high-level uses (e.g., writing software) showed no differences by socioeconomic background. Hence, by any measure, computers have transformed the workplaces this cohort occupies. The spread of computer technology is just one example of the dramatic changes that have rolled through society since the mid-1970s. Coining of Age in the 1990s does an excellent job of keeping the reader aware of how such changes may make a difference. Amidst such change, however, there are some notable stabilities. Socioeconomic gaps remain substantial in many respects. For example, we learn that nearly 60 percent of students from the highest-SES quartile obtained a bachelor's or higher degree in 2000. In contrast, only 24 percent of students in the middle quartiles obtained a bachelor's or higher degree. Note that these students in the middle quartiles arguably come from middle-class backgrounds. What they are not is the upper middle class, a colloquial term used often in the United States, perhaps to avoid acknowledging that if some are in the middle, then some must be on top. But it is clear that the highest-SES students have markedly better degree attainment prospects than do the middle-SES students. In the same way, the students in the middle-SES quartiles fare far better than those in the lowest-SES quartile; only 7 percent of students from the lowest-SES quartile obtained bachelor's or higher degrees in 2000. In other words, and put crudely, the middle-SES students did about three times better than the lowest-SES students in attaining degrees, and the highest-SES students did about 2.5 times better than the middle-SES students in attaining degrees. In sum, socioeconomic differentials are extremely large. This is an important set of findings to put before the public, and Corning of Age in the 1990s accomplishes that important task. Further research will be needed to ascertain what these socioeconomic-linked differences mean. If these and other socioeconomic differences are large enough, consistent enough, and robust enough, they may support the theory of effectively maintained inequality (EMI) (Lucas 2001). EMI contends that when there are quantitative differences in a the socioeconomically advantaged will use their resources to obtain more of the good.  1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 AVERAGE SAMPLE MEMBER AGE 0 quantitative difference might be years of schooling; under EMI, we would expect those of advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds to obtain more schooling. And EMI contends that when there are qualitative differences in the good, the socioeconomically advantaged will use their resources to obtain what is qualitatively better. An example of a qualitative difference is provided by tracking: empirical research indicates that students in different educational locations will be exposed to qualitatively different instruction (e.g., Gamoran 1993). We would expect the socioeconomically advantaged to use their resources to obtain the qualitatively better locations, in this case, college preparatory placements in secondary school. Ethnographic evidence is consistent with this expectation (e.g., Useem 1992). Owing to the ability to trade qualitatively better goods for quantitatively more goods down the road, these processes serve to effectively maintain inequality, perhaps even when access to a good is equalized. Once access to a good is equalized (e.g., access to high school), the socioeconomically advantaged seek out and obtain qualitatively better goods at that level. And those qualitative advantages can be \"cashed in\" for more of other goods later. In studying the role of socioeconomic background on educational attainment, EMI helped to interpret changes in the effect of socioeconomic background in making several transitions through secondary school on through college entry. This work was done using the High School and Beyond cohort (Lucas 2001). The same kind of process may also be operating in the more recent cohort of 1988 eighth-graders. Whether EMI or some other explanation makes sense of the astounding gross socioeconomic differentials remains for future analysis to discover, but it is clear that the socioeconomic differentials shown in Coming of Age in the 1990s cry out for both continuing analysis and, more important, a policy response."}, {"section_title": "Regrettable Limitations of Coming of Age in the 1990s", "text": "The foregoing should make clear that Coming of Age in the 1990s is an indispensable volume, and nothing below alters that assessment. Yet it is not all that it could be, nor all that the wider public might need it to be, because of several factors. The analysis is very effective at showing how the changing context must be considered in interpreting the attainments of the cohort. In the same way, the youth-toadult transition has several key moments, which are, in principle, available, due to the longitudinal design of NELS:88. It would have been helpful to see whether a key interim moment, picked up in earlier waves of data collec-; EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY Invited CommentaryTransitioning to Adulthood in a Turbulent Time tion, played a big role in the attainments observed in 2000. But this might have been very difficult to do, in part because of the very complexity of the NELS:88 data set. Not only were there several waves of data, with some unavoidable attrition owing to the longitudinal design, but earlier waves were subsampled (to contain cost) and freshened, to make the sample nationally representative at different grades. This subsampling and freshening greatly complicates efforts to use more than two waves in any analysis. The complications arise because the set of cases common across more than two waves may not generalize to any easily identifiable population. Perhaps one reason the snapshot contains only two waves of data is that analyzing more than two waves is just too difficult and too complicated, even for those most closely connected to the data collection. If so, it will be important for future data collection to be designed so that future cohorts to be studied will allow analysts to combine the waves so as to sketch the unfolding experiences of the cohorts in a straightforward way. A second reason Coming of Age in the 1990s cannot be all the wider public needs it to be is that a wave of data collection would need to be conducted in 2004 or 2005 to answer many questions posed in the base year. In earlier waves, students and young adults often were asked about their plans and expectations. Students were asked to think about a time far into the futureage 30. For 14-year-olds, such a far-off timea time further away from them than their own infancymay be difficult to concretely assess. Yet it was the time frame for which expectations and aspirations were ascertained, and it is a reasonable age to select. The 2000 wave, however, assessed the accomplishments and life-course transitions of young adults at a modal age of 26. If we learn anything from Coming of Age in the 1990s, it is that the transitions between ages 14 and 26 were a complex affair for many members of the cohort. The fact that we see that complexity with only two waves of data collection is testimony to the strength of the report. Had the authors analyzed additional intermediate waves, their analysis would only reveal even more complexity. However, the analytic implication of the complexity is that it is unlikely that one can ascertain whether members of the cohort met the aspirations they set for themselves when in middle school by considering their achievements 4 years before the \"deadline\" for the realization of those aspirations. the 1990s will be our last look at this pivotal cohort. Unfortunately, with that last look, many of the questions that motivated the original investment will remain unanswered. That is not the fault of the authors of the report, but it remains a regrettable circumstance nevertheless."}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "text": "Coming of Age in the 1990s is an essential volume.

The average score of twelfth-grade students, however, has not changed significantly. Gains seen in fourth-and eighth-graders' 2001 achievement-level performance The 2001 U.S. history assessment results show some changes since 1994 in the percentages of students at or above the NAEP achievement levels (figure B). At grade 4, the percentage of students performing at or above Basic increased between 1994 and 2001, although there were no changes in the percentages of students performing at or above Proficient and at Advanced. At grade 8, there were increases in the percentages of students at or above Basic and Proficient, as well as at Advanced. At grade 12, however, the percentages performing at or above each level in 2001 were not statistically different from 1994. Gains made by lower-performing fourth-graders and lower-and higher-performing eighth-graders Looking at how scores changed across the performance distribution clarifies the source of the improvement in the average national score at grades 4 and 8. An examination of scores at different percentiles on the 0-500 U.S. history scale at each grade indicates whether or not the changes seen in the national average score results are reflected in the performance of lower-, middle-, and higher-performing students. The percentile indicates the percentage of students whose scores fell below a particular average score. In 2001, for example, 25 percent of fourth-graders scored at or below 186.\nSome of the major findings from the analysis of public high school dropout and 4-year completion rate data are the following: Between 1993-94 and 1997-98 (years in which the numbers of reporting states were similar), the high school dropout rates were between 4 percent and 7 percent in almost two-thirds of the reporting states (table A). White and Asian/Pacific Islander students were less likely to drop out than were American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, or Hispanic students. Approximately one-third of all reporting states reported dropout rates of 10 percent or higher for Black students in each year from 1993-94 through 1997-98. Slightly less than one-half of the states had similar dropout rates for Hispanic students in this time period.   -Data missing. 'This state reported on an alternative July-June cycle rather than the specified October-September cycle. 2The following states reported data using an alternative calendar in the years indicated: Alaska (1995-96), Ohio (1993 -94), Wyoming (1993-94), and Puerto Rico (all years except 1997-98). 'Effective with the 1995-96 school year, Louisiana changed its dropout data collection from school-level aggregate counts reported by districts to an individual, student-record system.The increase in the dropout rate is due in part to the increased abilityto track students. Students were more likely to drop out of high school in districts that served large or midsize cities than in rural districts for those states reporting. When relatively low dropout rates are examined, 1997-98 data highlight this difference. In that year, the average high school dropout rate was less than 4 percent in rural districts in 16 of 37 reporting states. In contrast, none of the 21 reporting states with large city districts reported a dropout rate of less than 4 percent in large city districts. O High school 4-year completion rates were 80 percent or higher in 20 of 33 reporting states in 1997-98 (table B). (This rate does not reflect those receiving a GED-based equivalency credential.) The average 4-year completion rate was less than 60 percent for American Indian/Alaska Native students in nine reporting states, Hispanic students in six reporting states, and Black students in six reporting states in 1997-98 (table C). In every reporting state except Alabama, Maine, and West Virginia, the 4-year completion rate was higher for Asian/Pacific Islander students than for the other minority groups in 1997-98.  'Includes regular and other diplomas, as well as other completion credentials (e.g., certificates of attendance or other certificates of completion), but does not include high school equivalency credentials (e.g., GEDs). 2Effective with the 1995-96 school year, Louisiana changed its dropout data collection, which increased the number of its dropouts. In calculating the completion rates, 1995-96 data were used in place of older data. NOTE:The completion rate is calculated by dividing the number of high school completers in a given year by the number of high school completers in that year and dropouts over a 4-year period. \nEducation revenues Total education revenues per pupil averaged $7,067 (in unadjusted dollars) in 1997-98, but the range in revenues per pupil across the 50 states and the District of Columbia was quite substantialfrom $10,550 in New Jersey to $4,770 in Mississippi (table A). New Jersey, the state with the highest revenues per pupil, raised 2.2 times the revenue of Mississippi, the lowest revenue state. Cost adjustments reduced the range in revenues per pupil, but New Jersey, the state with the highest revenues per pupil ($9,158), still raised 1.8 times the revenues of Utah, the state with the lowest revenues per pupil ($4,998) (table B).1 Although federal, state, and local revenues per pupil all varied across the 50 states, revenues per pupil from state sources showed the largest range between the highest and lowest revenue states and federal revenues per pupil the smallest. In unadjusted dollars, state revenues per pupil in Hawaii ($6,009) were nearly 10 times higher than state revenues in New Hampshire ($633) (table A). Local revenues per pupil were almost seven times higher in New Jersey ($5,972) than in New Mexico ($857), and federal revenues per pupil were over four times higher in Alaska ($1,133) than in New Hampshire ($258).

Teachers made up 51.6 percent of all staff in the 2000-01 school year, and instructional aides and coordinators made up an additional 11.9 percent of staff (figure 2). The percentage of all staff who were teachers ranged from 60.0 percent in Rhode Island to 44.1 percent in Kentucky. Vermont had a relatively low percentage of teachers per staff (47.3 percent), the highest percentage of instructional aides (22.1 percent), and the lowest student/teacher ratio (12.1 students per teacher) (table 2). Another 26.4 percent of all staff (librarians, counselors, and other support staff) provided support services to schools and students. Staff providing support included 97,369 guidance counselors and 54,281 librarians. This translates to 485 students for every guidance counselor reported on average, and 870 students for each librarian.

This question asked students about their use of computers in general for history or social studies, not about any particular type of computer use. The results indicate a negative relationship between more frequent general use of computers in a social studies or history class and students' performance on the U.S. history assessment. At all three grades, students who reported daily general use had lower average scores than did those who reported less frequent general use. Specific computer use. It should be noted that relatively few students reported using a computer at school for history or social studies: 74 percent of fourth-graders, 64 percent of eighth-graders, and 42 percent of twelfth-graders said that they never or hardly ever used a computer in school to study these subjects. An additional 27 percent of twelfth-graders reported not having studied history during the twelfth grade. As shown on the following page, frequent users also tended to score lowest; however, the results presented below suggest that how the technology is used may matter. While figure E presents results that suggest a negative relationship between frequent general use of computers in history or social studies classes and students' performance, figures F and G indicate a positive relationship at grades 8 and 12 when computers are used for specific activities in such classes. Figure F shows that both eighth-and twelfthgraders who used computers to a great extent for research projects by using CDs or the Internet scored higher, on average, than those who did so to a lesser extent. Figure G indicates a similar positive relationship: eighth-and twelfthgraders who used computers to write reports had higher average scores than their peers who did not. It should be noted that a relationship between computer use and average U.S. history scores cannot, without further investigation, be interpreted causally.

Each of these resources was related to the likelihood that teachers also reported using the Internet for instruction. Sixty-five percent of teachers reporting classroom access to the Internet reported using computers or the Internet for instruction during class time, compared with 38 percent of teachers reporting no classroom access (table 1). Similarly, 56 percent of teachers who reported that training was available to them from their state, district, or school in the use of the Internet reported using computers or the Internet for instruction during class time, compared with 43 percent of teachers who said training was not available and 34 percent of those who did not know. Fifty-six percent of teachers reporting availability of technical assistance for using the Internet reported using computers or the Internet for instruction during class time, compared with 42 percent of teachers who said assistance was not available. Teachers were most likely to use the Internet for instruction during class time when they reported that both classroomlevel access and support in the form of training and assistance were available to them.

NOTE: For this figure, the training and assistance variables were combined into one dichotomous variable that indicated whether or not both training and assistance were available.Teachers who reported that the Internet was not available to them anywhere in the school were excluded from the analyses presented in this figure. Among teachers who reported classroom Internet access and the availability of training and assistance for the Internet, the school-level disparities in reported use discussed earlier no longer appear. Of teachers reporting classroom Internet access and the availability of training and assistance for the Internet, 68 percent reported the use of computers or the Internet for instruction during class time (figure 1). No statistically significant differences based on school poverty concentration or school minority enrollment were found (data not shown). What School Characteristics Are Related to the Presence of Classroom Internet Access and Support? Generally, teachers in schools with high enrollment of poor students were less likely to report classroom Internet access and the availability of training and assistance in the use of the Internet. Teachers in schools with 50 percent or more of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch were less likely than teachers in schools with 11 to 30 percent of students eligible to report that the Internet was available in their classroom, and they were less likely than teachers in schools with less than 50 percent of students eligible to report that training in the use of the Internet was available (table 2). Teachers in schools with more than 70 percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch were less likely than teachers in schools with less than 50 percent of students eligible to report that assistance in the use of the Internet was available. Overall, half or less of all teachers reported the availability of all three resourcesclassroom Internet access, and training and assistance in the use of the Internet (table 2, last column). Differences in classroom access, training, and assistance existed by the level of minority enrollment in a teacher's school. Teachers in schools with minority enrollment of 50 percent or more were less likely than those in schools with less than 50 percent minority enrollment to report having a combination of all three resourcesclassroom Internet access, training in the use of the Internet, and assistance in the use of the Internetas well as having each resource individually"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Classroom-level access to the Internet and support in the form of training and assistance appear to be important factors in instructional use of the Internet during class time. Depending on school characteristics, half or less of teachers reported that all three resources were available, and of these teachers, about two-thirds indicated that they used computers or the Internet for instruction during class time. Furthermore, among teachers who reported having all of these resources, the percentage reporting instructional use of computers or the Internet during class time did not vary by the proportion of poor and minority students at these teachers' schools. However, teachers in schools with high enrollments of poor and minority students were generally less likely to report the availability of these resources. The rapid pace of change in the world of education technology necessitates the further collection of data. In the year after these data were collected alone, the proportion of instructional rooms with Internet access in U.S. public schools rose, from 64 percent in 1999 to 77 percent in 2000 (Cattagni and Farris 2001). In addition, there is much more to be learned about teachers' instructional use of technology. Data on digital content used in classrooms, online assessments, the quality and duration of instances of instructional use of technology, and other areas would further our ability to understand how technology is changing the nation's classrooms. Other NCES survey programs, such as the Schools and Staffing Survey and the National Assessment of Educational Progress, will be publishing more data on teachers' use of technology in the next few ; 74 classroom teachers.

In 1999-2000, music instruction and visual arts instruction were available in most of the nation's public elementary schools (94 and 87 percent, respectively) (figure 1). Dance and drama/theatre instruction were available in less than one-third of elementary schools (20 and 19 percent, respectively). Results of the elementary school survey also indicate that Overall, 72 percent of elementary schools that offered music instruction and 55 percent of elementary schools that offered visual arts instruction employed full-time specialists to teach these subjects. Full-time specialists in dance were employed by 24 percent of elementary schools that offered this subject, and fulltime specialists in drama/theatre were employed by 16 percent of elementary schools that offered this subject. o Sixty-seven percent of elementary schools that offered music had dedicated rooms with special equipment for instruction in this subject. Of the schools that offered visual arts, 56 percent had dedicated rooms with special equipment for visual arts instruction. Fourteen percent of elementary schools that offered dance and 13 percent of schools offering drama/theatre had dedicated rooms with special equipment for teaching these subjects. o During the 1998-99 school year, 77 percent of regular public elementary schools sponsored field trips to arts performances and 65 percent sponsored field trips to art galleries or museums (table 1).  Thirty-eight percent of public elementary schools sponsored visiting artists, 22 percent sponsored artists-in-residence, and 51 percent sponsored afterschool activities that included the arts.\nDrawing from this report's compendium of descriptive statistics about part-time instructional faculty and staff available from NSOPF:93, we have identified five major findings: A higher proportion of part-time faculty members than full-time faculty members were female. There were differences between part-time faculty members in the humanities compared with part-time faculty members in other program areas. Part-time faculty members perceived lower levels of support from their institution than full-time faculty. About one-half (49 percent) of part-time faculty members also held full-time employment. O Part-time faculty members had different motivations for part-time employment. Many of those employed part time wanted to be a part of an academic environment or preferred working part time. Still others worked part time because full-time work was unavailable or they were finishing their degrees. These findings are discussed below. Differences among part-time faculty One of the strengths of postsecondary institutions is the variation among them. Just as it is preferable to distinguish among types of institutions, it is also preferable to distinguish among instructional faculty and staff who teach in them because patterns of faculty employment seem to be different in each sector (Clark 1997). In addition to the type of institution, the various academic disciplines act as somewhat unique \"labor markets,\" affected in different ways by changing enrollments, doctoral pipeline patterns, gender composition of the faculty, and many other issues. As Clark has suggested, understanding faculty work may require disaggregation into the \"small worlds\" of the individual disciplines and the particular contexts of the many strata of institutions (Clark 1997). Likewise, part-time instructional faculty and staff are not a homogeneous group. While it is true that part-time instructional faculty and staff were not generally in positions that had the same benefits, job security, and working conditions as full-time faculty, there was variation in their employment characteristics (such as academic rank, tenure status, type of appointment, and income). For example, about 30 percent of part-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions held academic ranks of assistant, associate, or full professor. Although the majority of those employed part time held the academic rank of instructor or lecturer, the variation across the academic ranks in 4-year institutions suggests that part-time faculty held different types of appointments at their institutions (table A). In addition, the percentage of part-time instructional faculty and staff who held a doctorate or first-professional degree was higher in 4-year than in 2-year institutions, perhaps because the doctorate or first-professional degree is more often a requirement in 4-year institutions. Thirty-eight percent of part-time faculty in 4-year institutions held a 98 doctorate or first-professional degree compared with 13 percent of those in 2-year institutions. Overall, about one-quarter of part-time faculty members held a doctorate or first-professional degree and one-half held a master's degree as their highest degree. In the fall of 1992, part-time faculty members were 46 years old on average, and full-time faculty were 48 years old on average. Seven percent of those employed part time were 65 or older. Part-time faculty were also distributed across the age ranges of people typically in mid-career: about one-third of part-time faculty were 35-44 years old (34 percent) or 45-54 years old (30 percent) ( figure A)."}, {"section_title": "Arts education in public secondary schools", "text": "Music and visual arts instruction were offered in most of the nation's public secondary schools (90 and 93 percent, respectively) in 1999-2000 (figure 2).

Further, the secondary school survey indicates that Most public secondary schools that offered music, visual arts, dance, and drama/theatre instruction employed full-time specialists to teach these subjects, with 91 percent reporting one or more full-time music specialists, 94 percent reporting one or more full-time visual arts specialists, 77 percent reporting one or more full-time dance specialists, and 84 percent reporting one or more full-time drama/theatre specialists. Ninety-one percent of public secondary schools that offered music instruction had dedicated music rooms Arts Education in Public Elementary andSecondary Schools: 1999-2000 with special equipment for teaching the subject, and 87 percent of those with visual arts instruction had dedicated art rooms with special equipment.

Results from the three 1999-2000 teacher surveys indicate that    Visual arts specialists had more time set aside each week for planning or preparation during the regular school day than music specialists and classroom teachers (4.2 hours vs. 3.6 and 3.4 hours, respectively).

The current report focuses solely on CCD data and introduces a high school 4-year completion rate based upon dropout and completion statistics. The 4-year completion rate is the proportion of students who leave school from the 9th through 12th grades who do so as completers.

Approximately 47,000 students attended the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools (table  1). The governance of BIA schools differs from that of the federal DoD schools. The Education Amendments Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-561) and further technical amendments (PL. 98-511, 99-89, and 100-297) mandated major changes in BIA-funded schools. These amendments empowered Indian school boards, provided for local hiring of teachers and staff, and granted the direct funding of schools. The BIA does not report the number of staff or graduate counts. How many students were educated in outlying areas? Five outlying areas participate in the CCD collection: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

Nationally, revenues increased an average of 7.4 percent over the previous year's revenues of $347 billion (in unadjusted dollars).  (table 3). This represents a $21 billion (6.9 percent) increase over expenditures in the previous school year ($303 billion in unadjusted dollars). About $200 billion in current expenditures went for instruction. Another $110 billion was expended for a cluster of services that support instruction. Almost $14 billion was spent on noninstructional services. When expressed in terms of the typical education dollar, instructional expenditures accounted for 62 cents of the education dollar for current expenditures (figure 2). Instructional expenditures include teacher salaries and benefits, supplies (e.g., textbooks), and purchased services. About 34 cents of the education dollar went for support services, which include operation and maintenance of buildings, school administration, transportation, and other student and school support activities (e.g., student counseling, libraries, and health services). Approximately 4 cents of every education dollar went to noninstructional activities, which include school meals and enterprise activities, such as bookstores. Most states were closely clustered around the national average (61.7 percent) in terms of the share of current expenditures that was spent on instruction; all but five states and the District of Columbia spent more than 58.0 percent of their current expenditures on instruction (table 4).

NOTE: All cost adjustments were made using the Geographic Cost of Education Index (GCEI) (Chambers 1998 introduction The Pell Grant program is the largest federal need-based grant program available to postsecondary education students. In 1998-99, the federal government spent $7.2 billion on Pell Grants for more than 3.8 million students (U.S. Department of Education 1999). Students can use a Pell Grant at almost all 2-and 4-year public and private not-for-profit institutions, as well as several thousand private for-profit institutions. Pell Grant program eligibility is based primarily on the student's and/or parents' income for the previous year, with awards made primarily to low-income students. Among undergraduates who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96, 87 percent of Pell Grant recipients were either dependent students whose parents' incomes were under $45,000 (59 percent) or independent students with incomes under $25,000 (28 percent). Other factors are also taken into account in awarding Pell Grants, such as student and parent assets and other family members who are concurrently enrolled in college. This report provides a description of Pell Grant recipients who were first-time beginning postsecondary students in 1995-96. Using data from the 1996 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, \"First Follow-up\" (BPS:96/98), the report examines the academic and enrollment characteristics of beginning students who received a Pell Grant and their rates of persistence 3 years after first starting postsecondary education. These students are compared with beginning students who did not receive a Pell Grant. Because Pell Grant recipients are predominantly low-income students, high-income students were excluded from the analysis when comparing students' educational background and postsecondary outcomes. For these analyses, Pell Grant recipients were only compared to lowand middle-income nonrecipients. However, all students were included when analyzing the distribution of different types of financial aid and the types of institutions that students attended with respect to whether or not they received a Pell Grant. In 1995-96,29 percent of all beginning students and 32 percent of full-time beginning students received a Pell Grant. Beginning postsecondary students receiving Pell Grants differed from other first-time students in the types of institutions attended and receipt of other types of financial aid. When examining low-and middle-income students only, Pell Grant recipients differed from nonrecipients in their level of high school academic preparation and the number of factors that put them at risk for not achieving their educational objectives. Institution Type, Pell Grant Awards, and Other Financial Aid Taking into account all students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96, Pell Grant recipients differed from nonrecipients in where they enrolled. In particular, they were more likely than nonrecipients to attend private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions, which provide primarily short-term occupational training. Pell Grant recipients were less likely than nonrecipients to attend public 4-year, public 2-year, and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions (table A). Differ-ences in enrollment patterns were also notable among fulltime students, with 26 percent of Pell Grant recipients attending public 4-year institutions and 22 percent attending private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions. In contrast, 35 percent of full-time nonrecipients attended public 4-year institutions and 8 percent attended private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions. Because Pell Grant recipients are primarily low-income students, they were more likely than nonrecipients to qualify for and receive additional types of financial aid such as loans, work-study, and other grant aid. Among Pell Grant recipients, those enrolled at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions were more likely than those at other institutions to receive other financial aid."}, {"section_title": "Academic Background and Enrollment Characteristics", "text": "Taking into account low-and middle-income students only, Pell Grant recipients were less well prepared academically than their counterparts who did not receive a Pell Grant.

Low-and middle-income Pell Grant recipients attending less-than-4-year institutions differed in some respects from nonrecipients in their educational objectives. Recipients at public 2-year institutions were more likely than nonrecipients to be pursuing an associate's degree and less likely to be working toward a vocational certificate. Pell Grant recipients enrolled at private for-profit less-than -4year institutions were more likely than nonrecipients to be pursuing no degree and less likely to be pursuing a vocational certificate. Pell Grant recipients enrolled at public 2-year institutions also were more likely than nonrecipients to enroll full time and less likely to work while enrolled. This may be due in part to the Pell Grant program's requirements. Both parttime attendance and income earned from employment can decrease eligibility for a Pell Grant. Persistence and Attainment of Beginning Students With Pell Grants\nPersistence at 4-year institutions Considering all low-and middle-income beginning students who were enrolled at 4-year institutions in 1995-96, no differences in 3-year persistence rates were detected between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients. Furthermore, with one exception, no differences were detected in persistence between Pell recipients and nonrecipients when taking into account either SAT I/ACT composite test scores (table B) or high school curriculum (table C). The exception was for those who scored in the lowest SAT I/ACT quartile (table B): Pell grant recipients were less likely than nonrecipients to leave postsecondary education without a degree (16 vs. 26 percent). Private not-for-profit 4-year institutions. When examining low-and middle-income students in 4-year institutions separately within sector, some differences were observed among students enrolled at private not-for-profit institutions.

Among those who had taken a rigorous high school curriculum, however, no differences in persistence rates were detected between recipients and nonrecipients (89 percent for both groups). Public 4-year institutions. Among low-and middle-income beginning students enrolled at public 4-year institutions, differences were found among students scoring in the lowest and middle quartiles on their entrance exams: Among those scoring in the lowest quartile, Pell Grant recipients were less likely to leave without a degree (15 vs. 28 percent), while among those scoring in the middle quartiles, Pell Grant recipients were more likely to leave without a degree (17 vs. 12 percent). However, in neither of these test score groups (lowest or middle quartiles) were differences detected in the likelihood of remaining enrolled at an institution of the same level or higher. Persistence at less-than-4-year institutions Among low-and middle-income students enrolled at lessthan-4-year institutions, Pell Grant recipients averaged more persistence risk factors than nonrecipients and were less likely than nonrecipients to have graduated from high school. Despite such risk attributes, no differences in 3-year persistence rates were detected between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients attending either public 2-year or private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions. Persistence of Pell Grant recipients receiving other financial aid or parental support The study also examined 3-year persistence rates for fulltime beginning students with a Pell Grant in light of other types of financial assistance received, in particular loan aid and assistance from parents. Among full-time Pell Grant recipients enrolled at private institutions (both not-forprofit 4-year and for-profit less-than-4-year institutions), those who received loan aid during their first year of enrollment were more likely than those who did not receive any loans to remain enrolled at an institution of the same level or higher. No such differences in persistence were detected among Pell Grant recipients enrolled at public 2-year or public 4-year institutions. Finally, Pell Grant recipients were examined with respect to the relationship between persistence and financial support from parents.'

Among low-and middle-income beginning students, Pell Grant recipients were more likely than nonrecipients to have each of these persistence risk factors except for full-time employment and part-time enrollment (figure A). Recipients also had a higher average number of risk factors than did nonrecipients. Recipients' likelihood of having such factors varied by institution type, with those at less-than-4-year institutions more likely than those at 4-year institutions to be at risk. Within each institution type, however, Pell Grant recipients were more likely than nonrecipients to be independent, to have children, and to be single parents.

Examination of 3-year rates of persistence included comparisons of students by institution type and academic background, comparisons of Pell Grant recipients by receipt of other financial aid or parental support, and a multivariate analysis taking into account several variables associated with persistence. The 3-year persistence rates of Pell Grant recipients initially enrolled at 4-year institutions and those enrolled at lessthan-4-year institutions were examined separately to account for differences in the academic preparation and educational goals of students at different types of institutions. Because Pell Grant recipients were less well prepared academically and reported more persistence risk factors than nonrecipients, it might be expected that Pell Grant recipients would have lower rates of persistence and attainment than nonrecipients. However, with a few exceptions, this appeared in large part not to be observed in this study."}, {"section_title": "Relationship of specific variables to persistence", "text": "Finally, a multivariate analysis was conducted analyzing the likelihood of remaining enrolled at an institution of the same level or higher for 3 years. The analysis included all full-time low-and middle-income beginning students enrolled at all types of institutions.

Before any of the background variables were taken into consideration, among all full-time low-and middle-income beginning students enrolled at all postsecondary institutions, Pell Grant recipients were less likely to remain enrolled than their nonrecipient counterparts. However, the findings from the multivariate analysis showed that no differences in persistence could be detected after controlling for the covariation of related variables. In other words, after taking into account such variables as type of institution first attended, income, parents' education, age, and persistence risk factors, the analysis failed to find a difference in persistence between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients. introduction Part-time faculty members are a sizable part of the workforce in postsecondary institutions today. Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992 (Kirshstein, Matheson, and Jing 1997). Two out of five (44 percent) of those employed part time were teaching in public 2-year institutions. Part-time instructional faculty and staff represented 62 percent of all instructional faculty and staff teaching for credit in public 2-year institutions during the fall of 1992 (Palmer 2000). That there has been an increase in the number and percentage of part-time faculty over the last 20 years is undeniable. The Digest of Education Statistics has tracked this increase over time (Snyder and Hoffman 2000). What is perhaps surprising to some, however, is that we have very little historical information about the characteristics of part-time faculty overall and that we have even less information about the similarities and differences among part-time faculty members and between part-time and fulltime faculty in general. One notable exception is Gappa and Leslie's (1993) The Invisible Faculty, which used data from the 1988 National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:88) and interviews with part-time faculty members from around the country to describe their characteristics. They concluded that part-time faculty members were a diverse workforce and that they were even more diverse in many ways than full-time faculty, yet more similar to them than is often assumed. Policymakers, administrators, researchers, and the public have become more concerned in recent years about the increase in part-time faculty. Part-time faculty members have become more vocal about what they see as inequitable treatment in the workplace and, in many states, have sought to unionize in an effort to improve working conditions, salary, and benefits (Saltzman 2000). As a result, understanding who part-time faculty members are, what they do, and what they think is becoming an increasingly important issue. Data from the 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93) provide valuable insight into the characteristics of this group of faculty from a national perspective. A nationally representative sample of faculty and instructional staff received questionnaires in 1993 that asked about their employment in the fall of 1992. These data add to our knowledge about the characteristics of parttime faculty overall and the similarities and differences among part-time faculty members and between part-time faculty and full-time faculty in general. Specifically, this report presents estimates of the characteristics, qualifications, motivations, work patterns, and attitudes of part-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year and 2-year institutions by program area for the fall of 1992. The report compares part-time faculty and full-time faculty, examines some of the common perceptions about part-time faculty, and provides a comprehensive source of descriptive statistics about part-time faculty characteristics.' This report is a valuable resource about part-time faculty in the United States. Gappa and Leslie (1993) provided data from the 1988 NSOPF, which up to this point has been the most comprehensive resource on part-time faculty available. In addition to providing an updated resource, this report offers researchers a resource for making comparisons with future NSOPF reports on part-time faculty."}, {"section_title": "Gender", "text": "In the fall of 1992, part-time instructional faculty and staff were more likely to be female (45 percent) than were fulltime instructional faculty and staff (33 percent), although the majority of both full-and part-time faculty were male (67 percent and 55 percent, respectively). About 45 percent of part-time faculty in 4-year institutions, part-time faculty in 2-year institutions, and full-time faculty in 2-year institutions were female, while 30 percent of the full-time faculty members in 4-year institutions were female. Regardless of the type of institution, women were underrepresented in several program areas. In disciplines that have been historically male dominated, women held proportionately fewer positions, regardless of employment status. Among part-time faculty in 4-year institutions, for example, 34 percent of instructional faculty and staff in business, law, and communications, and 25 percent of those in the natural sciences and engineering were women. These broad categories of program areas may mask differences in specific disciplines, however. In Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities (Conley 1997), for example, NSOPF:93 data were presented separately for four disciplines that make up the humanities: English and literature, foreign languages, history, and philosophy and religion. Although the report focused only on full-time instructional faculty and staff, the data showed clear patterns among the humanities disciplines with respect to gender. Female faculty members were more likely to be employed in English and literature and foreign languages than in history or philosophy and religion. Part-time faculty in the humanities In the fall of 1992, about 60 percent of those employed part time in the humanities were working part time because fulltime employment was unavailable, a higher percentage than in most other program areas. Part-time faculty members may have selected multiple reasons for working part time, however. In 4-year institutions, part-time humanities faculty were more likely to be employed at the instructor or lecturer level than were part-time faculty in other program areas with the exception of social sciences and education, and vocational training. For example, while 74 percent of part-time humanities faculty in 4-year institutions held the academic rank of instructor or lecturer and 8 percent held the rank of full professor, 58 percent of part-time business, law, and communications faculty held the rank of instructor or lecturer and 21 percent held the rank of full professor (table A). Yet there was no substantive difference across program areas in the number of years part-time faculty members in 4-year institutions had held their current job (almost 7 years, table B). In both 4-year and 2-year institutions, a higher proportion of part-time humanities faculty reported that they were only employed by their sampled institution than part-time faculty members in other program areas, with the exception of natural sciences and engineering faculty in 4-year institutions and social sciences and education faculty in 2-year institutions. Taken together, these data suggest that the employment characteristics of part-time instructional faculty and staff in the humanities were different from those employed part time in other program areas, especially in 4-year institutions."}, {"section_title": "Teaching and support from the institution", "text": "The majority (92 percent overall) of part-time instructional faculty and staff reported that their principal activity at their employing institution in the fall of 1992 was teaching, regardless of their program area of teaching or the type of institution in which they taught. Part-time instructional faculty and staff taught principally undergraduate students. On average, they taught 1.6 undergraduate courses per semester. A higher percentage of part-time faculty (86 percent) than full-time faculty (70 percent) reported teaching only undergraduate students. Part-time faculty perceived a lower level of support from their institution than full-time faculty. For example, only 3 percent of full-time instructional faculty and staff reported that office space was not available compared with 33 percent of those employed part time. Ninety-four percent of those teaching part time agreed that teaching effectiveness should be the primary criterion for promotion. Seventy-nine percent of those teaching full time also agreed that teaching effectiveness should be the primary criterion for promotion. Other employment of part-time faculty Twenty-four percent of part-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions and 21 percent of those in 2-year institutions reported that their only employment in the fall of 1992 was part time at their current institution (figure B). In other words, about three-quarters had other employment. The average number of additional jobs held by parttime faculty was 1.7 (table B). Part-time faculty who held three or more other jobs constituted a small proportion of the part-time faculty population (12 percent in 2-year institutions and 14 percent in 4-year institutions). About one-half (49 percent) of part-time faculty members also held full-time employment. More than one-half (64 percent) of part-time faculty who had more than one job reported that the employment status of their other main job was full time. Some (e.g., Fulton 2000) have argued that part-time faculty members who have full-time jobs in the field bring real-life experience to the classroom and can enhance program quality. Motivations for holding a part-time position NSOPF:93 asked those employed part time to identify their motivations for part-time employment. The answers provided a unique opportunity to examine and perhaps distinguish for the first time groups of part-time faculty from one another based on their motivations for holding part-time positions. Figure C shows the percentages of parttime instructional faculty and staff who reported each of several reasons.2 2The question that asked respondents why they were working part time allowed multiple responses. As a result, respondents may be assigned to more than one category. About 70 percent of part-time instructional faculty and staff in both 4-year and 2-year institutions cited \"to be in academia\" as a reason for holding part-time employment in the fall of 1992. Around one-half (54 percent in 4-year institutions and 50 percent in 2-year institutions) of parttime instructional faculty and staff said they preferred parttime employment. Seventy percent of part-time faculty who preferred part-time employment reported that their other main job was full time (not shown). Thus, to a majority of those employed part time, academia appears to bear at least some intrinsic value.    On the other hand, a substantial percentage of those employed in 4-year institutions (40 percent) and in 2-year institutions (47 percent) reported that the lack of full-time employment was at least partially the reason why they were working part time. One-half (51 percent) of part-time faculty in 4-year institutions and 63 percent of those in 2-year institutions were working part time to supplement their income. About 10 percent of part-time faculty in both 4-and 2-year institutions said they were working part time because they were finishing their degrees."}, {"section_title": "Concllusion", "text": "The academic labor market is rapidly changing (Rhoades 1998). Increases in part-time faculty and the possible negative impacts of these increases on the quality of the academy are areas of increasing concern (Lee 1995;Grenzke 1998). An understanding that not all part-time faculty are the same, just as not all full-time faculty are the same, is vital for those wrestling with how best to react to the altered academic labor market of the new millennium. NSOPF:93 data indicate that certain issues may be of particular concern when analyzing part-time faculty characteristics, work life, and attitudes. These issues include differences by gender, academic discipline, perceived level of support from the institution, presence or absence of full-time employment elsewhere, and motivations for accepting part-time employment."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), a comprehensive study of financial aid among postsecondary education students in the United States and Puerto Rico, provides information on trends in financial aid and on the ways in which families pay for postsecondary education. NPSAS represents students attending all types and levels of institutions, including public, private for-profit, private notfor-profit, less-than-2-year, 2-year, and 4-year institutions. The NPSAS data are part of the comprehensive information that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) provides on student financial aid receipt and other characteristics of those enrolled in postsecondary education. NPSAS also serves as the base-year survey for longitudinal studies of postsecondary students. Thus, the 1999NPSAS (NPSAS:2000 was the base-year survey for a sample of baccalaureate degree recipients who were interviewed again in 2001. Approximately 1,100 institutions were initially selected for NPSAS:2000, and all but 10 of these institutions were found to be eligible. Sampling frames for selecting students consisted of enrollment lists or data files provided by the institutions for those students enrolled during the NPSAS:2000 year. The desired number of sample students was determined by accounting for expected rates of nonresponse and ineligibility among sample students in different strata and rates of misclassification of baccalaureate recipients (as determined from NPSAS:93 and the NPSAS:2000 field test). These sampling procedures resulted in the selection of about 70,200 students for NPSAS:2000, including 16,600 potential baccalaureate recipients. Almost 6,000 of these sample members were determined to be ineligible for NPSAS:2000 during various phases of data collection, resulting in a final eligible sample of about 64,500 students."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Design and Outcomes", "text": "NPSAS:2000 involved a multistage effort to collect information related to student aid. All student sample members were first matched to the Department of Education's Central Processing System (CPS) to collect an electronic student aid report (Institutional Student Information Report, or ISIR) for each federal financial aid applicant. The second stage involved abstracting information from the student's records at the sampled postsecondary institution, using a Webbased computer-assisted data entry (CADE) system. Interviews were then conducted with sampled students, primarily using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) procedure. To help reduce the level of nonresponse to CATI, computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) procedures using field interviewers were also used for the first time on a NPSAS study. Over the course of data collection, some data were obtained from the Department of Education's National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), the ACT, and the Educational Testing Service. These additional data sources provided information that was not collected from the institutions or the students and provided a way to \"fill in\" institutional record abstraction (CADE) data or student interview (CATI) data that were missing for individual sample members (e.g., demographic characteristics). The additional data sources also provided a way to check or confirm information obtained from student records or the interview."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Contacting", "text": "Once institutions were sampled, attempts were made to contact the chief administrator of the selected institutions to verify institutional eligibility, solicit participation of eligible institutions, and request appointment of an Institutional Coordinator.

Several checks on quality and completeness of student lists were implemented before the sample students were selected. For applicable schools, separate checks were made for baccalaureate recipients, undergraduate students, graduate students, and firstprofessional students.

In addition, the system was customized for each institution by preloading the names of up to 10 institution financial aid programs and up to 10 state financial aid programs. Once CADE was initialized for a particular institution, the Institutional Coordinator was notified by telephone that the CADE data collection could begin. Institutions that had chosen field data collection were also notified by telephone of CADE initialization, at which time an appointment was made for a field data collector to visit the institution.

The CATI system developed for NPSAS:2000 presented interviewers with screens of questions to be asked of the respondents, with the software guiding the interviewer and respondent through the interview. The student interview consisted of seven sections administered sequentially, namely: eligibility, enrollment, financial aid, employment, education experiences and expectations, disabilities, and locating information. To reduce interview burden and to guide the interview, information collected from CADE and other sources was preloaded before the interviews. Online coding programs developed by NCES (for industry/occupation, 1PEDS, and field of study coding) were embedded in the overall interview administration system. Student interviews were conducted primarily by CATI. A paper-copy mail questionnaire or an \"abbreviated\" telephone interview was also available. All students finalized as \"unlocatable\" in CATI were eligible for field locating and/or CAPI. Nonresponding and unlocatable cases falling within predetermined geographic clusters were assigned to field staff for CAPI.

It is intended to facilitate the organization, collection, and reporting of program completions data using classifications that capture the majority of reportable program completion activity. The CIP titles and program descriptions are intended to be generic categories into which program completions data can be placed, not exact duplicates of specific major field of study titles used by individual institutions. The CIP is not intended to be a regulatory device. CIP codes and their associated programs are standard statistical coding tools that reflect current practice, not a prescriptive list of officially recognized or permitted programs. Codes that have been added, deleted, or moved reflect variations in instructional program offerings and reported data that have occurred since the 1990 edition of the CIP was produced. CIP codes, for the most part, are not intended to correspond exclusively to any specific degree or program level. In most cases, any given instructional program may be offered at various levels, and CIP codes are intended to capture all such data."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the CIP:2000", "text": "The CIP:2000 is divided into six chapters and appendix A that contain information and codes that are distinguishable from each other. The chapters contain the following types of instructional programs: Chapter 1 contains academic and occupationally specific instructional programs offered for academic credit at one or more postsecondary educational levels. These programs usually result in recognized completion points and awards such as degrees, diplomas, certificates, or some other formal award.' 'Note that the numerical sequences in chapter I occasionally skip codes or Series numbers.This results from either deletions of code numbers that appeared in previous editions of the CIP, or moves of 2-or 4-digit Series and/or 6-digit codes to new locations or chapters. Chapter II contains residency programs in various dental, medical, and veterinary specializations offered in teaching hospitals and similar locations that may lead to advanced professional certification if board approval is sought and obtained. These residency programs are in a separate chapter to preclude confusion with research degree programs with similar names in the clinical, biological, and agricultural sciences. Chapter III contains technology education and industrial arts programs that are taught at high schools and other nonpostsecondary levels. Chapter IV contains Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs that are offered for limited regular credit and that lead to professionally recognized completions, but that do not lead to academic awards or completions. Chapter V contains personal improvement and leisure-time programs that are not typically offered for academic credit, but that may receive some form of recognition and may lead to a completion award. Chapter VI contains instructional programs that lead to general diplomas and certificates awarded at the secondary education level only. Appendix A contains instructional programs offered in French to Canadian residents and others for whom French is the first language, or to other students enrolled in schools, colleges, and universities in Canada in which the primary language of instruction is French."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Taxonomy", "text": "The CIP taxonomy is organized on three levels: (1) a 2-digit Series, (2) a 4-digit Series, and (3) a 6-digit program level, with the 2-digit Series codes and programs representing the most general groupings of related programs, the 4-digit Series codes and programs representing intermediate groupings of programs that have comparable content and objectives, and the 6-digit codes representing the specific instructional programs. The numbering format for the 2-digit Series consists of a 2-digit number followed by a period. (Examples: 01., 13., and 22.) Codes and program titles at this level appear in bold type and in capital letters. (Examples: 01. AGRICUL-TURE, AGRICULTURE OPERATIONS, AND RELATED SCIENCES; 13. EDUCATION; and 22. LEGAL PROFES-SIONS AND STUDIES.) 1 Program descriptions at the 2-digit Series level begin with the standard phrase \"Instructional programs,\" followed by a general description of the content areas and topics associated with the instructional programs within that Series. The numbering sequence for the 4-digit Series consists of the 2-digit Series number followed by a period and an assigned 2-digit number following the period that is uniquely associated with that 4-digit Series. Codes and program titles at the 4-digit level appear in bold type. (Examples: 01.01 Agricultural Business and Management and 51.02 Communication Disorders Sciences and Services.) The programs that comprise the 4-digit groupings are listed in numerical sequence. Within a 4-digit Series, single instructional programs with a more general focus appear at the beginning of the Series and an \"Other\" program entry appears as the final program entry within the Series. This convention of including an \"other\" program code was established to provide a category for reporting on programs that fall within a 4-digit Series but do not have a separate program code. (Example: Within Series 01.01, Agricultural Business and Management, the code and program 01.0101 Agricultural Business and Management, General, appears first and 01.0199, Agricultural Business and Management, Other, is the last program code.) Program descriptions are not provided at the 4-digit summary level. The user is instead informed where the instructional content for the Series is contained. (Example: For Series 01.01, Agricultural Business and Management, the program description is indicated as follows: Instructional content for this group of programs is defined in codes 01.0101-01.0199.) Six-digit codes are the most detailed program classifications within the CIP. They are the basic unit of analysis used by NCES and institutions in tracking and reporting program completions and field of study data. There is at least one 6-digit code within every 4-digit Series. The numbering sequence is similar to the 4-digit Series sequence, with two more digits added after the 4-digit Series number; the standard format for the 6-digit codes is XX.XXXX. subject matter listings are intended as a general guide to the content areas addressed by the instructional program. Programs offered at different levels may cover more or fewer topics than those listed. The program descriptions generally identify the objectives and content of the instructional programs. Program descriptions for academic or general programs begin with the phrase \"A program that focuses on...\" Program descriptions that begin with the phrase \"A program that prepares individuals for...\" or the phrase \"generally prepares individuals...\" indicate that the program is designed to prepare individuals for specific occupations upon completion. Example: 01. AGRICULTURE, AGRICULTURE OPERATIONS, AND RELATED SCIENCES. Instructional programs that focus on agriculture and related sciences and that prepare individuals to apply specific knowledge, methods, and techniques to the management and performance of agricultural operations. 01.01 Agricultural Business and Management. Instructional content for this group of programs is defined in codes 01.0101-01.0199."}, {"section_title": "01", "text": ".0102 Agribusiness/Agricultural Business Operations. A program that prepares individuals to manage agricultural businesses and agriculturally related operations within diversified corporations. Includes instruction in agriculture, agricultural specialization, business management, accounting, finance, marketing, planning, human resources management, and other managerial responsibilities."}, {"section_title": "Series and Code Titles", "text": "The titles of Series and programs presented in the CIP:2000 generally represent the most commonly used current titles of programs and program groupings. However, some titles have been maintained in the CIP:2000 either because of their historical importance and their continued usage by large numbers of institutions and schools, or because the terminology is accepted by accreditors and professional bodies in some cases where programs are governed by regulations related to preparation for licensed occupations. Single titles are comprised of one word or phrase, such as \"Psychology\" or \"Civil Engineering,\" that conveys the most commonly used or accepted name describing a program."}, {"section_title": "Classification of Instructional Programs: 2000 Edition", "text": "In some cases, more than one title may be used for the same instructional program. The CIP:2000 uses words or phrases separated by slashes in situations where (1) two or more commonly accepted names exist for the same program, (2) the same program has different names at different educational levels, or (3) the program has undergone a recent name change but many institutions still use the older name for the program. (Example: \"Engineering Technologists/Technicians\" is the slashed title of Series 15., which includes programs that prepare engineering technologists [the preferred term, but not the only one used] and also engineering technicians [an alternative title].) Different terms may also be used at different educational levels in some cases. (Example:\"Family and Consumer Sciences/ Human Sciences,\" where the term Human Sciences is the new title but it has not yet been universally adopted and thus the older title is still referenced.) The CIP:2000 groups closely related programs together in 6-digit codes and in Series so that institutions may report data for them in discrete codes and not in undifferentiated \"other\" categories. The titles of closely related programs captured under the same code are separated by commas and/or the conjunction \"and.\" (Example: The title of Series 50., \"Visual and Performing Arts,\" indicates that it contains programs in both the visual or plastic arts [fine art, applied art, crafts, photography, etc.] and the kinetic or performing arts [music, dance, theatre, etc.]. Likewise, the title of code 03.0201, \"Natural Resources Management and Policy,\" indicates that this code is the appropriate place to report data on majors in either or both natural resources management and natural resources policy) Principles Governing the inclusion of Programs in the COP For purposes of the CIP, NCES defines an instructional program as follows: A combination of courses and experiences that is designed to accomplish a predetermined objective or set of allied objectives such as preparation for advanced study, qualification for an occupation or range of occupations, or simply the increase of knowledge and understanding. (Chismore and Hill 1978, p.165) Under this definition, instructional programs included in the CIP must meet all of the following operational criteria: X12' (1) An instructional program must be offered by, through, or under the auspices of an education institution or other recognized provider. (2) The program must consist of more than one isolated course or learning experience and must not be a haphazard collection of unrelated courses or experiences. (3) There must be a set of structured learning experiences, defined by an institution or other provider, leading to a completion point that is formally certified by a degree, another formal award, or some other form of recognition. Types of instructional programs that meet the above criteria for inclusion in the CIP are as follows: postsecondary programs culminating in the following types of awards: postsecondary certificates for the completion of programs that are less than 1 academic year, at least 1 but less than 2 academic years, or at least 2 but less than 4 academic years; associate's degrees; bachelor's degrees; post-baccalaureate certificates; master's degrees; post-master's certificates; first-professional degrees; education specialist's degrees (Ed.Sp.); doctor's degrees; and post-doctorate certificates; residency programs conducted by the dental, medical, and veterinary professions that lead to advanced professional certification, including specific training offered by the U.S. military in programs parallel to civilian instructional programs; secondary and postsecondary Cadet and Junior/ Senior ROTC programs; ora adult education programs leading to certificates of completion; gra secondary programs culminating in the following awards: regular/general high school diplomas and secondary/senior high graduation/completion diplomas/certificates; college/university preparatory and advanced high school/secondary school diplomas; vocational high school diplomas and secondary/ vocational/industrial diplomas; programs culminating in diplomas, honors/regents high school diplomas and provincial graduation certificates; high school/ secondary equivalence certificates; adult secondary school diplomas; certificates of competence and provincial certificates of education; certificates of Individualized Education Program (IEP) completion; and certificates for homeschooled instruction. The CIP is a coding guide designed to assist in the collection of data on formal instructional programs only. The following programs are, therefore, not included in the CIP: o in-house, professional, or on-the-job training activities that are not recognized by an education institution or provider and that do not lead to any kind of formal award, credit, or certification; and o subject matter specializations or individual courses within a program that are not treated as a major and are generally not recognized by the education institution as a formal program offering. An instructional program that meets the criteria stated above is eligible for inclusion in the CIP. To determine whether an eligible program would be retained or added, the following decision rules were used: o federal survey data showing that at least 30 program completions have been reported over a 3-year period in at least 10 postsecondary institutions in three or more states (e.g., from surveys such as IPEDS or the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates); written requests for new codes provided via federal education surveys and meeting the threshold criterion above; o requests from other federal agencies, state governments, or Canadian authorities for new or modified codes together with evidence of the existence of such programs and the need for them; o evidence, including testimony, from authorities in a field who state, and provide evidence to show, that a new program exists and is offered; and/or o empirical evidence of program viability based on the authors' review of primary sources and related databases at both the secondary and postsecondary levels. Programs and codes could have been deleted from the current edition of the CIP for the following reasons: o federal survey data showing that fewer than 30 program completions were recorded over a 3-year period, in less than 10 postsecondary institutions, and spread across fewer than three states; o evidence, including testimony, from authorities in a field who state, and provide evidence to show, that a program is or will no longer be offered or recognized; and/or kl3 112 NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS empirical evidence that a program is not in fact offered, based on the authors' review of primary sources and databases at both the secondary and postsecondary levels. Revisions to the CIP:2000 The development of the CIP:2000 resulted in several significant changes to the program listings (additions, deletions, and movements of individual programs and program groups). The conventions used to implement these changes are delineated below. Several new codes and programs were added to the CIP:2000 to reflect program titles and definitions that are currently used by education providers and professional associations. New programs were added when there was sufficient evidence that a new instructional program or Series of programs was evolving and when the programs met the operational criteria for inclusion. The identification of new programs resulted from meetings and extensive discussions between NCES and representatives of professional associations, academic societies, federal agencies, and institutional registrars and academic affairs officials. Searches of institutional and association program databases also informed the identification of new programs. A standard procedure was used to identify programs that were added to the CIP:2000. The programs are presented in italics and labeled \"NEW\" in the Index of CIP:2000 Codes and Titles. They appear in bold italics and are also labeled \"NEW\" in the full program listing of the CIP:2000. (Examples: 09.10 Publishing (NEW) and 09.1001 Publishing (NEW).) These examples indicate that both a new 4-digit Series and a new 6-digit instructional program for Publishing were added to the C1E2 Programs that are identified as \"NEW\" in the CIP:2000 are programs that were either added to the taxonomy for the first time or reinstated from previous CIP taxonomies. ) This information appears in the location formerly occupied by the program entry. The first example indicates that an entire 4-digit Series (group) was deleted from the taxonomy. The second example indicates that the 6-digit instructional program originally contained within the Series was eliminated and integrated into another 6-digit program. Instructions are provided to alert the CIP user where the deleted program should be reported (e.g., Report under 04.0301). Several programs that occupied a particular location in the CIP:1990 were moved to new locations within the CIP:2000. Multiple sources were consulted before Series or program location changes (i.e., moves) were made. Programs that have been moved to new locations (i.e., placed under new program groups) are identified as follows: the program code appears in parentheses with instructions that indicate where the program has been moved to. Other Major Changes to the CIP:2000 Several general programs were added at both the 4-digit Series and 6-digit code levels. (Examples: 01.00 Agriculture, General, and 01.0000 Agriculture, General; 46.00 Construction Trades, General, and 46.0000 Construction Trades, General.) These codes were added to permit reporting of undifferentiated or general programs in Series where no such opportunity existed previously. Several program groups (Series) were deleted from the CIP:2000. The deletions were made to implement a more logical organization of the program classifications. Several programs and program groups were moved to new locations in the CIP and assigned new CIP codes. Examples include the history and residency programs. History (previously located in Series 45.) was moved into a newly created program group (Series 54.); the residency programs were assigned a new Series code (Series 60.). Dental residency programs were moved to and should be reported under Series 60.01, medical residency programs were moved to and should be reported under Series 60.02, and veterinary residency programs were moved to and should be reported under Series 60.03."}, {"section_title": "Cross-References", "text": "Cross-references or crosswalks are provided to refer the CIP user to related codes/programs within the CIP.

For schools and states, data are included for the last 3 years; for agencies, all 4 years. This CD-ROM contains approximately 300,000 school records, more than 65,000 agency records, and 177 state records. Agencylevel finance data for fiscal years (FY) 1997(FY) , 1998(FY) , and 1999 have been merged with the appropriate agency nonfiscal records.
