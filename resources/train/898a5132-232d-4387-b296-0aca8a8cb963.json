Network-based models of the brain have shown that both local and global topological properties can reveal patterns of disease propagation.

To address this, we developed a novel approach, which models brain structural connectivity atrophy with a multiplex network and summarizes it within a classification score. On an independent dataset multiplex networks were able to correctly segregate, from normal controls (NC), AD patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment that will convert to AD (cMCI) with an accuracy of, respectively, 0.86 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.84 \u00b1 0.01. The model also shows that illness effects are maximally detected by parceling the brain in equal volumes of 3000 mm 3 (\"patches\"), without any a priori segmentation based on anatomical features. A direct comparison to standard voxel-based morphometry on the same dataset showed that the multiplex network approach had higher sensitivity.

It is expected that over 115 million people will develop AD by 2050 1 . Illness related brain changes can be detected in vivo with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuroimaging has been playing an increasingly important role for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders 2, 3 to the extent that it has been incorporated in the diagnostic criteria for AD 4 . It is now accepted that the neurodegenerative cascade in AD begins in the brain years, decades even, before the clinical and radiological manifestations of the illness. The dementia is preceded by a prodromal phase of mild cognitive impairment 5 , and this, in turn, by a pre-clinical phase 6 of variable duration. Understanding the biological changes, occurring in these early phases, is of paramount importance, as it would open a window of opportunity for future disease-modifying treatments. While it is clear that neurodegeneration in AD occurs in a rather stereotyped fashion in the majority of cases 7, 8 , it is not known exactly what drives the propagation of the disease within an individual, and what is behind the variations in the patterns of atrophy between individuals. To which extent neurodegeneration propagates through anatomical contiguity, or through preferential pathways of structural or functional connectivity is yet to be clarified, but network-based approaches can yield a better understanding of these phenomena.\nMRI can provide significant information on large-scale topological organization of the brain [9] [10] [11] and graph theory has been widely used to study both functional and structural connectivity [11] [12] [13] [14] for AD and, more in general, for neurodegenerative disease characterization 15 . These studies reported altered local and global graph properties in AD, supporting the clinical relevance of brain networks, especially within group-wise association studies 16, 17 . Up to now the different graph theory strategies used to model and describe the brain [11] [12] [13] [18] [19] [20] [21] have been based on two distinct approaches 22 : (i) voxel-wise and (ii) region of interest analyses. We propose here a novel approach combining the interpretability of a voxel-wise description, without its intrinsic computational burden and noise sensitivity 23 , and the robustness of region of interest methods, avoiding a priori assumptions in terms of disease effects or segmentation accuracy 24 . In addition, as brain disease has often a diffuse effect, affecting multiple voxels, but not necessarily corresponding to entire anatomical structures, the proposed approach has the potential to better suit the description of pathological changes in the brain, reflecting biological variability.\nSpecifically for network science, recent studies have investigated the limitations of traditional approaches to describe real systems [25] [26] [27] and have pointed out that context information plays a fundamental role. Here we introduce an approach that segments the whole brain in rectangular boxes, from now onward referred to as \"patches\", representing the nodes of a network modeling each subject. The network connections are pairwise Pearson's correlations between the nodes. This is aimed at investigating graph-based properties from the different perspective of multiplex networks (from now onward also multiplexes) and introducing a novel concept, namely structural connectivity atrophy. Multiplexes are multi-layer systems with a fixed number of nodes that can be linked in different interacting layers, to investigate inter-subject characterization, rather than group-wise differences. In this study multiplex-based features are exploited to efficiently model AD-related atrophy patterns; these faetures are then used within a random forest classifier to correctly segregate normal controls (NC) from AD patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment that will convert to AD (cMCI). We demonstrate how a structural connectivity atrophy can be used to describe inter-subject variability relating it to the emergence of statistically significant AD patterns altering the topological organization of the brain."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Scale selection and informative content", "text": "Graph theory provides tools to concisely quantify the properties of complex networks that describe interrelationships (represented by edges) between the objects of interest (represented by nodes). In this work, for each subject, and thus for each MRI brain scan, we built a weighted undirected network whose N nodes were rectangular brain patches and whose connections were defined by measuring their pairwise Pearson's correlation, see Figure 1 for a pictorial representation.\nIn order to detect structural local changes of the brain, we considered the strength s of each patch, measuring the intensity of its connections. Strength does not take into account if the number of connections is preserved, thus we included in our representation the nodal degree k which is the number of existing connections and the inverse participation ratio Y evaluating how unevenly the weights of the links of the node are distributed 28 . To capture intersubject variations, we introduced the conditional values of strength s(k) and inverse participation Y (k). Finally, to capture intra-subjects changes, we considered the distribution degrees k \u2032 of the whole cohort and analogously defined the quantities s(k \u2032 ) and Y (k \u2032 ). In conclusion we obtained a 8-dimensional feature representation for each node.\nThere is no a priori knowledge determining the dimension of patches and, therefore, the number of nodes N that should be used to model a brain with a network. Thus, we firstly investigated if a privileged dimension existed in order to maximize classification accuracy to distinguish controls and patients. To this aim, we used a first random forest classifier for feature selection and a second random forest to summarize network measures in a unique network atrophy score, within a 5-fold cross-validation framework. This score allowed subjects' classification. Experimental results on a mixed cohort of 38 AD and 29 NC, namely D train , showed an accurate and stable classification performance within the [2250, 3200] voxel (mm 3 ) range, corresponding approximately to 500 patches, with variations lower than 5%. This range established the optimal patch dimension for the NC-AD clas- sification, best results were obtained with N = 549 patches. In addition, we performed a second classification test using structural morphological features obtained by FreeSurfer 29 , instead of multiplex features. The accuracy of the proposed methodology was on average 0.88 with a 0.01 standard error (sensitivity and a specificity respectively 0.90 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.88 \u00b1 0.02) while with FreeSurfer features we obtained 0.83 \u00b1 0.01 (sensitvity 0.86 \u00b1 0.01 and specificity 0.79 \u00b1 0.01). This result confirms the effectiveness of the multiplex characterization and the possibility to use our framework to discriminate controls from patients using only MRI data."}, {"section_title": "Anatomical characterization", "text": "Once the optimal dimension of multiplex network had been fixed we investigated on D train the most significant features according to their classification importance and consequently the related anatomical districts. The reason was twofold: reduce the data dimensionality and gain clinical insight.\nStarting from the initial network of 549 nodes, for each subject we determined which regions were able to effectively distinguish controls from patients, thus outlining 32 significant patches, 18 (\u223c 56%) in the left hemisphere and 14 in the right; these regions included 27 different cortical and sub-cortical regions listed in Figure 2 in order of significance. Further details about significance measures for both features and anatomical districts are provided in Methods section. As a region can be included in different patches (provided at least one of its voxels belongs to the considered patch), only most significant p-value entries are reported.\nIn Figure 3 some representative brain axial planes are shown, as well as the Harvard-Oxford atlas 30 we used for this assessment. In the left hemisphere, patches corresponding to amygdala, hippocampus, para-hippocampal gyrus, pallidum and putamen showed the strongest association to AD (p = 0.0001). For cingulate and para-cingulate giri, pre-cuneus, cuneus, and occipital cortex p = 0.001. Other significant patches (p = 0.002) were located in middle frontal gyrus and pre-frontal gyrus, nucleus accumbens, brain stem and thalamus.\nOn the right, p = 0.0001 for orbito-frontal cortex, insular cortex, prarahippocampal gyrus, planum polare and planum temporale; p = 0.001 for the parahippocampal-amygdalar complex, occipital pole, pre-and post-central gyri, supramarginal gyrus, middle and superior temporal gyri; p = 0.002 for inferior, middle and superior frontal gyri, frontal pole, and paracingulate gyrus. Interestingly, the right frontal lobe involvement was more evident.

Firstly, a segmentation of brain tissues was performed, followed by non-linear normalization with the SPM tool DARTEL to create a study specific template. Secondly, we performed a smoothing with an isotropic Gaussian filter with a full width at half maximum of 8 mm. Lastly, a two-sample analysis was performed with a t statistics to investigate significant group-wise differences in atrophy between NC and AD on training subjects. Significant voxels, with 5% family-wise correction, are represented in Figure 4 ."}, {"section_title": "Figure 4.", "text": "A voxel based morphometry analysis shows bilateral areas of significantly reduced grey matter density in patients with AD, in medial temporal lobe structures, such as hippocampus and amygdala, more prominent on the left as expected.\nThe VBM analysis showed significant reduction in grey matter density only in bilateral peri-hippocampal regions, more prominent of the left. Compared to the proposed methodology, able to detect 32 significant regions, VBM showed a largely decreased sensitivity. Since the VBM analysis confirmed that left-sided changes were more prominent, two dedicated tests were carried out to further explore the lateralization. Firstly, we used only multiplex features inherent to the left (right) hemisphere and trained the classification models. We found that left patches were able to discriminate NC from AD patients with an accuracy of 0.87 \u00b1 0.01 while right hemisphere features were able to reach the accuracy value 0.85 \u00b1 0.01. Left hemisphere remained responsible for a greater part of the overall information of the multiplex framework, which was 0.88 \u00b1 0.01.\nHowever, each patch summarizes a network of interrelationships with other patches independently from its spatial collocation. As an example, the strength of a node denotes the sum of its connections, the fact that a node of the left hemisphere is significantly related to AD does not prevent its strength to be the result of its correlation with the right hemisphere. As a consequence, a second test was performed. We built the multiplexes of left and right hemispheres separately, thus disregarding one hemisphere. Classification accuracy for NC-AD when using left (right) multiplex was 0.83 \u00b1 0.01 (0.81 \u00b1 0.01), thus confirming a greater involvement of the left hemisphere but also signaling a definite deterioration of the information content if compared with the whole brain multiplex."}, {"section_title": "Robustness and generalization", "text": "To investigate if classification performance based on netowrk atrophy was related to the random permutation of voxels inside a patch, we firstly shuffled a varying number of voxel within each patch, while keeping the patch decomposition stable, thus affecting the Pearson's correlation pairwise measurement. Then we measured the classification accuracy. The training results are presented in Figure 5 .\nThe test was repeated 100 times increasing the size of the shuffle by 500 voxels at the time. It could be noticed that for small variations, under 1000 voxels, performance did not suffer a significant deterioration; but with 2500 voxel permutation a drastic drop of the performance was observed, a value comparable with the dimensional scale determined in section . To further assess the method robustness we also performed a classical non-parametric statistical permutation test. This consisted in the permutation of the clinical labels of each subject belonging to D train . We performed 1000 random permutation and observed that the classification accuracy was 0.50 \u00b1 0.05.\nTraining set randomization effectively established that the multiplex framework was able to model a significant structure in the D train data between the multiplex features and the clinical label. Moreover, given the normality of the performance distribution obtained by permuting the labels, it was possible to assign a p-value to the performance obtained without permutations. The result showed that the multiplex model was able to identify a significant (p < .001) class structure within the D train data. Otherwise, it would not have been possible to reject the null hypothesis underlying this test, i. e. that labels and features were independent, so that in fact no difference really existed between the classes.\nAs a further assessment, we performed a binary classification on an independent test set D test , incuding 48 AD, 52 NC and 48 cMCI, for the NC-AD and NC-cMCI cases. The analysis was repeated using 100 bootstrapped D test sets to provide a measurement of the performance uncertainty. We found in terms of accuracy respectively 0.86 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.84 \u00b1 0.01. The respective specificity were 0.74 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.72 \u00b1 0.01, while sensitivity reached higher values for both cases: 0.96 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.94 \u00b1 0.01. Remarkably, the NC-cMCI classification performance compared well with NC-AD classification confirming the method reliability and its informative content.\nThe small, but significant, performance deterioration (training accuracy was 0.88 \u00b1 0.01, see section ) could be expected, mainly because even if the test perturbation of the training multiplex was considered small, it should not be completely neglected. The implementation of larger training sets could in principle mitigate this effect."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The proposed approach aims at modeling brain atrophy in AD through inter-subject multiplex networks whose nodes are represented by brain patches and edges by pairwise Pearson's correlations. Basing on multiplex features we introduced a network atrophy score. This score allowed a robust classification performance over a broad range of Pearson's correlations and with the use of other similarity metrics (see sections \"Threshold Assessment\" and \"Similarity Metric Study\" of the Supplementary Materials).\nAn optimal volume size for the detection of AD effects, maximizing the informative content of the multiplex, was identified as ranging from 2250 to 3200 mm 3 . it is worthwhile to note that this range was comparable with the size of several brain structures related to AD, such as the hippocampus, therefore suggesting it as an ideal multiplex 6/16 dimension for AD characterization.\nThe high sensitivity of the method in the detection of illness related brain changes was demonstrated by the number of regions, 32, that were identified as significantly associated with AD. The detected regions comprised hippocampus and para-hippocampal-amygdalar complex, pallidum and putamen, cingulate and paracingulate giri, pre-cuneus, cuneus, and occipital cortex, middle frontal gyrus, pre-central gyrus, accumbens, sub-callosal cortex and brain stem.\nThe cingulate cortex early involvement in AD pathology, has been amply demonstrated by functional and structural studies 32, 33 . The same is true for posterior areas, such as cuneus and pre-cuneus, also known to be affected by the illness in early stages 33, 34 . As to the involvement of subcortical gray matter in AD, this has also been recognized, and shown to correlate with cognitive impairment 35 . Volume loss of the nucleus accumbens was found to increase the risk of progression from MCI to AD 36 . The brain stem is a key area in the early pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, another common neurodegenerative disorder, and alterations of the brain stem in AD have been shown both in vivo 37 and post-mortem 38 .\nIt was striking how VBM on the same data set was able to detect only atrophy of the perihippocampal regions. The method here described seems more sensitive than standard VBM 39 , while studies adopting advanced VBM methodologies have also shown better results 40 . The method outlined the involvement of 32 significant brain regions, but only 22 concerned single-layer measures; thus, the multiplex model thus allowed a consistent increment (+46%) in sensitivity. The results also confirmed asymmetry in the spatial distribution of significant patches, mostly located in the left hemisphere, in keeping with several other studies 41, 42 . This asymmetry has a direct effect on the informative content (see \"Left/Right Characterization\" of the Supplementary Materials).\nAs to the application of this methodology to disease classification studies, we evaluated the method robustness on an independent set D test and confirmed its reliability for discriminating both AD patients and cMCI subjects from controls. Classification performances are accurate, it should be noticed the obtained results are comparable with recent classification-focused studies 3, 43, 44 . To provide a diagnosis support system, although results are encouraging in this sense, was not the end goal of this work; however, the multiplex model is able to efficiently capture diseased patterns and inter-subject variability thanks to the specific multi-layer features this model can introduces. An even more refined classification could have been achieved including, as suggested by our previous works, structural features 45 or longitudinal information 46 . In addition, the method has great versatility and lends itself to a variety of purposes, including the identification of \"disease signature\" for more anatomically heterogeneous forms of neurodegenerative disorder, such as tauophathies or synucleinopathies, where the model could be enriched with additional clinical or genetic data."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we propose a novel approach based on multiplex networks to characterize brain structural variations related to AD. We investigated the information content provided by multiplex networks and showed that they produce an accurate modeling of the disease.\nWe demonstrated how this framework is able to provide a robust method for AD characterization: (i) it shows the existence of an optimal scale for the description of disease effects of [2250, 3200] voxels, which reflects the size of brain structures relevant in AD, such as the hippocampi. (ii) The method does not require any a priori human expert segmentation and correctly identifies cerebral region significantly related to AD. It also confirms that AD pathology is more prominent in the left hemisphere. (iii) Multiplex networks are a robust and effective method to describe disease patterns. Multiplex-based features allow, on the independent test set D test , the accurate classification of AD patients, with an accuracy of 0.86 \u00b1 0.01, and cMCI subjects, with an accuracy of 0.84 \u00b1 0.01, from NC subjects.\nThe information content provided by multiplex characterization was able to efficiently detect disease patterns. Also, the method is very suitable to application to longitudinal studies, ideally in association with functional imaging, to improve our understanding of the different patterns of neurodegeneration in different diseases.

Firstly, MRI scan intensity differences were normalized, then intra-cranial regions were extracted with the FSL Brain Extraction Tool (BET). Secondly, spatial normalization was performed to co-register the different images into the common coordinate space MNI152; an affine registration, with default configuration, was performed with the FSL Linear Registration Tool (FLIRT). Linear registration is preferred to a non-linear for the methodology to be robust to subtle local differences, due for example to subject morphological variability, or small registration failures. Finally, using the template brain coordinates, we automatically segmented the brain of each subject into the two hemispheres and, starting from the medial longitudinal fissure plane, uniformly divided each hemisphere in an equal number of rectangular (l 1 \u00d7 l 2 \u00d7 l 3 ) patches, covering the whole brain, see Figure 6 . Only those patches overlapping with the template brain for more than 10% were kept. Patches were the nodes of a network whose connections represented the grade of similarity between them. Several similarity metrics were explored (see the \"Similarity Metric Study\" section in Supplementary Materials) "}, {"section_title": "8/16", "text": "and Pearson's correlation was finally preferred.\nFor each subject, we built an undirected weighted network with edges defined by pairwise Pearson's correlation among patches. Therefore, multiplex network G G G = {G 1 , G 2 , ..., G \u03b1 , . .., G M } was, in this case, a collection of single subject weighted networks G \u03b1 = (N, E \u03b1 , W \u03b1 ) sharing a common number of nodes N, while the set of links E \u03b1 and the inherent weights w i j \u2208 W \u03b1 change depending on the layer \u03b1.

Pearson's correlation admits continuous values in the [\u22121, 1] interval. Negative correlations were disregarded. It is worth noting that negative correlations can be found, for example, between patches in which gray matter and white matter undergo a left-right inversion. As a result, distinguishing positive and negative correlations would include in the multiplex model a left-right bias. As asymmetry is a common characteristic of atrophy in AD, it was decided to consider undirected networks. In addition, we decided to threshold the networks by setting to 0 all connections whose absolute correlation was less than moderate (|r| < .3), in order to exclude noisy interrelationships in the model, and reducing as much as possible the loss of important links. For higher correlations, weights were kept in the model, thus resulting in a weighted undirected network representation for each subject. An investigation on how the threshold affects the multiplex network ability to detect diseased patterns is also reported in the \"Threshold Study\" section in Supplementary Materials."}, {"section_title": "Multiplex features", "text": "In a multiplex it is possible to introduce several topological characteristics that are usually adopted to describe a complex network 28 . In our approach we employed the following indicators: the strength s \u03b1 i and the inverse participation ratio Y \u03b1 i of a node i in layer \u03b1:\nStrength measurements denote which nodes are more relevant within the network describing a single layer (i. e. a subject) of the multiplex. Inverse participation ratio attains the heterogeneity of the weight distribution within each layer. Along with these two measurements we also evaluated the conditional means of strength s(k) \u03b1 and inverse participation Y (k) \u03b1 against the nodes with degree k:\nSummation is extended over the N k nodes having degree k; as summation includes a Kronecker \u03b4 function, the only non-null terms, for both strength and inverse participation, are referred to nodes i of the layer \u03b1 whose degree is k. These quantities help to understand how weights are distributed within each layer, thus, for example, distinguishing whether, on average, the weights of central nodes and less connected nodes are identically distributed or not. Several studies have already pointed out, especially with group-wise single layer approaches 51 , how these features can describe significant differences among healthy and diseased subjects.\nHowever, it is reasonable to assume that further evidence of significant differences between subjects, can arise from the context information provided by the multiplex framework. Accordingly, this information content was exploited by considering the aggregate adjacency matrix A multi = a multi i j where:\nThe matrix A multi naturally allowed us to re-introduce the previous measurements within a global perspective. In fact, it was possible to compute for each node an aggregated degree and then use it to weight the previously defined strength and inverse participation. Analogously, we used A multi to define the aggregate degree for each node and then re-computing the conditional means. In this way we introduced in the description of each node the information produced by the whole multiplex.\nIn conclusion each network was described by 8N features (4N single layer and 4N multiplex features), resulting in a M \u00d7 8N feature representation. It is worthwhile to note that this characterization was independent from the clinical status of the subjects as the multiplex had been built blindly to diagnosis. This base of knowledge was then investigated with supervised machine learning models to extract specific disease effect patterns."}, {"section_title": "Classification and Clinical feature importance", "text": "The multiplex characterization of the images yielded a simple matrix representation, which could be used to feed machine learning models, and unveil discriminating anatomical patterns. The number of features f , involved in this approach, could easily reach values ranging from \u223c 10 3 to \u223c 10 4 outnumbering the number of the available training samples. Thus, to prevent over-training issues, arising from the curse of dimensionality and assess the multiplex framework, a feature selection was necessary. A flowchart of the whole feature selection method is represented in Figure 7 . A 5-fold cross-validation feature importance selection was performed within a wrapper-based strategy. We randomly divided 1000 times A train in a training and a validation test. For each cross-validation round we built a multiplex model on training subjects, then we computed the related training multiplex features and the overall matrix A train . For test subjects, single layer features were straightforwardly computed. Features accounting the whole multiplex structure were in turn computed adding the test subject to the training multiplex but keeping fixed A train . The reason for this choice can be justified considering the perturbation induced by the addition of one layer is small.\nFor each cross-validation round, we trained a first random forest classifier and selected the most important features. In particular, we measured the total decrease in node impurities, in terms of Gini index, from splitting on the variable, averaged over all trees. The selected features were stored for later use and used to train a second random forest classifier which was used to predict the diagnosis of the validation subjects. In both cases random forests were grown with 500 trees, a number large enough for the out-of-bag error to reach the typical training plateau.\nAt each split \u221a f features were randomly sampled, thus, for each cross-validation round, different features were selected; to determine the most important features, we measured the overall occurrence rate of each feature, interpreting it as a success rate. As a consequence, we compared the probability to observe such occurrence with a binomial distribution and an experimental p-value could be computed to test the randomness hypothesis. To select a more exiguous number of features a p-value < 0.01 threshold was set, then we established which ones had shown a significant probability of occurrence. Once the best features had been selected, we used them to train a new ensemble model on D train and tested it on D test to assess the method robustness and evaluate the informative content carried by multiplex features.\nIt is worth noting that features like strength and inverse participation have a direct interpretation, being directly related to a single patch of the brain network whilst conditional means, by definition, are related to several nodes sharing a common degree k. For classification purposes this is not an issue, being based on computed features; on the contrary this is relevant in order to provide an anatomical interpretation and a diagnostic value of the features selected. Again, for each significant feature we determined with the same strategy which anatomical districts had show a significant association to AD.
