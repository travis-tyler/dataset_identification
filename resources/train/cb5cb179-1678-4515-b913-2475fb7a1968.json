[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Agricultural production alone is no longer a viable occupation for all but the largest farms. Operators are reliant, to varying degrees, on income earned off the farm, in order to sustain both the farm business and the farm household. These jobs \"in town\" are necessary for farm survival, and consequently, off-farm work has become a mainstay of US farm households. Indeed, without off-farm work, most farms would not be able to service their household (i.e., farm and non-farm) debt, as the farm DRCU (debt repayment capacity utilization ratio) for all but the largest farms has consistently averaged above 100% since 1998 (Briggeman, 2011) . 1 In addition, off-farm work is credited with closing the income gap between the median farm and non-farm household; median farm household income has been higher than median non-farm household income since 1998 (Brown et al., 2013). Further, the necessity of off-farm income and the structure of most farm households lends a gendered component to the decision to work off-farm. In the vast majority of cases, the farm's primary operator is a man, and so it is his spouse who does more of the work \"in town,\" earning income that is necessary for the continued operation of the farm business and for the maintenance of the farm household. Despite the existing body of exploratory work into the importance of off-farm income, its causal impact on farms' operational or financial characteristics remains unknown. To date, no study has been able to link off-farm income over time to measures of farm financial viability. In addition to estimating the causal impact of off-farm income on these measures, which include the DRCU, the debt-to-income ratio, and total volume of debt, this paper also explores whether there are differential effects of off-farm income when it is earned by the farm spouse rather than the operator. Shocks to male job opportunities or income earning potential therefore affect the operator but not the spouse, and vice versa. The farm business may be affected more in the former case than in the latter, if the operator's income supports the farm more than his spouse's. This question relates directly to a literature, based on research from less developed countries, which identifies that women and men spend income differently and documents those differences (Blumberg, 1988). Although the context differs greatly, it is reasonable to assume that differences may exist in the context of the advanced agricultural economy of the United States. The \"primary operator\" designation may help motivate these differences, if, for example, it causes the household to think of the income he earns as supplementing the farm business and the income the spouse earns as supporting the household. In addition to allocating their earned income differently, there is a well-established literature that acknowledges the different ways women and men participate in and are compensated by the labor market in the US. Female labor force participation is more variable, both across women and within individual women over time (Fogli and Veldkamp, 2011), more likely to be impacted by the earnings of her spouse (Mincer, 1962), and more likely to be responsive to fertility decisions (Bloom et al., 2009). In addition, while female labor force participation has been increasing dramatically since the start of the last century (Heath and Jayachandran, 2016), the gender wage gap has remained pervasive (Blau and Kahn, 2017). The implications of the gender wage gap has never been explored for farm households in the US, despite the widespread labor force participation by farm spouses, which is often coupled with non-participation by farm operators. The financial penalties farm households assume as a result speak to both the important, non-monetary benefits to identifying as a farmer as well as to the social constructs of the farm family. This paper is the first to causally estimate the role that off-farm income plays in the continued financial viability and production capacity of US farms. Much research about the US farm economy assumes only weak links between the agricultural sector and the rest of the economy; this work identifies off-farm income as one very important channel, and quantifies that importance. In doing so, I connect the agricultural risk literature with the extensive literature on labor force participation, especially female labor force participation. Finally, by estimating the relationship between off-farm income and participation in government programs designed to provide income stability for farms, I capture important trade-offs between these two sources of farm income support. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on off-farm labor in the US, including work that has already done on the correlates of off-farm labor participation. Section 3 documents early conceptual models of the decision to work off-farm, and includes an outline of this paper's theoretical framework for that decision. Section 4 describes the data and empirical methods to-date. Results appear in section 5, and section 6 concludes."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Farm household income variability has been the target of government programs since the beginning of the 20th century, with the most recent example being the 2014 Farm Act. Farm household income is so volatile because the income earned from agriculture is highly variable: one study of large-scale commercial farms found that the between-year change in farm income was about 180% of the median farm income (Key et al., 2017). Farm households where the operator does not have a spouse have more variable income. Off-farm work has long been understood to be a crucial component in a farm's risk management strategy, as variability of farm income has been found to have a significant relationship with off-farm labor supply in early empirical work (Mishra and Goodwin, 1998), (Serra et al., 2005). Studies that have looked at the relationship between off-farm labor and government programs in particular often struggle with identification in light of the endogeneity between the decision to work off farm and the amount of government payments received. In the case of El-Osta et al. (2008), their solution for this endogeneity, the Smith-Blundell two-step estimator, was only \"fairly successful.\" 2 They find a negative and significant relationship of government payments on the likelihood of just the husband working off-farm and of both spouses working off farm. However, an increase in expected payments actually increases the likelihood of just the wife working off-farm, possibly attributed to the higher dependence on farming among households with this off-farm work strategy. The wife's education level and household size have the expected relationship (positive and negative, respectively) on the likelihood of the wife working off farm. Using a sample from Canada, Poon and Weersink (2011) find that government payments have a significant and positive relationship with the variability of off-farm income, showing that government payments could be a substitute risk management option for off-farm work. The increase in variability indicates a possible decrease in full-time off-farm work associated with government payments for these farms (Poon and Weersink, 2011). Serra et al. (2005) find similar results on the relationship between government support and off-farm labor decisions, using the 1996 farm policy reform that introduced fixed, decoupled payments into the suite of US government farm support as a plausibly exogenous policy change. However, the decreased likelihood of off-farm labor was potentially counterbalanced by an increased revealed aversion to risk, which in turn was related to increased off-farm labor participation. Overall, Serra et al. (2005) conclude that the reforms' net effects were small. Because of data limitations, these authors are only able to observe the extensive margin of off-farm work by any family member: a dummy variable equal to 1 if any household member reports off-farm work. One possible means of addressing this endogeneity would be to use changes in levels of access to health insurance, as one of the many reasons an operator or his spouse chooses to work off-farm is to receive health insurance for the farm family. Farm household members receive insurance from different sources than the general population, although the percentage receiving health insurance from their employer is roughly the same in each group (57.0% of farm households and 59.7% of non-farm households). In 2006, 9.1% of non-farm individuals purchased insurance directly, 20.8% of farm household members did. On the flip side, farm household members are less likely to receive health insurance from government programs (18.5%) than are members of the general non-farm population (27.0%) . Mishra and Chang (2012) used the theoretical framework of Huffman and Lange (1989) to estimate the relationship between off-farm work and health-related expenditures and found that off-farm work is associated with significantly lower health care expenditures. Over time, changes in tax policy also changed the incentives around self-employment, including farming. For example, changes in the deductability of health insurance premiums for the selfemployed, brought about by legislation, increased the probability of self-employment both extensively and intensively (Heim and Lurie, 2010). More recently, changes to the country's health care system brought about by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) changed the possible sources of health insurance for some farm households. Expansions to Medicaid, in the states that elected to do so, made some households eligible, while the individual marketplace changed the incentives to work off-farm primarily for health insurance. Additionally, provisions in the ACA requiring employers of a certain size to provide health insurance for their employees may have impacted the structure and labor use decisions of the country's largest farms (Ahearn et al., 2014). In their paper, Ahearn et al. (2014) identify the farms that would be implicated by the ACA expansion, using data from 2011 prior to the bill's passage and relying on the assumption that farm characteristics would be somewhat constant. They find that 17% of farm families in 2011 would be eligible for Medicaid under the expansion, with roughly half of these farms located in states that elected to expand. The research by Mishra, Ahearn and others indicates the non-monetary benefits of off-farm work, including access to group health insurance coverage, play a significant role in determining whether a household member works off-farm and the extent to which s/he does so. These authors also find significantly higher retirement savings for farm households who participate in more off-farm work, likely through the mechanism of company supported retirement savings systems, such as pensions and 401(k)s. Another possible way to exogenously identify these effects would be to use changes in the characteristics of the local labor market. Work by Alasia et al. (2009) has shown a significant association between local economic conditions and the likelihood of off-farm labor provision. Because agriculture tends to be decoupled from general economic trends, under some circumstances it is possible that changes in the local economy increased the likelihood of off-farm employment without affecting other on-farm production or financial decisions. Using data from the 2010 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), Brown et al. (2013) provide a descriptive analysis of the nature of off-farm work by both farm operators and, uncommon for this literature, their spouses as well. Because 2010 was the first year ARMS asked respondents about their specific occupation, rather than the industry, in which farm operators and their spouses worked, the authors use this information to highlight important complementarities between the current nature of farm management and the kinds of work operators and their spouses perform off-farm. Specifically, given the high levels of human capital required to manage a large farm, Brown and Weber predict that farm operators' off-farm jobs will be high skill, which would help explain the increase in median farm household income relative to the general population since 1998. These predictions are born out in the data: farm operators and spouses worked in management and professional positions more frequently than the general non-metro, non-farm population. Across all farm sizes, the most common position for a farm operator or his spouse was in a management or professional occupation. In another study using ARMS data, El-Osta 2011shows that human capital attainment, specifically education, is an important contributor to a farm's capacity to generate income, both on and off the farm. However, El-Osta (2011) use only one year of ARMS data (2006) and are unable to control for the endogeneity of education in the economic outcome models. This result supports the findings of earlier work using county-level averages to show that increases in farmers' human capital, through education or extension, \"directly increases the odds of their off-farm work\", both at the extensive and intensive margin (Huffman, 1980), a finding also supported by the work of Alasia et al. (2009). The importance of off-farm income does decline as farm size increases; off-farm income declines as a share of total farm household income as farm size increases (Brown et al., 2013). Separate empirical work on a sample of Canadian farmers shows a different, but related result: 50% of farms classified as \"large\" or \"very large\" in their sample were in the highest off-farm income volatility quintile. These authors suggest that operators and their families of large farms use off-farm income to self-insure when farm income is low (Poon and Weersink, 2011). The negative correlation between farm size and propensity to work off-farm is also found in other empirical work ( (Mishra and Goodwin, 1998), (Serra et al., 2005)). While there is substantial variation in the occupation of the farm operator across farm sizes, the jobs held by farm spouses do not tend to vary: work in the education and health care sectors dominates all others, regardless of farm size. The opposite is true for hours worked, however: while the hours worked by the farm operator are relatively constant regardless of the occupation, across all occupations farm spouses work significantly less as farm size increases. In fact, spouses on farms with $250,000 or more in sales work an average of only 3.6 hours per week, compared to an average of 26.4 hours per week by spouses on farms with $50,000 or less in sales. This points to significant, systematic differences in work preferences by spouses across farm sizes, different opportunity costs of time, or some combination of the two (Brown et al., 2013). In a study examining the household income variability of large-scale commercial operations, Key et al. (2017) find that the off-farm income variability of these farms is significantly higher than the non-farm income of non-farm households. Off-farm income is clearly used very differently by farms of different sizes; for the largest operations, it is used only when necessary to compensate for the variation in farm income. In years where it is possible for these households to forgo off-farm work, they do so; in other years, when off-farm work is necessary due to farm income downturns, it is sought out."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual model", "text": "The earliest conceptual models of off-farm work in the United States have either failed to consider, or been unable to consider, the differences between the labor supplied off-farm by the primary operator and by his spouse. Early theoretical models of household off-farm labor allocation considered each household member to be identical, with identical preferences over farm work, off-farm work, and leisure (Huffman, 1980). In addition to this simplification, these models also relied on some unrealistic and untenable assumptions, including perfect flexibility in the off-farm labor market and no non-monetary benefits to work. The work of Huffman and Lange (1989) provides a theoretical model of the intra-household bargaining system that farm households undertake when making off-farm work decisions. Their work advances earlier models by including non-negativity constraints on off-farm hours, which previous work, including Huffman (1980), failed to include. Despite this advancement, their work fails to consider differential levels of access men and women have to labor markets, especially in rural areas. Further, their theoretical model of off-farm labor supply fails to consider that some women (and men) might derive utility from off-farm work, as well as other developments from the \"work as empowerment\" literature that has been developed over the last few decades. Their findings, on the determinants of off-farm work, are not surprising, and highlight the role of human capital accumulation in influencing these decisions. In cases where the operator and his spouse's off-farm work are considered separately, authors tend to treat the spouse's decision as identical to the operators', ignoring a wide body of literature on the mechanics of intra-household bargaining, as well as studies that model differences between how men and women access, participate in, and are compensated in the labor market. In fact, El-Osta et al. (2008) even says, \"increasing access to off-farm job opportunities...is likely to be more important for husbands than for wives, in terms of both participation and earnings potential.\" However, data these authors use show that wives work off-farm at a rate almost double that of husbands, when only one partner works off-farm."}, {"section_title": "Data and empirical strategy", "text": "As mentioned above, previous literature that has looked at the relationship between farm-level outcomes and off-farm work has been limited by two primary empirical challenges: the endogeneity of the off-farm work decision and poor data availability. For the former, endogeneity comes from the simultaneity of the decision to work off-farm and to participate in government programs, take on debt, and other production considerations. Omitted variables are also a concern, especially given the inherent unobservability of factors that drive people to pursue off-farm work, such as innate motivation or aptitude. In the following two sections, I outline my empirical strategy, which is designed to overcome these obstacles. The conceptual model in section 3 describes how the question of who works off farm, and how much they do so, is the outcome of a household bargaining decision. For the majority of farm households in the data, the outcome of that decision is that the primary operator remains male and the spouse works off-farm. This has remained true over time, with the share of female primary operators holding constant at roughly 5% of farm operations, even as other occupations in the non-farm economy showing signs of increasing gender parity. Further, given this designation, we expect that income earned off-farm by each member of the household to be used differently. In order to capture the extent to which this is true, therefore, our empirical strategy must be able to identify changes to off-farm work opportunities for men separately from those of women. Additionally, detailed data are needed to test how off-farm work is used more generally. For example, data on participation in government programs designed to reduce farm income variability can be used to estimate whether off-farm work is used to smooth farm income across time. Data on receipt of lump-sum sources of farm funding, on the other hand, can be used to estimate whether off-farm income is instead used to increase total income."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is the only nationally representative and annually conducted farm survey. It contains comprehensive information on all aspects of the farm business and household, including measures of participation in government programs, such as crop insurance, and an extensive section on the farm businesses' outstanding loans. Each year, ARMS surveys roughly 20,000 farms; ARMS has been conducted each year since 1996. Although the data are cross-sectional, distributional requirements mean that there is a positive relationship between farm size and likelihood of appearing in the ARMS sample more frequently over time. As a consequence, there is a smaller, non-representative sub-sample of farms that are larger than the average ARMS farm that can be formed into an unbalanced panel. Weber et al. (2016) provides more detail on the ARMS panel, and how observations in the panel differ from those in the cross section. In addition to providing the dependent variables of interest, ARMS also includes important information on the off-farm labor participation and time use separately for the farm operator and, crucially, his spouse. These variables form the set of \"first stage\" mechanisms; summary statistics for these variables are reported in table 1. Specifically, ARMS reports the off-farm income earned, broken down into off-farm wage or salary income and income generated from operating an offfarm business. I also observe the on-farm wage paid to the operator and to the spouse for work they do on-farm. This is distinct from income generated by the farm business, and is quite noisy; it is highly variable and may reflect income smoothing to comply with tax regulations rather than accurately reflecting the value-added to the farm business. Starting in 2004, the survey included a weekly time use section that recorded how the operator and his spouse spent their time during an average week. To capture the influence of the farm production cycle, which is highly seasonal, these questions were asked of each household member for each quarter of the year. Within year variation in off-farm work is an important aspect of understanding the role off-farm income plays in the risk management strategy of the farm. From this section, it is also possible to calculate the number of non-farm hours worked during a week by both household members. Other categories in the time use survey included on-farm hours, broken out by paid and unpaid hours, personal care, which includes home production activities, and leisure hours. All of the dependent variables are reported at the farm level, while the intermediate off-farm work variables are reported at the farm-household-member level. However, the data reported below are aggregated up to the commuting zone level for the estimation strategy, which uses shocks at the commuting zone level to estimate impacts.  "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The empirical model for this paper is motivated first by a need for plausibly exogenous shifts in off-farm work opportunities that are unrelated to agricultural performance. Given the genderbased dichotomy in the off-farm work decision, these shifts should also be separately identifiable as affecting women's work opportunities more than men's, and vice versa. One such example would be the growth, or decline, in traditionally female employment opportunities, such as education or nursing. The second motivation for the empirical strategy comes from the kinds of off-farm work farm operators and their spouses perform. Research by Brown et al. (2013) shows that farm operators and their spouses are over-represented in off-farm management and professional occupations, occupying a higher share of these jobs than either metropolitan or non-metropolitan workers. Further, the share of operators or spouses in these positions increases with farm sales volume, indicating important human capital spillovers between operation of large farm businesses and non-farm professional work. Using one year of the ARMS survey, they show that almost a third of farm operators work in management and a quarter work in sales; for spouses, those shares are 40% and 37%, respectively. This work highlights the difficulty in limiting shocks to one specific occupation or even sector. An economy-wide shock, differential by both gender and industry, is more conducive for estimating the impact of off-farm work for the farm household. To do so, we rely on a well-developed literature that looks at the labor impacts of the explosion of Chinese manufacturing imports, beginning with David et al. (2013). In this paper, the authors use spatial variation in exposure to import competition from China, based on the initial distribution of industries across the country. They find a host of labor market impacts, including increased unemployment and reduced wages and labor market participation between the years 1990 and 2004. Following their framework, I construct a measure of import penetration of the following form: where: L i j95 is the employment in i of industry j in 1995 L i95 is total employment in i in 1995 M cu jt are imports from China to the US of industry j in t Y j96 + M j96 X j96 is the initial absorption of j in 1996 In this measure, i indexes commuting zones, a geographical aggregation measure based on where people work and used to define local labor markets. 3 ; j indexes industries defined by the SIC industry code, and t indexes years. A gender component to this shock was added to their framework by including the fraction of female workers to the measure of import competition (Autor et al., 2018). With this component, the measure of import penetration separately identifies shocks by gender and by industry, using lagged data for employment counts and share of female workers by industry. This measure appears as follows: ( 2)where: f i j90 is share of women in i working in industry j in 1990 Everything else as before The measure I constructed differs from Autor et al. (2018) in a few ways. First, I observe my dependent variables annually, and so instead of using a differenced measure of import penetration, I construct one for each commuting zone in each year between 1996 and 2016. I also change the base years to more accurately reflect the start date of my data (that is, 1996 instead of 1990). Table  A1 in the appendix records the sources used in the creation of this import penetration measure. Finally, to address the simultaneity between imports from China and local labor market conditions in commuting zones in the United States, I also follow David et al. (2013) and Autor et al. (2018) in constructing an instrument for the measure of Chinese import penetration in the US. To do so, I replace the measure of China's exports to the US for each industry with a measure of China's exports to a small set of comparably developed countries for the same industry and year. 4 The instrument is calcuated as follows: (3) where: The validity of this instrument, through the satisfaction of the exclusion restriction, rests on the assumption that the instrument captures the common component of import growth in the US and in other countries. This common component is due to factors specific to China's changing internal policies and promotion of manufacturing, rather than anything specific to the countries importing its products. Without the instrument, there would be concerns that factors specific to the commuting zones, such as localized demand shocks, driving both the imports in a year as well as the employment-related dependent variables. David et al. (2013) also replicate their findings using a gravity trade model, which accounts for domestic demand, and find that correlated import demand shocks across countries are not important for their results. Finally, the instrument is calculated using ten year lags on the employment variables and three year lags on the trade variables to mitigate concerns about anticipatory behavior regarding trade with China affecting contemporaneous employment. My estimation strategy leverages the instrumented import penetration from China in each commuting zone and in each year to first estimate the impact of changing work opportunities for men and women on the intermediate indicators of off-farm work decisions. This estimating equation takes the following form: In this specification, W sit is the on-or off-farm hours or income for gender group s in CZ i in year t; IP cu sit is the Chinese import pressure in the US, as defined above in equation 2; IP co sit is the Chinese import pressure in other countries, as defined in equation 3; F it is a matrix of farm characteristics aggregated to the CZ level; and a t are year fixed effects. In addition, I estimate a similar equation, with one-year-lead measures of farm debt and household debt (measured at the farm level and aggregated up to the commuting zone) as the dependent variables of interest, rather than the intermediate outcomes of measure of work. This is defined as follows: Here, Y it+1 is the acres or debt in CZ i in year t +1, and all other variables are defined as in equation 5."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Figure 5 presents the results from estimating equation 5. These results confirm that the measure of import penetration does have an effect on the intermediate measures of on-and off-farm work for both farm operators and their spouses. Specifically, we see that when female-oriented work opportunities are shocked, off-farm income for farm spouses declines by more than $30,000; this effect is even more extreme for farm operators, who lose more than $270,000 in income. In fact, results in this table seem to indicate that farm operators tend to give up their off-farm work entirely when male dominated industries face increased import pressure: in addition to the large decline in income, they also reduce their off-farm hours per week by about 40 hours. The coefficient in column 4 indicates that they replace these hours with more off-farm work. Results for the spouse show the opposite effect: when their off-farm opportunites are shocked, they increase their non-farm hours in a week, but make less money. This indicates that farm spouses are possibly taking more hours at a lower wage or lower skill job, possibly to retain health insurance or other non-wage benefits from working. They also work fewer on-farm hours. Figures ?? and 6 show the results for total volume of farm debt and total volume of household debt, respectively. We see opposite impacts on farm debt than on household debt, depending on the household member whose employment opportunities are shocked. An increase in import pressure for operator's employment opportunities leads to an increase in farm debt and a decrease in household debt. The opposite is true for the farm spouse: when her off-farm work opportunities are shocked, household debt increases but farm debt increases. This preliminary evidence suggests that the farm operator and his spouse allocate the money they earn differently, with the operator's off-farm income bolstering the farm business and the spouse's income going towards the household. Figure 6: Off-farm income shocks and farm debt Figure 7: Off-farm income shocks and household debt"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The role off-farm income plays in a farm's risk management strategy is important to understand, especially for farms in the middle of the farm size distribution. As the farm economy nationwide continues to see a \"hollowing out of the middle,\" it is crucial to know how linkages between the farm and non-farm sectors function. Off-farm work may be an important mediator preventing fur-ther consolidation of rural agricultural land and the loss of \"family farms.\" The as-yet unexplored gender component of this question also sheds light on how farm households operate internally, and how continued support for female labor force participation and a narrowing of the gender wage gap can have important implications for the survival of farm businesses. Future work on this topic will repeat the estimation, exploiting changes in access to health insurance as the source of exogeneity driving the decision of whether or not to work off-farm. These changes include state and time variation in the deductability of health insurance premiums for the self-employed, and Medicaid expansions and other forms of increased access brought about by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, future work will include an expanded set of outcomes, including those that are not currently available due to data release constraints, as well as a more granular estimation that makes better use of the farm-level data. This is again not presented here due to data access and release constraints. I show preliminary results that indicate that the farm operator and his spouse allocate the money they earn off-farm differently, and that there are differential effects by gender in response to changing off-farm work opportunities. Contrary to previous theoretical models of the US farm household, these are not two identical agents, but instead each may serve a more specialized role in the operation of the farm business. 7 Appendix A "}]
