The difference between RCs and Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRCs) lies in the fact that IUCRCs are typically initiated by the universities and get their initial funding from the federal government while most of the RCs are private initiatives where the member firms control the type of research conducted at the RC and contract with universities whenever desired (Evan and Olk (1990) ).\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore why firms decide to form an RC instead of financing a similar research project internally. Several answers to this question have been proposed in the literature including the efficiencies of shared cost and risk, the pooling of scarce talent and capital, the desire for research synergy, setting standards, reducing duplication of effort, and accelerated technology development (Gibson and Rogers (1994) , Ouchi and Bolton (1988) , Peck (1986) ). These traditional motivations for cooperation in R&D explain why firms would want to cooperate. However, they do not offer any insight as to how cooperation should be organized, i.e., whether cooperation should take the form of a RC or should be organized as a contractual agreement among independent firms. While the transaction cost literature does offer an explanation as to why a hierarchy might perform better than a contractual arrangement among independent firms, it does not provide a clear explanation as to why firms would prefer to form a RC-sharing authority with several partners-to performing the R&D project internally (see Kogut (1988) , Hennart (1991) , Parkhe (1993) and Robertson and Gatignon (1998) ). In order for the RC to be the optimal governance structure, it needs to dominate both integration and a contractual arrangement. In the face of some contractual incompleteness related to the researcher's contract we find that RCs arise as the optimal governance structure.\nThe importance of attracting and retaining scarce research talent is often mentioned as an important reason for firms to cooperate in R&D, especially in the semiconductor industry.\nHowever, the role of researchers' ability and their influence over project choice, have never been directly related to the organizational form of R&D. This paper develops a model of RCs in which RCs must compete for high ability researchers with universities, research institutions and other firms within the industry. Universities are attractive to researchers because they typically allow researchers a great deal of autonomy in pursuing a research program. Private for-profit organizations often cannot offer the same degree of autonomy. Once a researcher has joined a private organization, it may be in the organization's best interest to channel the researcher's program in a specific direction in order to increase short-term profits.\nAnticipating such meddling by the management of the firms, researchers may opt for university employment rather than employment in the private organization. This creates the tradeoff for private organizations between control over research projects and attracting higher ability researchers. Economies of scale in R&D, i.e. a necessary critical mass of researchers, exacerbate this tradeoff and improves the performance of the RC because of these economies and the reduced competition for scarce resources by individual member firms.\nIn order to understand the nature of the problem, it is important to define the type of research RCs tend to perform. While R&D statistics often make the distinction between different types of research such as basic, applied and development research (Dosi (1988) ), this distinction is rarely made explicit in the theoretical literature on research and development.\nWhat is important to note, is that different types of research projects, require different skills in terms of the researchers that perform the research. Research projects that could be classified as more basic research, require researchers with basic or academic research skills. For these research projects, the problem as well as the solutions are usually not well defined. The observable output of this research skill are for instance published articles in scholarly journals and the success of a basic research scientist is measured through peer acceptance rather than the utility created through social change or monetary rewards (Nason (1981) , Powell and Smith (1996) ). Reich (1985) defines the intermediate type of research that RCs tend to perform also as \"Industrial R&D\": \"industrial laboratories set apart from production facilities, staffed by people trained in science and advanced engineering who work toward deeper understandings of corporate-related science and technology, and who are organized and administered to keep them somewhat insulated from immediate demands yet responsive to long-term company needs.\" We are especially interested in the organizational element of this type of research which requires researchers with basic research skills. Closer to development, the required skills of the researcher are development engineering skills (Bridenbaugh (1996) ).\nThe researchers on these projects need to find solutions to a known, usually more practical, but therefore not easier to solve problem. The observable output of these more applied projects are patent applications, new products and new processes and usually monetary rewards are tied to these. While at the development end, the firms compete with each other for qualified research personnel with development engineering skills, for the more basic research projects, the firms also compete with universities and research institutions for their researchers.\nA key finding of this paper is that RCs will offer researchers greater autonomy than a single firm pursuing an identical research program. Given this, RCs will have an advantage over single firms in recruiting high ability researchers. The intuition for this result is that in a RC, exercising formal authority over the choice of research projects is a public good. The members of the RC free ride on each others' monitoring efforts. As a result top management of the RC ends up meddling less with the choices of research projects than would be the case in an in-house R&D department. Because it involves a sharing of formal authority among several principals, the organization of a RC effectively commits the organization to exert less control over project choice. The optimal loss of control over project choice which maximizes member firm benefits depends on the success probability of industrial R&D. The model predicts that the number of member firms of a RC is larger, the lower this success probability.\nThis result is consistent with the fact that RCs are observed in some industries more than in others.\nThe theoretical model does not identify the boundaries of the organization. In this respect the model can also shed some light on issues relating to centralized R&D departments versus decentralized R&D efforts. Similar trade offs between control over the projects performed in the centralized R&D department and attracting high ability researchers exist.\nFirst, when the company headquarters reduces its authority over the research department and the different divisions of the firm jointly exercise formal authority over the research department, the model predicts that the maximum ability researcher that can be attracted to the research department decreases. Typically division management is better informed about which specific projects to perform and thus has a lower cost of information gathering and monitoring. Secondly, decentralizing R&D efforts completely increases the likelihood of intervention by management of the division because the free riding on information gathering between division managers is eliminated.\nThe model of RCs is applied to the specific case of the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC), a well known RC devoted to research on computer technology and artificial intelligence. The model developed here sheds light on the organization of MCC as well as on the evolution of turnover of research personnel as a result of organizational changes. We find evidence in this case study that the flow of high quality researchers is directly related to the organizational design of an organization concerned with industrial research and development. The main findings are consistent with the existence of the trade off identified in the theoretical model between control over research projects and researcher ability. This paper is related to the growing literature on endogenous organizational design where the firm commits to an organizational design either to influence some noncontractible decision by an agent or by the firm at a later point in time, or to change the renegotiation game which takes place after some investment decisions by the agent.\nIn Aghion and Tirole (1997) , the paper most closely related to ours, the decision on the organizational design of the firm is whether formal authority to implement projects is allocated to the principal or to his agent. The optimal organizational design depends on the congruence between the principal's and the agent's objectives. Whenever congruence in objectives is high, the principal allocates formal decision rights to the agent in order to stimulate the agent's effort choice. There exists thus a general trade off between initiative by the agent and loss of control of the principal.\nIn Rotemberg and Saloner (1993) the choice of the CEO commits the firm to a certain leadership style, and as a result to an implementation policy for innovative projects. A more empathic leader cares about the employee's utility while an autocratic leader maximizes the profits of the firm. The shareholders prefer the former when the firm has the potential for exploiting numerous innovative ideas, and prefers the latter in the other case. In a similar analysis Rotemberg and Saloner (1994) show that under certain conditions a narrow focus of the firm might be preferable to a broad one. When considering which profit-enhancing innovation to implement, the firm selects the innovation that leaves the most rents to the firm after having paid incentive compensation to the innovative employee. With a broad business strategy it is more likely that implementing the innovation that leaves the most rents to the firm ex post does not provide the agent with the appropriate ex ante incentives to invest effort in finding profit-enhancing innovations. This could make the firm with a broad business strategy worse off compared to firms committing to a narrow business strategy.\nIn this paper the choice of organizational design, i.e. the number of principals and the amount of investment in infrastructure of the RC, commits the principals to a level of information gathering about R&D projects. This in turn determines the expected autonomy researchers will enjoy over the choice of research projects and as a result influences the ability of the researchers that can be attracted. The assumptions underlying this type of model, especially the noncontractibility of the level of autonomy researchers enjoy, of investment decisions of member firms, and of the final project value, have a natural interpretation in a research and development environment. As is the case with any monitoring effort, the decision to invest in gathering information about which research project to pursue, is hard to contract upon. Similarly, the exact nature of the outcome of a research project is ill-defined ex ante.\nThe perceived benefits of these projects are typically rather intangible, such as researcher training, and increased awareness of R&D in general (Sakakibara (1997) ). As a result the value of the research project is noncontractible ex ante (Aghion and Tirole (1997) ).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we develop the basic theoretical model that focuses on the link between control over research projects and the ability of the researchers that can be attracted to the RC. Section 3 analyses the model and develops the key intuitions. In Section 4 the organization of MCC is described and the evolution of turnover of research personnel at MCC is explained as a result of the tension between control over research projects by the member firms at the RC and the ability of researchers within the organization. Section 5 concludes. Because of their simple nature, all proofs are relegated to the Appendix."}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "This section develops the basic model for the organization of a RC interested in attracting high ability research personnel. The recruiting ground of the RC is common with the universities interested in high ability researchers. The main advantage of a RC over a university is the availability of funds and the latest technical equipment. The university is appealing to the researchers because of the guaranteed freedom in academic research. A private organization is unable to give its researchers such commitments.\n2 The RC is considered as a commitment device that decreases the incentives of its member firms to interfere with the researcher's choice of research projects. As a result of this commitment the RC attracts higher ability researchers."}, {"section_title": "Notation and Timing", "text": "The idea for setting up a RC is launched by a leader and innovator in the field. This organizer determines the size, n, and the amount of the initial investment, F, of the RC by maximizing her share of profits from the RC where n \u2208 [1, \u221e) and F \u2208 R + . The organizer invites n -1 other firms to join the RC and they pay their share in the investment in infrastructure, . Note that the principals in the RC are the top management of the n member firms. Next, the RC decides whether or not to offer a researcher with ability \u03b8 a research contract, where \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u221e). The ability of the researcher implies his ability to perform academic type research and is assumed to be observable but not verifiable. 3 The researcher can either accept or reject the offer. Accepting the offer commits the researcher to the RC for the duration of the project.\nRejection ends the game. If the researcher accepted the contract, he proposes a research project to work on. The member firms do not know the payoffs of any of the research projects ex ante but have the same preferences over project choices and individually invest in information gathering, K i . 4 Their joint investment determines the probability that the board of directors of the RC actually knows which projects are the most profitable for the RC:\nWe assume that P(.) is increasing and concave with 0 \u2264 P(.) \u2264 1, P(0) = 0 and P'(0) = \u221e, P(\u221e) = 1, P'(\u221e) = 0. This ensures an interior solution with respect to the investment in information gathering. We also assume that the investment in monitoring is not contractible. The process of information gathering about which research projects would maximize the member firms'\nprofits, is sufficiently complex that it cannot be specified completely in an initial contract between the member firms, which then could be observed by the researcher and other member firms. If the board of directors knows the payoff structure of the projects, they can overrule the proposal of the researcher, otherwise the researcher's suggestion as to which project to pick is accepted. 5 This set up is very similar to Aghion and Tirole (1997) . The timing of the game tries to capture the fact that the management in the RC will meddle with the research project during the course of its development. This happens after the researcher accepted the contract of the RC. The researcher will be forward looking in anticipating this intervention by the board of directors. Finally, the project is selected and the payoffs are realized. The timing of the game is summarized in Figure 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Preferences and Profits", "text": "The benefits of the member firms increase with the ability of the researcher that is attracted to the RC but depend on whether or not the board of directors chooses the project. The preferred project of the member firms has an expected gross benefit of G(\u03b8), where G(.) is increasing, concave and bounded in \u03b8, and G(0) = 0 and G'(0) = \u221e. This total value is equally divided between the member firms by allowing member firms to develop this technology in the specific areas of their expertise, or, the total value can be appropriated by the organizer of the RC by not inviting any other firms into the RC. 6 If the researcher is allowed to choose the R&D project, he will not necessarily choose the most preferred project of the member firms. The probability that the member firms' preferred project coincides with the researchers choice is \u03b1 (0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1). This \"congruence\" parameter is likely to be industry specific and is related to the distance of basic research to market. In some industries, basic research more readily leads to profitable products and processes. 7 We interpret this parameter \u03b1 as the probability that academic type research eventually leads to a profitable business venture. If the board of directors follows the researcher's recommended project, the expected gross benefit of the RC is \u03b1G(\u03b8). It is important to distinguish the effects of \u03b1 and \u03b8. The parameter \u03b8 is related to the ability of the researcher to perform academic type research, while \u03b1 indicates how likely this type of academic research translates into profitable business ventures. A brilliant mathematician will have a high \u03b8. However, \u03b1, the probability that any project results in a profitable business venture is very low, whether you have a brilliant or not-so-brilliant mathematician. If, for some reason the mathematical research project turns out to be a profitable business opportunity, we assume that the expected value of the project by the brilliant mathematician, G(\u03b8), is higher than the one for the not-so-brilliant researcher. The total expected payoff of the RC, gross of monitoring investment is:\nThe researcher cares both about his research autonomy, a, and his research funding and infrastructure, F.\n8 The researcher's utility is represented by: U(a, F), where a \u2208 {0, 1}, U a \u2265 0,\n9 If a = 1, the researcher has the freedom to choose the project to work on. If a = 0, the researcher is told which project to work on. We will make the following assumption about the utility function of researchers:\nThis assumption implies that the researcher values the choice of research projects and can never be fully compensated for the loss of this freedom through monetary or material rewards.\nFor the results of the model to hold, however, it is sufficient that any incentive scheme provided to the researcher cannot perfectly align the incentives of the researcher with those of the board of directors. This assumption is consistent with the observation that scientists are less likely to have an incentive contract compared to engineers. One explanation is that basic research types might be less responsive to financial incentives compared to development engineering types. 10 Alternatively this could be the result of the type of compensation contracts that are feasible between the RC and the researcher. 11 We will assume that the researcher has an outside option. We can think of this outside option as getting a job at the university where nobody will ever overrule any project choices (a = 1). The utility of the researcher doing research at the university is: U(1, F U ), where F U is the funding and infrastructure provided to the researcher by the university. The expected utility of the researcher at the RC depends on the available funding and up to date equipment, F, and on the expected autonomy in the choice of research projects. The expected utility of a researcher of ability \u03b8, working at the RC is:\n3. Analysis"}, {"section_title": "Information Gathering by Member firms", "text": "To derive a subgame perfect equilibrium, we solve the game by backwards induction. In the last stage the member firms have to determine how much to invest in information gathering.\nGiven that the investment in information gathering by an individual member firm is not contractible, each member firm chooses K i to maximize her share in the RC:\nThe first order conditions determine the optimal investment level of each member firm, for all \u03b1 < 1. We assume that the member firms are identical and solve for the symmetric equilibrium.\nDefine K* \u2261 K(n, \u03b8; \u03b1, \u03b2) as the optimal investment in information gathering. We summarize the comparative statics with respect to K* in proposition 1 and proposition 2: * \u03b2 Proposition 1.1 states that the higher the ability of the researcher, the more a member firm invests in monitoring the project choice of the researcher. Given that the researcher accepted the contract, it is in the member firms' best interest to monitor with higher probability and let a higher ability researcher work on the member firms' most preferred project. The marginal benefit of intervention by the board of directors ((1-\u03b1)G(\u03b8)) is increasing in the ability of the researcher. 12 If the objectives of the researcher are more aligned with the member firms' objective, or if research is more readily commercialized in the industry, proposition 1.2 reveals that the member firms are less likely to monitor the researchers' project choice because the expected benefit from not interfering increases. In proposition 1.3 the member firms invest less in information gathering as the marginal cost of information gathering increases.\nProposition 2: An individual member firm invests less in information gathering and the RC as a whole invests less in information gathering, the more member firms there are in the RC:\n* Proposition 2.1 characterizes the public good aspect of the investment in information gathering. The more member firms there are in the RC, the less each member firm spends on monitoring. The free rider effect of gathering information becomes more severe as the number of firms in the RC increases. 13 Proposition 2.2 formalizes this stronger result, namely that the total investment in information gathering by the RC decreases as the number of firms in the RC increases. The loss of control over the research projects increases as the number of member firms increases."}, {"section_title": "Researchers' Pool", "text": "A researcher of ability \u03b8 needs to decide whether or not to accept an offer by the RC. Note that rejecting the offer returns the researcher to his reservation value, U(1, F U ). We assume that the ability of the researcher is observable by the RC. Qualified researchers are scarce resources and the firms performing R&D in these specific areas usually have a good idea of the people available in the market. The highest ability researcher that the RC can attract is\nThe pool of researchers from which the RC can hire is \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03b8 max ]. Given that ability is observable, the RC only attracts the highest ability researchers within the pool of researchers. Given the assumptions, \u2200 \u03b1 < 1: U RC (F, n, \u03b8, nK*) is strictly decreasing and convex in \u03b8, while U(1, F U ) is constant. For any amount of funding strictly greater than the funding at the university, F U , there will exist a strictly positive maximum ability researcher that the RC can attract. Propositions 3 derives the comparative statics related to the highest ability researcher that can be attracted to the RC.\nProposition 3: 3.1 If researchers and member firms are more likely to agree on the projects, higher ability researchers are more likely to accept a contract of the RC:\n3.2 If information gathering by the member firms becomes more difficult, higher ability researchers are more likely to accept a contract of the RC:\nIn proposition 3.1, the more aligned the objectives of researchers and member firms, the higher the ability of researchers attracted to the RC. The effect of an increase in \u03b1 is that the member firms gather less information (Proposition 1), which reduces the probability that the board of directors meddles with the project choice of the researchers. The expected benefit of the researcher in the RC increases and as a result higher ability researchers are willing to accept a contract offer. An empirical prediction consistent with proposition 3.1 is that the average ability of researchers in the biotechnology industry, relative to the ability within the profession, is higher than the relative average ability of researchers in the microelectronics business. This is because we expect that \u03b1 is higher in biotechnology than in microelectronics since the distance between basic research and the commercial application of technology in biotech is lower (see also footnote 7).\nThe same intuition for the effect of an increase in \u03b1 of Proposition 3.1 underlies the effect of more costly information gathering in Proposition 3.2. An empirical prediction consistent with this proposition is that whenever formal decision authority over research projects is transferred from the central headquarters to the divisions, the high ability Empirically we can try to discriminate between the effects of a change in \u03b1 and \u03b2 through analyzing industry versus firm specific effects. A change in \u03b1 should affect the whole industry. In that case, we should observe similar effects with respect to all the firms within the industry. Firm specific effects can be interpreted as changes in \u03b2. For example, turnover of research personnel could be the result of a change in \u03b1. In this case, we should observe similar effects at other firms and RCs within the industry. This would also be reflected in the average ability of researchers in the industry. Turnover as the result of a change in \u03b2, would only affect that specific firm. These researchers could move within the industry, rather then between the industry and the university.\nThe effects of the number of firms and the amount of funding on the highest ability researcher are readily established. Higher funding attracts higher ability researchers by directly increasing the researchers expected benefits in the RC. Increasing the number of member firms exacerbates the free rider problem in the RC with respect to information gathering.\nResearchers anticipate being monitored less (Proposition 2). As a result higher ability researchers can be attracted at the margin.

The organizer maximizes her share of the profits of the RC. On the one hand, the organizer can increase the initial investment in infrastructure, F. This attracts higher ability researchers, because it shifts the expected utility of the researcher in the RC upwards. As a result, the expected value of the research project increases. On the other hand, the organizer can increase the number of firms she invites to join the RC. This also attracts better researchers and enlarges the pie.

Given that the organizer can attract researchers with \"high enough\" ability to perform the type of research proposed, individual firm profits can be increased by decreasing the number of member firms in the RC.

Pisano, Shan Ventures in an industry is significantly negatively correlated with the number of R&D active firms that perform basic research in that industry. 15 This result is consistent with our theoretical result given that we expect the proportion of R&D active firms that perform basic research to be highly correlated with our measure of \u03b1. Furthermore, with respect to the number of member firms, the simple correlation between the average number of member firms of RCs of an industry and the percentage of R&D active firms that perform basic research is also significantly negative. Although we admit that other factors are certainly important in the determination of the exact number of member firms of the RC, the consideration of autonomy for researchers does seem important in the decision of an individual firm whether to go it alone versus forming a RC with more partners. 16 The ability to attract scarce high ability researcher features prominently in this decision. More in depth empirical analysis on RCs will be necessary, however, in order to distinguish the effect of the appropriability conditions of an industry on the average number of member firms of a RC from our explanation. One would expect that \u03b1 is correlated with the appropriability conditions of the industry."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "Proposition 4 is also consistent with anecdotal evidence on longitudinal observations of specific industries.

In the development and growth phases of the industry, \u03b1 is high and close to one. During the maturation and decline phases, \u03b1 decreases over time. The evolution of \u03b1 over time is consistent with the recent trend where large corporations in the microelectronics and computer technology industry shift effort away from central R&D laboratories toward division-level effort with greater emphasis on risk minimization to meet the needs of today's customers (National Science Board (1992)). At the same time these corporations are shown to cooperate increasingly with competitors for more basic research projects. With respect to the Biotech industry Pisano, Shan and Teece (1988) note that \"...the distinction between basic research and applied development will likely become sharper as the technological paradigm matures and applied development becomes more focused on incremental innovation.\" As a result, we would expect to observe more cooperative ventures over time as the Biotechnology industry matures (see also Rosenberg and Nelson (1996) ). Sakakibara (1997) finds evidence that for Japanese RCs more tangible merits of the RCs are recognized by R&D managers in the projects whose target industry is \"emerging\".

The CEOs of Xerox have been able to resist the pressures from the divisions to reduce corporate R&D spending in favor of increasing the divisional budgets.

First, we need to show that the trade offs between control over the research projects and researcher ability are real and important. Secondly, we need to show that organizing a RC dominates other organizational forms such as internal R&D projects and funding university research.

MCC was envisioned to become an important source of long term industrial R&D. The member firms took responsibility for the ultimate commercialization of these research results. MCC's original organizational structure and resource allocation focused on research excellence. Inman realized that the key asset of the RC would be the ability of the researchers attracted to the RC: \"Early on it was recognized by Inman and the small group of advisors and colleagues he had assembled to help set up an administrative structure for MCC that the success or failure of the organization would depend on the quality of the personnel they would be able to attract. Without first-class brainpower no amount of shareholder funding would insure attainment of MCC's ambitious goals.\" (Murphy (1991) ).\nHowever, within the microelectronics and computer technology industry, congruence between researchers'and member firms' objectives is not likely to be very high. This implies that it is not likely that enough suitable candidates will be found in the industry or within the member firms for the type of research MCC was envisioning:\n\"Candidates from the shareholder companies were nominated and interviewed. The process...did not uncover enough people of sufficient quality to staff all the program director positions. As this became recognized, a modest parallel effort was under way that began looking outside the shareholders for suitable candidates....\" (George Black, first Vice President for Human Resources of MCC, quoted in Gibson and Rogers (1994) ).\nThe considerable amount of autonomy of MCC researchers and the availability of research funds combined with a state-of-the-art research facility attracted high ability researchers from all over the world.

In an effort to involve the member firms' divisions more directly with MCC's operation, authority for matters related to MCC was transferred to division level managers in the member firms, in the hope that they would value and use the research they were paying for. However, this shift in authority resulted in the division management pushing MCC to deliver more near term (1-3 years) research output. This organizational shift also accentuated the competition for R&D funds between MCC and in-house (division) research. The divisions expected MCC to deliver packaged technology. As a result, MCC researchers lost their funding and autonomy in choosing projects, exactly the reasons why they came to MCC.\nTurnover of research personnel increased from 3% under CEO Inman to 20% in the second phase under CEO Dove. The division level managers have a lower cost of monitoring the choice of research projects within MCC. This is because division managers usually have better information on which to base any choice of research projects that would fit into their division.\nAlternatively, less potential projects would fit within a specific division, which reduces the search costs for suitable research projects of the division manager compared to a CEO. The effect of these reduced monitoring costs (lower \u03b2) is derived in proposition 1 and 3. The propositions predict that the researchers at MCC are more likely to lose their autonomy in choosing projects because of these lower monitoring costs of the division managers.\nResearchers are unhappy about this change and high ability researchers leave MCC, increasing turnover during this phase and reducing average researcher ability at MCC.\nIn 1990, the third CEO of MCC, Craig Fields, took office. He started evaluating every MCC program as a separate profit center in order to increase the researchers' sensitivity towards the pressures of the business world. The result, however, was an all time high turnover rate of 30% in 1990:\n25 \"I don't know anybody who is still at MCC right now because they really like it, believe in its goals and think they are going to be there in five years,\" said former researcher Elaine Rich, who left the consortium last year after eight years there. \"That wasn't true five years ago. People were there nights and weekends doing their work. Morale is low because workers believe some research programs are in jeopardy and because they dislike many of the changes Fields made.\" (Austin American-Statesman, March 7, 1994) .\nA decrease in the congruence parameter \u03b1 could be the cause of this increase in turnover. The distance between the (new) objectives of the member firms and CEO on the one hand, and the researcher on the other hand, increased. As a result turnover increases dramatically (Proposition 3). To restore motivation, researchers at MCC were encouraged to spin off their technology whenever the member firms were not interested in commercializing the technology themselves. Turnover of research personnel stabilized around 17% after this What we learn from this story of organizational evolution at MCC is that the loss of This data could be obtained through questionnaires as in Olk (1997) and related to the number of member firms in the Research Corporation carefully controlling for industry effects. A second approach is related to the finance literature. Yermack (1996) and Eisenberg et. al.\n(1998) have found a significant negative relation between board size and firm value in a large sample of US and Finish firms respectively. An interesting partial test of this model would be to check whether firms that are more innovative also show this negative relationship. The model would predict that a larger board of directors provides the CEO with more autonomy to chose the direction of the company. This might be more important for innovative companies, where choice of the (research) projects is of strategic importance, compared to less innovative companies, which are managed based on financial criteria. Related to Rotemberg and Saloner (1993) , the choice of the CEO would be more important for these innovative companies relative to less innovative ones. The size of the board of directors would then determine how much of a commitment the choice of the CEO is for the firm. Small boards tightly control the CEO, while larger ones leave the CEO some more autonomy."}, {"section_title": "Appendix: Proofs of Propositions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Proof of Proposition 1", "text": "We know that the optimal investment by an individual member firm, i, is determined by:\nFrom the implicit function theorem we get:\nP is increasing and concave, G is increasing in \u03b8.

The solution in this case is:\nThus, at \u03b1 = 1, the optimal number of firms is\nWe are at the boundary of the feasible set [1, \u221e), where dRC/dn < 0. Given the continuity of the problem, in a neighborhood of \u03b1 = 1, increasing F has only a second order effect on the value of the objective function, while increasing the number of firms, n, has a first order effect. This implies that there exists an \u03b1* < 1, such that \u2200 \u03b1 > \u03b1* the optimal number of member firms in the RC is one. ideas and to focus on problems in depth, and (3) insure property rights protection (Kornberg (1995) ).\n11 Given that the RC performs a more basic type research for which it hires scientists, it might be impossible to write incentive contracts contingent on the benefits of the research projects.\nThis might be due to the non-contractible nature of the outcomes given the higher level of uncertainty or because of the time lag between effort of the scientists and the outcome, so that it is hard to attribute the outcome itself to the scientists involved. In more applied research, usually performed by engineers, it is often more feasible to write this type of incentive contracts. In the model it might be possible to interpret the parameter \u03b1 as a measure related to the contractability of the outcomes of research. If \u03b1 is close to 1, meaning that the objectives of the member firms and the researcher are more aligned, contractability might at the same time be less of an issue. As a result the RC is less likely to occur as an optimal organizational design, which is consistent with our results. Link et. al. (1996) mention for the case of Sematech that it was clear to all the parties involved that the intangible benefits of Sematech, such as benefits from research management, research integration and spillovers, were more important than the tangible direct benefits flowing from the research results. See also Anderson (1990) on the difficulties of assessing the performance of joint ventures in general and the inability to apply typical financial criteria and Sakakibara (1997) for a related account on Japanese RCs.\n12 If the probability that academic research creates business opportunities increases in the academic ability of the researcher, \u03b1'(\u03b8)>0, this result could be reversed. However, we do not believe that brilliant academic researchers necessarily have a better business sense but the value of their projects, in case of a hit, G(\u03b8), is assumed to be higher. 13 If the objectives of the member firms diverge, each individual member firm might have a stronger incentive to get informed about what the best project for its purpose would be in order to influence the decision of the board of directors. However, given that there is more than one member firm and each member firm has equal weight, the board has to vote on any change in project choice. The fact that the opinion of one member firm is only weighted according to her voting power, reduces the incentive of the member firm to invest in monitoring compared to the case where this member firm would be the sole participant in the project. The organization of a RC thus creates the same loss of control over the choice of research projects where the objectives of the member firms are not perfectly aligned.\n14 We assume that second order conditions for the problem are satisfied so that there exists an optimal number of firms and an optimal amount of investment for the RC (see Cassiman (1996) for details).\n15 I would like to thank Albert Link for generously providing this updated data set on firms that registered under the National Cooperative research act. This data set is described in more detail in Link (1996) . The number of firms performing R&D in an industry and the number of firms performing basic R&D in that industry were taken from the National Science Foundation Survey of Industrial Research and Development, 1996.\n16 Gatignon and Anderson (1988) find more generally that the key decision for multinationals' organizational entry mode for foreign subsidiaries is not the degree of control, but whether or not to share control with partners.\nengineering skills, and as a result, another type of researcher. Hence, the critical difference between MCC and SEMATECH lies in their Human Resource Management. MCC hires most of its own researchers, while SEMATECH, in contrast, receives most of its researchers on assignment from the member companies.\n20 Although the mission of MCC was clear at the time of its founding-cooperate at the basictechnology level and leverage R&D to provide long-term benefits to the microelectronics and computing industry and the nation-no project details had been decided on at the time when member firms were deciding to join. The specific project details would be filled in by the board of directors, assisted by the technical advisory board, the program directors and the researchers. The board of directors, however, remained in charge of the progress and direction of the research performed at MCC. 21 The semiconductor and computer companies were the ones that originally helped set up MCC. The major aerospace companies and conglomerates joined later. And, finally, the telecommunications companies signed up (Murphy (1991) ). 22 In a recent press release by MCC (March 9, 1998), a Texas Instruments' representative mentions that the main reason for TI to become a shareholder is that MCC has proven an effective way to complement their internal R&D resources. 23 The period we consider in this case is from 1983 until 1995. 24 Four out of nine of the program directors that started at MCC were recruited from university positions: Stanford University (2), University of Minnesota and University of Texas (Defense Electronics (June 1984), Gibson and Rogers (1994) )."}]
