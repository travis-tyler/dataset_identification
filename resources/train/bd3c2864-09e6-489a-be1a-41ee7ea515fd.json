However, the pathophysiological substrates of cognitive dysfunction leading up to the demented state remain only partially understood Williams-Gray et al., 2009; Winder-Rhodes et al., 2015 Yarnall et al., 2013) . In parallel with a recent shift towards early interventions and the prospect of disease-modification (e.g. immunotherapy and apomorphine) in non-demented PD (Yarnall et al., 2015) , there is an urgent need to identify surrogate markers to track disease progression and perform risk-stratification to improve patient enrolment in clinical trials.\nAt present, psychometric tests and severity rating scales (i.e. Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale, UDPRS) are the de facto standard for evaluating disease progression in PD. There is however increasing interest in adopting longitudinal neuroimaging techniques as adjunctive markers of disease progression with the expectation that MRI measurements may provide better sensitivity and precision than standard clinical measures (Jack et al., 2003; Nestor et al., 2008; Schott et al., 2005) . In this regard, advances in neuroimaging analyses have contributed to the validation of whole brain atrophy rates (Smith et al., 2002) as sensitive markers of disease progression in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Sluimer et al., 2010) , frontotemporal dementia (Knopman et al., 2009 ) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Fox and Freeborough, 1997) . In addition, ventricular enlargement has emerged as another viable surrogate but not non-specific marker of neurodegeneration in MCI and AD (Ferris et al., 2009; Jack et al., 2004; Nestor et al., 2008) .\nInstead of a mere proxy of widespread tissue loss, ventricular enlargement has been linked to a broad range of cognitive and memory deficits, reduced brain reserve against neurodegeneration (Cavedo et al., 2012) and decreased survival in dementia (Olesen et al., 2011) .\nPower calculations in MCI and AD have consistently shown that whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement would require far smaller sample sizes (approximately 3 -10 times reduction) compared to cognitive tests to show differences from controls (Jack et al., 2004; Ridha et al., 2008) . This has significant implications on the design of early-intervention and secondary prevention trials that are often hampered by subtle disease-related decline in the prodromal stages (i.e. weak effect sizes) and greater M A N U S C R I P T\nRegarding the comparisons between PD converters and PD stable , there were no significant differences in age, gender, education, UPDRS and duration of illness between both PD converters and PD stable . Although whole brain atrophy was numerically greater in PD converters (-0.5% \u00b1 0.7) compared to PD stable (-0.4% \u00b1 0.5), this difference was not significant (Student's T-Test; p=0.44), Cohen's d = 0.2). However, PD converters showed a significant increase in ventricular enlargement over 18 months compared to the PD stable group (Student's T-Test; p = 0.015, Cohen's d = 0.7) (Supplementary Figure 1) .\n\n\nMarkers of global atrophy in Parkinson's disease 17 al. (2013) study. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that cortical thickness has the greatest sensitivity to neurodegeneration in PD compared to other conventional structural MRI methods .\nInterestingly, when we stratified the PD subjects according to a median split of CSF A\u03b242, only the low CSF A\u03b242 group showed a significant association with both whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement and CSF tau and A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio (Supplementary Figure 2) . These findings also are in line with a recent tau PET study where the relationship between hippocampal [\n18 F]-AV1451 uptake and volume was only significant in amyloid-positive subjects (Wang et al., 2016) . These associations, confined to individuals with increased amyloid burden, collectively fit a model in which a pathological accumulation of amyloid is necessary before triggering a cascade of downstream neurodegeneration ). The precise mechanisms for this process are still unknown, although there is evidence that \u03b2-amyloid may convert tau into its neurotoxic form, leading to cellular dysfunction and eventually cell death (Bloom, 2014 )\nThe relationship between CSF \u03b1-synuclein levels and longitudinal atrophy has been relatively understudied (Campbell et al., 2015; Compta et al., 2014; Mattsson et al., 2013) . In our present study, CSF \u03b1-synuclein was not associated with whole brain atrophy nor ventricular enlargement. This runs counter to previous studies, where reductions in CSF \u03b1-synuclein have been shown to correlate with functional deficits in motor networks (Campbell et al., 2015) and frontal atrophy in non-demented PD . Interestingly, Compta and colleagues observed a reverse relationship in the PD-D group, where increased CSF \u03b1-synuclein was associated with atrophy in the parahippocampal gyrus and precuneus, both of which are commonly implicated in preclinical and established stages of dementia (Mak et al., 2016; Villemagne and Ch\u00e9telat, 2016) . However, the correlations did not persist after adjusting for CSF tau, suggesting that any effects of CSF \u03b1-synuclein may be mediated through tau . In agreement with our study, a previous analysis involving the ADNI cohort also found that baseline levels of CSF \u03b1-synuclein were not correlated to atrophy brain rates across the spectrum of normal aging, MCI and AD (Mattsson et al., 2013) . These findings, considered together with autopsyconfirmed reports of relatively preserved brain structure in Lewy body diseases (Nedelska et al., 2015) ,\nMarkers of global atrophy in Parkinson's disease 18 suggest that the effects of \u03b1-synuclein pathology may be mediated via cellular dysfunction and functional network disruption (Peraza et al., 2015; Rittman et al., 2016) . These are important questions that will be further addressed by the future development of PET radioligands for \u03b1-synuclein (Eberling et al., 2013) .\nMarkers of global atrophy in Parkinson's disease"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "Markers of global atrophy in Parkinson's disease 4 uncertainty that participants are on course for developing dementia (i.e. greater variance in measurements). As a result, these trials would require very long follow-up duration as well as large samples to detect any disease-modifying effects.\nTherefore, it is surprising that there are only limited studies investigating the utility of whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement in PD. While increased whole brain atrophy rates have been reported in PD-D compared to controls (Burton et al., 2005) , it remains to be established if MRI-derived measurements of global atrophy are sensitive to changes in a prodromal stage such as PD-MCI, and whether these measurements are feasible in a clinical trial targeting cognitive symptoms in PD. Ventricular enlargement has also been less studied in PD (Camicioli et al., 2011) despite its associations with both motor and cognitive impairment (Apostolova et al., 2012) .\nLevels of CSF markers have been shown to be promising candidate markers in AD (Blennow and Hampel, 2003; Frisoni et al., 2010) and more recently in PD (Kang et al., 2016) . Elucidating the potentially unique role of each CSF marker in the later events of neurodegeneration (i.e. structural atrophy) will have important implications for informing strategies targeting the underlying protein pathologies. In a pooled sample of PD patients, both CSF T-Tau and A\u03b2 levels have been cross-sectionally associated with lateral ventricular size (Beyer et al., 2013) , while there are only limited studies investigating the involvement of CSF markers and progressive atrophy in PD (Compta et al., 2013) .\nTo address the aforementioned gaps in the literature, we undertook a new study with three main objectives: (a) To investigate the suitability of global longitudinal measurements of brain volume (whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement) to monitor disease progression over 18 months in newlydiagnosed PD patients; (b) To evaluate the relationships between baseline CSF markers of neurodegeneration (\u03b1-synuclein, tau-protein)and structural changes on imaging using tensor-based morphometry; (c) To assess the impact of using MRI measurements on future clinical trials in nondemented PD patients by estimating the sample sizes needed to detect a 20 -50 % reduction in whole brain atrophy, ventricular enlargement and global cognition. \nMarkers of global atrophy in Parkinson's disease 6 was graded using a modified 0 to 2 rating scale as a measure of visuospatial function (Williams-Gray et al., 2009) . Language domain was assessed using the naming (0 -3) and sentence (0 -2) subsets of the MoCA test. All participants were assessed while they were on their usual dopaminergic medication at baseline and 18 months. Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) value was calculated using the Tomlinson et al formula (Tomlinson et al., 2010) . Global cognitive function was assessed using the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Dalrymple-Alford et al., 2010) . As our schedule of neuropsychological tests preceded the introduction of the MDS criteria for PD-MCI, we used a modified MDS Level II criteria as described previously (Lawson et al., 2016; Yarnall et al., 2014) , in that only one test (i.e. pentagon copying) was specific to the visuospatial domain. A subject was diagnosed as PD-MCI if he or she performed 1.5 standard deviations (SD) or more below appropriate norms (derived from controls) on at least two neuropsychological tests across five cognitive domains: attention, memory, executive function, language and visuospatial function. To reduce the number of comparisons, we derived a composite Z-Score for each domain based on the average of the Z-scores across the respective tests. Using this cut-off, 38 PD subjects were classified as PD-MCI while the remaining 66 PD subjects were classified as PD-NC. We classified participants as amnestic (n=26) or non-amnestic PD-MCI (n=12) at baseline. Amnestic participants were impaired in at least two tests across the five domains with at least one impaired memory test, while non-amnestic PD-MCI participants did not have impaired memory.\nMarkers of global atrophy in Parkinson's disease 13 ventricular enlargement were significantly increased in the PD-MCI group, particularly in patients with memory impairment. Secondly, both global imaging markers were associated with several cognitive domains as well as CSF markers of AD pathology. Finally, sample size calculations showed that MRI measurements would be more sensitive than neuropsychological assessments to detect treatment effects in clinical trial. These collective findings provide reasonable support for the use of imaging measurements as surrogate markers in early interventional trials that target cognitive aspects of PD.\nMarkers of global atrophy in Parkinson's disease\nMarkers of global atrophy in Parkinson's disease 20 lateral ventricle is the most consistently measured structure cash (Cash et al., 2015) . This reduction in variability is crucial for reducing sample sizes necessary to detect a treatment effect. Several potential limitations should be recognised. Subjects were assessed while taking their medication, which could influence cognitive function and CSF measures. To address this, we accounted for LEDD in all group comparisons and correlational analyses. In the cognitive battery we used, our assessment of visuospatial function was limited as we only had one representative test. However, the pentagon copying item of the MMSE has a high predictive value for the development of dementia in PD (Garcia-Diaz et al., 2014; Williams-Gray et al., 2007) . In addition, the magnitude of the correlations between imaging measures and cognitive domains were rather modest despite the statistical significance. Many factors contribute to cognitive decline. Some but not all of these will be expressed through differences in brain structure, in addition to which the imaging markers represent a greatly reduced dimensionality of patients' neural systems. Correction for multiple comparisons were not performed in this study due to the inter-correlated nature of the MDS cognitive domains, and should be replicated in independent cohorts. The extent and accuracy of longitudinal imaging measurements may be influenced by baseline volumes too. For instance, ventricular enlargement may be greater early in the disease when the baseline volume is smaller. However, the methods used in this paper are solely longitudinal, providing the amount of % change between scans but not the initial volume at baseline (Vrenken et al., 2014) . While SIENA/VIENA do not permit cross-sectional volumetric quantification, they use consecutive images at two time-points to estimate the local displacements between edges from serial images. This measurement has been shown to demonstrate high accuracy, high test-retest reliability as well as robustness against different scanner sequences (Smith et al., 2002) . Furthermore, the accuracy of VIENA is not affected by the initial ventricular volume (manually segmented) (Vrenken et al., 2014) . In addition to greater processing time and demands, volume-based quantification typically require MR images with good intensity contrasts between gray and white matter, which may be decreased in aging. Such requirements may not always be satisfied in large-scale clinical trials or are unavailable in retrospective studies from archived images."}, {"section_title": "METHOD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The Incidence of Cognitive Impairment in Cohorts with Longitudinal Evaluation-PD (ICICLE-PD) is a longitudinal observational study with two centres (Newcastle and Cambridge) to understand the disease mechanisms underlying the evolution of PD-D from disease onset .

The technical details have been described (Smith et al., 2007 (Smith et al., , 2002 .\nBriefly, for each individual subject, the baseline and follow-up brain images were aligned to each other using the skull images to constrain the registration scaling, and both brain images were then resampled into an intermediate halfway space with affine transformation. Next, tissue-type segmentation was carried out in order to locate brain/non-brain edge points. The displacement of the follow-up brain image compared to the baseline was calculated as the edge-point displacement perpendicular to the surface.\nFinally, the mean edge displacement across the whole brain was converted into a global estimate of percentage brain volume change (PBVC) between the two time-points (Figure 1 ). The quality of the registrations across time points, brain masks, and final outputs was then visually inspected while blinded to diagnostic group information, during which 5 subjects were excluded (1 healthy control, 2 PD-MCI and 2 PD-NC).

The technical details for this procedure have been described at length in the validation paper (Vrenken et al., 2014) . In summary, the average edge displacement was calculated on edge points along the ventricular boundaries. This step made use of a ventricular mask, in MNI152 space, of a single MS patient with exceptionally large ventricles. The ventricular mask was then linearly registered to each individual MRI. Finally, the average ventricular edge displacement between both timepoints was converted into a summary value (Figure 1 ).

Increased atrophy rates in non-demented PD have been reported in one study (Hu et al., 2001 ), but not in others (Burton et al., 2005; Guevara et al., 2016) . These differences are mostly ascribed to small sample sizes and heterogeneity in cognitive profiles, especially as PD-MCI was not distinguished from PD-NC. An earlier study that reported increased whole brain atrophy rates in PD involved a relatively small sample of PD patients (n = 8) who were impaired in memory and visuospatial functions (Hu et al., 2001) Similarly, it has been suggested that certain cognitive domains are more predictive of dementia than others. The 'Dual Syndrome Hypothesis' distinguishes a relatively stable fronto-striatal profile of impairment from 'posterior cortical' deficits (i.e. memory) that are associated with more pronounced cholinergic deficits and increased progression to dementia (Kehagia et al., 2012) . An important caveat is that 22/25 of our amnestic PD-MCI also had impairments in other domains (i.e. multi-domain impairment).\nFuture studies with larger sample sizes in each group (single-non-amnestic/amnestic and multi-domainnon-amnestic/amnestic) would be needed to clarify the neurodegenerative profile associated with each cognitive subtype of PD-MCI."}, {"section_title": "Ventricular enlargement is associated with conversion to PD-MCI", "text": "Longitudinal MRI studies may also be sensitive to early cognitive decline in PD-NC.

Whole brain atrophy was significantly associated with baseline and 18-month measurements of global cognition and memory, whereas ventricular enlargement showed additional correlations with multiple cognitive domains as well as motor features. These correlations are in broad agreement with previous studies in MCI and AD (Apostolova et al., 2010; Jack et al., 2004; O'Brien et al., 2001; Sluimer et al., 2008) Interestingly, ventricular enlargement was also associated with longitudinal changes in executive function, an early PD feature that is intimately linked with dopaminergic deficits in fronto-striatal networks (Foltynie et al., 2004; Janvin et al., 2005) .\nThese findings may suggest that ventricular enlargement, in addition to being a sensitive state marker, shows promise in staging cognitive decline, at least for those modulated by fronto-striatal deficits in early non-demented PD. Several reasons could account for the closer coupling of ventricular enlargement to a multitude of clinical features, an observation that has also been reported in a longitudinal multiple sclerosis study utilising both SIENA and VIENA (the same imaging techniques employed in this study) (Lukas et al., 2010) pathology from the brainstem to the cerebral cortex (Braak et al., 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Baseline CSF correlates of MRI measurements", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Markers of global atrophy in Parkinson's disease 16", "text": "The third objective of the study was to investigate these structural changes in relation to baseline CSF markers. Elevated CSF T-tau levels, rather than A\u03b242/A\u03b240, were correlated with increased percentage of whole brain atrophy. These findings are in broad agreement with the literature showing an association between CSF tau and brain morphological measures across PD (Beyer et al., 2013; Compta et al., 2012) , In our study, the correlations between ventricular enlargement and lower AB42/AB40 ratios are consistent with previous findings looking at CSF (Beyer et al., 2013; Ott et al., 2010) and [\n11 C]-PiB PET imaging studies (Sarro et al., 2016) . In one of the largest MRI analyses of the ADNI cohort, Chou and colleagues showed that ventricular enlargement correlated strongly with decreased CSF A\u03b242 across healthy controls, MCI and AD. However, the association of CSF tau with ventricular enlargement was less robust as it did not persist after adjusting for covariates such as age (Chou et al., 2009) . Similarly, we found that CSF tau was only tended to relate to ventricular enlargement. Ventricular enlargement, particularly of the temporal horn, could well be associated with adjacent atrophy in the medial temporal lobe -a preferential site of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation (Braak and Braak, 1995) . In the absence of in vivo localisation of tau pathology, we can only speculate that the CSF tau levels and measures of ventricular expansion may be regionally-specific (i.e. confined to the temporal horn) and therefore lost when we consider global percentage change over time. This suggestion also fits with our tensor-based findings showing an association between CSF tau levels and atrophy in overlapping regions of the temporal lobe.\nCould the relationships between CSF markers and MRI outcomes be influenced by amyloid status? As discussed, our study did not find an association between baseline CSF amyloid levels and longitudinal whole brain atrophy although another study did find a posterior pattern of cortical thinning in PD subjects with low CSF A\u03b242 levels (Compta et al., 2013) . These findings are not necessarily in conflict with each other as a dichotomised amyloid status reflects a cumulative marker of AD pathology, such that PD subjects with low CSF A\u03b242 values are more likely to be further on course to dementia. Methodological differences may also preclude direct comparisons as cortical thickness was investigated in the Compta et "}, {"section_title": "Lack of correlations between imaging changes and cognitive decline", "text": "The breadth of findings in this study provides reasonable support for the use of imaging measures in clinical trials of non-demented PD. However, despite evidence of correlations between whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement with cross-sectional cognitive domains and CSF markers, only ventricular expansion showed covariance with executive function over 18 months. This is surprising, as previous studies have reported correlations between both global MRI summaries and cognitive changes in PD-D and other neurodegenerative conditions (Camicioli et al., 2011; Jack et al., 2008; Knopman et al., 2009 ). Several explanations arise, including (a) the relatively stable trajectories or even minimal cognitive improvements in this PD cohort as well as other parkinsonian conditions (Guevara et al., 2016) ; (b) that the clinical assessments could fluctuate in response to other influences that are unrelated to disease progression; (c) greater cognitive reserve in highly functioning individuals may mask the underlying disease progression; (d) the length of follow-up could also be insufficient to detect cognitive decline, as other studies have reported negligible cognitive decline in non-demented PD subjects over 4 years (Aarsland et al., 2004) ; (e) that our sample was evaluated while taking dopaminergic medication, which has been associated with both beneficial and adverse effects on executive function in PD (Cools et al., 2001; Molloy et al., 2006) . This is by no means an exhaustive list of factors that could influence the variability in clinical and cognitive measurements, but it does highlight the value of using adjunctive imaging markers in clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Impact of MRI outcomes on clinical trials", "text": "Consistent with other studies in MCI and AD (Jack et al., 2003; Ridha et al., 2008) , we found that using cognitive testing (MMSE) as a trial end point would require significantly more patients to detect the same degree of treatment-related slowing of decline compared to MRI measures. Nevertheless, the effect size on a clinical scale may be differentially consequential compared to an equivalent change on MRI (i.e. a M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "20% reduction in MMSE decline may be more clinically meaningful compared to the same degree of reduced atrophy rates. Therefore, we recommend that neuroimaging should still be used in conjunction with cognitive assessments in trials designed to evaluate disease progression and the effectiveness of disease modifying treatments. Several studies have found that approximately 35 -100 AD and 100 -200 MCI patients are necessary to detect a 25% reduction in brain atrophy (Beckett et al., 2010; Ho et al., 2010; Hua et al., 2010; Nestor et al., 2008) . Our findings extend these reports to PD-MCI, a condition for which there are currently no disease-modification trials. Assuming a clinical trial design with 18 months of follow up and a 20% absolute reduction in volume loss, the required sample sizes for whole brain atrophy (n = 186) and ventricular enlargement (n = 223) are larger than previous estimates in AD (n = 115; Fox et al., 2000) , in line with the milder atrophy seen in PD or PD-D relative to AD (Beyer et al., 2007; Burton et al., 2004; Mak et al., 2015a) . Nevertheless, these numbers are not prohibitive in terms of logistics and cost, particularly for secondary preventive trials in PD-MCI patients. Furthermore, the relationships of both imaging outcomes with AD pathologies -not alpha-synuclein -suggest that patients with Lewy body diseases might stand to benefit from interventions directed against amyloid and tau pathologies. This will no doubt be a topic for important validation using in vivo PET imaging of amyloid and tau in Lewy body diseases (Gomperts, 2016; Kantarci et al., 2016; Sarro et al., 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "The main strength of this prospective cohort study is its longitudinal follow-up of an incident cohort allowing correlation of longitudinal global atrophy in PD with cognitive function. The comprehensive analyses of CSF enabled the investigation of the differential correlation of each CSF marker to longitudinal atrophy, an area of research that is currently understudied in PD. We used validated approaches to measure longitudinal global changes which reduces inter-subject variability as each subject serves as his or her own control (Smith et al., 2007; Vrenken et al., 2014) . There are several practical benefits associated with global summaries particularly in the context of large-scale clinical trials.\nThese measurements are fully automated, fast (20 -30 minutes per subject), and they have been shown to demonstrate high accuracy, high test-retest reliability as well as robustness against different scanner sequences (Smith et al., 2002) .

These MRI markers could be used to enrich for patient cohorts for clinical trials of disease modifying therapies as more aggressive profiles of whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement are associated with individuals who are more likely to demonstrate a significant cognitive decline over the course of a clinical trial. Indeed we have further shown that using both global MRI markers would require much smaller sample sizes for trials compared to neuropsychological assessments to detect an equivalent degree of treatment effects. However further studies are needed to show the utility of this approach using independent cohorts of patients.
