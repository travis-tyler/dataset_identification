[{"section_title": "", "text": "temporary appointments that have become a near-ubiquitous career waypoint for freshly minted PhDs. This is in contrast to the academic market of the 1970s . The rapid growth in demand for postdocs was almost entirely met by an influx of international PhDs moving to the United States specifically to fill the need (Garrison, 2005). However, the increase in demand for labor apparently had no effect on more permanent, tenured and tenure-track faculty positions (Blume-Kohout, 2012). Economists are coming to believe that the life science labor market may be saturatedproviding a career path where scientists forfeit significant earnings for tenuous career prospects . Given that trainees have become a primary engine of research in the lab-focused biomedical education system, universities may be motivated to overproduce scientists. Biomedical students graduating in the late seventies 2 had an approximate 30% chance of receiving a tenure-track position by 1985. This dropped to 20% for students graduating in the late eighties and surveyed in 1995 (Committee on Dimensions, 1998). Where increased biomedical science investment was expected to create long-term job opportunities within these fields, it may not be doing so. For the group of elite 1992-1994 National Research Service Award (NRSA) winners it yielded little career assistance (Levitt, 2010). As of 2010, more than a decade after their graduations, only approximately 25% of those students had achieved tenure at a university. That trend has continued and the biomedical labor market still struggles to absorb fully-trained biomedical scientists into full-time and tenure-track faculty research positions . The changing life science labor market may alter job prospects at every level. While established end-career prospects may motivate students to matriculate, funding opportunities also determine enrollment. Garrison et. al. (2005) found that the number of research assistants funded by the NIH held steady from 1995 through 2000 -the beginning of the NIH budget doubling. In contrast, we found that the number of RAs was already increasing in that time period. The appearance of declining employment rates in the biomedical sciences elicits concerns over institutional stewardship of the future biomedical workforce. Do universities care about the ultimate placement of their graduates? Do funding institutions realize that the current system may be preparing the majority of graduate students, given that most are hoping for a tenured career in academia, for undesired career outcomes? The NIH Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD) Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group recently issued a report addressing the NIH's understanding of these issues. NIH administration seems to recognize the current state of the life science labor market and the task force ultimately recommends limits on the number of funding years  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010 Fellowships and Traineeships Research Assistantships 4 available to each student and a move from RA grants to training grants: the better to guide and homogenize training quality across institutions (Tilghman, 2012). At the institutional level it may be more difficult to coordinate enrollment based on the job market. Institutions are given to supplementing or withdrawing graduate student funding counter-cyclically to the National Institutes of Health (Ehrenberg, 1993). Present concerns about the over-production and the quality of biomedical scientists come on the heels of a pervasive historical fears that the United States is underproducing in the sciences. Rising Above the Gathering Storm, a report from the National Research Council, paints a global landscape in which the United States is falling behind other nations in scientific education, research, and productivity (2005). Should we fail to remain competitive, the report argues, the United States will de-facto sacrifice economic and political status to other nations. This paper extends research which has previously primarily focused on undergraduates, into the market for PhD-trained workers. Whether graduate students, and specifically those in life sciences, choose graduate training in response to current or future expected future labor market conditions has yet to be firmly established. Degrees in biomedical science appear so specialized, and require such a sacrifice of early career earnings, that it begs the question whether students who have chosen to study in these fields are doing so out of a natural affinity for the subject or the non-pecuniary benefit, rather than simply a desire to maximize their lifetime earnings. Other graduate degrees, such as the MBA, require a shorter time investment in education to produce greater expected lifetime earnings. Furthermore, since pursuit of a PhD is a long-term career investment, often in excess of five years, market conditions at graduation may be vastly different from market conditions at the time of enrollment. In an ideal labor market, students considering a graduate degree would make informed decisions based on their best understanding of their future career prospects including inherent non-pecuniary benefits. While changes in graduate and undergraduate enrollment are broadly a function of population growth, there are important policy questions to be addressed in short-term enrollment trends. It is generally accepted that the university has acted within the labor market as a refuge from down economies for undergraduates. A workforce facing high unemployment rates or low wages will return to the university (Betts and McFarland, 1995). While we are measuring the macroeconomic determinants of graduate biomedical matriculation, we also take into account other influences, such as the availability of funding. Previous research has found that interest rates affect the attractiveness of school to potential students (Dellas and Koubi, 2003) and the sources of funding available to a student affect his or her ability to complete a degree (Ampaw, 2010). Cohort size has also proven to be important. An influx of foreign students into a given field will result in lower wages and employment rates within that field (Borjas, 2006). Students, undergraduates especially, have proven themselves to be vulnerable to business cycles and to be rational actors in the labor market (Dellas and Sakellaris, 2003 To generate the biomedical scientist average wage time-series, we followed the occupation classification from the recent NIH Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD) task force report. These occupations are detailed in Table 1. The average wage for each year is a weighted average, where the weights are determined by the number of 9 people in that occupation code, relative to the total sum of employees across all biomedical sciences occupations. In Figure 2 we see that biomedical salaries began to grow more quickly just as the NIH budget doubling came to an end. There was also a spike in biomedical science compensation around 2001, in the middle of the NIH program of expansion.  Classification system code (SOC), and used these shares to estimate a weighted average salary by year for bachelor's degree holders across these alternative occupations."}, {"section_title": "NSF-NIH Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering", "text": "We use the NSF-NIH Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates (GSS) to estimate the number of students entering U.S. biomedical sciences degree programs each year.

The survey collects data on partand full-time enrollment, student demographics, and students' sources of financial support.

"}, {"section_title": "II.B. Models", "text": "As discussed by Freeman (1976) and others, markets for highly-skilled labor are subject to substantial \"production lag,\" where labor supply is largely predetermined by entry into training programs several years prior. We use both cobweb and forwardlooking analyses in order to determine whether students are reacting to present-day conditions or attempting to forecast the future job market. The cobweb-type models make the assumption that present-day, time t enrollment is determined by present-day, time t market conditions. Participants in this labor market are committing to participation in a labor market for which they have no more indication of wage rates than the present wage rate (Hoy, 2001). In contrast, forward-looking models assume that students in time t are attempting, with some success, to predict wages and employment at the time they will be entering the market, time t+d. Here, we begin by estimating the supply of new entrants into biomedical sciences graduate programs, as follows: GradEnter AltSalary BioSalary GradEnter (1) Equation 1 (2) If students have \"cobweb\" expectations, then their expectation for BioSalary t+d would simply be the current salary for biomedical scientists, BioSalary t , and likewise their expectation for AltSalary t+d would be AltSalary t . Likewise, their expectations regarding future job growth may depend on current changes in employment levels for biomedical scientists, BioEmp. We test these alternative assumptions about students' expectations empirically. One difficulty with the formulations in equations (1) and (2) above, as discussed by Ryoo & Rosen (2004), is that they do not control for exogenous year-to-year changes in cohort size that could affect the number of students completing college, and thus eligible to enter PhD programs (i.e., supply shifters). We therefore also consider the following relative supply model: In this specification, the dependent variable represents the share of students who graduated with bachelor's degrees in biology or chemistry in year t and went on to enter graduate programs in biomedical science fields in the following academic year. The explanatory variable is the relative financial prospects at graduation, in year t+d, for a student who completes a PhD in biomedical sciences, versus the wages paid for those majors' alternative career paths. If we presume that all workforce outcomes for biomedical sciences PhDs are considered by prospective students-including non-science-related and non-research jobs-then the correct measure for students' expected income at graduation is the average entry-level wage for a biomedical sciences PhD, regardless of his or her occupation, as we calculate from the SDR data. On the other hand, if new PhDs are taking non-research and non-science-related jobs due to an excess labor supply that depresses entry-level wages in biomedical sciences research occupations, then only the wages in those specific positions are relevant. This latter specification is somewhat more attractive for our market model, as these wages are the relevant prices for the demand side of the market. However, in that case, the rational expectations labor supply model should also include a measure of the stock of biomedical sciences researchers as well. We explore each of these specifications empirically, below. Again, ignoring for simplicity any additional signals a student may receive during his or her d years of graduate training that might affect expectations of future salaries, the number of biomedical sciences PhDs supplied to the market at time t, Grad t , is then determined mainly by GradEnter t-d : In equation 4above, we expect the term \uf066 1 will be less than one, reflecting usual attrition from doctoral programs. We also add additional terms to assess whether increases in the proportion of students funded by NIH research assistantships, traineeships, or fellowships impacts timely PhD completions. The outcome variable Grad t shows the influx of new PhDs into the labor supply that year. Like equation 3, this equation can also be expressed in relative terms, to avoid supply-side shift effects like changes in cohort size. We can interpret \uf0a0\uf020 \uf06e \uf06c as the impact of changes in the availability of NIH support for students in each year of their PhD program on their probability of completing the PhD within d years. A significant negative coefficient would imply that an increase in NIH support for students during that year of a given cohort's graduate training actually decreases the six year completion rate for the cohort. When first-differencing the variables as in the empirical analyses below, the coefficient represents the effect of acceleration in NIH spending in any given year on the rate of PhD completion. In the empirical analysis, we also investigate variations on equation 5  In this representation, the dependent variable is the log relative wage for biomedical scientists, and BioEmp t is the total number of biomedical scientists employed at time t. The demand-shifters are total NIH obligations for R&D in year t, NIHRnD t , representing demand for postdoctoral workers in academia and government, and estimated annual pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry R&D expenditures, PharmaRnD t , to represent demand in industry. As usual, we expect the sign on \uf071 1 will be negative, reflecting that an increase in labor market supply will, all else equal, reduce  The term \uf0a0\uf020\u02c6 \uf072\uf020 is the sample correlation coefficient, estimated from the residuals: Because the correlation coefficient is bounded between -1 and 1, where -1 is perfect negative autocorrelation and 1 is perfect positive correlation, the d statistic will be approximately 2 when there is no autocorrelation, will approach zero when autocorrelation is strongly positive, and will approach 4 when autocorrelation is strongly negative. Durbin and Watson (1951) "}, {"section_title": "25", "text": "The original Durbin-Watson test assumes strict exogeneity of the regressors, which precludes its use in autoregressive models like that in equation (1). In models such as that, where lagged values of the dependent variable are included among the explanatory variables, the d statistic will be biased towards 2 and thus we may fail to reject the null of no autocorrelation, even when autocorrelation is present. Durbin (1970) presented a more general alternative test that permits lagged dependent variables, and also assesses presence of higher-order autocorrelation."}, {"section_title": "Instrumental Variables (IV) Estimation", "text": "Structural market models, such as the supply and demand equations we estimate Empirically, one approach to estimating simultaneous equations is two-stage least squares (2SLS) IV. To implement 2SLS IV estimation for the labor supply equation, we need to find one or more instruments that are highly correlated with biomedical scientists' wages, but are otherwise uncorrelated with unobserved factors affecting the number of students enrolling in (or completing) PhD programs in biomedical sciences. Ryoo and Rosen (2004) employ the third and fourth lags of public and private defense R&D spending relative to total GDP, which they argue reflect changes in demand that 26 only affect supply of bachelor's-degree engineers through their prospective wages. For us, NIH R&D as a share of total GDP would be analogous, but empirically we find that public (NIH) R&D funding is in fact a strong predictor of supply as well as demand, and therefore does not assist in resolving the identification problem. This relationship between our nominal \"demand shifter\" NIH funding and graduate student enrollments can be seen very clearly in Figure 8, below."}, {"section_title": "Figure 8: Relative Enrollment and Relative NIH Funding", "text": "In the analyses that follow, we therefore instrument for wages using only the third and fourth lags of pharmaceutical industry R&D expenditures, relative to GDP. The relevance of industry R&D expenditures to market wages is tested via the partial F-statistic for the excluded instruments in the first stage regression. To maximize the number of usable observations in our time series given restrictions on available data, we employ the PhRMA estimated R&D expenditures as instruments, and use the BEA pharmaceutical R&D estimates as the explanatory variable for our demand equations."}, {"section_title": "Overid Testing", "text": "In addition to the relevance condition-that industry R&D expenditures must be correlated with the endogenous regressor, market wage-industry R&D expenditures must also satisfy the exogeneity condition. That is, industry R&D expenditures can only be correlated with graduate student enrollment and completions via the price mechanism (wages). When the system is overidentified, meaning the number of exogenous instrumental variables exceeds the number of problematic endogenous variables, we can use the Sargan or Hansen tests of overidentifying restrictions (\"overid tests\") to assess whether evidence supports exogeneity of the instruments. Overid tests essentially construct alternative models using subsets of the instruments so that the system is \"just-identified,\" meaning there are only as many instruments as there are regressors, and then compare the residuals. If the overid test statistic exceeds its critical value, this can be interpreted either as evidence that one or more of the instruments is correlated with the error term (so is not exogenous after all), or possibly that the omitted instruments actually belong in the second-stage regression and our equation is misspecified (see Davidson and McKinnon (2004), p. 336-338). Using Hansen's J-statistic, we are testing the null hypothesis that all of the instrumenting variables are valid. If the critical value associated with this test is large relative to the chi-squared random variable, and significant at the .05 or .10 significance level, then we reject the null hypothesis."}, {"section_title": "III. RESULTS", "text": "In this section we summarize the results of econometric regressions used in this paper. We have used time-series data to create OLS and IV models which provide some insight into the responsiveness of graduate students to macroeconomic inputs. The conclusions resulting from these estimations, combined with descriptive statistics, help to map the realities of the biomedical workforce."}, {"section_title": "Models of the Supply of Biomedical Scientists", "text": "We begin with basic OLS regression to see if graduate students in biomedical fields express rational expectations in the labor market. Models (1) and (2) in Table 3 (1) and (2) is the log of the number of students entering PhD programs in biomedical sciences. Outcome variable for models (3) and (4) is the log of the ratio of the number of students entering PhD programs to the number of Bachelor's degrees earned in biological sciences and chemistry. Wages and employment variables for model (1) are six-year leads, reflecting expected market conditions at time of graduation with perfect foresight (rational expectations). Models (2)-(4) use current wages and employment levels (cobweb expectations). Models (3) and (4) use the log of the ratio of wages for biomedical sciences vs. alternative career fields, and the log of the ratio of employment in biomedical sciences occupations vs. alternative career fields. In model (4), all variables are first-differenced to mitigate autocorrelation. All equations are estimated using OLS, and fully robust standard errors are reported in parentheses below each coefficient estimate. Autocorrelation seems to be resolved by first-differencing all of the variables. However, the explanatory variables of wage and employment remain insignificant. Least there be simultaneity from the two independent variables, we run a first-differenced cobweb model, model (1) in table 4, with only log relative wage as the independent variable. This regression provides us with a unit-elastic result for wage (p<.1). Using the same variables as model (1), we switch to IV regression for model (2). This should help address any endogeneity that may have been an issue in the wage variable. IV regression reveals a wage elasticity of 3, (p<0.1). When we add lagged variables of wage and employment in model (3), now calculating PhD completions instead of entrants, we find a similar elasticity on wage which is also significant. This indicates that labor supply is highly responsive to changes in wage. Model 4exchanges the present-day wage calculation for a lagged NIH funding variablethe effect of logged, relative, first-differenced NIH funding of students in time period t-6 on present-day logged, relative, first-differenced completions. Employment at time t-6 is very significant (p<.001), indicating that a 1% change in the first-difference of employment results in an .87% change in the first-difference of completions. The lagged wage variable is not significant at allindicating that students may care more about their prospect of getting a job than they do about the wage they will earn. The NIH funding variable is also very significant (p<.001), and it is negative. A 1% increase in the change in NIH funding at the time of enrollment actually has a 1.4% negative effect on the  (1) and 2are first-differenced logs of the ratios of firsttime graduate student enrollment in biomedical sciences PhD programs, over total Bachelor's degrees in biological sciences and chemistry that year. Outcome variables for models (3) and (4) are logs of the ratio of PhDs completed over the sixth lag of Bachelor's degrees. Table 5, model (1) once again raises the issue of simultaneity. The dynamic OLS regression produces strong significance on each of the four variables included, the negative coefficient on present-day log relative wage has returned. This implies that an increase in the relative wage for biomedical scientists of 1% decreases PhD completions by 2%, (p<.001). Two other variables in the model are more predictable, with employment and NIH Funding both being highly significant. Students will complete their PhD more quickly with the possibility of a job and they will complete it in a less timely manner if they enrolled at a time of NIH funding expansion. Model (2) returns to IV regression, using the exact same variables from model (1), but the first-stage partial F-statistic is unimpressive. The instrumented variable in this model is the lagged relative PhD completions variableindicating that instruments do a better job of predicting quantity than price. IV models (3) and (4) provide very strong results. This is most likely a result of the reduction in the number of observations, in addition to the time period over which they span. NIH obligations and industry R&D are the instruments for employment in this model. The observations in these two models cover the years 2006 through 2010a period which follows the NIH budget expansion years when Congress was no longer emphasizing biomedical research. Whereas the NIH was a significant driver the labor market in the past, when budget growth stopped other variables were given the opportunity to become influentialincluding industry R&D. The partial F-statistic for models (3) and (4) are very good compared to previous estimations. Both models indicate that scientist supply is very responsive to changes in wages. Model (3) controls for the availability of NIH student support at matriculation, producing a significant coefficient nearly identical to that from table 4, model (4). The story remains that students who enroll in the midst of NIH support growth are less likely to graduate in a timely manner. Model (4) finds something unique to previous NIH support coefficients in this paper. Students who are in the middle of their biomedical studies when the NIH begins an expansion are more likely to graduate. For a 1% increase in the change in the proportion of NIH students funded in year 3 of their PhD program, there will be a 1.2% increase in the six-year completion rate (p<.001).  The outcome variable for model (1) is the logged first-difference of wages within biomedical sciences. The outcome variable in model (2) is the log of first-differenced biomedical employment. All independent variables in equations (1) and (2) are first-differenced and logged. NIH R&D Obligations at time t and Industry R&D at time t-1 are both relative variableseach divided by GDP."}, {"section_title": "Models of the Demand for Biomedical Scientists", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "IV. CONCLUSIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "IV.A. Policy Implications", "text": "This research finds that graduate biomedical students take wages and employment levels into consideration when they are deciding whether or not to pursue a PhD. We find that the most significant influence on matriculation is the level of National Institutes of Health funding available. A matriculated student is not, however, a future graduate. NIH funding ironically lures life science students into graduate school while simultaneously decreasing their chances of success. It may be that the allure of extra funding opportunities is too strongdrawing insufficiently prepared students into biomedical science. In the first-differenced cobweb OLS model, we found positive unit-elastic wage significance upon enrollment. A one percent increase in wages would result in a one percent increase in enrollments. Using IV cobweb, first-differenced models, we found some significance in relative wages. We find robust evidence that elasticity of labor supply (as measured by PhD enrollment and completions) with respect to relative wages, whether at time of entry to the PhD program or at time of completion, has an elasticity of about 3. This implies that labor supply is highly responsive: a 1% increase in relative wages would result in a 3% increase in relative employment. It is using IV cobweb firstdifferencing that we first see negative effect of NIH funding on completions. An inverse demand function reveals a very significant, negative effect of employment on salary. In a regular demand function, NIH R&D obligations are revealed to be very significant and unit elastic. The findings around NIH R&D funding are the most significant results of this research. This contributes to previous literature in the field indicating that discretion in the use of NIH funding for student aid is vital. Figure 8 indicates that students are highly responsive to the availability of funding when deciding whether to enroll. Figure 7 shows that the early availability of NIH funds in a student's graduate career may delay or altogether prevent graduation. The NIH is right to have begun the research into graduate careers that began with the NIH Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD) Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group. Our results would indicate that the NIH can get the most from their human capital investments by restricting the years of graduate school in which NIH funding is available. If this funding were to be given to students beginning only in year 3 of their graduate school career, it might reduce excess enrollment of the unqualified while increasing completions. The NIH may, however, consider other strategies. If they wish to increase the overall quality of graduating students, the NIH may choose to continue funding students early in their careersluring a greater number of applicants -under the assumption that only the brightest will complete, increasing the graduate pool from which scientists are made."}, {"section_title": "IV.B. Limitations", "text": "The most significant results from this paper have come from simple correlations. Figure 8 shows a very significant relationship between NIH funding and enrollment. The econometric regressions run in this paper are hampered by the restricted availability of data -caused by the career code reclassifications in Bureau of Labor Statistics data which occurred in 1998. Our results, however, are in line with those produced in similar research. It is possible that these methods could be applied with an expanded dataset in the future, yielding similarly significant results around the importance of wages and employment rates. Ryoo and Rosen (2004) find a similar wage elasticity, between 2.5 and 4.5, in their research on engineering graduate students. Freeman (1974), Ryoo & Rosen (2004), and the research presented in this paper all found a greater relevance in cobweb expectation models. This would indicate that students may be less forward-looking in their decision making than they are responsive to present-day conditions."}, {"section_title": "IV.C. Summary and Directions for Future Research", "text": "This paper was unable to conduct an analysis of demographic responses to macroeconomic matriculation incentives. The data would indicate that race and gender have some effect on the types of occupations that students will ultimately work in. Future research should seek to understand the effect of race and gender on responsiveness to macroeconomic variables. It would also be ideal for these same analyses to be conducted with alternate wage data. The Survey of Doctoral Recipients could provide an alternate source of wage data for scientists working in biomedicine. Finally, a larger time series is needed in order to lend greater significance to these wage and employment results. In 15 43 or 20 years these analyses might be repeated, creating greater insight into the significance of wages and employment upon matriculation. In the meantime, the National Institutes of Health and other graduate student funding sources would do well to carefully examine the mechanisms and timelines by which they will assist potential and current students."}]
