According to the latest neuroimaging standards, CSVD include white matter hyperintensities (WMH), dilated perivascular space (dPVS), microbleeds (MBs) and lacune [1, 2] . There are evidences that they often cooccur and presence of them can increase the future risk of cognitive decline and dementia [3, 4] . Although mechanisms underlying association between CSVD and cognition are unclear, previous studies hypothesized that cerebral small-vessel burden may expedite progression of cognitive-related diseases through promoting accumulations of amyloid depositions or increasing vulnerability to these pathology [5] [6] [7] . Another known risk factor for age-related cognitive decline is in the APOE gene loci. It is known that APOE is involved in modulating the metabolism and accumulation of amyloid depositions [8, 9] . However, the precise mechanisms underlying its relationship with the risk of cognitive deficits are also not fully understood.\nClarifying the relationship between APOE genotype and CSVD could provide important clues to the mechanisms underlying the cognitive impairment. Notably, two high-quality meta-analyses reported inconsistent results regarding the association between APOE \u03b52/\u03b53/\u03b54 genotypes and CSVD in older adults. The work of Paternoster et al. (24 studies, n=8546) suggested there was no evidence of association between APOE \u03b54 allele and WMH [10] . Whereas meta-analysis of Schilling et al. ( 11 studies, limited to use continuous WMH burden, n=8917) displayed that APOE e4 carrying was significantly associated with increased WMH and presence of MBs, and APOE \u03b52 allele was significantly related with increasing WMH load [11] . Notably, most studies selected in these meta-analyses are cross-sectional and performed in patients with dementia, depression or other diseases, these limitations may contribute to the discrepancy. Thus, longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether different APOE genotypes are associated with CSVD in the general population. Moreover, studies examining neuropathologic correlates of CSVD and their association with APOE genotypes could also help in understanding the pathophysiologic link between APOE and CSVD.\nThe current longitudinal study is aim to dissect the relationship between APOE genotype and CSVD in a two-years cohort of healthy elderly from ADNI database, and to explore whether there are interactions between APOE and CSVD lead to cognitive decline. Specifically, in three time points, lobar distribution of WMH volume was quantified, dPVS were observed in the basal ganglia (BG) and white matter (WM) region, and number of MBs and lacune was calculated. Besides, dementiarelated neuropathologic biomarkers measured by CSF or neuroimaging were also taken into consideration in this study. First, we predicted that e4 allele was associated with formation and progression of WMH, especially in brain regions with perilous blood supply. Second, we hypothesized that the synergy between \u03b54 allele and CSVD can exert long term detrimental effects on cognition."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographics, behavioral and CSF data", "text": "An overview of demographic variables, behavioral performance and CSF data is presented in Table 1 .

Moreover, our results showed APOE \u03b54 carriers had decreased CSF A\u03b2 level and increased PET-PiB SUV in frontal lobe relative to controls. On the one hand, physiological interpretations of our observations may be that the vulnerability of frontal WM to ischemic condition [20, 21] . We noted that most frontal WMH is distributed around the anterior periventricular horn. Studies have found a watershed area around the periventricular region where blood supply is perilous. To be specific, anastomoses in this area are scarce and arterioles are tortuous, thus making the WM in anterior periventricular horn extra vulnerable to hypoperfusion and small vessel disease [22] . On the other hand, APOE \u03b54 allele is associated with aggregation of A\u03b2 protein and decreased clearance of A\u03b2 deposition relative to \u03b53 or \u03b52 allele [23, 24] . According to latest studies, possible mechanisms include \u03b54 allele is associated with sleep disorders [25] , further, lead to impaired glymphatic clearance and suppressed clearance of soluble amyloid deposits [26] [27] [28] [29] . As a result, relatively increased A\u03b2 deposition in \u03b54 carriers may damage arterial wall and reduce vessel lumen, leading to chronic hypoperfusion [30] . Taken together, we speculated that perilous blood supply in frontal lobe and accumulation of mis-folded protein aggregates jointly contribute to formation of WMH.\nLongitudinally, we found progression of frontal WMH volume in APOE \u03b54 group was also significantly faster than the two other groups. These results suggested APOE \u03b54 allele has long-term detrimental effects on formation of WMH, especially in frontal lobe, even in non-demented individuals. We assumed significantly increased frontal WMH burden in \u03b54 carriers at baseline may explain these results. On its own, WMH burden could reflect worse cerebral vascular condition, as studies has pointed out that WMH is correlated with reduced cerebral perfusion both inside WMH area and areas of normal appearing WM (i.e., penumbra) [31] . In these normal appearing WM areas surrounding WMH, many DTI studies have reported subtle damage already exists [32, 33] . These penumbra regions with tortuous blood vessel and subtle microstructural damage can easily develop into future WMH areas. Meanwhile, studies of hemodynamics further reported that the size of ischemic penumbra was larger than the one assessed by microstructural modalities, suggesting WMH is progressively spreading to normal appearing WM, and putting more WM tracts at risk [34] . Moreover, our results showed that decreased A\u03b2 1-42 level and increased PET-PiB SUV of frontal lobe at baseline were also significantly related with progression of frontal WMH volume. These may suggest A\u03b2 deposition of subjects have a long-term effect on the formation of WMH. Consistent with our hypothesis, results in this part suggested carrying \u03b54 allele was associated with WMH in non-demented subjects. We speculated that a combination of perilous blood supply in anterior periventricular horn and aggravated chronic hypoperfusion (result from increased A\u03b2 deposition in APOE \u03b54 carriers) caused Figure 3 : Severity scores of dPVS in the BG. Specifically, dPVS severity is rated 1 when there were <5 dPVS (A), rated 2 when there were 5~10 dPVS (B), rated 3 when there were >10 dPVS but the number is still countable (C), and rated 4 when the number is uncountable (D). www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget increased frontal WMH at baseline. Subsequently, these frontal WMHwould continuously expand owe to deteriorated cerebral vascular condition.\nCorrelation analyses showed that in \u03b54 carriers, baseline and progression of frontal WMH volume was related with declining trend of cognition in \u03b54 carriers. Furthermore, GLM indicated factors impacting MMSE ranking were the interaction between APOE \u03b54 allele and frontal WMH volume, independent to vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and smoking history) and other CSVD (Table 2 ). Previous studies have found the correlation of reduced WM integrity in frontal lobe with cognitive decline [35, 36] . In particular, previous anatomical studies suggested the fronto-subcortical circuit play a critical part in the cognitive process such as planning and execution of self-generated novel action [37, 38] . Thus, we assumed that the significantly increased frontal WMH volume in non-demented \u03b54 carriers, which Figure 4 : Severity scores of dPVS in the WM. Specifically, dPVS severity is rated 1 when there were <10 dPVS in total (A), rated 2 when there were >10 PVS in total but no more than 10 dPVS in a single section (B), rated 3 when there were 10~20 dPVS in the section containing the greatest number of dPVS (C), and rated 4 when there were >20 dPVS in any single section (D). www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget partially reflected the disruption of fronto-subcortical WM circuit, caused the damage to general cognition. These results were in line with our hypothesis that e4 allele can activate WMH to exert long-term detrimental effects on subjects' cognition."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between APOE and dPVS", "text": "In this section, our results showed that dPVS in BG area was increased in APOE \u03b54 carriers relative to controls, but there were no differences in WM dPVS or progression of dPVS. Previous studies have found that WM-dPVS is more closely related to A\u03b2 accumulation and CAA pathology [39] , while BG-dPVS preferentially associated with hypertension [40] . However in our study, there were no significance increases in WM-dPVS in APOE \u03b54 group where we presumed the A\u03b2 accumulation should be more prominent. According to the evidence that dPVS is closely related to the severity of WMH [41] , we thus assumed that increased BG-dPVS in \u03b54 carriers may mainly result from increased WMH burden in \u03b54 carriers. To validate this assumption, correlation analyses were performed. Results displayed that not only dPVS was correlated with WMH volume, but also the differences of BG-dPVS among groups were no longer significant after controlling for total WMH volume. Overall, our results may also suggest in non-demented elderly, dPVS is not directly involved with A\u03b2 accumulation; therefore, future studies controlling WMH are required to determine the pathology associations for regional dPVS. Besides, longitudinal result in our analysis showed that there were no significant difference between progression of dPVS across groups. It suggested in non-demented elderly, the differences of APOE genotype only have limited impact on the development of dPVS.\nCorrelation analyses suggested baseline BGdPVS was related with progression of general cognition; however, when total WMH volume was introduced into GLM, this association is no longer statistically significant. General enlargement of dPVS is associated with other morphological features of CSVD such as WMH or lacune [42, 43] . The association between WMH and cognitive decline has been extensively studied and WM tract damage has been considered an important pathological change in cognitive decline. In contrast, few studies focused on the pathological correlation between dPVS and cognitive decline. In general population, our results were in perfect accordance with one work, which documenting correlation between BG-dPVS and cognition is no longer significant after controlling for WMH volume [44] . Thus, we assumed that the correlation between dPVS and cognitive decline may be dependent on WM damage. However, it is worth noticing that in both our study and the work of Yicheng et al., the assessment of dPVS was based on a 4-grade semiquantitative visual scales. Compared to the volumetric assessment of WMH, such grading system may be less sensitive. The correlation between dPVS and cognition are require further studied, but our results suggested WMH volume is a better radiological marker to reflect CSVD."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between APOE and MBs/Lacune", "text": "There was no difference of number of MBs/Lacune among three groups at baseline or during two-year followup; moreover, there was still no association between MBs/ lacune and cognition changes. In previous studies, the association between APOE \u03b52 allele and MBs has been reported. Some reasons may account for this discrepancy. On the one hand, the prevalence of MB and lacune in our population are 20.9% and 31.9% respectively, which is similar to the previous reported prevalence rate in general population [45] ; however, those studies documenting associations between \u03b52 allele and MBs were mostly performed in mild cognitive impairment, dementia or stroke patients, who generally have higher prevalence of MBs and lacune. Therefore, relatively low prevalence rate of MBs and lacune in non-demented population may reduce the chance of finding a significant association. On the other hand, limitation in assessment methods in current analyses, such as calculating number of MBs based on T2*-weighted images, may also impact the outcome.\nConclusively, the results of our population-based cohort study emphasized that APOE \u03b54 allele was related with relative increased A\u03b2 deposition and had a long-term detrimental effect on CSVD, especially in frontal WMH. Further, there is interaction between APOE \u03b54 allele and frontal WMH, which may exert long-term detrimental effects on non-demented individuals' trajectory of cognitive change."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Data set used in this study was obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).
