We estimated hippocampal volumes in 39 healthy controls and 124 stroke participants at three months, and 38 controls and 113 stroke participants at one year. We used intra-class correlation, concordance, and reduced major axis regression to assess agreement between automated and 'Manual' estimations. A linear mixedeffect model was used to characterize hippocampal atrophy.\nOverall, hippocampal volumes were reduced by 3.9% in first-ever stroke and 9.2% in recurrent stroke at three months post-stroke, with comparable ipsi-and contra-lesional reductions in first-ever stroke. Mean atrophy rates between time points were 0.5% for controls and 1.0% for stroke patients (0.6% contra-lesionally, 1.4% ipsi-lesionally). Atrophy rates in left and right-hemisphere strokes were comparable. All methods revealed significant volume change in first-ever and ipsi-lesional stroke (p < 0.001).\nHippocampal volume estimation was not impacted by hemisphere, study group, or scan time point, but rather, by the interaction between the automated segmentation method and hippocampal size. Compared to Manual, Subfields and FIRST recorded the lowest bias. FreeSurfer/v5.3 overestimated volumes the most for large hippocampi, while FIRST was the most accurate in estimating small volumes. AdaBoost performance was average.\nOur findings suggest that first-year ipsi-lesional hippocampal atrophy rate especially in firstever stroke, is greater than atrophy rates in healthy controls and contra-lesional stroke. Subfields and FIRST can complementarily be effective in characterizing the hippocampal atrophy in healthy and stroke cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Stroke is a major global cause of disability and death (Strong, Mathers et al. 2007 , Maier, Schroder et al. 2015 , Aerts, Fias et al. 2016 . People with stroke have a higher incidence of dementia (Makin, Turpin et al. 2013) , and up to one-third of stroke survivors develop poststroke dementia (PSD) in the years following the initial stroke incident (Mok, Lam et al. 2017) . Understanding the trajectory of cognitive decline and associated brain changes over the first year after stroke is crucial for developing treatments to delay the onset of PSD and modify its course.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been successfully used for the detection of structural changes in PSD (Mijajlovi\u0107, Pavlovi\u0107 et al. 2017) . Combined with neuropsychological testing, quantitative MRI methods show promise as important diagnostic tools (Ystad, Lundervold et al. 2009 ). In many quantitative MRI studies of diseased populations (Frodl, Schaub et al. 2006 , M Meisenzahl, Seifert et al. 2009 , Woon, Sood et al. 2010 , Apfel, Ross et al. 2011 , including subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (Fein, Di Sclafani et al. 2000) , smaller hippocampal volumes have been reported. In major stroke survivors, hippocampal atrophy has been associated with cognitive decline (Gemmell, Bosomworth et al. 2012 , Kliper, Bashat et al. 2013 ).\nThe segmentation of structures characterized by morphological complexitylike the hippocampiis challenging. Despite serious efforts to automate hippocampal segmentation, this is still commonly performed by human experts (Maglietta, Amoroso et al. 2016 ). However, manual segmentation is restricted by time and is costly for large datasets, has lower reproducibility unless protocols are strictly adhered to, and its results may be influenced by rater bias (Colon-Perez, Triplett et al. 2016) . The high reproducibility of automated methods reduces bias and facilitates the replication of findings between studies, in addition to allowing for faster processing. However, most longitudinal validation studies of automated segmentation have focused on healthy (Morey, Petty et al. 2009 , Perlaki, Horvath et al. 2017 and Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohorts (Morra, Tu et al. 2010 , Mulder, de Jong et al. 2014 , Cover, van Schijndel et al. 2016 , Maglietta, Amoroso et al. 2016 , Cover, van Schijndel et al. 2018 . Automated segmentation has not been validated for the characterization of hippocampal atrophy in stroke.\nAssessing longitudinal brain atrophy in conditions with destructive brain lesions, such as stroke, can be particularly challenging given the dynamic structural alterations before and after the stroke. The timing and sample size of MRI datasets pose challenges to conclusions about structural atrophy. There is also the challenge posed by the inclusion of patients with recurrent (i.e., prior) stroke who may already have suffered significant regional brain atrophy including in the hippocampus. While we have looked at brain atrophy in the first three months post-onset (Brodtmann, Pardoe et al. 2012 , Brodtmann, Pardoe et al. 2013 , Li, Pardoe et al. 2015 , relatively longer term trajectories of hippocampal volume changes have not been examined. Given that most functional recovery occurs in the first three months after stroke (Lee, Lim et al. 2015) , the three-month time point may serve as a better baseline for assessing longitudinal brain atrophy.\nResearchers have examined whole-brain (Seghier, Ramsden et al. 2014 ) and hippocampal (Schaapsmeerders, Tuladhar et al. 2015) atrophy in young and old patients many years after stroke. They reported lower volumes ipsi-lesionally in the whole-brain and in the hippocampus. However, the profile and rates of hippocampal atrophy over the first year remain largely unknown.\nPreviously (Khlif, Egorova et al. 2018) , we assessed the agreement between a number of automated segmentation methods and manual tracing in estimating hippocampal volumes in healthy participants and stroke patients at three months post-stroke. The top performers (AdaBoost, FIRST, and Subfields) in that study, in addition to FreeSurfer/v5.3 and v6.0, were used in the current study. The latter two methods were included in order to validate the improvement in hippocampal volume estimation sought with the evolution of FreeSurfer algorithms. We expected the algorithms' performance at 12 months to be consistent with their previous performance at three months. Moreover, we needed to evaluate their performance in assessing hippocampal atrophy between three and 12 months to better inform future studies. Accordingly, our aims were to: 1. Quantify hippocampal volume change in healthy and ischemic stroke participants in the period between three and 12 months after stroke (based on volumes estimated using manual and automated segmentation methods).\n2. Quantify hippocampal volume change in left-hemisphere stroke compared to righthemisphere stroke, in first-ever stroke compared to recurrent stroke, and in ipsi-lesional hippocampus compared to contra-lesional hippocampus.\n3. Evaluate the agreement between manual tracing and automated segmentation in estimating hippocampal volumes at 12 months post-stroke.\n4. Assess the sensitivity of automated algorithms in detecting longitudinal hippocampal volume change between three and 12 months post-stroke."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were sampled from the Cognition And Neocortical Volume after Stroke (CANVAS) study (Brodtmann, Werden et al. 2014 neuropsychological assessments, at five time points: baseline (within six weeks of index stroke), three months, one year, three years, and five years post-stroke (post-baseline for controls).

For this, we used a linear mixed-effect (lme) model where the estimated volumes were taken as the dependent variable and age, sex, years of education, and TIV were included as covariates.\nAge was included to correct for brain volume loss due to normal aging, sex to account for sexual dimorphism, education to adjust for its protective effect on cerebral structures, and TIV to control for head size variations. The covariates were checked for non-collinearity (the maximum variance inflation factor was 1.3) and residuals from model fitting were checked for normality and heteroscedasticity.\nThe lme model allowed for repeated measures and accommodated missing values in our dataset. For better generalization of our findings, we designed our mixed-effect model based on a maximal random effects structure. Time (a categorical variable with 3M and 12M as input) was included as a fixed effect, in addition to group (categorical variable with control and stroke, or stroke subclasses as input), sex (categorical variable), age, years of education, and TIV. The inclusion of first-order interactions between fixed effects was determined by comparing models (with and without the interaction term) using the simulated likelihood ratio test (500 replications, 95% confidence level). Among all interactions, only the group-time interaction was found to be significant. For fitting the data, maximum likelihood was used to estimate the model parameters.\nA random intercept and a random (time) slope varied by subject were also included in the lme model to fulfil the non-dependency requirement for within-subject and to allow for heterogeneity in estimated measures between subjects. The random intercept and slope were modelled as uncorrelated based on comparisons between models (with and without the correlation assumption). The likelihood ratio test showed the correlation between the random intercept and random slope to be non-significant.\nA model (lme.1) was first used to fit hippocampal volumes averaged across hemispheres. The MATLAB 'fitlme' function was employed to fit the model using the 'reference' method of coding dummy variables (I[.] ). Here, the response (i.e., dependent variable) at three months for male control participants was used as the reference. Accordingly, the lme.1 model was formulated as:\nwhere Y ijm represents hippocampal volume, i is the observation index, j = 2 corresponds to the 12M time point, m is the participant index, and \uf062 [.] are the fixed-effect coefficients. The random effects and observation error had the following prior distributions:\nAfter fitting the lme model, we tested the residual errors for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We excluded influential participants (maximum of three) as needed to meet the normality test for residuals. Residuals from a sample model fitting are shown in Supplemental Fig. 1 where they appear random regardless of group or hippocampal size and where their distribution is shown normal.\nIn a second model (lme.2), we fitted responses after grouping the stroke volumes based on hemisphere side in which stroke had occurred. Hippocampal volumes were grouped ipsilesionally and contra-lesionally, where both the ipsi-lesional and contra-lesional groups contained a mixture of left and right hemisphere volumes. Since the ipsi-lesional and contralesional groups were not independent, the random effects were further grouped by a subjectgroup interaction. For the control participants, we used volumes averaged across hemispheres as in lme.1. The three control, ipsi-lesional, and contra-lesional groups were then compared using the following extended model:\nwhere k = 2, 3 is the group index.\nModels lme.1 and lme.2 were also used to fit stroke volumes grouped as left vs. right, as well as first-ever stroke vs. recurrent stroke. There were 18 cases of recurrent stroke with an average of 6.5 years since last stroke.

The bias shown by AdaBoost and FIRST is the least proportional to hippocampal volume (a \u2248 1). On the other hand, FreeSurfer/v5.3 overestimated large hippocampal volumes, while Subfields slightly overestimated smaller volumes. Hippocampal volumes estimated by Subfields correlated best to manually traced volumes at both time points (r \u2265 0.89), while FIRST volumes correlated the least (r \u2264 0.6).

Side-by-side comparison showed improvement of the FreeSurfer segmentation with the introduction of v6.0 and Subfields (see Fig. 1 , plot F). Cross-sectional comparison at three months revealed lower mean hippocampal volume for the stroke group compared to the control group, regardless of segmentation method. This difference was larger at 12 months due to the accelerated rate of hippocampal atrophy in the stroke group relative to controls (see Table 3 ). At three months, a significant difference between control and stroke mean hippocampal volumes was found using FreeSurfer/v5.3 (p = 0.011) and FreeSurfer/v6.0 (p = 0.027) methods, but not with Manual.

In one study, hippocampal volumes with FreeSurfer (v4.0.5) were found to be closer to manual volumes than FIRST (fsl/v4.0.1). However, amygdala volumes with FreeSurfer were farther from hand-traced volumes than FIRST (Morey, Petty et al. 2009 ).

FIRST achieved better results than both versions of FreeSurfer for putamen segmentation when compared to manual segmentation. FreeSurfer overestimated putamen volume, while FIRST did not significantly differ from manual tracing. However, for caudate segmentation, FreeSurfer and FIRST had similar performance (Perlaki, Horvath et al. 2017 ).\nIn the current study, hippocampal volumes with Subfields were the closest (d 3M = 66 mm 3 , Fig. 1 ) to manually traced volumes, while volumes with FreeSurfer/v5.3 were the farthest (d 3M = 385 mm 3 ). The bias with FIRST (d 3M = 173 mm 3 ) was nearly half that with FreeSurfer/v6.0 and AdaBoost. The recorded bias with FIRST and AdaBoost was nearly fixed (a \u2248 1). FreeSurfer/v6.0 (a 3M = 1.05) and Subfields (a 3M = 0.94) had similar but slightly higher and reversed proportional bias (i.e., increasing bias for increasing hippocampal volume with FreeSurfer/v6.0 and for decreasing volume with Subfields). In terms of correlation (r), intra-class correlation (ICC) and absolute agreement (CCC), Subfields scored the highest, while FIRST scored second for absolute agreement. FreeSurfer/v6.0 had second highest Pearson's and intra-class correlation coefficients.\nWe note that the performance of the presented automated segmentation methods for the three-month time point remained unchanged for the 12-month time point. We have also shown that such performance was influenced neither by study population (e.g., healthy vs. stroke) nor by hemisphere (i.e., left vs. right), but was mainly dictated by a method\u2212hippocampal size interaction (see Supplemental Fig. 2) . The slope of best-fit line (see Fig. 1 ) determined by RMAR is a manifestation of this interaction where methods exhibiting a bias directly proportional to the size of the hippocampus were found to overestimate the cross-sectional difference between the healthy and disease groups and to underestimate the difference in their longitudinal change. The artificial inflation and deflation of effect sizes shown in our cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses have also been reported in other studies (Xie, Wisse et al. 2019 ). Finally, the presence of ischemic infarcts did not negatively impact on the performance of automatic segmentation. On the contrary, the automated methods performed worse when the stroke lesions were accounted for (Khlif, Egorova et al. 2018 ).\nThe overall results presented in Section 3.3 indicated that, at three months, contra-lesional and ipsi-lesional stroke hippocampal volumes were nearly equally reduced compared to control participants (4.6% contra-lesionally vs. 4.7% ipsi-lesionally). A similar pattern emerged in the first-ever stroke group (3.8% contra-lesional vs. 4.0% ipsi-lesional reduction compared to control). Moreover, the small difference between contra-lesional and ipsilesional reductions at three months accounted for the faster atrophy rate on the ipsi-lesional side, which we postulate is accelerated by the stroke. This translated to a difference of 0.8% in atrophy rate over nine months. The higher atrophy rate between the three and 12-month time points in the stroke group, compared to controls, was driven by greater volume loss in first-ever stroke compared to recurrent stroke; though the difference in their atrophy rates was shown to be non-significant by most methods, especially Manual. This may be related to the baseline degree of atrophy being higher in recurrent stroke patients and may reflect a limitation in atrophy rate once brain volumes are already reduced.\nIndividually and collectively, the segmentation methods showed that the average hippocampal volume is larger in control than stroke participants at three months and even more so at 12 months. The statistical difference between these two groups depended on the way the segmentation method modulated the hippocampal volume. In particular, FreeSurfer/v5.3 overestimated hippocampal volumes the most, but more importantly, this overestimation increased with hippocampal size. Our findings showed a significant improvement of the FreeSurfer algorithm from versions 5.3 to 6.0 and eventually to the implementation of an ex vivo atlas with Subfields.\nIn Section 3.3, we noted that at three months, the first-ever and recurrent stroke group hippocampal volumes were reduced by 3.9% and 9.2%, respectively. Based on an average of 6.5 years between prior and index stroke in the recurrent stroke group, we estimated this group's annualised atrophy rate (prior to recent stroke) to be around 0.8% on average. On the other hand, the annualised atrophy rate for first-ever stroke patients was estimated to be 1.3% in the first year after stroke. We predict that hippocampal atrophy in our first-ever stroke group will slow over subsequent years, and plan to test this hypothesis in the CANVAS cohort.\nAccelerated hippocampal volume loss has been described in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as AD and temporal lobe epilepsy. The rate of hippocampal atrophy is a strong predictor of progression to AD (Henneman et al., 2009) . Hippocampal atrophy has also been associated with cognitive decline in stroke survivors (Gemmel et al., 2012 , Kliper et al., 2013 . Barnes et al. (2009) performed a meta-analysis of longitudinal hippocampal atrophy in 595 AD participants and 212 healthy controls (Barnes et al., 2009) . The mean (95% CIs) annualised hippocampal atrophy rates were found to be around 4.7% (3.9, 5.4) in AD and 1.4% (0.5, 2.3) in healthy controls. The ratio of atrophy rates between these two cohorts was calculated to be 3.4 times higher for AD. In our study, we report a nonsignificant average hippocampal volume reduction of 0.7% (annualised) for the healthy control group (from 0.4% with Subfields to 0.9% with FIRST) compared to a significant annualised 1.3% volume reduction in the stroke group (from 0.8% with FreeSurfer/v5.3 to 1.8% with Manual). Ipsi-lesionally, the average annualised hippocampal volume reduction was 1.9%: ranging from 1.1% with FreeSurfer/v5.3 to 3.3% with Manual. Thus, the ratio of ipsi-lesional to control atrophy was at 2.6 on average (from 1.4 with FreeSurfer/v5.3 to 5.4 with Manual). The ratio of ipsi-lesional to control atrophy found in the current study trends similar to the ratio of AD atrophy to control atrophy reported in Barnes et al. (2009) . The ratio of atrophy of ipsi-lesional stroke to control revealed by Manual in our study even surpassed the average ratio of atrophy in AD compared to healthy controls in Barnes et al. (2009) .\nFinally, the linear mixed-effect model used in this work has effectively captured the variability in the data given the normally distributed low magnitude residuals obtained. We chose maximal models for better generalization and we have provided the MATLAB script (Appendix A) to facilitate result reproducibility. However, given the small number of recurrent stroke participants in our study, findings regarding this group should be interpreted with caution in the context of this sample size limitation. We also note that the performance of the segmentation methods is governed by the type of data we used. A different MRI scanner and/or acquisition protocol may lead to different comparisons between the segmentation methods. Still, the FreeSurfer algorithm used for subregion segmentation (i.e., Subfields) can adapt to MRI variations from different acquisition hardware or pulse sequences. This has been demonstrated on three datasets with different types of MRI contrast and resolution (Iglesias, Augustinack et al. 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Improvements in volumetric estimation methods have a significant impact on findings from MRI studies.
