[{"section_title": "", "text": "in Duck, NC, including over 2600 non-breaking waves, 414 spilling breakers, 110 plunging breakers, and 1139 breakers whose initial type could not be determined. Wave height is measured using a spatio-temporal method for wave tracking that preserves the true sea surface elevation maximum and is robust to instances when the wave trough is beyond the field of view of the LIDAR transect. Methods for estimating instantaneous wave speed are refined by fitting a skewed-Gaussian function to each wave profile and tracking the fitted wave form peak. Wave slope was estimated using a variety of fitting methods to the upper 20%, 50%, and 80% of the wave face. A linear fit to the upper 80% of the wave face provides the strongest correlation with geometric wave slope defined relative to mean sea level, and the maximum wave face slope achieved by the skewed-Gaussian fitted wave form is most robust to the wave shape changes near the onset of breaking. At the onset of spilling and plunging, critical breaking predictors are examined on a wave-by-wave basis. We find that \u03b3, the ratio of wave height to water depth, peaks near the onset of breaking (0.7 < \u03b3 b < 0.8 for plunging and 0.6 < \u03b3 b < 0.7 for spilling) at values consistent with solitary wave theory (\u03b3 sol = 0.78) and critical \u03b3 rms values previously observed at Duck and other beaches. Direct estimates of wave face slope and wave phase speed also peak at the onset of breaking. Wave face slope and \u03b3 are positively correlated and, when used together, strongly predict breaking and breaker type. A support-vector machine model is successfully used to identify or define the transition from non-breaking to breaking and from spilling to plunging. Finally, traditionally estimated wave energy flux gradients are compared with dissipation rates estimated using the bore model and the roller model. This analysis is pursued primarily on an ensemble-averaged basis, and the results are segregated by breaker type. We find that plunging breakers lose energy at a rate 40% greater than that of spilling breakers within the first 0.2 wavelengths after the onset of breaking. Following this interval, the rate of change of wave energy flux is approximately equal for spilling and plunging breakers. The bore model predicts maximum dissipation rate at the onset of breaking for both spilling and plunging breakers. For plunging breakers, high dissipation rate is concentrated very near the onset of breaking followed by a precipitous decrease, and for spilling breakers, the dissipation rate decreases gradually. Due to multipath reflections that can artificially augment the roller length, the roller model dissipation rates are inconclusive and require further research. 4.1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.2 Methods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.3 Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.4 Discussion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.5 Conclusions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It may include a variety of land types, such as coastal plains, wetlands, estuaries, coastal cliffs, dunes, and beaches. Nearshore regions are a mainstay of national and local economy and public recreation, and are a subject of national security. At the same time, they are vulnerable to the effects of dense human population, longterm erosion, extreme storms, and sea level rise (Elko et al., 2014). Because the nearshore responds dynamically to its environmental and anthropogenic pressures, it is a region of great interest to scientists and coastal citizens alike. The surf zone is the shallow nearshore region where surface gravity waves are influenced by the presence of the seafloor, become unstable, and break. In the surf zone, breaking waves drive nearshore circulation, suspend sediment, and promote air-sea gas exchange. Events such as strong rip currents, beach erosion, or storm-induced flooding and infrastructure damage provide impetus for predictive models of nearshore processes. To resolve these processes, nearshore wave models must parameterize wave breaking using a chosen theory and breaking criteria. Model predictions in regions where breaking initiates often diverge from in situ measurements because wave breaking has large spatial and temporal variability. Additionally, even though spilling and plunging breakers dissipate energy differently, nearshore models do not incorporate breaker type in the parameterization of wave forcing. Therefore, detailed observations of spilling and plunging breakers in the field are needed to develop appropriate parameterizations of wave energy dissipation across the surf zone. Close-range remote sensing instruments, specifically LIDAR and thermal infrared imagery, provide the spatio-temporal resolution to investigate the rapid changes that occur near the onset of breaking and are sensitive to differences between spilling and plunging breakers. This dissertation presents extensive methodology to combine data from a line-scanning LIDAR and thermal infrared cameras to detect breaking, classify breaker type, and measure key wave parameters. Analysis of these geometric and kinematic wave properties on a waveby-wave basis near the onset of breaking provide new ways to predict breaking and breaker type in the field. Finally, a preliminary comparison of near onset dissipation rates for spilling and plunging breakers is pursued."}, {"section_title": "Wave Energy Dissipation Models", "text": "In general, there are two types of wave models used in the nearshore: phase-averaged and phase-resolved. Phase-averaged models, like the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model (Booij et al., 1997(Booij et al., , 2008, propagate a wave spectrum onshore, using wave statistics to define breaking criteria. The goal of phase-averaged models is to model the bulk energy dissipation across the surf zone, not to replicate the details of wave breaking. This is in contrast to phase-resolved models, like the Simulating WAves till SHore (SWASH) model (Zijlema et al., 2011), which model the free surface directly to assess wave evolution and breaking. Both types of models parameterize wave breaking-induced energy dissipation using the hydraulic jump or bore model (e.g., Thornton and Guza, 1983;Janssen and Battjes, 2007). Phase-averaged numerical models use statistical measures of the wave field to initiate breaking. The root-mean-squared wave height, water depth, and an empirical depth-limited breaking criteria \u03b3 (often tuned for better model results) are used to determine the maximum wave height supported at a given location in the surf zone. These parameters define the fraction of breaking waves and the breaking wave height probability distribution, which are used to scale the wave spectra as it propagates onshore. Phase-resolving, or wave-resolving, numerical models initiate wave breaking using a critical speed at the crest or a critical steepness of the wave face. Once exceeded, the breaking wave is modeled as a bore until another speed or steepness threshold is reached and the wave ceases to break. Generally, these thresholds have been validated using laboratory breakers. Essentially, phase-averaged models do not allow the total wave energy to be greater than a certain value at a given depth, and phase-resolving models do not allow individual waves to exceed a certain speed or steepness without breaking. As both model types employ the bore model, neither accounts for differences in dissipation rate due to breaker type."}, {"section_title": "Significance of Breaker Type", "text": "Plunging waves form when the wave crest overshoots the toe of the wave, as seen in Figure   1.1, and forms a large air cavity, which collapses suddenly, submerging a bubble plume and often resulting in a secondary, smaller splash-up. Spilling breakers evolve more gradually, developing an aerated, bubbly roller that slides down the front face of the wave ( Figure   1.1). The classification of the breaker only applies to its initial stages, because as the beach slope and wave shape change throughout the breaking process, the breaker type changes across the surf zone. Both spilling and plunging breakers eventually reach steady state, evolving into a turbulent bore (Battjes, 1988). As breakers develop along this continuum they dissipate wave energy at different rates. Quantifying the geometric, kinematic, and energetic differences between breaker types in the surf zone is key to accurately modeling important physical processes in this region. The classification of spilling, plunging, collapsing, and surging exists along a continuum and has been previously quantified in terms of a dimensionless surf similarity parameter, called the Iribarren number, the ratio of beach slope to wave steepness, where \u03b2 is the beach slope angle, H 0 is the deep water wave height, and L 0 is the deep water wavelength (Galvin, 1968). H 0 can be replaced by the breaking wave height, H b , to define a surf zone Iribarren number, \u03be b (Battjes, 1975). Using the surf zone Iribarren number, Battjes (1975) found spilling breakers occur for \u03be b < 0.4, plunging for 0.4 < \u03be b < 2.0, and surging and collapsing for \u03be b > 2.0. In other words, for a given surf zone wave steepness, spilling breakers are predicted for a shallowly sloped beach and plunging breakers are predicted for a steeply sloped beach. Collapsing and surging waves occur most frequently on steep, rocky beaches (Wright and Short, 1984) and are not considered in this surf zone study."}, {"section_title": "Remote Sensing Fundamentals", "text": "Advancement and assessment of wave energy dissipation parameterizations based on breaker type will depend on efforts to quantify and model the details of wave breaking over a range of space and time scales. Remote sensing techniques, such as visible (Electro-Optical, EO) imaging, thermal infrared (IR) imaging, and LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) have been used to provide wave-resolved spatial coverage of wave breaking. In the ocean, observable infrared signals are a combination of the emission of the scene objects and reflection of the background, in contrast to a visible band camera that sees only reflected and transmitted light from the sky and solar disk. In EO imagery, active foam, the foam generated at the crest while a wave is breaking, and residual foam, the foam left behind in the wake of a breaking wave, both appear bright (Figure 1.2a) due to the diffuse reflection of light off bubbles that make up foam. Thus it is difficult to use EO imagery to isolate the actively breaking crest from residual foam left in the wake of the breaking wave (Holman et al., 1993;Aarninkhof and Ruessink, 2004). In thermal IR imagery, foam has a higher emissivity than foam-free water, making foam appear warmer than undisturbed water of the same temperature (Nicl\u00f2s et al., 2007;Branch et al., 2016), as indicated in Figure 1.2b. Observations show that foam also appears to cool rapidly after it is formed and breaking subsides (Fogelberg, 2003;Marmorino and Smith, 2005). IR imagery has been used to study deep-water wave breaking (Jessup et al., 1997a) and microscale breaking (Jessup et al., 1997b). Carini et al. (2015) recently employed a new IR technique, exploiting the unique IR signature of active foam, to detect and characterize actively breaking crests and estimate wave dissipation in the inner surf zone along a cross-shore profile. LIDAR can be used to track the variation of wave shape and slope as it evolves. Brodie to measure swash reflections and steady spilling breakers in the surf zone provide robust methodologies that are reviewed in Chapter 2 (Martins et al., 2016(Martins et al., , 2017a(Martins et al., , 2018."}, {"section_title": "Field Experiment Overview", "text": "The ROLLer EXperiment (ROLLEX) was conducted from 25 October 2016 to 10 November 2016 at the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, NC. The experiment objectives were to collect remote sensing data that can be used to identify breaking waves, classify breaker type, and track the evolution of breakers across the surf zone. Breaking wave parameters would then be used to estimate wave energy dissipation due to breaking. The surf zone at the FRF is instrumented and maintained by the USACE, and as a result of the many small and large-scale field experiments that have been conducted there over the last few decades, the site characteristics are well known. The beach morphology here is variable, but typically includes a shore-parallel sand bar or terrace, and can be punctuated by rip current channels (Plant et al., 1999). Significant wave height, H s , at the FRF is commonly 0.2 -1.0 m, increases to 2 -3 m during storms, and sometimes reaches as high as 4 -5 m (Birkemeier et al., 1985). The FRF provides a significant amount of infrastructure including laboratories, fabrication facilities, a pier, an an imaging tower. The FRF is equipped to make detailed bathymetry measurements using amphibious vehicles and two site surveys were conducted during ROLLEX, on 03 November and 16 November 2016. These are used to define beach slope, identify any barred or plateaued bathymetry, and estimate local water depth over the course of the experiment. The FRF also maintains in situ instruments at 8-m and 3.5-m water depth that were used to characterize incoming wave conditions. For ROLLEX, we deployed four thermal infrared (IR) cameras from the FRF imaging tower, two IR cameras and a line-scanning LIDAR from the FRF pier, and two in situ acoustic Doppler profilers (ADPs). The pier is a 6 m wide steel and concrete structure that extends approximately 560 m out from the dunes behind the beach and past the surf zone. The FRF pier deck is 7 m above mean sea level and has power access points along its length. The FRF tower is 43 m tall and is equipped with power and data connections in a small enclosure at the top, which houses an existing video imaging monitoring station (Argus). This thesis focuses primarily on data collected from two IR cameras and the line-scanning LIDAR. One IR camera was mounted about 28 m above sea level on the FRF tower to provide a surf zone-scale field of view (FOV). The other IR camera and the LIDAR provided a wavescale FOV from about 12 m above sea level. These two instruments were mounted to a mobile platform that could be moved onshore or offshore throughout the experiment to maintain coverage of the breakpoint and initial stages of breaking as wave conditions changed. See Chapter 2 for a complete description of the field deployment and instrument specifications. The wind and wave conditions recorded throughout ROLLEX are summarized in Figure   1.4. The intensity of green in the background of each panel represents how many of the remote sensing instruments were operational, with the best observational coverage occuring for 03 Nov to 09 Nov.

(Galvin, 1968). The intuitive link between breaking wave type and the safety of a beach landing is physically substantiated by our heuristic understanding of breaker mechanics. Plunging breakers occur when the wave crest curls forward and impinges the water surface. This impinging jet may cause a secondary, smaller splash-up and creates an air cavity, which collapses, submerging a bubble plume (Basco, 1985). Spilling breakers also exhibit a curling crest, but at a much smaller scale (Duncan, 2001). This initiates an aerated roller that cascades down the front face of the wave (Basco, 1985). As they progress onshore, both spilling and plunging breakers gradually develop into turbulent steady state bores (Battjes, 1988). By their nature, spilling and plunging breakers dissipate energy differently and thus contribute differently to nearshore processes, such as air-sea gas exchange, sediment transport, and transient or steady coastal circulation. However, wave models used to predict such natural phenomena typically do not account for breaker type or stage of breaking. Specifically for wave-driven events that occur over shorter time scales, incorporating breaker type and the evolution of the stages of breaking across the surf zone may help improve model predictions. One way this can be achieved is by including key geometric wave properties that correlate with breaker type and may be used to modify the parameterization of wave energy dissipation. Thus motivated, we present the first of a two-part series addressing the evolution of spilling and plunging breakers near the onset of breaking. The major of objective of this chapter is to use remote sensing data fusion techniques for tracking, classifying, and measuring breaking waves in the surf zone. Chapter 3 uses these measurements to investigate geometric predictors of breaking and breaker type. Differences in geometric (e.g., wave asymmetry and roller slope), kinematic (e.g., phase speed and orbital velocities), and dynamic (e.g., breaker-induced turbulence) wave properties of spilling and plunging breakers have been measured in the laboratory (Adeyemo, 1968;Kirby, 1995, 1996;Govender et al., 2002;Blenkinsopp and Chaplin, 2007;Mukaro et al., 2013, among others) and modeled using various computational techniques (e.g., Grilli et al., 1997;Chella et al., 2016;Derakhti et al., 2018), but few field measurements are available for distinguishing breaker types and wave characteristics near the onset of breaking. Miller and Zeigler (1964) described breaker types in the field based on time-averaged sea surface and vertical velocity profiles separating them into symmetric, asymmetric, and very asymmetric categories, but concluded differentiation was still subjective. Suhayda and Pettigrew (1977) averaged ten plunging breakers, whose onset occurred at approximately the same location in the surf zone, and observed that wave height and speed peaked near onset. Weishar and Byrne (1978) found that the onset of plunging and non-plunging breakers occurred for different wave height and water depth criteria and that the breaker classification of Galvin (1968) or Battjes (1975), more commonly referred to as the Iribarren number, is insufficient to discriminate between plunging and spilling breakers. Remote sensing methodologies have greatly expanded out ability to detect the onset of breaking (Carini et al., 2015;Martins et al., 2017b) and measure wave geometries, specifically details about the plunging jet (Robertson et al., 2014) and spilling roller (Martins et al., 2018). Remote sensing techniques that have been used to provide phase-resolved observations of waves in the surf zone include visible (Electro-Optical, EO) imaging, thermal infrared (IR) imaging, radar, and LIDAR (Holman and Haller, 2013). IR imagery has been used to study deep-water wave breaking (Jessup et al., 1997a), microscale breaking (Jessup et al., 1997b), and surf zone wave breaking (Carini et al., 2015). From the ocean surface, observable infrared signals are a combination of the thermal emission of the scene objects and reflection of the background, in contrast to the visible band, which consists of reflected light from the sun. In EO imagery, active foam (the foam generated while a wave is breaking) and residual foam (the foam left behind in the wake of a breaking wave) both appear bright due to the diffuse reflection of light off the bubbles that make up foam. Thus it is difficult to use EO imagery to isolate actively breaking waves from the residual foam left in their wake (Holman et al., 1993;Aarninkhof and Ruessink, 2004). In thermal IR wavelengths, foam has a higher emissivity than foam-free water, making foam appear warmer (brighter) than undisturbed water of the same temperature (Nicl\u00f2s et al., 2007;Branch et al., 2016). Observations show that foam also cools rapidly after it is formed and breaking subsides (Fogelberg, 2003;Marmorino and Smith, 2005), making residual foam appear darker than undisturbed water in IR imagery. By exploiting the unique IR signature of active foam, Carini et al. 2015 Of particular relevance are their wave-tracking methods (Martins et al., 2016), computation of wave phase speed (Martins et al., 2016(Martins et al., , 2018, and direct estimation of the slope of the aerated wave face, called the roller angle (Duncan, 1981;Martins et al., 2018). In the following sections we describe data fusion techniques for a large LIDAR and IR data set. We detail methods to track individual waves, detect breaking, and classify the type of breaking. Metrics for wave height, wave phase speed, and wave slope, are tested for nonbreaking and breaking waves. The difference in wave slope at the onset of breaking between spilling and plunging breakers is provided to demonstrate the power of these methods.     The second IR camera and a line-scanning LIDAR provided wave-scale observations from the FRF pier. Both were mounted to a mobile pier platform, which consisted of a 6m-long frame mounted at the top of a telescoping stand (Figure 2.3b). The platform was raised to its maximum vertical position of z =13.2 m to allow for optimal data collection and was stabilized by four guy lines attached to the pier. As the sea state evolved during the experiment, the platform was moved to maintain coverage of the cross-shore region spanning the onset of breaking, as marked in at the location of the LIDAR cross-shore transects. To estimate a representative bathymetry for 07-08 November 2016, we interpolated between the two surveys using a linear weighting function based on the time between the data collection and each bathymetric survey. Evidence supporting this linearly interpolated bathymetry is provided in Appendix A. This interpolated bathymetry is shown in Figure 2.2a and 2.2b. The local beach slope was estimated using the interpolated bathymetry and ranged from 1:50 to 1:25 at the onshore LIDAR position and 1:500 to 1:50 at the offshore LIDAR position."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection & Processing Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Field Experiment & Wave Conditions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Transformation to Field Coordinates", "text": "A total station was used to survey the 3D locations of both IR cameras, five reference points with known FRF coordinates, and several ground control points (GCPs) across the beach and swash zone. Given these 3D points in FRF coordinates and their corresponding 2D points in each IR image, a projective mapping was created for the tower IR camera (Holland et al., 1997;Hartley and Zisserman, 2003). Because the FOV of the pier IR camera did not capture any of the surveyed GCPs, a rectification was estimated using the surveyed camera location and its tilt as measured by a surveying level placed on the camera housing. The resulting approximate camera geometry was judged to be adequate since this camera was only used to visually assess the breaker type. For the LIDAR, we developed an adaptive method to register the data from the LI-DAR coordinate system (x , y , z ) to the local FRF coordinate system (x, y, z) because the orientation of the LIDAR varied slightly throughout the experiment. Each time the pier platform was moved, we surveyed the LIDAR position and known FRF GCPs and used this information to compute the LIDAR position in FRF coordinates, (x , y , z ). To determine the orientation of the LIDAR, the following calculations are performed on each five-minute LIDAR data file. First, the roll of the LIDAR is determined by fitting a line in the x -z plane to all of the collected points. Since the LIDAR was deployed on its side, the roll angle is computed as 90 \u2022 \u2212 tan \u22121 (m), where m is the slope of the fitted line. We rotate the data points using this roll angle, which renders the linear fit horizontal. Over 07-08 November 2016 the mean and standard deviation of the data-derived roll were 88.5 \u2022 and 0.3 \u2022 , respectively. Next, the distance from the LIDAR to the sea surface is computed using the rectified instrument position (x , y , z ) and the tidal elevation from the NOAA tide gauge (Station ID: 8651370) located at the end of the pier, which reports mean sea level every six minutes. The tilt is chosen as the angle which, when applied to the data, rotates the mean sea surface line closest to the tidal elevation. Over 07-08 November the mean and standard deviation of the data-derived tilt were 26.3 \u2022 and 0.5 \u2022 , respectively. The azimuth of the instrument was estimated using a plane fit to three surveyed points on the base of the LIDAR and was found to be 0.08 \u2022 and to vary less than 0.05 \u2022 between deployments. Therefore, additional azimuthal rotation was not implemented. Last, the LIDAR data was translated to the FRF coordinate system by adding the instrument's FRF position, (x , y , z ). While this projection correction method is useful for situations where accurate orientation data is unavailable, due to the removal of any mean sea surface slope in the fitting process of each data file, this method is not appropriate for measuring wave setup or set-down. However, if the instrument is stationary throughout the experiment and the orientation calculations are performed on a period of time when waves are small, then wave setup or set-down may be estimated."}, {"section_title": "LIDAR Quality Control", "text": "The density of LIDAR returns depends on the instrument's spatial resolution and the reflector (i.e., the water surface) characteristics (Blenkinsopp et al., 2010;Brodie et al., 2015). When there is sufficient breaking to produce foam that persists on the water surface or sufficient surface roughness, the density of backscattered returns is high, and the LIDAR is able to capture breaking and non-breaking wave profiles. When there is no breaking, or no persistent foam, the smooth water surface specularly reflects the signal away and the density of returns is low. Therefore, it is important to determine when the collected LIDAR data sufficiently samples the sea surface to resolve detailed features of the wave profile. We first interpolated the irregularly spaced LIDAR points to a uniform grid using an appropriate and achievable spatial resolution. Operating in long-range mode, the LIDAR can collect point-measurements at 42 kHz (when line-sampling at 5.2 Hz), yielding a theoretical maximum of 8076.9 point-measurements per line and an angular resolution of 0.0124 \u2022 , for our field setup. The corresponding spatial resolution at the water surface is shown in Figure 2.4a as a function of cross-shore position. At 15 m onshore of the LIDAR, the spatial resolution is 0.61 cm, and at 30 m offshore of the LIDAR, the spatial resolution is 1.4 cm. The highest resolution, 0.36 cm, occurs at nadir. Based on this theoretical resolution curve, we uniformly interpolated the LIDAR transects to 1 cm resolution. To address variations in return density, we developed a quality control criterion to determine when to accept or reject the LIDAR data based on an expected minimum sampling rate. If five minutes of data were collected at the spatial resolution shown in Figure 2.4a and binned every 10 cm, the resulting theoretical histogram of returns would match the would allow resolution up to a 1 Hz Nyquist frequency. This minimum-returns curve can be computed for any chosen spatial resolution, sample duration, and data-binning scheme. Any time the density of measured returns falls below the minimum-returns curve, that part of the cross-shore transect is excluded. For example, of the three overlaid histograms of LIDAR signal returns in Figure 2.4b, we can use nearly all of the high return density data (dark gray), only the onshore part of the medium return density data (medium gray), and none of the low return density data (light gray)."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Wave-tracking & Wave Parameter Estimation", "text": "Central to our methodology is the development of a spatial wave-tracking algorithm that uses the full spatial and temporal resolution of the LIDAR.

To initially identify each wave, we extract a time series from the offshore edge of the timestack and define initial wave peaks (x 0 , t 0 ) as local maxima, with a minimum separation of 2 s between peaks and a minimum peak prominence of 0.25 m. Next, we extract the cross-shore transect at t 0 and choose the surface elevation maxima as the initial spatial peak, (x pk , z pk ). This wave peak is then tracked at every time step by searching for surface elevation maxima in each sequential cross-shore transect (solid black lines in Figure   2.5a). The search is confined to the region between the location of the previous peak and a shoreward position of twice the distance the wave would have moved if traveling according to shallow water linear wave theory. Tracking continues at each time-step until we reach the onshore limit of the transect. Each wave may vary in how many instances it was tracked due to variations in speed: faster waves travel farther between each time step and are therefore tracked at fewer points over the full transect. In addition to tracking the peak, we track the preceding and following troughs. Figure   2.5b and 2.5c show an example spatial profile of a breaking wave and its corresponding time series, respectively. While surf zone waves have well-defined peaks, the troughs are characteristically broad and flat (Munk, 1949;Komar and Gaughan, 1973), making the trough location ambiguous, though the trough elevation is well-defined. Additionally, due to the limited cross-shore extent of our line-scans, we often do not capture the full wavelength, as is the case in Figure 2.5b, and thus cannot identify preceding and following troughs simultaneous with a peak. Therefore, we extract the time series at the location of the tracked peak and identify the trough elevations z tr\u2212t (temporal minima) just before and after the tracked peak, similar to Martins et al. (2017b). Wave period, T , is estimated as the time between these preceding and following troughs, as shown in Figure 2.5c. Individual wave heights are then computed as the difference in elevation between the spatially-tracked wave peak and temporally-tracked preceding wave trough, H = z pk \u2212 z tr\u2212t . Note that parameters derived from the spatial profile will be denoted either with no additional subscript (as seen in the definition of H) or with subscript x, and parameters derived from the time series will always be denoted with subscript t. Individual wave speed c is estimated from the tracked wave peaks as the slope of a 5-point moving linear regression on the (t pk , x pk ) values, following the methods of Tissier et al. (2015) and Martins et al. (2018). This method is more robust than using the scan-to-scan velocity of the tracked peak ( x/ t). However, the 5-point regression is still susceptible to peak misidentification due to noise and rapid wave shape changes near the onset of breaking. To overcome this issue, we fit each wave form with an idealized wave shape, here formalized as a skewed-Gaussian curve, shown in Figure 2.5b. A skewed-Gaussian function, is the scaled product of a standard normal probability density function, and its cumulative distribution function, where r is a dummy variable representing (x \u2212 \u00b5)/\u03c9. The skewed-Gaussian function (2.1) was chosen to match the expected shape changes that are characteristic of a breaking wave as it pitches forward prior to breaking. The wave shape function is fit to the measured profile using a non-linear optimization of the peak location (\u00b5), peak width (\u03c9), horizontal skewness (\u03b1), a scaling parameter (A) and a vertical offset (\u03b6). For the example breaking wave in Figure 2.5b, \u00b5=151.71, \u03c9=7.95, \u03b1=6.72, A=3.56, \u03b6=0.47. To assess the goodness of fit, we use a sample \u03c7 2 statistic, where \u03c3 tot = \u03c3 LIDAR + \u03c3 interp is the sum of instrument variance (assumed constant at 1 cm) and the mean absolute difference between the raw and interpolated LIDAR profiles ( |z raw \u2212 z interp | ). If the \u03c7 2 value is less than the critical value for a \u03c7 2 distribution with 45 degrees of freedom (conservative estimate from the 4501 cross-shore points included in the analysis) at 95% confidence, we accept the fit. For our dataset, 92.7% of the skewed-Gaussian fitted profiles pass the \u03c7 2 test. The fitted profiles provide sub-pixel tracking of the wave peaks, (x pk ,z pk ), which yields a smoother estimate of wave speed,c, estimated using the 5-point moving linear regression method. Additionally, we use the skewed-Gaussian fitted wave speed and the wave period to estimate wavelength, L =cT . We do not estimate wavelength directly because our cross-shore transects did not consistently capture a full wavelength. The water depth through which a wave travels is computed as the difference between the measured mean sea level and the interpolated bathymetry at the location of the wave peak, h = z M SL \u2212 z bathy (x pk ). Using z M SL as a reference level and following definitions proposed by Kjeldsen et al. (1979), we estimate wave asymmetry, L /L , and wave slope, \u03b7/L , as illustrated in Figure 2.5b. Three additional wave slope metrics are computed. First, we fit a line to a portion of the wave face and use the fitted slope, m . Section 2.4.3 compares wave slope \u03b7/L to m computed using the upper 20% of the wave face, the upper 50%, the upper 80%, and the full wave face. For those waves nearing the onset of breaking, especially plunging breakers, a quadratic fit to a portion of the wave face may be more appropriate. Second, the maximum gradient achieved by the quadratic fit over the wave face is taken as the quadratic fit wave slope, m q . Lastly, the maximum slope achieved by the skewed-Gaussian over the wave face is m SG ."}, {"section_title": "Breaker Detection & Classification Using IR Imagery", "text": "For each wave tracked in the LIDAR data, we use the corresponding surf zone-scale IR imagery (from the imaging tower) to determine if the wave was breaking and the wavescale IR imagery (from the pier) to classify the type of breaker.

The back face of a spilling breaker exhibits a uniformly patchy texture in the IR imagery. In contrast, the back face of a plunging breaker is characterized by an organized streak pattern in the IR imagery. series will always be denoted with subscript \u2212t. Temporal peak-tracking methods sample the cross-shore LIDAR transect at discrete locations and use these time series to identify, track, and measure wave parameters (e.g., Martins et al., 2017b;Postacchini and Brocchini, 2014;Power et al., 2015). In effect, the LIDAR data are treated as a dense cross-shore array of elevation gauges. For comparison purposes, we show temporally-derived troughs, peaks, and wave heights for data sampled at a location mid-transect to ensure that both spatial and temporal wave peaks and troughs can be identified. In Figure 2.10a, we see large scatter between temporal z tr\u2212t and spatial z tr\u2212x , with a rootmean-squared difference (rmsd) of 20 cm and a normalized rmsd (nrmsd) (normalized by the variance of the spatially-derived parameter) of 2.2. The mean bias is -4.8 cm, indicating that, on average, z tr\u2212t is lower than z tr\u2212x . These statistics suggest that the true trough elevation computed with z tr\u2212x is biased high and supports the use of the z tr\u2212t for calculating trough-to-peak wave height, H. Figure 2.10: (a) Wave peak elevations and (b) wave trough elevations identified using the temporal peak-tracking method versus the spatial peak-tracking method, with 1:1 line for comparison. (c) Wave heights computed from the temporal peak-tracking method versus wave heights computed from the spatial peak-tracking method (black dots) and the combined spatio-temporal method (gray dots), with 1:1 line for comparison. Comparing the spatially-and temporally-derived wave peak elevations in Figure 2.10b, we find that the scatter between z pk\u2212x and z pk\u2212t is small, with an rmsd of 7.1 cm and an nrmsd of 0.25. Thus, the spatial peak-tracking methods agree well with the temporal methods. In Figure 2.10b, all points lie on or to the right of the 1:1 line, which indicates that all individual bias calculations (z pk\u2212t \u2212 z pk\u2212x ) are zero or negative. The resulting mean bias is -4.3 cm. A negative bias is expected because the spatially-derived z pk\u2212x will always report the maximum surface elevation, while the temporally-derived z pk\u2212t may not always sample this value. When the temporal peak-tracking method samples at relatively sparse cross-shore locations (1-m spacing), the location through which the wave peak passed at a given time may occur between sample locations. The resultant bias theoretically approaches zero as the spacing between sampling points approaches zero. Benetazzo et al. (2017) quantifieda similar difference between temporal and spatial sampling protocols, reporting that rogue waves are observed more frequently when searched for in space and time than when using time series alone. The rmsd (21 cm) for H x relative to H t is similar to that of z tr\u2212x relative to z tr\u2212t , but the nrmsd (0.79) and mean bias (0.57 cm) are lower because of the close agreement between z pk\u2212x and z pk\u2212t . The scatter and mean bias of H relative to H t are small and almost identical to that of z pk\u2212x relative to z pk\u2212t . Since using z tr\u2212x severely limits our ability to calculate H across the full transect, and there is a relatively small and predictable bias (-4 cm) in H when z tr\u2212t is used in conjunction with z pk\u2212x , we conclude that H = z pk\u2212x \u2212 z tr\u2212t is a valid metric of wave height. (x pk , t pk ) is still noisy, as illustrated by the solid line in Figure 2.9b. However, the skewed-Gaussian tracked peaks (x pk ,t pk ) provide a more smoothly varying wave speed estimatec (dotted line in Figure 2.9b) via the same smoothing method. The overall variance of the wave speed distributions is also reduced, as shown by the red curve in Figure 2.11. The mean, mode, and standard deviation for c are 6.44 ms \u22121 , 5.85 ms \u22121 , and 2.23 ms \u22121 , respectively. For c, the mean and mode are not significantly different at 6.21 ms \u22121 and 5.75 ms \u22121 , respectively, and the standard deviation is slightly reduced to 1.72 ms \u22121 . Figure 2.11: Wave speed estimated discretely (black bars), c via the 5-point regression method (blue curve) on peaks tracked in the interpolated LIDAR profiles (x pk , t pk ), andc from 5-point regression on the skewed-Gaussian fitted peaks (x pk ,t pk )."}, {"section_title": "Phase Speed", "text": "Wave energy flux calculations require the mean energy transport velocity, called the group speed. Given shallow water linear wave theory assumptions, the group speed is approximately equal to the individual wave phase speed. Dynamically, c represents the tracked peak speed, or crest speed, whilec represents the wave form speed. Of the two metrics,c is the better metric to estimate phase speed. The ratio of crest speed and wave form speed (c/c) may be of interest for predicting wave breaking, similar to the way the ratio of crest speed to phase speed is used in models that resolve the free surface and water particle velocities (Zijlema et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Wave Slope", "text": "Similar to wave phase speed, wave slope can vary greatly depending on the chosen metric and the region of the wave face used to estimate slope. Of the four metrics defined in Section 2.3.1 and illustrated in Figure 2.9c, we will examine two here: the linear fit wave slope, m , and the geometric wave slope, \u03b7/L . those regions are also highly variable (largest rmsd and nrmsd). Using the upper 50% of the wave face (Figure 2.12b) produces smaller bias and rmsd than the upper 20%, but the density plot shows many instances where m is almost twice \u03b7/L . The opposite trend is seen using the full wave face (Figure 2.12d). The cross-shore location of the wave trough is typically far from the wave peak, which results in a small m and a negative bias. Based on the minimal scatter and bias reported in Figure 2.12c, we find that m best estimates the geometric wave slope \u03b7/L when the upper 80% of the wave face is included in the linear fit. The fit to this region is least susceptible to variability due to small shape changes near the crest and avoids bias due to curvature of the wave face near the trough.  Undetermined-type breakers, breakers whose onset was not observed by the pier IR camera, exhibit the next highest wave slopes, followed by spilling breakers.  (Carini et al., 2015). Some of the lower historical wave slopes were tuned to provide good agreement between the modeled and estimated bulk wave energy flux across the full surf zone for a range of wave conditions (Dally and Brown, 1995;Reniers and Battjes, 1997;Ruessink et al., 2001). Others were estimated from sea surface time series using assumptions of shallow water linear wave theory (Carini et al., 2015). The largest historical wave slope, 12.6 \u2022 , was directly measured from photographs of spilling breakers in the laboratory by (Duncan, 1981) and agrees well with the 50 th percentile of m for spilling breakers (11.82 \u2022 ). Our results support more recent wave slope estimates, made directly from surf zone LIDAR profiles (Martins et al., 2018) or modeled and validated with laboratory data (Haller and Catalan, 2009), which range from 10 \u2022 to 30 \u2022 . While the linearly fit wave slope (fit to the upper 80% of the wave face) is a straightforward and robust metric, it may not be appropriate for estimating slope for waves with large concavity. Near the onset of plunging, a higher order fitting function, such as a parabolic fit to the wave face, might better describe its curvature. The skewed-Gaussian wave-form fit is also a promising tool for tracking the steepening of a wave prior to breaking. Chapter 3 focuses on the evolution of wave parameters near the onset of breaking and includes analysis of the maximum gradient of the skewed-Gaussian fit, m SG , and the quadratic fit wave slope, m q , which are most appropriate for steep and nearly overturning spilling and plunging breakers."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This work presents detailed methodology for LIDAR and IR data fusion to track, measure, and classify breaking waves in the surf zone. We compare existing and new wave metrics for wave height, wave speed, and wave slope. We compute metrics of wave height, wave speed, and wave slope, on a wave-by-wave basis. Wave height, H, is calculated as the difference between the spatially-derived peak elevation and the temporally-derived trough elevation. Extracting peak elevations from the full spatial wave profiles guarantees that the true peak elevation of the wave is sampled, and extracting trough elevations from the times series (collocated with the tracked wave peaks) provides trough elevations even if the trough location is beyond the field of view of the LIDAR transect at the time the peak is observed. We compare H to H t (computed using the time series alone) for context, and find good agreement with an rmsd of 7.1 cm, an nrmsd of 0.25, and the mean bias is -4.3 cm (H t \u2264 H). Computing wave speed with the LIDAR data, we find that variability is mitigated with a 5-point moving linear regression of the tracked peaks (t pk , x pk ) and provides a more robust estimate of wave phase speed than discrete point-to-point differentiation, x/ t. Using a linear fit to the upper 80% of the wave face yields a robust estimate of wave slope that correlates strongly with the geometric wave slope, \u03b7/L (Figure 2.5b)  WAves till SHore or SWASH (Zijlema et al., 2011), are time-dependent and conserve mass and momentum at a discrete level. In SWASH, the sea surface elevation is modeled in space and time, which allows for breaking criteria, such as a critical wave speed or wave steepness, to be assessed on a wave-by-wave basis and for wave shape changes to be tracked as breakers develop. Phase-averaged models, such as Simulating WAves Nearshore or SWAN (Booij et al., 1997), operate using a spectral action balance equation. In SWAN, energy dissipation due to wave breaking is parameterized using the Battjes and Janssen (1978) bore model, which determines the portion of the wave height spectra that breaks using the breaker parameter \u03b3 = H/h, the ratio of wave height to water depth. Phase-resolving models are often used for basic research about wave mechanics and as input for phase-averaged models, which are larger scale and used for predictive and hind-cast projects. Traditionally, \u03b3 is estimated as a bulk statistic, using the significant wave height, H s , or the root-mean-squared wave height, H rms , and the mean water depth,h. For example, Sallenger and Holman (1985) found 0.32 < \u03b3 rms < 0.42 in the inner surf zone and 0.4 < \u03b3 rms < 0.8 seaward of a shore-parallel sandbar at Duck, NC, the site of this current study. Both Sallenger and Holman (1985) and Raubenheimer et al. (1996) found that \u03b3 is not correlated with offshore wave steepness, the ratio of deep water wave height to deep water wavelength H 0 /L 0 , but \u03b3 is positively correlated with local beach slope, \u03b2. Apotsos et al. (2008) tested empirical and modeled formulations for bulk \u03b3 from Thornton and Guza (1983), Battjes and Janssen (1978), Lippmann et al. (1996), Battjes (2007), Baldock et al. (1998), and Whitford (1988) against field data collected at three different sites (Duck, NC, La Jolla, CA, and the Netherlands) and found that no universal value predicts breaking on all beaches. After tuning \u03b3 to optimize model performance across the three beaches, mean \u03b3 varied between 0.2 and 0.66 (Apotsos et al., 2008). When \u03b3 is modeled on a wave-by-wave basis the range increases to include 0.6 < \u03b3 < 1.4 (Chella et al., 2015). There are very few studies of \u03b3 for individual waves in the field. Suhayda and Pettigrew (1977) analyzed 10 plunging breakers at Rockley Beach, Barbados, and found that \u03b3 increased as the waves approached the breakpoint and decreased following the onset of breaking. At Virginia Beach, Weishar and Byrne (1978) tracked 116 waves and found \u03b3 = 0.78 on average, but that there was a significant difference between \u03b3 for plunging and non-plunging breakers. This chapter analyzes \u03b3 on a wave-by-wave basis for a large dataset to investigate reasons why \u03b3 varies widely across different beaches and even at a single beach. Given that \u03b3 is often correlated with parameters used to predict breaker type, such as beach slope and wave steepness, it is reasonable to suggest that \u03b3 varies with breaker type. To that end, the relationships between \u03b3, beach slope, wave steepness, and breaker type are investigated. First, we briefly summarize the methods used to track and classify breakers in the surf zone using LIDAR line-scans and IR imagery (see Chapter 2 for details). Second, results are presented from spatial analysis of key wave parameters near the onset of breaking, specifically, the breaker parameter \u03b3 = H/h, wave face slope, and wave phase speed. Third, the predictive capabilities of \u03b3, wave face slope, and the Miche steepness criteria are explored. Last, we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results for nearshore wave models.  \nUsing cross-shore LIDAR line-scans and IR imagery, we track and classify over 4200 waves to evaluate the conditions for the onset of wave breaking in the surf zone. This remote sensing data fusion enables the segregation of waves into non-breaking, spilling, plunging, and undetermined type breaker classes. The spatial and temporal resolution of the LIDAR allows for direct computation of \u03b3, wave face slope, and wave phase speed at every instant each wave is tracked across the surf zone. We find that mean \u03b3 calculated from all the observed waves agrees with previous in situ time-series estimations of \u03b3 at Duck, NC. When further segregated by breaker type and examined as a function of cross-shore position, plunging breakers exhibit larger \u03b3 than spilling breakers. This suggests that the variability in \u03b3 reported from other field observations (0.4< \u03b3 <1.2) may be due in part to variability in the dominant breaker type at each study site. Using a normalized cross-shore coordinate, the evolution of \u03b3, \u03b8 q , andc was examined about the breakpoint for spilling and plunging breakers. Both \u03b3 and \u03b8 q increase to a maximum near the onset of breaking, with plunging breakers achieving 15% higher \u03b3 and 18-36% steeper wave slopes than spilling breakers. There is no statistically significant difference between wave speedc for spilling and plunging breakers, and both breaker types exhibit an increased wave speed at the onset of breaking. On average,c is better described by solitary wave theory than shallow water linear wave theory. On average, c sol is biased low, with c/c sol =0.95, and c lin is biased high, withc/c lin =1.23. We robustly characterize the \u03b3 and wave slope \u03b8 q parameter space for the surf zone. The likelihood of observing non-breaking versus breaking waves or spilling versus plunging breakers based on \u03b3 and \u03b8 q is useful for determining appropriate breaking limits for nearshore wave models and also helps describe the continuum of breaker type. The transition from nonbreaking to breaking estimated using \u03b3 and wave face slope (\u03b3 = \u22120.049\u03b8 q + 1.41) could be incorporated into nearshore models to improve the parameterization of wave breaking. While a similar equation for the transition from spilling to plunging is not statistically supported by this dataset, there is a discernible relationship between \u03b3 and \u03b8 q with respect to breaker type that may be defined with the inclusion of more data. If wave face slope is not resolved by the model, we suggest utilizing the relationship between wave slope (fit to the upper 80% of the wave face) and the ratio of the sea surface elevation to the modified wavelength, the wavelength shoreward of the wave crest, presented in Figure 2.12. We note that further investigation or assumptions would be required to relate the modified wavelength to the full wavelength, which is typically computed in nearshore wave models. As a final extension, we test a shallow water Miche steepness criteria for the onset of breaking and find that it underestimates the breaking rates for most plunging and spilling breakers. However, 99.0% of non-breaking waves fall below the Miche limit, and 90.5% of non-breaking waves fall below the most conservative Miche-type breaking limit derived from the spilling breaker data. Bulk statistics or critical values near the onset of breaking are still helpful especially if the modeled beach is known to be dominated by one type of breaker. If processes forced on shorter time and spatial scales are of interest, then an accurate, local critical \u03b3 or critical wave steepness (from wave face slope or the Miche criteria) is important. Ultimately, these geometric and kinematic differences at the onset of spilling and plunging breakers imply a difference in the wave energy dissipation rates. This topic will be explored in future research. Chapter 4\nUsing the LIDAR and IR-derived wave parameters defined in Chapter 2 and analyzed in  for plunging breakers will be missed. The bore model estimates wave energy dissipation rate using the wave height, water depth, mean wave period, and B, the fraction of wave height covered by the bore (set to 1). The bore model predicts maximum dissipation rate at the onset of breaking for both spilling and plunging breakers. However, high dissipation rate for plunging breakers is concentrated very near the onset of breaking, with a quick drop off to lower dissipation rates starting at x = \u22120.05. Whereas, the dissipation rate for spilling breakers gradually decreases as the breaker develops, decreasing to 50% of the onset dissipation rate by x = \u22120.39. The roller model is also used to estimate wave energy dissipation rate for spilling and plunging breakers based on roller length, wave slope, mean wave period, and a constant that represents both the roller geometry and its density relative to that of sea water. Using the roller model, no statistically significant difference is found between dissipation rates for spilling and plunging breakers. The most likely explanation and source of error for the roller model is the effect of multipath reflection on the automated roller detection algorithm. Multipath IR reflections along a steeply sloped wave face amplify the thermal radiation received by the IR camera and either result in a roller identified in the absence of foam (just prior to onset) or a roller of artificially increased length (just after onset). The ensembleaveraged wave profiles of the probability of active foam strongly suggest that the former occurs for plunging breakers and the latter for both breaker types. These data limitations prohibit any substantial conclusions about wave energy dissipation rates estimated using the roller model.

In the current analysis, we focus on the quadratic-fit wave slope, \u03b8 q , defined as the maximum slope achieved along the wave face by the parabola fitted to the upper 80% of the wave face ( Figures 3.3a and 3.3c). This wave slope metric is particularly useful for waves near the onset of breaking whose wave face may display some degree of concavity. Wave slope may also be estimated as the maximum slope achieved by the SG fitted profiles along the upper 80% of the wave face, \u03b8 SG (Figure 3.3c). As detailed in Chapter 2, the SG fitted profile peaks provide a more robust estimate of wave speed than using the raw LIDAR-tracked wave peaks. Therefore, the instantaneous wave speed presented in this analysis is defined from the SG profiles and denotedc ( Figures 3.3d and 3.3h). Wavelength is estimated as L =cT , where T is the trough-to-trough wave period from the time series extracted at the location of the tracked wave peak. We note that the interpolated bathymetry has a significant impact on h, and thus also on \u03b3. Appendix A shows that the time-weighted interpolated bathymetry agrees reasonably with the depth profiles estimated by inverting solitary wave theory using the measured wave speeds.

Figure 3.4a shows the \u03b3-distribution for all tracked waves (N = 4290), with a mean and standard deviation of 0.49 and 0.27, respectively. The next tier segregates waves into three categories: non-breaking waves (Figure 3.4b), onset-observed breakers ( Figure   3.4c), and breakers of undetermined type (Figure 3.4d). The \u03b3-distribution for non-breaking waves (N = 2627) closely resembles that for all waves, but exhibits a smaller mean \u03b3 of 0.40. The mean \u03b3 for breakers whose onset was observed (N = 524) is 0.67, the largest mean \u03b3 for this tier, and the mean \u03b3 for undetermined type breakers (N = 1139) is slightly lower at 0.60.

For the offshore transect, \u03b3 P is greater than \u03b3 s across the entire transect, peaking at 0.82 and decreasing shoreward to about 0.70. \u03b3 S and \u03b3 U again exhibit similar behavior, this time matching \u03b3 s , rather than \u03b3 rms , at values between 0.65 and 0.68. For non-breaking waves, \u03b3 N lies below all other estimates and is approximately constant at 0.40 from the offshore to onshore transect until x <155 m, when \u03b3 N increases slightly to 0.47. In nearshore wave models, the critical \u03b3 value derived from solitary wave theory, \u03b3 sol = 0.78, is often employed to trigger breaking in the surf zone. Non-breaking waves, spilling breakers, and undetermined type breakers all maintain a mean \u03b3 less than \u03b3 sol across the surf zone, though the distributions of \u03b3 for spilling and undetermined type breakers do contain some values above this limit for the offshore transect. Bin-averaged \u03b3 P exceeds \u03b3 sol for x >198 m and briefly at x=165 m. While the cross-shore, bin-averaged \u03b3 S and \u03b3 P mirror the type of information included in nearshore wave models, averaging based on cross-shore position obscures maximum \u03b3 values that may be achieved near the onset of breaking."}, {"section_title": "Evolution of \u03b3, \u03b8, and c Near the Onset of Breaking", "text": "To examine the evolution of \u03b3 about the breakpoint for spilling and plunging breakers we create ensemble-averaged wave profiles. Regardless of breaker type or location of the transect within the surf zone, \u03b3 increases to a maximum or peak at the onset of breaking. For the onshore transect, \u03b3 reaches a maximum of 0.63 for spilling breakers and 0.73 for plunging breakers at the onset of breaking. For spilling breakers, this peak \u03b3 is maintained as the breakers develop. For plunging breakers, \u03b3 is more variable during breaker development, because the tracked wave heights are variable due to the drastic shape changes, secondary plunging events, and splash up that are typical of plunging breakers. However, \u03b3 P does gradually approach \u03b3 S within one wavelength of the breakpoint. Using a two-sided t-test, we find that \u03b3 S and \u03b3 P are statistically different at the 95% confidence level within one-half wavelength (in both directions) of the breakpoint.    are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, based on a two-sided t-test.

Finally, we examine the evolution of wave speed about the breakpoint. Figure 3.8 presents wave speed,c, estimated using the skewed-Gaussian fitted profiles as a function of normalized cross-shore coordinate. Wave speed peaks just after the onset of breaking for both spilling and plunging breakers. Using a two-sided t-test at 95% confidence level, we find that there is no statistically significant difference between spillingc and plungingc for the onshore or offshore transects. However, for a given breaker type,c is statistically different within approximately one-third wavelength of the breakpoint for the onshore and offshore transects. For the onshore transect, the peakc lies between 6.8 m s \u22121 and 7.2 m s \u22121 .

The black line in (a) is a linear fit to the support vector points: \u03b3 = \u22120.049\u03b8 q + 1.41. A transition region, where there is roughly equal probability of observing a non-breaking or breaking wave, spans a parameter space where 10 \u2022 < \u03b8 q < 20 \u2022 and 0.45 < \u03b3 < 0.8. Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling is a form of machine-learning that can be used  Figure 3.9a, is then fit with a line, using a robust fitting method that excludes outliers. For the transition from non-breaking to breaking, the linear fit yields \u03b3 = \u22120.049\u03b8 q + 1.41. The 95% confidence bounds on the slope and intercept are (-0.067, -0.031) and (1.13, 1.69), respectively. Finally, to assess the predictive power of \u03b3, \u03b8 q , and the combination of the two parameters, a multivariate linear regression is performed of the type y and x 2 is \u03b3. Table 3.1 shows that, based on both the p-value and t-test, \u03b8 q alone is most predictive of breaking. The product of \u03b8 q and \u03b3 is also a significant predictor, but \u03b3 alone is not a significant predictor of breaking. Using only the breaking wave data, Figure 3.9b reports the probability of observing a spilling or plunging breaker for a given (\u03b8 q ,\u03b3) pair. Spilling breakers mostly occupy the smaller wave face slopes and lower \u03b3 values, and plunging breakers occupy the larger wave face slopes and higher \u03b3 values.  Figure 3.9b. While it appears reasonable to distinguish spilling from plunging breakers by drawing a nearly vertical line through the support vector points, they are not well-fit by a line. Again, a multivariate linear analysis is performed to assess the predictive power of \u03b3, \u03b8 q , and the combination of the two parameters. Table 3.2 shows that the combination of \u03b8 q and \u03b3 is the most predictive of breaking. \u03b3 alone is also a significant predictor, but \u03b8 q alone is not a significant predictor of breaking. In addition to the direct measurement of wave face slope, we estimate a local wave steepness, H/L, to test the Miche criteria, which predicts breaking at a critical steepness when (Miche, 1944). To our knowledge, this is the first field verification of the Miche breaking criteria for depth-limited breaking in the surf zone. 95.5% fall below the limit estimated from onset plunging breakers, and 90.5% fall below the limit estimated from onset spilling breakers. We note that L and k are both estimated from measuredc and T , and thus introduce correlation between the independent and dependent axes. Nevertheless, this correlation does not overwhelm the signal, as evidenced by the non-breaking waves, which lie well below the Miche limit and cover a range of values. "}, {"section_title": "Implications for Modeling Wave Breaking Using \u03b3", "text": "Previous experiments at Duck, NC, have reported a critical breaker parameter of 0.4 < \u03b3 s < 0.8 (Sallenger and Holman, 1985), where \u03b3 s is calculated using the significant wave height from time series data and does not distinguish between breaking and non-breaking waves. The distributions of spatially-tracked \u03b3 (Figure 3.4) compare reasonably to this range for every subset of the data. The mean \u03b3 values increase as expected from 0.40 for non-breaking waves, to 0.60 for undetermined type breakers, to 0.65 for spilling breakers, and finally to 0.75 for plunging breakers. On average, we find that \u03b3 for plunging breakers is 15% larger than for spilling breakers. A wide range of \u03b3 s has been reported from field experiments at other beaches, 0.2 < \u03b3 s < 1.2 (Apotsos et al., 2008), and a consistent correlation has been found between local beach slope, \u03b2, and \u03b3 s , where \u03b3 s increases with increasing beach steepness (Sallenger and Holman, 1985;Raubenheimer et al., 1996). We find 0.65 < \u03b3 s < 0.70 for the offshore transect where 0 < \u03b2 < 0.02 and 0.70 < \u03b3 s < 0.75 for the onshore transect where 0.02 < \u03b2 < 0.04. These \u03b3 s values are greater than what is predicted based on the \u03b3 s -\u03b2 dependency shown in Figure 7 of Raubenheimer et al. (1996) or Sallenger and Holman (1985). However, we do see different patterns of \u03b3 evolution for the offshore and onshore transects that are most likely attributable to differences in local beach slope. For the onshore transect (Figure 3.6a), the bathymetry monotonically decreases and the transect is close to the shoreline (x \u2248 100 m). After the breakpoint, H and h decrease in such a way as to maintain relatively constant \u03b3 values for both spilling and plunging breakers. For the offshore transect (Figure 3.6b), the bathymetry plateaus, therefore h changes very little. Following the onset of breaking, H decreases but h remains constant, so \u03b3 decreases as the spilling and plunging breakers develop. The increase and decrease of \u03b3 about the breakpoint was also observed in a study of 10 surf zone breakers by Suhayda and Pettigrew (1977), but has not been confirmed more robustly in the field until now. Interestingly, the breakpoint observed by Suhayda and Pettigrew (1977) occurred just before a plateau of the bathymetry and the measurements spanned a similar spatial scale (30-40 m). The variation of \u03b3 with breaker type is reasonable and expected based on evidence in the literature. Sallenger and Holman (1985) and Raubenheimer et al. (1996) found \u03b3 to vary with local beach slope, but to be independent of offshore wave steepness. Here, Figure 3.6 shows that local beach slope influences the evolution of \u03b3 about the onset of breaking, and Figure 3.9 shows that \u03b3 is correlated with local wave slope. Since local beach slope and wave steepness (or wave slope) are predictors of breaker type (Galvin, 1968), it follows that \u03b3 would vary with breaker type. Therefore, our results suggest that for a beach exhibiting mixed breaker types, parameterizing wave energy dissipation due to breaking using a single \u03b3 value does not accurately represent the breaking dynamics (Figure 3.6). For instance, based on the critical \u03b3 for SWAN of 0.78 (derived from solitary wave theory), if all waves become spilling breakers, the predicted breakpoint would be onshore of the measured breakpoint, for which \u03b3 = 0.63 \u2212 0.71. However, the predicted breakpoint would be fairly accurate if all waves become plunging breakers, whose measured breakpoint occurs for \u03b3 = 0.73 \u2212 0.81. For mixed breaker type wave conditions, using a single critical \u03b3 would yield wave breaking patterns that are either too concentrated or too evenly distributed across the surf zone, which has consequences for wave-driven circulation and sediment transport predictions."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Modeling Wave Breaking Using Wave Face Slope", "text": "Wave face slope follows a similar pattern of evolution about the breakpoint. These trends are indicative of wave shape changes that spilling and plunging breakers undergo as they develop into steady state bores. The shape of a spilling breaker, even at the onset of breaking, is similar to that of the steady state bore into which it is developing, which may account for the relatively constant wave slope following onset. In contrast, plunging breakers undergo a dramatic shape change as they transition to steady state bores, which is consistent with the highly variable wave slope following onset. SWASH, a phase-resolved nearshore wave model, determines the onset of breaking by using a critical local surface steepness threshold of 0.6, which is roughly equivalent to a wave slope of 30 \u2022 . To our knowledge, this limit has not been field-tested. This steepness criteria for breaking matches the critical wave slope we estimate for plunging breakers (\u03b8 q = 30 \u2022 ), though spilling breakers exhibit lower wave slope at the breakpoint (22 \u2022 < \u03b8 q < 25.5 \u2022 )."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Modeling Wave Breaking Using Wave Speed", "text": "Measured wave speed,c, also peaks near the onset of breaking.

On average,c/c lin = 1.23 for spilling and plunging breakers combined, which is further from a ratio of one than the meanc/c sol = 0.95. This agrees with laboratory and field studies of the surf zone, which found that solitary and shock wave speed predictions generally agree with measured wave speeds and out-perform shallow water linear wave theory and bore theory (Postacchini and Brocchini, 2014;Tissier et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "ENERGETICS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Spilling and plunging breakers transform and dissipate energy differently across the surf zone Kirby, 1995, 1996), which affects the spatial and temporal distribution of wave forcing responsible for generating alongshore and cross-shore currents, suspending sediment, and enhancing air-sea gas exchange.

Therefore, they do not account for differences in energy dissipation rate due to breaker type (i.e., spilling versus plunging) or due to different breaker dynamics during the initial stages of breaking, prior to the wave achieving steady state.

Reflection depends on beach steepness, tidal elevation, and wavelength, and has been reported to range from 3% to 18% of the incoming wave energy at our study site (Elgar et al., 1994). Wave energy flux is defined as, where wave energy, E, is estimated according to linear theory as a function of water density \u03c1, gravitational acceleration g, and the root-mean-squared wave height across the surf zone and group speed c g may be approximated by phase speed c under shallow water linear wave theory assumptions. Energy may also be written in terms of the significant wave height, In situ estimation of wave energy dissipation typically requires an array of instruments that measure wave height across the surf zone, along with an estimate of wave phase speed, which is most commonly made using water depth based on shallow water linear wave theory, c lin = \u221a gh (Thornton and Guza, 1986;Elgar et al., 1994;Madsen et al., 1997;Ruessink et al., 2001;Feddersen, 2012). The wave energy dissipation rate is discretely computed as the wave energy flux gradient between instrument positions, Nearshore wave models can be verified by assessing the wave energy balance across the surf zone, using data collected in intermediate or deep water to estimate the incoming energy flux and data collected within the inner surf zone to estimate the energy flux after breaking. However, this comparison does not resolve spatial or temporal patterns of wave energy dissipation that occur on a scale less than the instrument spacing, which is typically greater than 10 m. Remote sensing technologies provide broad spatial coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution, which enable the investigation of such patterns by decreasing the distance between sampling locations Evaluation of the right hand side of equation 4.1, depend on the chosen formulation of break . We will test two common parameterizations of energy dissipation due to breaking, the bore model and the roller model."}, {"section_title": "Hydraulic Bore Model", "text": "The most common model for break in equation 4.1 is a hydraulic jump or bore. In a hydraulic bore, (schematic shown in Figure 4.1) energy is lost in the turbulent motions of a hydraulic jump, which implies the direct transformation of wave motion into turbulent motion. The decrease of wave energy throughout the propagation of a turbulent bore occurs simultaneously with the decrease in total momentum flux. In other words, for a breaking wave that has reached a steady state bore phase, wave forcing is occurring instantaneously, at the same time and place as the breaking. Following Le Mehaute (1962), the energy dissipation rate of a breaking wave is estimated from a bore or hydraulic jump of equivalent height (Stoker, 2011), In equation 4.6, h 1 and h 2 are the water depth ahead of and behind the bore, respectively (as in Figure 4.1), and Q is the volume discharge per unit area across the bore. The volume discharge may be estimated under steady conditions as Q = ch/L, where c is the wave speed, h is the mean water depth, and L is the wavelength. In the numerator of equation 4.6, the distance h 2 \u2212 h 1 represents the peak-to-trough wave height H. For the hydraulic bore model, wave height is modulated by a coefficient B, a calibration factor of order 1, conceptualized as the fraction of the wave face covered by the turbulent bore, as shown in Figure 4.1 (Le Mehaute, 1962). Using these substitutions and the assumption that we estimate the average energy dissipation per unit area in a breaking wave as, As stated, equation 4.7 is deterministic and represents the average energy dissipation per unit area in a single breaking wave. However, nearshore wave models propagate a spectrum of waves onshore and the energy dissipated when some proportion of that spectrum breaks, for a given water depth, must be estimated statistically. To that end, wave height and wave period statistics, as well as a predictor of the fraction of waves that break, Q b , are used in the wave-averaged dissipation rate: There are several parameterizations for Q b at a given location (or water depth) (including Baldock et al., 1998;Ruessink et al., 2003;Janssen and Battjes, 2007) by Thornton and Guza (1983)). A thorough testing of several parameterizations by Apotsos et al. (2008) found that no one parameterization out-performs the others and \u03b3 must be tuned to each field site."}, {"section_title": "Wave Roller Model", "text": "Numerical models (Iafrati, 2011) and field measurements (Feddersen, 2012)  Here, \u03b8 is the slope of the breaking wave face and \u03c1 is the density of the aerated roller. In Duncan (1981), the roller density is \u03c1 /\u03c1 = 0.61, but this ratio ranges from 0.4 to 0.87 in the literature. A diagram of the roller is shown in Figure 4.2. Duncan (1981) found the geometry of the breaking region to be self-similar by showing that the aspect ratio, the ratio of its thickness to its length, was constant for all observed breakers, 0.01. (4.10) This observation allows A to be eliminated from (4.9). The Duncan (1981) wave roller parameterization provides a framework for estimating energy dissipation due to spilling breakers on a wave-by-wave basis using roller length, wave slope and density of the breaking region. However, the relationship between A and L r and the ratio of \u03c1 to \u03c1 in the field remain unknown, mainly because they are extremely difficult to measure. Therefore, we form a general roller model that makes no assumptions about these relationships. The average energy dissipation per unit area given by the roller model is, where andT is the average wave period. The wave roller model has been tested in the laboratory and the field for steady state spilling breakers. Haller and Catalan (2009) used the D81 wave energy dissipation formula to predict wave height from camera-based roller length estimates and compared the results to measured wave height across a freshwater laboratory surf zone. Results were promising over the limited range of waves produced, and although no direct estimate of wave energy dissipation was made, the authors suggested that the D81 parameterization could be used to estimate wave dissipation in the field. Since then, the wave roller model has been successfully tested in the field to estimate total wave energy dissipation along a cross-shore transect (Carini et al., 2015), map average dissipation rates over a 2D area (D\u00edaz et al., 2017), and estimate wave-by-wave energy dissipation for steady state spilling breakers (Martins et al., 2018).  Because estimating the wave energy flux gradient requires differencing, an operation that amplifies noise in a dataset, a smoothing protocol is implemented on all tracked wave parameters. For wave height, wave period, wave face slope, and wave speed, a 10-point smoothing (loess) is performed for each tracked wave. The loess filter performs a local quadratic (nonlinear) least-squares regression on the data (Schlax and Chelton, 1992), which retains the pattern of evolution of the tracked parameter while reducing its variance.

Individual F profiles for plunging breakers exhibit more variability than spilling breakers. However, the ensembleaveraged profiles show that F decreases steadily after the onset breaking (x < 0) for both spilling and plunging breakers. Prior to breaking (x > 0), F increases, which seemingly disobeys conservation laws. This will be discussed in Section 4.4. Comparing the evolution of F for spilling and plunging breakers in Figure 4.6a confirms that plunging breakers lose energy at a greater rate than spilling breakers just after the onset of breaking. A two-sided t-test confirms that the difference between ensemble-averaged spilling and plunging F profiles is statistically significant for \u22120.1 \u2265 x > \u22120.2. The general trends and range of statistically significant difference for spilling and plunging F are consistent even when the mean wave form speed is used in equation 4.2 instead of the tracked wave form speed, as shown in Figure 4.6b. However, the rate of change of wave energy flux, or the dissipation rate, is effected by the choice of wave speed metric. To estimate this dissipation rate, we fit a line to F over sequential intervals of x . The slopes of these lines correspond to the fraction of normalized wave energy flux lost per wavelength L. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 report the fitted slopes and their 95% confidence intervals  Table 4.1 shows that the dissipation rate is greatest for \u22120.03 \u2265 x > \u22120.2. Over this interval, wave energy flux decreases by about 21% every 0.1L for spilling breakers and by about 30% every 0.1L for plunging breakers. For \u22120.2 \u2265 x > \u22120.3, the rate of change of wave energy flux is approximately equal for spilling and plunging breakers, with wave energy flux decreasing about 14% per 0.1L. Overall, the dissipation rates are lower when estimated using mean wave form speed. For \u22120.03 \u2265 x > \u22120.2, Table 4.2 shows that the rate of change of F ( c ) for spilling breakers is 13% per 0.1L, which is 38% smaller than when the tracked wave form speed is used. Plunging breakers lose 24% per 0.1L over this interval, which is 20% smaller than the dissipation rate estimated using the tracked wave form speed. Next, instead of estimating wave energy flux gradients from the ensemble-averaged profile, we do so for each individual breaker. Figure 4.7 plots the normalized dissipation rate from 0 > x > \u22120.2 for each spilling and plunging breaker as a function of the predictors \u03b3 and \u03b8. Our observations from Section 3.4.1 are confirmed by these 108 individual breakers; as \u03b3 and \u03b8 increase, the breaker type transitions from spilling (marked by circles) to plunging (marked by triangles), with some overlap along the continuum. Most of the plunging breakers exhibit higher initial normalized dissipation rates than the spilling breakers. However, there is no strong correlation between increased \u03b3 and \u03b8 and increased dissipation rate.

The dissipation rate estimates from the bore model and the roller model (evaluated using A/L 2 r and \u03c1 /\u03c1 from Duncan (1981)) are compared to the best estimate of true dissipation rate calculated via equation 4.5. Based on the results for wave energy flux (Figure 4.6), equation 4.5 is evaluated using the tracked wave speedc and the mean wave speed c . We cannot make this comparison on an ensemble-averaged basis because the averaging aliases the impact the observed wave height and wave period distributions, making a wave energy balance untenable. plunging breakers. Note that while it appears the plunging breaker was observed over a shorter distance than the spilling breaker, this is an artifact of the x-axis normalization, as the plunging breaker exhibited a longer average wavelength. In fact, the spilling and plunging breakers were observed for similar real-world distances (27 m and 21 m, respectively) following the onset of breaking. For the spilling breaker, the roller model produces a gradual increase, followed by a gradual decrease in dissipation rate, which mimics F/ x (regardless of wave speed metric used). The maximum value of roller is half that of F(c)/ x, but agrees well with F( c )/ x. Unlike F/ x, roller does not decrease to zero, but plateaus around 500 W m \u22122 for x < \u22120.3. The bore model does not capture the gradual ramp up of dissipation rate. Instead, bore is nearly at its maximum at the onset of breaking. It increases slightly to a peak of 1500 W m \u22122 at x = \u22120.04 and then gradually decreases, plateauing at a value slightly higher than roller at about 650 W m \u22122 for x < \u22120.3. For the plunging breaker, neither the bore model nor the roller model replicate the  Figure 4.10d, the variability in F(c)/ x is dominated by similar variability in measured wave form speed. This is further supported by the much smoother evolution of F( c )/ x, estimated using mean wave form speed. The roller model estimates higher dissipation rate than the bore model and exhibits some variability as the breaker develops, though not in the same way as F(c)/ x. The bore model behaves very similarly for the plunging breaker as observed for the spilling breaker, except it has much smaller magnitude, with a maximum of about 530 W m \u22122 . For 0 > x > \u22120.03 both estimates of F/ x are negative, indicating that there was some other source of energy convergence as the wave crest begins to overturn. This increase in wave energy flux (or corresponding negative wave energy flux gradient, relative to the normalized x-coordinate) was also seen in Figure 4.6 for both spilling and plunging breakers. Prior to the onset of breaking, the wave energy flux should be constant. However, because this analysis was performed along a cross-shore transect, it is possible that energy convergence in the alongshore direction, which is not accounted for, is responsible for the increasing wave energy flux. Ultimately, the observations described here, especially for the individual spilling and plunging breakers, are inconclusive as the variability cannot be definitively ascribed to a single cause. To truly compare dissipation rate models and the wave energy flux gradient, the energy contributions from both the x and y directions must be resolved."}, {"section_title": "Variability & Limitations of the Roller Model", "text": "The roller model is likely not appropriate for plunging breakers near the onset of breaking, because they do not produce a roller until steady state is achieved. However, if the large region of active foam produced just after onset (by the impinging jet, collapsing air cavity, splash up, secondary plunging, etc.) is measured as a proxy roller length, roller could compare favorably with \u2202F/\u2202x. This will be further examined for the example plunging breaker in the next section. For now, we investigate multipath IR reflections as a possible explanation for roller length variability, especially for steep plunging breakers, that would contaminate the normalized and ensemble-averaged roller . Our hypothesis is that increased pixel intensities in the IR imagery due to multipath reflection along steep plunging wave faces (Branch et al., 2014) are falsely identified as active breaking by the automatic breaker detection algorithm. If active breaking is automatically detected prior to the onset of breaking due to steep wave face slope or if the region of active foam is overestimated due to multipath reflections at the toe of the roller, L r will be biased high and roller is subject to errors of O(L 2 r ). We can use ensemble-averaged wave profiles of the automated detection of active foam to further investigate. As expected, the probability of the presence of active foam is near zero along the front face of the pre-onset profiles (Figures 4.11a and 4.11e). The very low, non-zero active foam probabilities observed near the peak of pre-onset spilling and plunging ensemble-averaged profiles are caused by variations in the data, such as sea spray at the crest or IR multipath reflections off the pre-onset wave faces (Branch et al., 2014).

The colors on the front face of the wave indicate the probability of the presence of active foam or aerated roller. for pre-onset ensemble-averaged profiles has a mean of 0.05 and a standard deviation of 0.13, these variations are not deemed meaningful. The effect of IR multipath reflections is much more pronounced for onset plunging breakers. The onset of plunging is manually determined by inspecting the wave-scale IR imagery for the moment the crest begins to overturn. This means that at onset, there is no active foam along the front face of the wave. However, Figure 4.11f shows very high probabilities of roller presence along the front face of the onset plunging ensemble-averaged wave profile. While not all plunging waves were reviewed again, several of those that were confirmed that the automated detection algorithm was triggered by multipath reflection from the steep wave face slope (25 \u2022 -45 \u2022 , Figure 3.9b). These results are supported laboratory measurements by Branch et al. (2014), who found multipath IR reflections were common for steep breakers in imagery collected at large incidence angle, as was the case for the FRF tower-mounted IR camera. For developing plunging breakers (Figure 4.11h), splash up and secondary plunging events (Basco, 1985) produce active foam along a highly variable and turbulent front wave face, and false extension of the roller due to multipath is not likely an issue. For spilling breakers, onset is defined as the moment active foam appears near the peak (Figure 4.11b). In Figures 4.11c and 4.11d, the foam roller gradually extends down the front face of the wave (Basco, 1985). Despite the growth of the roller, the probability of roller presence remains relatively low at 0.5. This implies that there is considerable variability in roller evolution across spilling breakers. Multipath reflections may contribute to roller length variability for spilling breakers, though to a lesser extent than plunging breakers due to their shallower wave slopes (5 \u2022 -25 \u2022 , Figure 3.9b)."}, {"section_title": "Parameterizing Plunging Breakers", "text": "Neither the bore nor roller models can capture the rapid and concentrated dissipation of energy seen for plunging breakers. However, other parameterizations have been developed specifically for plunging breakers. Estimates of the wave energy dissipation due to air entrainment in a plunging breaker vary widely, from 4%-9% of the total wave energy (Blenkinsopp and Chaplin, 2007) to 30%-50% of the total wave energy (Lamarre and Melville, 1991). This large range was investigated by Iafrati (2011), who found through numerical modeling that the energy transferred from a plunging wave into the potential energy accumulated in bubbles accounted for various percentages of the total wave energy according to the wave steepness \u03c3 = ka = H 0 /2L 0 : 10%-15% for \u03c3 = 0.50, 20%-25% for \u03c3 = 0.60, 30%-35% for \u03c3 = 0.65. The Iafrati (2011) numerical simulation of plunging breakers provides guidance about the relative importance of air entrainment to wave energy dissipation, but has not yet been tested in the laboratory or field. Drazen et al. (2008) and Iafrati (2011) use inertial scaling and treat the plunging wave crest as a projectile traveling a ballistic trajectory to model energy dissipation.  where H is the trough to crest height of the plunging breaker at the point of maximum wave steepness, B p is the width of the air cavity, and u c and u t are the speed of the wave crest and wave toe, respectively. The subscript 0.32 references the crest and toe speeds of the steepest non-breaking waves observed in the model. This parameterization could not be tested here, but it could provide an estimate of the energy lost to air entrainment by way of the work needed to submerge an air cavity of size A 0 against the force of buoyancy (Lamarre and Melville, 1991)."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The application of this thesis is two fold: it makes a substantial contribution to the development of surf zone remote sensing methods and it provides geometric, kinematic, and energetic measurements of spilling and plunging breakers near the onset of breaking that are useful for improving nearshore wave models. The surf zone is a challenging environment in which to make measurements, and the data collected are invariably complicated by technology limitations or natural variability. The methods for fusing IR and LIDAR data to classify breaker type is vital to all of the results presented here, and the detailed account of the challenges of this dataset and our proposed solutions are useful for others using IR, LIDAR, or similar remote sensing technologies in the surf zone. The wave parameters analyzed, \u03b3, wave slope, and wave speed, are commonly employed as breaking criteria in nearshore wave models. For phase-averaged models concerned with long timescale or large spatial scale processes, the bulk statistics and critical values of \u03b3 near the onset of breaking are useful. For phase-resolved models focused on short time and spatial scales processes, the local critical values of \u03b3, wave slope, and wave speed are applicable. Potential avenues of future research using this data are discussed later in this chapter."}, {"section_title": "Main Findings", "text": "Chapter 2 presents detailed LIDAR-IR data fusion methodology to track individual waves, classify breaker type, and measure wave parameters in the surf zone. Utilizing the full spatial and temporal resolution of the LIDAR data, we track over 4200 waves. The surf zone-scale IR imagery is used to automatically identify candidate breakers, and the wave-scale IR imagery is manually reviewed to determined the moment of onset and classify breaker type. In IR, an unorganized textured thermal signature on the back face of breaking waves indicates spilling type and an organized streaky thermal pattern indicates plunging type. In total, 524 spilling and plunging breakers are measured. Wave height is calculated as the difference between the spatially-derived peak elevation and the temporally-derived trough elevation, which guarantees that the true peak elevation of the wave is sampled and provides trough elevation even if its location is beyond the instrument field of view. Fitting the wave profiles with a skewed-Gaussian curve and using the fitted wave peaks to estimate instantaneous tracked wave speed produces a smoothly varying wave speed metric that is robust to noise due to spray or rapid wave shape changes. This wave speed metric is the best possible approximation (given the current dataset) of the wave phase speed. Four metrics of wave face slope are examined. When fitting a wave slope, the most robust estimate is achieved by using the upper 80% of the wave face. As expected, plunging breakers exhibit the steepest linear-fit wave slopes, though the quadratic fit or skewed-Gaussian fit wave slope may be more appropriate as the concavity increases near the onset of breaking. Chapter 3 presents analysis of three key breaking wave parameters on a wave-by-wave basis: \u03b3 (the ratio of wave height to water depth), wave face slope, and wave phase speed. The range of \u03b3 calculated on a wave-by-wave basis agrees with previous in situ time-series estimations of \u03b3 at Duck, NC. Across the surf zone, we find that plunging breakers exhibit larger \u03b3 than spilling breakers, which suggests that the reported variability in \u03b3 (0.4< \u03b3 <1.2) from other field observations could be attributed to natural variability in the dominant breaker type at a given beach. \u03b3, wave slope, and wave speed all reach their maximum value at or just after the onset of breaking. Plunging breakers exhibit 15% larger \u03b3 values and 18-36% steeper wave slopes than spilling breakers, but there is no statistically significant difference for wave speed. Together, \u03b3 and wave slope are strong predictors of breaking and breaker type. We also test the Miche steepness criteria for the onset of breaking in shallow water and find that there is a clear separation between breaking and non-breaking waves, with 99% of non-breaking waves falling below the Miche limit. However, the strict Miche limit applies only for some of the observed plunging breakers, and would underestimate the breaking rates for most plunging and spilling breakers. Chapter 4 presents a comparison of the wave energy flux gradient with dissipation rates from the bore model and roller model. For plunging breakers, the ensemble-averaged wave energy flux decreases at a rate up to 1.4 times that of spilling breakers within 0.2 wavelengths of the onset of breaking. When investigated on a wave-by-wave basis, plunging breakers again exhibit larger dissipation rates than spilling breakers, though the dissipation rates do not show correlation with the \u03b3-\u03b8 parameter space used to predict breaking and breaker type. For plunging breakers, the ensemble-averaged bore model estimates high dissipation rates concentrated very near the onset of breaking followed by a sharp decline, while for spilling breakers, the dissipation rate gradually decreases from its maximum value at onset as the breakers develop. There is no statistically significant difference in the ensemble-averaged roller model dissipation rates for spilling and plunging breakers. The influence of multipath IR reflections on roller length estimates is the most likely cause of the large uncertainty in roller-based dissipation estimates. When analyzing a single breaker of each type, neither the bore nor the roller model capture the pattern of dissipation rate within 0.2 wavelengths of the onset for the plunging breaker."}, {"section_title": "Future Directions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Automated Breaker Type Classification", "text": "One of the strengths of this work is the volume of waves analyzed. However, this only represents about 10 hours out of almost two weeks worth of data. There are legitimate reasons for limiting the dataset. First, all necessary instruments (two IR cameras and one LIDAR) must be operational at the same time. This was not always the case as systems inevitably malfunction and must be fixed during a field experiment. Second, the wave conditions must include frequent breaking. This produces foam, which serves as a diffuse reflector for the LIDAR. In order to achieve dense returns along the cross-shore transect, sufficient foam must persist on the sea surface. Third, it is time-consuming to manually review the onset of breaking and classify breaker types. The first two limitations can only be addressed with a new field experiment or different instrumentation. However, there are remedies for the third limitation, and methods for handling and processing large datasets are an area of active research. Motivated by the need for automated breaker classification and encouraged by the distinct IR signatures of spilling and plunging breakers, Buscombe and Carini (2019) trained a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) to predict breaker type based on the wave-scale IR imagery. This work is part of only a handful of studies that used deep learning on geophysical imagery, and the first to address surf zone hydrodynamics. Processing over 400,000 images at 1 Hz, the DCNN model classifies breaker type (one type per image) with accuracies (F1 scores) of 0.97, 0.81, and 0.74, for non-breaking, spilling, and plunging waves, respectively. This result demonstrates the the DCNN is sensitive to subtle variations of IR image tone, contrast, saturation, and texture that collectively indicate a changing dynamic state, while being robust to variation in lighting, significant textural variation within a given breaker type, and a small training set of images. In analyzing the results, we found that the frequency of occurrence of plunging classifications increases as significant wave height and peak wave period increase, as shown in Figure 5.1. The opposite trend is seen for spilling classifications. This motivates one area of continued research: using the DCNN results to investigate the continuum of breaker type. Breaking waves exist along a continuum between spilling and plunging (and collapsing and surging). For each image classified, the DCNN ascribes a probability for each class, where each probability can vary between 0 and 1, and the three classes do not sum to one. An example is shown in Figure 5.2. We hypothesize that those waves whose DCNN classification is not dominated by any one class, but instead more evenly split between spilling and plunging, are examples of waves that exist along the continuum between spilling and plunging. To prove this hypothesis, we need to show that the DCNN classification probabilities produce consistent trends with respect to the breaker type continuum. While the human eye and brain are capable of recognizing an \"in-between\" spilling and plunging type breaking in the imagery, for an objective analysis, we must define the breaker type continuum based on measurable wave parameters. One option would be to use the \u03b3 and wave slope relationships presented in this thesis to parameterize the breaker continuum."}, {"section_title": "3D Sea Surface Reconstruction & EO-IR Data Fusion Applications", "text": "Stereo imaging methods rely on feature matching across image pairs, and most stereo image processing software were developed for EO imagery, which typically have O(10-100 Megapixels). Our IR cameras have 640x480 (307,200) pixels, and both commercial software Photo-Scan and the Waves Acquisition Stereo System (WASS) by Benetazzo (2006) failed to identify enough matched features for sea surface reconstruction due to this coarse resolution. However, stereo EO imagery collected during ROLLEX and preliminary work by Ladner and Palmsten (2017) shows successful reconstruction of a region of the sea surface that overlaps the wave-scale IR imagery FOV ( Figure 5.3). Stereo reconstruction of the sea surface would expand the dataset by capturing more instances of waves at onset of breaking (not limited to the alongshore location of the LIDAR Figure 5.3: 3D sea surface reconstruction from stereo pair of EO cameras deployed alongside the IR cameras on the FRF pier during ROLLEX (Ladner and Palmsten, 2017). transect). It could also be used to investigate along-crest variability in wave height, wave slope, roller length, and wave speed, for a more robust examination of breaking criteria. Combining EO and IR imagery may provide a solution for the multipath IR errors in roller identification. The thresholding methods from Carini et al. (2015) would first be used on the IR imagery to segregate active foam and regions of high reflectance from residual foam and undisturbed sea surface. Then, the collocated EO imagery along the wave face is used to separate the roller (bright, white) from the steep wave face (dark). We note that for certain positions of the sun relative to the EO camera, reflections from steep wave slopes may still pose a problem for roller isolation."}, {"section_title": "Wave Energy Dissipation Rate", "text": "Chapter 4 presents wave energy flux measurements that confirm that plunging breakers dissipate energy at a greater rate than spilling breakers in the early stages of breaking. Neither the bore nor the roller model capture these differences. Chapter 4 proposed a plunging wave model that parameterizes the energy lost to air entrainment at the onset of plunging breaking using the work needed to submerge an air cavity of size A 0 against the buoyancy force (Lamarre and Melville, 1991;Drazen et al., 2008;Iafrati, 2011). While the LIDAR data presented here is insufficient to resolve the plunge distance, B p in Figure 4.12, recent multibeam LIDAR observations of plunging breakers demonstrate robust visualization of the plunging air cavity (Brodie et al., 2018). The area of this air cavity could also be estimated via the parametric cubic curve fitting (Longuet-Higgins, 1982) as pursued by Brodie et al. (2018). Another next step of this research would be to expand the cross-shore extent of LIDAR coverage, similar to the coverage demonstrated by Martins et al. (2016), in order to guarantee the observation of a wave from the onset of breaking, thorough development, to steady state. In this way, we could quantify the time or space, relative to wave period or wavelength, required for a spilling or plunging breaker to evolve into a steady state bore. We found that 0.15 T after the onset marks a distinct transition in the character of energy dissipation for both spilling and plunging breakers, but the waves are not observed long enough to know if a second transition occurs. This information would help answer questions such as: How much energy does a wave lose during its onset stage relative to its steady state stage? Given that the bore model is applied universally, what are the consequences of not including or including onset dynamics when modeling wave forcing across the full surf zone? How might the bore model be modified to improve predictions of nearshore processes that are sensitive to the temporal and spatial patterns in wave forcing, such as transient rip currents?
