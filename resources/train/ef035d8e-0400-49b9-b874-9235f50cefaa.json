[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Understanding intraspecific relationships between genetic and functional diversity is a major goal in the field of evolutionary biology and is important for conserving biodiversity. Linking intraspecific molecular patterns of plants to ecological pressures and trait variation remains difficult due to environment-driven plasticity. Nextgeneration sequencing, untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) profiling, and interdisciplinary approaches integrating population genomics, metabolomics, and community ecology permit novel strategies to tackle this problem. We analyzed six natural populations of the disease-threatened Cornus florida L. from distinct ecological regions using genotype-by-sequencing markers and LC-MSbased untargeted metabolite profiling. We tested the hypothesis that higher genetic diversity in C. florida yielded higher chemical diversity and less disease susceptibility (screening hypothesis), and we also determined whether genetically similar subpopulations were similar in chemical composition. Most importantly, we identified metabolites that were associated with candidate loci or were predictive biomarkers of healthy or diseased plants after controlling for environment. Subpopulation clustering patterns based on genetic or chemical distances were largely congruent. While differences in genetic diversity were small among subpopulations, we did observe notable similarities in patterns between subpopulation averages of rarefied-allelic and chemical richness. More specifically, we found that the most abundant compound of a correlated group of putative terpenoid glycosides and derivatives was correlated with tree health when considering chemodiversity. Random forest biomarker and genomewide association tests suggested that this putative iridoid glucoside and other closely associated chemical features were correlated to SNPs under selection.\nadaptation, Cornus florida, ecological genomics, population genetics, secondary metabolism, single nucleotide polymorphisms"}, {"section_title": "| INTRODUC TI ON", "text": "Plant secondary metabolites are closely tied to ecological functions and greatly affect community interactions (Dixon & Paiva, 1995; Moore, Andrew, K\u00fclheim, & Foley, 2014) . Certain secondary metabolites may provide plants with specialized functions like deterrence to herbivory or infection (Harborne & Turner, 1984) . Identifying the genetic basis of secondary compounds for such functions is of interest to the field of evolutionary ecology. Even small changes in genetic diversity may yield exceptionally large changes in secondary metabolism-producing novel molecules with often unknown biological activity (Firn & Jones, 2000) . While specific compound classes such as iridoids, phenolics, and tannins are often the basis of study for ecological function in plants (Sardans, Pe\u00f1uelas, & RivasUbach, 2011) , secondary metabolite diversity as a trait, or chemotype, represents a special dimension of biodiversity important to natural and managed ecosystems (Bustos-Segura et al., 2017) . In contrast to the research presented in this article, few studies have evaluated broader relationships between chemical diversity and genetic diversity within species (focusing on the diversity of chemical compound composition among individuals in a population) while examining a select group of metabolites diagnostic of health versus disease (otherwise known as biomarkers) and associated with SNPs under selection. Recent innovations in next-generation sequencing coupled with untargeted chemical profiling provide unique opportunities to examine these relationships in plant systems (Eckert et al., 2012; Gomez-Casati, Zanor, & Busi, 2013; Raguso et al., 2015; Riedelsheimer et al., 2012) . Integrating next-generation sequencing technologies with population genomics and community ecology permits identification of chemical compounds and associated SNPs related to disease resistance or other ecologically functional traits.\nSecondary metabolite richness and relative abundance of chemicals within individuals-a chemotype referred to as chemodiversityare informative yet understudied metabolome properties helpful for understanding evolutionary and ecological processes (Hilker, 2014; Kellerman, Dittmar, Kothawala, & Tranvik, 2014) . Promising work has investigated broader patterns of natural metabolome variation in the context of natural genetic variation, but most analyses of variation in chemical diversity focus on distance-based measures versus explicit measurement of chemical richness. For example, significant correlations between metabolic and genetic distances were detected in nine Arabidopsis thaliana accessions exposed to different environments (Houshyani et al., 2012) . In a second example, multigenerational lines inbred from different Drosophila melanogaster populations were found to remain distinguishable in general lipid composition, and approximately one-fifth of the lipid compounds had clear concentration differences between male and female genotypes (Scheitz, Guo, Early, Harshman, & Clark, 2013) . More recent studies of environmental and bud-leaf metabolome analyses of Pinus pinaster (ten European provenances in common garden) revealed two groups of individuals corresponding to spatially distinct regions (Meij\u00f3n et al., 2016) . All these studies used distance measures based on a reduced dimensionality of abundance differences for targeted compounds instead of explicitly calculating and comparing diversity indices (Appendix S1), which account for both chemical compounds' presence-absence and relative abundances within each sample.\nStudies employing diversity indices of broad chemical profiling are rare (Hilker, 2014) , possibly due to previous aversion to adapting such indices outside of community ecology (Hurlbert, 1971 ).\nHowever, initial trepidations regarding usage of these indices are now being addressed with cautious interpretation of chemical diversity indices (Morris et al., 2014) . Additional studies that integrate advancements in untargeted metabolomics (Alonso, Marsal, & Juli\u00e0, 2015; Yi et al., 2016) and population-landscape genomics (Anderson, Willis, & Mitchell-Olds, 2011; Sork et al., 2013) with adoption of these chemical diversity indices would further demonstrate the power of this correlative approach to illustrate how genetics (i.e., locally adapted genes) and plant functional diversity (i.e., chemodiversity) influence plant health, after controlling for environment analytically.\nWe use a multidisciplinary approach to characterize and evaluate how properties of genetic diversity and chemodiversity contribute to susceptibility or resistance to disease in Cornus florida (L.), the flowering dogwood tree. In addition, we have applied exploratory analyses to winnow an untargeted list of metabolites down to a select group of potential antimicrobial compounds-closely resembling compounds previously observed in dogwoods (He, Peng, Hamann, & West, 2014; Stermitz & Krull, 1998; Yue et al., 2006) . The species itself occurs naturally throughout much of eastern North America and is ecologically important partly because of calcium it delivers to food chains in deciduous forests (Baird, 1980; Blair, 1982; Borer, Sapp, & Hutchinson, 2013; Holzmueller, Jose, Jenkins, Camp, & Long, 2006; Linzey & Brecht, 2003; Lovenshimer & Frick-Ruppert, 2013) . In addition, the plant is a cultural icon, serves as the emblem of three southern US states (Jordan, 2010) , and is valued in the horticulture industry at 30 million dollars in annual sales (NASS USDA, 2007 Census of Agriculture). In the past three decades, C. florida populations have experienced major declines in health due to the introduction of a fungal pathogen (Discula destructiva) to North America (Miller, Masuya, Zhang, Walsh, & Zhang, 2016) , the causal agent of dogwood anthracnose (Redlin, 1991) . Northern and mountain populations have been hardest affected with up to 98% mortality occurring in monitored stands (Hiers & Evans, 1997; Jenkins & White, 2002; McEwan, Muller, Arthur, & Housman, 2000; Rossell, Rossell, Hining, & Anderson, 2001; Sherald, Stidham, Hadidian, & Hoeldtke, 1996; Williams & Moriarity, 1999) . As dogwood anthracnose disease progresses southward along the Appalachian Mountains, populations of C. florida continue to decline (Jones, Smith, & Twardus, 2012) . Whether or not the range of dogwood anthracnose (Figure 1) will expand to the southeast overtime is uncertain. Understanding the adaptive mechanisms in C. florida that may possibly limit the spread of disease will be important in the conservation of the species. Iridoid glycosides in particular are highly abundant in Cornelian taxa and have been noted to play roles in plant defense and disease resistance (Stermitz & Krull, 1998; Yue et al., 2006) in addition to various phenolic and tannin compounds (Dudt & Shure, 1993) . In this work, we integrated evidence from multivariate analyses of flowering dogwood tree metabolomes, reduced genome sequences from genotype by sequencing (Pais, Whetten, & Xiang, 2016; Peterson, Weber, Kay, Fisher, & Hoekstra, 2012) , and environmental data (model controls) to address the following questions: (1) What is the relationship between genetic diversity and chemodiversity? (2) Is there evidence from candidate SNPs and metabolites for local adaptation, and are there particular chemical biomarkers such as iridoid glycosides associated with either diseased or healthy plants? (3) Likewise, do healthier plants exhibit greater chemodiversity?"}, {"section_title": "| MATERIAL S AND ME THODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Plant material", "text": "Natural populations of C. florida were sampled from the mountain, Piedmont, and Coastal Plain regions of North Carolina during the summer of 2012 (Pais et al., 2016) .

As one metabolite may give rise to multiple peaks including isotope, adduct, or fragment peaks, the 2,785 peaks were further grouped by peak intensity correlation and RT similarity using built-in procedures from the XCMS pipeline (Tautenhahn et al., 2012) .

For clarity, we first define richness in the context of a typical community ecology study before transferring the analogy to studying intraspecific chemodiversity. In a hypothetical field divided into multiple plots, species richness is the number of unique species in the field or each plot (Whittaker, 1972) . Alpha (\u03b1) richness refers to the average richness of plots while the total number of unique species in the whole field is gamma (\u03b3) richness. When appropriating these indices for studying chemodiversity, we treat each \"species\" as a metabolite and the \"plot within a field\" is represented by an individual plant's chromatogram, which represents the sum of all metabolite intensity peaks. More simply, richness is the metabolite count in an individual sample, and when richness is averaged among each tree in a subpopulation, subpopulations can be statistically compared by \u03b1-richness (Whittaker, 1972) . In contrast, \u03b3-richness represents total number of unique metabolites within a given subpopulation.

Putatively neutral reference SNPs were used to calculate marker-based inbreeding coefficients (F; Keller, Visscher, & Goddard, 2011) and identity-by-state matrices using PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) . We added an inbreeding coefficient (F) variable into logistic models characterizing plant health and disease (see section 2.9) because we recognized the need to account for greater heterozygosity (fewer homozygous loci than expected) within an individual, which could affect plant health (Ouborg, Biere, & Mudde, 2000) by yielding more unique metabolites and raising plant potential to respond to novel pathogen effectors (screening hypothesis; Jones, Firn, & Malcolm, 1991) .

Using the R package adegenet (Jombart, 2008; Jombart, Devillard, & Balloux, 2010) , we performed discriminant analysis (DA) on the optimal number of principal components (PC) to maximize among-population variation and minimize within-population variation. We estimated and analyzed PC scores separately from two different datasets (both scaled): reference SNPs aligning to the C. florida draft genome and abundance data (log-transformed) for 377 metabolites. We conducted DAPC both by defining groups by collection sites and by allowing the program clustering algorithm to find optimal cluster number (K) without priors. Discriminant analyses of principal components does not require assumptions on a population genetic model (e.g., linkage equilibrium of markers) in contrast to programs like STRUCTURE (Pritchard, Stephens, & Donnelly, 2000) so DAPC has been widely adopted in recent population genetic studies (Buchalski et al., 2016; Cahill & Levinton, 2016; Gr\u00fcnwald & Goss, 2011) . Its use for metabolic study is recent, but its efficacy in discriminating different biologically meaningful chemotype classes has been demonstrated and favored over other discriminant analysis methods under certain circumstances (Gromski et al., 2015; Scheitz et al., 2013) .\nNext, we estimated average genetic diversity and chemodiversity of each subpopulation. Rarefied-allelic richness was calculated per site using the hierfstat R package (Goudet, 2005) and the same genetic dataset analyzed in DAPC.

For these correlation analyses, we employed Arlequin (Excoffier & Lischer, 2010) (Hammer, Harper, & Ryan, 2001 ). An ANOSIM matrix is a reduced-dimension matrix describing the similarity between pairs of subpopulations based on differences in abundances of multiple metabolites. Correlations of the F ST matrix to the ANOSIM R matrix of population-level metabolic distances were assessed using one-tailed\nMantel tests of Pearson's r coefficient.\nThe significance of simple linear regressions between individualspecific chemodiversity levels, inbreeding coefficients, and all available environmental predictors was also assessed. In addition, we determined the best multivariate models describing general chemodiversity as the response (Appendix S1). For these initial regression models, we used chemodiversity indices based on all 2,785 chemical features as this allowed us to more reliably detect general differences in chemical richness among samples.

Our justification for recalculating chemodiversity from metabolites in presumably related biological pathways was to compare the evenness or dominance in the accumulation of the specific set of metabolites between diseased and healthy plants. We also recalculated and examined chemodiversity among ten metabolites with common results among GWA and biomarker tests in exploratory analyses (Appendix S1; Table S5 ). Lastly, we tested interaction terms between chemodiversity and the other effects found to influence plant health (i.e., inbreeding coefficient, temperature at collection, and random effects of collection sites).\nUpon adding interaction terms for temperature at collection, we consistently found the interaction effects to be insignificant.

Logistic mixed modeling of individual metabolites showed that six metabolites were significantly correlated with the log odds of being healthy versus diseased (Table 3) after controlling for temperature at collection, inbreeding coefficient, and collection site random effects. Of the 39 biomarker metabolites, five had significant associations with SNPs as revealed from GWA models controlling for environment ( Figure S9a ). The hypothesized SNP and GGM associations for these biomarkers are reported in Figure S10 along with results of greater focus concerning the hypothesized group of iridoid glycosides ( Figure 6 ).\nAfter controlling for inbreeding coefficient, collection site random effects, and temperature at collection, healthy-diseased class correlations (log odds) to chemodiversity indices (calculated from the hypothesized GGM group of iridoid glycosides consisting of M227T630, M451T432, and M435T576) were significant for the majority of diversity indices (no differences in richness among samples and p-values approximately .01 for H\u2032, D1, D2, E, and BP indices).

It has been demonstrated that even small differences in genetic diversity (such as single amino acid substitutions) can yield large differences in chemical profiles (Kampranis et al., 2007) , and several studies have found that higher intraspecific genetic diversity reduces herbivory and disease in plant populations (Hughes, Inouye, Johnson, (Glassmire et al., 2016; Richards et al., 2015) . In the context of this study, it is important to note the similarity between clustering patterns derived from genetic and metabolite data in addition to noting evidence that some diseased mountain subpopulations (Figure 1) have lower genetic and chemical diversity.\nWhile dogwood disease may be constrained to the niche and life history of causal pathogens (Chellemi & Britton, 1992; Daughtrey, Hibben, Britton, Windham, & Redlin, 1996; Ennos, 2015; Holzmueller et al., 2006) , C. florida does exhibit a gradient of variation in genetics and metabolites among North Carolina's coast, Piedmont, and mountain ecoregions (Figures 2, 4 , and S1), which may correspond to variation in health scores (Figures S1 and S4; Pais et al., 2016) .\nFurthermore, relatively high chemodiversity estimates among 377 metabolites are observed in healthier plants ( Figure 3 ). As healthy plants occur in all environments from the Coastal Plains to mountains, this finding suggests that dogwood anthracnose may not necessarily be constrained by only abiotic factors (e.g., cooler and moister habitats) but instead may also be affected by both genetic and metabolite diversities. Genetic and metabolite diversity may be important to disease variation. High levels of metabolic and genetic diversity intrinsic to the host may benefit individual trees in staving off disease infection (Jones et al., 1991) . Alternatively, low genetic diversity in mountain populations can also be a consequence of dogwood anthracnose disease effects (Hadziabdic et al., 2012) . Although the co-occurrence of these patterns in C. florida presents challenges to distinguish relative roles of abiotic, genetic, and chemical factors, available evidence supports an influence of genetics on disease as elaborated below.\nPrevious ecological genomic analysis using GBS data (Pais et al., 2016) proteins (i.e., an oligomeric Golgi complex) that facilitate glycosylation to inhibit disease (Ostertag et al., 2013) . Other loci such as F ST outlier B982 (Pais et al., 2016) are predicted to encode for signaling receptors like lectin-domain receptor kinases, which have been previously implicated in plant immunity responses among other signaling processes (Singh & Zimmerli, 2013) , and recent functional experimentation on resistance genes encoding for such receptors in Solanaceous plants has provided evidence for resistance against Phytophthora disease (Wang, Weide, Govers, & Bouwmeester, 2015) .\nOther SNP loci like B440 may encode regulatory proteins (Fan et al., 2016; Sawaki et al., 2009) (Caplan, Padmanabhan, & Dinesh-Kumar, 2008) . For instance, M227T630 was identified as Cornolactone C, an iridoid isolated previously from C. florida (He et al., 2014) , which belongs to a compound class known to accumulate in response to infection and has documented antimicrobial properties (Marak, Biere, & Van Damme, 2002) .\nThese predicted chemical compounds serve as an important guide for prioritizing which SNPs and biomarkers to further test in future research. The abundance and inducibility of certain secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, other phenolics, and glycoside derivatives have been found to be heritable and mediated by herbivore-pathogen pressures (Johnson, Agrawal, Maron, & Salminen, 2009; Li et al., 2014) . Determining the specific genetic factors regulating such adaptive metabolites remains an important goal, and this study adds to emerging efforts to integrate large secondary metabolite concentration data with information from genome scans (Eckert et al., 2012; Jensen, Foll, & Bernatchez, 2016; Talbot et al., 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "| Herbivore/pathogen interactions influencing chemodiversity in plants", "text": "Explanations for natural variation of secondary metabolism have long been debated (Fraenkel, 1959) . Intraspecific variation of plant chemodiversity can be attributed to differences in the environment (e.g., variation in surrounding plant, herbivore, fungal, or microbial communities as well as abiotic heterogeneity; Tahvanainen & Root, 1972; Root, 1973; Barbosa et al., 2009; Sardans et al., 2011; Rivas-Ubach et al., 2014) or to genetic variation within the species. Proponents of the latter explanation cite observations used to argue for the role of chemodiversity in ecological function and heritability; namely, these authors note that congruent patterns of genetic diversity and chemodiversity are often inversely related to herbivory or infection levels (reviewed in Moore et al., 2014; Raguso et al., 2015) . As an example, one study of Smallanthus macroscyphus (Asteraceae) reported less sesquiterpene lactone diversity (herbivory deterrent) in populations further away from the equator, which was explained as a result of selection for lower toxicity due to fewer herbivore-plant interactions in areas far from the equator (Ar\u00e1oz, Mercado, Grau, & Catal\u00e1n, 2016; Salazar & Marquis, 2012) . This variation of sesquiterpene lactone diversity in the species may well have a genetic basis, which has not been investigated. Higher genetic diversity in certain individuals (e.g., less homozygous genotypes; Figure S7 ) or subpopulations (e.g., higher rarefied-allelic richness; Figure 2d ) can confer a greater range of gene products (e.g., secondary compound precursors) and increase host ability to respond more readily to any general infection (Firn & Jones, 2000) .\nOn the other hand, herbivory and infection on plants can also induce greater secondary compound diversity or induce dominance of certain compounds (Mith\u00f6fer & Boland, 2012; Thoss & Byers, 2006) . While our study could not discriminate between constitutive and induced chemical diversity, our analysis of chemodiversity derived from a specific set of biomarkers did show that healthy plants tended to have greater unevenness of chemical expression than diseased plants (Figure 7 ). The unevenness seemed largely attributed to variation in expression of certain biomarkers (i.e., M435T576).\nIn C. florida, candidate SNPs like B982_75 and B440_76 as well as biomarker M435T576 in the iridoid glucoside network (Figure 6 ) may represent examples of candidate genes governing variation in accumulation and degree of inducible expression for certain defense compounds."}, {"section_title": "| CON CLUS IONS", "text": "Our study demonstrates untargeted metabolite profiling is a useful approach for understanding biodiversity in a new dimension.
