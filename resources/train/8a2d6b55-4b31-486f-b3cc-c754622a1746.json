This may be due to entrapment of \u03b1-synuclein in Lewy bodies, similarly to how reduction of CSF \u03b2-amyloid42 (A\u03b242) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be caused by deposition of A\u03b242 in senile plaques [5] . About 40-50 % of AD patients have \u03b1-synuclein positive Lewy bodies [6] [7] [8] . Studies of CSF \u03b1-synuclein levels in AD have shown mixed results, which may be due to methodological differences in sample handling and study cohorts [1, 2, [9] [10] [11] [12] . Recent reports from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) found increased CSF \u03b1-synuclein in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD [13] , and demonstrated correlations between CSF levels of \u03b1-synuclein and the neuronal damage marker tau, across several diagnostic groups [14] . Such correlations suggest that CSF \u03b1-synuclein may be released in response to neuronal injury. Taken together, the data on CSF \u03b1-synuclein in AD and synucleinopathies suggest that two opposite forces may act on CSF \u03b1-synuclein levels in patients with neurodegeneration, with Lewy body pathology leading to lower CSF levels, and AD-type neuronal injury leading to higher CSF levels of the protein.\nAD patients with Lewy body pathology have accelerated cognitive decline [15] , suggesting that concomitant Lewy body pathology increases neuronal damage in AD. However, patients with DLB have a pattern of brain atrophy that is different from AD patients, with more engagement of midbrain structures, and less hippocampal and temporoparietal atrophy [16] . Given the associations between CSF \u03b1-synuclein and DLB, it is possible that CSF \u03b1-synuclein levels may influence brain atrophy patterns. In this study, our goal was to explore if CSF \u03b1-synuclein is related to brain atrophy rates in healthy elders (NL), patients with MCI and patients with AD. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to study effects of other CSF biomarkers on brain atrophy, including A\u03b242 and tau [17, 18] , but to our knowledge no study has explored effects of CSF \u03b1-synuclein on brain atrophy.\nWe tested the a priori hypothesis that baseline levels of CSF \u03b1-synuclein have effects on regional atrophy rates. We tested this primarily in amygdala (which is a region where AD patients are likely to have both Lewy body pathology [6] and early atrophy [19] ), brainstem (which is an early site of Lewy body accumulation in PD and DLB [20] ), caudate (which is one of the subcortical structures affected in DLB [21, 22] ), and hippocampus (which is typically affected by atrophy in AD, but spared in DLB [23] ). Secondarily we tested effects of CSF \u03b1-synuclein on atrophy rates in all available grey matter and ventricle regions. We also tested the hypothesis that the effects of baseline CSF \u03b1-synuclein on brain atrophy rates vary across the cognitive spectrum from NL, to MCI and AD, by examining interactions between diagnoses and CSF \u03b1-synuclein."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year publicprivate partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals (NL), people with MCI, and people with early AD. Inclusion criteria for NL subjects were mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores 24-30, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0, no depression, no MCI, and no dementia. MCI subjects had MMSE 24-30, memory complaint, and objective memory loss (adjusted for education) measured by Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II, CDR 0.5, absence of significant levels of impairment in other cognitive domains, essentially preserved activities of daily living, and no dementia. AD subjects had MMSE 20-26, CDR 0.5-1, and met the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. For up-to-date information on ADNI, see http://www.adni-info.org.

All models included a random intercept, and most models also included a random slope (in a few regions, the models would not converge with a random slope, and these models were only tested with fixed effects and a random intercept).\nAfter inspection of the correlation within subjects, a compound symmetry structure was assumed for the linear mixed effects models.

This finding argues against the use of CSF \u03b1-synuclein as a stand-alone indicator of future risk of brain atrophy within the cognitive spectra from NL to MCI and AD. It is possible that the combination of CSF \u03b1-synuclein with other biomarkers have stronger effects on brain atrophy than individual biomarkers. A recent study found that the combination of CSF \u03b1-synuclein with the core CSF AD biomarkers A\u03b242, total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (Ptau) enhances the diagnostic accuracy for MCI to AD conversion compared to the individual biomarkers [14] . Future studies on CSF \u03b1-synuclein and brain imaging may build on this and incorporate CSF A\u03b242, T-tau and P-tau, and for example test if low CSF \u03b1-synuclein increases the risk for DLB- . Note that the sign of the t-value depends on the relationship between CSF \u03b1-synuclein and volume change. Thus, in regions with negative volume change (atrophy), a negative tvalue indicates that higher atrophy rates were seen in subjects with high CSF \u03b1-synuclein, and a positive t-value that higher atrophy rates were seen in subjects with low CSF \u03b1-synuclein. In contrast, in the few regions where the longitudinal volume change was positive (ventricles and pallidum in NL, MCI and AD, and pericalcarine in MCI), a negative t-value indicates that volume enlargement was seen in subjects with low CSF \u03b1-synuclein, and a positive t-value that volume enlargement was seen in subjects with high CSF \u03b1-synuclein. No effect was significant when correcting for multiple comparisons (correcting within study group [48 tests]). type pathology in subjects where other biomarkers strongly indicate AD.\nThe second major finding of this study was that although the effects of CSF \u03b1-synuclein on atrophy rates were nonsignificant within the individual diagnostic groups, there were significant differences between NL and AD in brainstem and caudate, when comparing these diagnostic groups with each other. In the brainstem, AD patients with low baseline CSF \u03b1-synuclein had high atrophy rates, while the opposite was seen in NL. A possible interpretation of this is that concurrent Lewy body pathology, as reflected by low CSF \u03b1-synuclein levels, are more strongly associated with brainstem atrophy in AD than in NL. The brainstem is interesting, since it is a typical region for early Lewy body deposits [20] . However, it should be noted that the brainstem is not a typical region for AD-related brain atrophy, and the development of Lewy body pathology does not always begin in the brainstem [27] . Also, in this study the overall brain stem atrophy rates were similar between NL, MCI and AD. In the caudate, the relationship between CSF \u03b1-synuclein and atrophy rate was reversed, so that AD patients with high baseline CSF \u03b1-synuclein had high atrophy rates, while the opposite was seen in NL. We have no clear explanation for this finding. We noted that two outliers with high CSF \u03b1-synuclein levels and high atrophy rates affected the slope in the AD subjects. Therefore these results must be treated with caution. Further studies are needed to elucidate if CSF \u03b1-synuclein affects brain atrophy differently across NL, MCI and AD in regions implicated in DLB and AD.\nThe final part of this study was an exploratory analysis of all available regions. After correction for multiple comparisons, there were no significant effects of CSF \u03b1-synuclein. However, although the effects were non-significant, the patterns seemed to differ between NL and MCI/AD. In NL and MCI, the effects of CSF \u03b1-synuclein varied, and atrophy rates were related to either high or low CSF \u03b1-synuclein (although non-significantly). In AD, high atrophy rates tended to be related to high CSF \u03b1-synuclein, with some exceptions, for example the brainstem, where high atrophy rates tended to be related to low CSF \u03b1-synuclein. This difference between groups may be related to random variations, since atrophy rates were larger in AD. We observed that longitudinally increased ventricle volumes generally were related to low CSF \u03b1-synuclein. Further studies of white matter structure and lesions may be useful to clarify if atrophy of periventricular regions is related to Lewy body pathology, as reflected by low CSF \u03b1-synuclein.\nIt should be emphasized that this was not a study of subjects afflicted with disorders known to be primarily associated with \u03b1-synuclein pathology. Both PD and DLB are characterized by the presence of Lewy Bodies and \u03b1-synuclein in the brain. Patients with PD are being studied in the Parkinsons Progressive Biomarkers Initiative and CSF \u03b1-synuclein is being collected from these patients. Therefore, the results of the PPMI project (which are publically available on the UCLA LONI Website) will be interesting to compare with the ADNI data. We know of no study measuring longitudinal atrophy in DLB subjects with CSF \u03b1-synuclein measurements.\nLimitations of this study include the small sample size, and the lack of autopsy follow-up. Also, since only a subset of AD and MCI patients are likely to have concomitant Lewy body pathology, it is possible that a larger study cohort is needed to detect any effects of CSF \u03b1-synuclein on Lewy body related atrophy. This is especially true if CSF \u03b1-synuclein is affected by opposite forces in AD, with Lewy body pathology reducing levels and neuronal injury increasing levels, attenuating any effects of the biomarker, as has recently been suggested [14] . Another limitation of this study is that we only considered effects on grey matter atrophy and ventricle volume. It is possible that CSF \u03b1-synuclein levels also affects white matter integrity, which may be tested in future studies using tractography."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This is the first study of CSF \u03b1-synuclein and brain atrophy rates in NL, MCI and AD.
