[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The research focuses on the development and validation of an integrated assessment instrument to assess students' analytical thinking skills and chemical literacy in chemical equilibrium. The research consists of 5 phases ie analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The research participants were 174 students of grade 12th senior high schools in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The participants were selected using stratified random sampling. The Integrated assessment instrument to assess students' analytical thinking skills and chemical literacy consists of 20 open-ended multiple-choice questions developed from 12 integrated indicators. Expert validation result shows that 20 questions are declared valid with Aiken's V value greater than 0.86. The result was collated and coded for analysis with Rasch model approach. 3 items (15%) were included in the very difficult category, 3 items (15%) were included in the difficult category, 8 items (40%) were included in the moderate category, 5 items (25%) were included in the easy category, and 1 question (5%) was included in the very easy category. It turns out that this instrument is capable to measure students' analytical thinking skill and chemical literacy."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "One of the education goals is to make students have a system of knowledge, skills to be independent, effective and creative (Petrovska & Veselinovska, 2013) . The objective is aligned with the educational goals proposed by Temel (2014) , which teaches students on how to think and solve problems well so that students become individuals who can think, ask, research and formulate solutions to a problem. The 21st-century challenge was put forward by Vanada (2010) stating that students need to improve collaborative skills and creative, analytical and practical thinking skills. Moreover, the role of highlevel thinking skills in modern times is not only a progression of facts and concepts, but it must be a person's ability to solve problems as his contribution to society (Lateef, Dahar & Latif, 2016) . Anwar & Mumthas (2014) state that one aspect of a person's intelligence success is the analytical thinking skill. In fact, however, the score of student achievement in Indonesia is still at a medium and low level. This is in line with the results of Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in 2015, which shows that the average score of learning achievement on the subjects of mathematics and science students in Indonesia is 397, lower than the average TIMSS score overall country of 500. The students' achievement in math and science subjects in Indonesia is at a very high level (1%), High (6%), Medium (24%) and low (55%). This shows that students in Indonesia are at a medium and low level of achievement and that there is a need to develop students' cognitive abilities to be at higher level. Celik (2014) stated that changes in knowledge and technology occur quickly and affect society. Therefore, an understanding of the facts of science and the relationship between knowledge, technology, and society is necessary. The ability to apply knowledge to everyday life is called as science literacy. The 2015 result of the Program for International Students Assessment (PISA) shows that the average science literacy score of 15-year-old students is 403, while the average science literacy scores of all countries that follow this assessment program are 493, with the score of Indonesia including 10 countries with the lowest science literacy score. This indicates that assessment instruments for measuring high-level thinking skills are essential. The questions on assessment instruments work not only to evaluate students' understanding, but also stimulate students to think. This corresponds with the statement put forward by Santhitiwanich, Pasiphol, Tangdhanakanond (2013) stating that a specific test is required that teachers will use to measure and assess students' analytical thinking skills. Montaku, Kaittikomol & Tiranathanakul (2012) stated that low student scores are due to low intentions in conducting tests and exams using analytical thinking-oriented questions. It is in line with the statement of Fensham & Bellochi (2013) that the most of the assessment of learning outcomes in science still focus on low-level thinking skills, where the questions given by teachers to students are still memorizing without thinking. This is consistent with the result of preliminary observation in high school students, which shows the result that 19.3% of students stated strongly agree, 57.89% of students stated agree and 22.8% of students stated disagree that the problem given by the teacher is in the form of memorization. And the results of the questionnaire also showed that 17.5% of students stated strongly disagree, 78.9% of students said disagree, 3.5% of students agreed that the evaluation of the teacher given in the form of a matter of reasoning. It means that teachers in schools only use assessment instruments that measure rote or other low-level thinking skills. This suggests that an assessment instrument that can measure high-level thinking skills is necessary. Shwartz, Benz-vi & Hofstein (2006) explains that science literacy is one of the science Education goals, and it requires a new standard of content, pedagogy, and assessment. Instruction, October 2018 \u2022 Vol.11, No.4 Based on this, it can be concluded that a measuring instrument is needed to measure students' chemical literacy. But in reality, there are still a few teachers who provide the evaluation questions related to everyday life. This is consistent with the result of preliminary observation on high school students, showing the result of 52.63% student express disagree, 3.5% student express disagree, 38.6% agree and 5.2% student expressly agree that evaluation question was given by the teacher related to the problems of everyday life. It means that teachers only use theoretical assessment instruments without relating to real life. This indicates that the assessment instrument that contains literacy is necessary. Because of the lack of an instrument that teachers can use, teachers often use only an assessment instrument that does not know the level of ability to be measured."}, {"section_title": "International Journal of", "text": "There is a relationship between analytical thinking skills and chemical literacy, as Cigdemolu & Geban (2015) suggests, which states that a person with chemical literacy will be able to increase the frequency of asking, searching for information and using it when needed, and can analyze the advantages and disadvantages associated with the position in the debate. Based on the above, an integrated measuring instrument is needed to measure both aspects of analytical thinking and chemical literacy. The integrated assessment in this study is a form of assessment that can measure the skills of analytical thinking and also aligned can measure the level of student's chemical literacy.\nThe development of integrated assessment instruments in this study focused on chemical equilibrium materials. The selection of this material is based on the fact that this material is related to everyday life, but a matter used in very little judgment that has linked matter with life. In addition, the question that many used in the form of calculations that constitute the cognitive domain of the application has not yet reached the higher cognitive domain of analysis. Based on this, the researchers felt it was important to develop an integrated assessment instrument that could measure students' analytical thinking and chemical literacy skills on chemical equilibrium materials. -Yassin (2015) states that integrated assessments should be made in educational institutions, as these assessments are important ways to improve student learning outcomes. Moreover, McPhun (2010) explained that integrated assessment is a process of combining and integrating various learning outcomes into a series of simple, realistic and based cases. It is reinforced with Bourke and Mentis (2014) statement that the integrated assessment framework shows how different approaches can be aligned with specific goals, and further SAQA (2005) explains that there are several key elements in the integrated assessment, ie need to demonstrate the competencies applied, including the provision of evidence of results; Link assessment to define goals (standards and qualifications); The context in which the assessment should be done is key; practicality and efficiency of assessment are important; integrated assessment should add value to student learning; Relating theory to practice makes integrated judgments more authentic and coherent to be used as a method of assessment of learning; integrated assessment International Journal of Instruction, October 2018 \u2022 Vol.11, No.4 should make a variety of assessment instruments in which more than one model of learning is assessed; integrated assessment is an appropriate way to assess the extent to which learners can integrate concepts, ideas and actions; assessment of integration is the assessment of knowledge, skills, and personal qualities.\n"}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Integrated Assessment", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "El", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Analytical Thinking Skills", "text": "The definition of analytical thinking is explained by Art-in & Sitthipon (2012) , analytical thinking is a competency in identifying and classifying different aspects that can be objects, stories or events, and find relationships of those aspects. Meanwhile, Chonkaew (2016) states that students with analytical thinking skills can express their concepts understanding and implement their knowledge. Other definition, analytical thinking skills are a process of the mental formation used to determine the solution of a problem (Anwar & Mumthas, 2014) . Furthermore, the indicators for analytical thinking skills explained by Ramirez & Ganaden (2008) that are differentiating, organizing and attributing. Differentiating is differentiate a relevant sections with irrelevant and unimportant sections, organizing is determined how an element fits with its structure, and attributing is determined the point of view, the value or purpose underlying the existence of an element.\nBased on these matters, it is concluded that the analytical thinking skill is the competence in differentiating, organizing and relating an object, theory, problem or event, and can determine the relation of those aspects based on certain reason, principle or function."}, {"section_title": "Chemical Literacy", "text": "Jurecki & Wander (2012) defines sciencetific literacy as recognizing the natural world, understanding the key concepts and principles of science, possessing scientific reasoning capacity, and being able to use scientific knowledge for personal or social purposes. The definitioon of literacy of science also stated in the OECD (2013), PISA defines literacy as the ability to connect issues or problems related to science, and ideas in science. Moreover, literacy of science is the ability to understand the process of science and interpret the scientific information contained in everyday life (Fives, Huebner, Birnbaum & Nicolich, 2014) .\nA person who has the ability of science literacy will be able to understand science and the relationship of science with society and the environment, and can know the concepts, laws, theories and basic principles of chemistry and can use the skills of the scientific process (Turiman, Omar, Daud & Osman, 2012 ). Based on that, then someone with chemical literacy must understand the basic concepts of science because chemistry is a branch of science and in it, there are theories that are able to explain the natural world, and the knowledge gained from chemistry can be transferred and applied to other topics in science and technology. A person with chemical literacy must know the basic purpose of chemistry. This includes the chemical principles that teach us to understand macroscopic phenomena by interpreting the microscopic and symbolic levels of chemistry. A person that have chemical literacy must be able to use knowledge in everyday life. Instruction, October 2018 \u2022 Vol.11, No.4 Chemical literacy can explain as the ability to understand the concept of chemistry and connect the concepts to explain the relationship between the chemical concepts with phenomena, problems or facts that exist in everyday life, which is shown by three aspects of explaining the phenomenon by using the concept of chemistry, using a chemical understanding of problem solving and analyzing the strategies and benefits of chemical applications."}, {"section_title": "METHOD Design and Model", "text": "This research design is Research and Development (R & D) and adapting the ADDIE model which consists of five phases; these are analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation.
