Introduction", "text": "On June 18-20 th , 2019, CRRC and DPP co-sponsored a NOAA Regional Preparedness Training (NRPT) Workshop at Old Dominion University Tri-Cities Higher Education Center (Portsmouth, VA). The workshop, titled \"Improve Preparedness for Storm Events and Nuisance Flooding in the Norfolk Region\", focused on preparedness, planning and response to extreme weather events and nuisance flooding. See Appendix A for the agenda. The 40 participants (Appendix B) represented federal, state and local agencies, academia, and industry. This was the fifth workshop in a series of DPP NRPTs. The overall goal of the Norfolk workshop was to provide focused discussion regarding lessons learned from local partners during the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season and build a common understanding of how storm events and nuisance flooding will be addressed when they threaten mission personnel, infrastructure or natural resources. The specific objectives were to: 1. Establish networks with local partners to improve preparedness. 2. Identify gaps and ways to improve regional preparedness. 3. Increase coordination among participants to bolster regional preparedness. 4. Determine ways to provide adequate information and communicate knowledge, so that (1) the public and response community will make informed decisions relative to personal protection and safety, and (2) responders and natural resource managers more effectively mitigate regional disaster impacts. A one-day Tools Caf\u00e9 was held prior to the workshop (see Appendix A for the agenda), with presentations (Appendix D) and subsequent hands-on demonstrations of national and regionallyspecific preparedness and response tools that are currently available to responders or the public. The two-day workshop included plenary presentations from local and federal emergency responders outlining their day-to-day operations, continuity of operations during an emergency, tools used to make decisions, and lessons learned from previous events. A summary of the presentations can be found in Section IV \"Plenary Presentations,\" presentation slides are located in Appendix E. Participants were divided into three breakout groups with representatives from the various agencies/entities (Groups A-C). Breakout groups were tasked with identifying: (1) the primary challenges/impacts to mission that must be addressed for storm events and nuisance flooding, (2) the current practice to handle these challenges, (3) how preparedness and readiness could be enhanced to address these challenges, and (4) an implementation strategy for these enhancements.

The OCS navigation manager collects hydrographic data to update NOAA nautical charts, and provides hydrographic support in port recovery operations, working in conjunction with U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and USACE to make risk-based decisions to ensure the safety of commerce in ports. During response, navigation managers embed themselves within the incident command system (ICS) to help coordinate hydrographic response with survey assets. LT Klemm provided examples of previous relevant tasks, such as identifying sunken containers post-Hurricane Maria, identifying possible hazards to ensure the safety of the public and allowing the opening of port. The Atlantic Hydrographic Branch (AHB) in downtown Norfolk is the main facility and provides data processing support and data stewardship for hydrographic surveys. This facility operates with approximately 30 employees. Many AHB employees deploy to disaster areas to assist in emergency hydrographic surveys. There is a national need for the AHB expertise and for AHB during storms, however the branch has a commitment to the Norfolk region."}, {"section_title": "Kate Bosley, the Chief of the Field Operations Division of NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS)", "text": "discussed day-to-day operations including the maintenance of 340+ coastal observing stations, enabled by 40 federal/contract employees, and close connection with federal partners. CO-OPS relies on the NWS forecasts, CO-OPS Quicklook, and evacuation and closure notices to make operational decisions before, during, and after storm events. Their continuity of operations includes: assessing operating conditions of potentially impacted stations, securing facility assets before the storm, checking contact information for all employees, confirming contract options for telework, and assigning telework and duration requirements. Chief Bosley shared some recent lessons learned, describing the challenge to maintain reporting to CO-OPS HQ in midst of evacuation, and the uncertainty of some employees regarding their evacuation during the event. CO-OPS requested a refresher on the Employee Notification System (ENS) to be more prepared for the next major event."}, {"section_title": "Emily Clark, the Oceanic Branch Chief of the Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) in the Eastern Region Acquisitions Division (ERAD)", "text": ", discussed her position and AGO's relevance to preparedness.

ERAD supports OMAO, NMFS, NWS, and NOS. ERAD's operations are conducted by a staff of 72, located in the Norfolk Federal Building. During an emergency, their continuity of operations plan includes: safety and accountability of all staff, telework capabilities for federal and contractor staff, emergency acquisitions procedures maintained by each branch, and designated offices to continue operations Tom Tyree, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic Port Operations, represented the region's port operations office. The mission of the office is to execute national defense tasking, with force generation occurring at the facilities in the region's Area of Operations (AOR). This mission is executed by 220 employees, both military and civilian, with four HRA AOR/Ports and 45 boats. During an emergency, their continuity of operations includes: continued operations with mission essential personnel (MEP), maintenance of operations at COOP site as required, defense support civil authority (DSCA) response capabilities, and deployment to another region, if needed. Recent storm preparedness lessons learned include the effective execution of evacuation upon orders when roughly 50,000 people are on base daily, and methods to deal with old base infrastructure that is susceptible to flooding. The office requests assistance to improve communications with port partners in the event of an evacuation, and a better understanding of their partners' capabilities to facilitate collective assistance with port clearance and/or reconstruction. The Hampton Roads Hurricane Timeline Diagram ( Figure 1) was presented to the group, detailing the Navy's course of action beginning at 120 hours before storm landfall, with the goal of getting all personnel and assets safely out of port and staged at alternative locations. A flow chart for Post Storm Recovery Actions ( Figure 2) was also shared, detailing the common decisions required in order to reopen a port safely after an event has occurred.

The mission of USCG Sector Hampton Roads is to carry out the USCG's 11 statutory missions, which include search and rescue (SAR), living marine resources, law enforcement (MLE), aids to navigation (ATON) and port safety and security. There are over 600 active duty and reserve members in the region, and roughly 1,300 Coast Guard Auxiliary volunteers. During an emergency, their continuity of operations includes their involvement in a unified command (UC) under the National Incident Command System (NIMS). The Sector has multiple locations for COOP staging needs. Carroll stressed the importance of the Norfolk region in national security, and that during an event, response needs to be a collaborative effort between USCG, NOAA and all relevant entities. Carroll discussed the COOP capabilities with the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD), which has storage, berthing and emergency power capabilities onboard a Ready Reserve Vessel, essentially a \"floating command center\". The primary tools Carroll uses for decision-making are the sector's Severe Weather Plan to coordinate all vessel arrivals and departures with the Navy, and frequent port partner calls. He stressed the complexity of the port and noted all entities must have a voice. Recent lessons learned include: the importance of evacuations pre-storm, all personnel understanding evacuation zones, early communications with partners for exercises and clear lines of communication during an event, and the need for multiple COOP locations for multiple storm types and conditions. The sector would benefit from improved trajectories and modeling as these are crucial for decision-making, recovering sunken vessels to open waterways, and conducting emergency support functions (ESF) 9 (search and rescue) and 10 (hazardous materials) for location and mapping. They hope to learn tools for identification and forecasting of trouble areas, as well as long-term plans and realities in responding to storm events in the region. Carroll also stressed the importance of risk communication in evacuation zone planning, and the importance of early evacuation to ensure the safety of the public, even if they do not correctly perceive the risk due to some previous evacuations."}, {"section_title": "Major Alex Samms, Deputy District Commander of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),", "text": "shared his position and relevance to emergency response.

The tools frequently used for decision-making are the SLOSH model, LIDAR, DEM, and HURREVAC. All the tools are used to determine the scale of the mission to be executed, including debris management requirements, and temporary \"blue roof\" implementation. Recent lessons learned include the need for concrete staging areas for generators deployed by the Power Planning and Response team, and the importance of PM/non-federal sponsored pre-storm surveys. Samms explained the district would benefit from improved planning triggers for stream gauges and forecasts to anticipate areas of concern for federal response, Emergency Power Facility Assessment Tool (EPFAT) input, and first floor elevations and depth damage curve assignment sharing (which is crucial for the Virginian coast).

There are five state owned/operated terminals by the VA Port Authority (VPA). Other port terminals are operated / owned by the private sector and Department of Defense. The Maritime Incident Response Team's (MIRT) day-to-day operations include the coordination of regional planning, response and recovery operations, and support of the USCG with \"All Hazards\" response and search and rescue (SAR). During an emergency response, the port's continuity of operations includes mass notifications to partners, maintenance of \"ride out\" teams to keep IT systems active, address cargo issues, and colleague well-being checks. They also conduct annual table top planning exercises. The VPA uses the COOP plan, human resource policies and procedures, the USCG Severe Weather Plan, MTSU plans and scripted 204 plans. Recent lessons learned due to the mandatory evacuation include the inability for several modes of transportation (i.e., rail, trucks) to enter the evacuation zones), the need for the MARAD SafeStore program to have prepositioned ships, and the usefulness of NWS web tools. The VPA uses a private weather company for terminal operations, but port wide decisions are based on NWS forecasts. Burket stressed the importance of coordination with other agencies, especially when attempting to get supplies for port re-opening, which may be hindered by mandatory evacuation orders. Jim Redick, Norfolk City Emergency Manager, shared information about his position and relevance to emergency preparedness. Redick stressed the importance of coordination between entities noting that no one entity has the expertise or resources to handle response in the region, and that network establishment prior to a crisis is crucial. Redick described his office's close coordination with NWS, in the provision and description of forecast data for preparedness. As an emergency manager, Redick's most important task is bringing regional entities together for planning and preparedness. The continuity of operations in the city is the homeland security network, shelter openings, mitigation plans, and resilience strategies.

During Breakout Session I, participants were tasked with identifying major flood and storm related challenges that impact mission in the Norfolk region, as well as the agencies/entities impacted by these challenges. Following Breakout Session I, one member from each group summarized the discussions during a plenary report-out."}, {"section_title": "Group A", "text": "Group A discussed the psychological dimensions during evacuation, including the tendency not to evacuate in an attempt to protect possessions, and disbelief of the orders. The challenges of reconstitution were discussed, with concerns about citizens not returning to the state post-storm and the resulting economic and social impacts. From the city's perspective, human evacuation is significantly challenged by financial, transportation and housing constraints. Planning and response fatigue were considered from a federal/responder perspective. The concerns regarding planners and responders being fatigued as a result of successive storms poses a problem, with potential impacts including less planning/preparedness and aversion to conduct exercises and drills. Concerns about staffing during successive storms were considered, and how to best address whether there are adequate personnel and resources available to tackle multiple storms. There was consensus that expectations for employees, responders and managers must be evaluated pre-storm (e.g., obligations, evacuation zones) to improve overall response efficiency and accountability during a mandatory evacuation. The group also discussed the challenges associated with a lack of common terminology between responders, citizens, and agencies attempting to coordinate response efforts during an event. These two challenges are further exacerbated with limited communication during response, caused by downed communication systems or problems with the Everbridge notification system. The challenges of unclear employee expectations, lack of common terminology, and limited communications avenues, greatly challenge coordination and execution of mission during flooding or a storm event."}, {"section_title": "Group B", "text": "Group B identified challenges associated with planning timeframes, (e.g., short-, mid-, long-term), strategies and coordination between agencies/entities (e.g., municipalities, USCG, first responders, contractors). Considering a long-term planning timeframe, the acquisition of contracts and establishment of networks need to happen prior to events, to avoid hindering response efforts. With the increase in frequency of storms, the timeframe for planning is decreasing, requiring longer-term solutions for coastal areas. The group also stressed the need for education about sea level rise and flooding, as it is a major challenge to coordinate with citizens in coastal areas who are not aware of the risks. This requires outreach and planning strategies to educate the public. Comprehensive COOP plans are also a challenge, as well as the lack of coordination between the entities (e.g., the City of Norfolk, the Port Authority, Navy). COOP plans should be coordinated cross-agencies and entities to have the most effective response. Participants shared that COOP plans often work for individual groups, but must be validated by other entities. One concern is nursing homes, and the need for comprehensive COOP plans for these facilities, because of the sensitive population. Clear expectations with vendors and partners during shut-downs or emergency evacuations need to be established prior to an event to ensure effective response. In the event of limited cellular service, or when there are unaccounted personnel, executing a COOP plan becomes increasingly difficult, especially without coordination with outside parties. The group noted that outside resources and personnel can be included in a COOP plan, with the realization that most employees may have to help their families during a major event. Challenges related to funding were a major topic of discussion during this breakout group. COOP plans validated by multiple stakeholders and agencies. Communication challenges also extend to public perception of flooding events and mandatory evacuations. Without a complete understanding of the risks associated with sea level rise and flooding, the public cannot respond effectively at the time of an event. The shortcomings of communication and education also create challenges associated with responder and citizen fatigue when facing successive storms. Communication gaps exist during the transfer of institutional knowledge. A major challenge is the loss of experience and knowledge in a region with high military/political turnover. As a result of high personnel turnover, relationships and expertise in certain areas cannot be easily maintained. Access challenges were focused primarily on getting employees and resources on-site. It is a challenge to get personnel and resources back into an evacuation zone once the order has been given, inhibiting the re-opening of ports and critical facilities. Identification of available resources and personnel for deployment could be aided by tools such as NRAD discussed in the Tools Caf\u00e9. The group highlighted the importance of staging assets prior to events based upon forecasts, to help mediate identification and access challenges. Without an understanding of what resources are available, and the ability to stage or transport these resources, response efforts are greatly hindered. Access to funding for local partners is a major challenge. Without long-term contracts or plans, funding can be hard to acquire in a short time. Avenues for funding need to be identified to aid in response recovery, including what recurring funding is available, and how to obtain access to it. Even if responders have identified required resources, and have means of transportation, access to adequate funding may take additional time, delaying a response.\nIn regard to managerial training and communication issues a current best practice and possible desired protocol identified was the implementation of 'no-comms' scenarios in exercises and training to better prepare responders for this situation. Blue skies orientation/trainings could occur after the regular workplace trainings. The communication of data was a large challenge, especially when obtaining data from multiple sources and models. There is an identified need for information validation across multiple sources or models to make sure decision-makers are getting one clear message on the actions that need to be taken. A desired protocol would be making city databases interoperable within regions. Communication from managers to employees needs to be more transparent regarding responsibilities during an event. Managers need to clearly define steps taken to ensure employee wellness, employee compensation during an event, and plans for employees' families regarding housing and wellness. There was a clear gap in contracts and communications with contractors prior to events. There needs to be better communication with contractors, clearly defining roles and compensation avenues prior to an event."}, {"section_title": "VI. Session II -Best Practices", "text": "The Organizing Committee compiled and categorized the challenges identified during Breakout Session I. The challenges were sorted into eight categories: 1) capacity, 2) communications, 3) continuity planning, 4) data management, 5) funding, 6) infrastructure, 7) logistics, and 8) policy. After refinement and organization, the 41 challenges were equally distributed among the three groups. During Breakout Session II, Groups A-C were tasked with: i) identifying the current best practices to address each challenge, ii) the desired practice to address each challenge, and iii) the next steps for implementing the desired practice. Following Breakout Session II, one member from each group presented an overview at a plenary session. This section includes paragraphs summarizing priority items identified. See Appendix F for specific details. 1. Capacity Challenges a. Planning and response fatigue resulting from multiple storms in succession, and regions with frequent flooding. b. The loss of institutional knowledge once a staff member leaves, especially as a function of their longevity in the position at the local level, and the lack of continuity of relationships/knowledge transfer following turnover (e.g., political, military). c. Employee mental health and wellness concerns (e.g., required personnel are also impacted by the incident). d. The availability of local knowledge and acquiring resources (e.g., where can federal entities get local resources quickly when an event occurs?). e. Managing employee work and family responsibilities (e.g., accounting for all personnel, encouraging focus on families rather than getting back to work, smoothly evacuating dependents while maintaining essential employees). f. \"Conference call burn-out\" resulting from multiple communications among local, state, and federal entities. [E] f. Clarity of emergency and scientific messaging when relaying information on affected areas and associated risks (e.g., managing public expectations and messaging to the public). [E] g. Management of public interaction while trying to accomplish response missions (e.g., communicating safe practice, public not listening to notices). [E] h. Identification of the people using the products directly and how to improve them (e.g., end-user assessment for quality assurance and control. [E] i. Lack of standardization of communication and breakdown of responsibilities at the national level during response (e.g., relaying best practices, need for a lessons learned summary, different backgrounds of personnel or new personnel who have their own approaches). [I] j. Communication issues involving texting complications while using Everbridge. [I] 3. Continuity Planning Challenges a. Lack of reconstitution plans, and maintenance operations after mandatory evacuation (e.g., re-entry concerns, conflict with recovery/response operations). b. Semi-automated off-loading equipment for cargo if the port does not have manual option in the event of downed systems (e.g., lack of contingency plans in the port). c. Emergency designation of roles and responsibilities under any disaster conditions (e.g., people leave, or are unavailable to leave, including essential personnel during an emergency event). d. Avoiding conflicts in COOP planning at a regional scale (e.g., what happens at federal level if DC is incapacitated? what happens if entire Atlantic coast in impacted? Do COOP plans account for that?). e. Appropriate staging of assets based on forecasts (e.g., access to resources ahead of time, identification of areas that are not going to flood). f. Clear, honest, actionable plans for emergency situations. g. Scalability of preparedness for varying storm conditions (e.g., storms forming faster resulting in less lead time to prepare/evacuate). h. Mitigation hazards to response personnel related to methods of communication."}, {"section_title": "Data Management Challenges", "text": "a. Information collection and historical data analysis to aid in the determination of extent of flooding, depth of water, and timing to keep citizens informed. b. Maintenance of up-to-date information in databases (e.g., keeping pace with climate change/sea level rise, incorporating data predictive models). c. Frequency of nuisance flooding and accurate predictions of future floods. d. Identification of major impact zones in the region. e. Post-storm flood validation of affected areas (e.g., uncertainty of what flooded, no system to collect data on damage, risk of crowd-sourcing information during an event, visualization of what features look like with increasing levels of water). f. Multiple sources of information and models, resulting in potentially conflicting messages to public and decision-makers. g. The lack of consideration of compound flooding in models (e.g., precipitation on top of high tide, dam breaks, culvert failure). 5. Funding/Budget Challenges a. Lack of long-range funding streams to fix permanent issues at local level (e.g., nonconflicting community expenditures). b. Lack of mechanism built into contracts to receive supplemental funding leading to acquiring funding after ceiling is reached. c. Lack of an emergency funds available for hurricane season (e.g., funding similar to oil spill liability trust fund). 6. Infrastructure Challenges a. The loss of natural features due to frequent flooding and storm events (e.g., parks, wetlands). b. Aging infrastructure that is not designed to handle current flooding and storm scenarios. 7. Logistics Challenges a. Knowledge regarding where to relocate assets prior to storm events to avoid damage, and allowing access. b. Optimization of staff locations to ensure their safety, while allowing access to impacted areas (e.g., sending response teams for survey support, knowing where those people can stay for a few days, with limited cell service). c. Synchronization of resources and priorities to efficiently respond to a storm event. 8. Policy/Processes Challenges a. Mechanisms for servicing low income populations who may be at higher risk during an event (e.g., lack of transportation, insufficient shelter). b. Lack of pay for federal employees/military until mandatory evacuation is initiated; no guarantee that payment will occur during evacuation, a deterrence to proactive response measures. Group A Group A developed many solutions for planning and response fatigue due to multiple consecutive storms. The current best practice to combat this fatigue is a maximum response or planning time, followed by time off, to mitigate the effects of successive storm events. The potential for force multipliers during an event was a possible enhancement, by having an MOU with entities and contractors to build up a response cadre. Another way of addressing this challenge would be to share streamlined planning among entities. Plans could be shared across agencies using the Prebus Star application (i.e., sharing, connecting, editing). Sharing plans for NOAA or other federal entities posed a challenge due to sensitivity concerns. To aid in NOAA preparedness, the focus should be on prioritization in planning, including for essential staff and actions. The potential for staging was considered, by sending out responders and response actions in phases to reduce fatigue. In order to reduce fatigue and support response, inter-agency drills were proposed, reducing the amount of required drills and exercises, while increasing networking between entities. Group A had many potential solutions for reconstitution and re-entry. Many members in the group recognized a large gap in the reconstitution plan, questioning if a comprehensive plan even exists. The group suggested having all stakeholders involved in the reconstitution planning and process. The proposed reconstitution plan should be a part of the continuity of operations plan. The reconstitution process needs to be clarified to all stakeholders, with explanations of how decisions are being made, and how they are handled at the local level. Solutions need to be investigated surrounding the communication of reconstitution plans to communities. Regional reconstitution should be developed that consider local needs. The group suggested continued implementation of gauges to identify areas of flooding and to provide a better understanding of the coastal inundation trends. The main challenge identified with the implementation of new flood sensors was funding. Another best practice and future enhancement is the ability to crowdsource flooding photos from the public for more data on at-risk areas. The implementation of more water level indicator rods along roadways and coastlines would allow citizen scientists to report flooding."}, {"section_title": "Group C", "text": "The group stressed the importance of up-to-date phone contacts for all employees, managers, and emergency contacts for employees to use during evacuation. The desired protocol was identified as a continually updated phone-tree detailing all positions, names, and contact information. Another current best practices and desired protocol is a self-reporting system for employees and families to declare the position they evacuated to, their wellbeing, and ability to telework or venture back to the office. Mandated trainings or drills should be designed to simulate an evacuation scenario, to practice this new system, and ensure a coordinated response during an event. Drills would solidify employee's evacuation plans, with information regarding where to evacuate, how long it will take to reach this location, and giving managers a level of confidence of employee's well-being. These drills are particularly important if two spouses are essential personnel, making it critical to determine how to get their dependents to safety ahead of time. It was suggested to work these conversations into annual performance reviews with employees, and annually updating contact info and evacuation information. In the event that communications went down during a storm event, the group suggested using government emergency telecommunication services such as the Government Emergency Telecommunications Services (GETS)/Wireless Priority Service (WIPS) wireless priority services. Verizon offers a similar priority service for government employees, and it was suggested to sign up for this program, or see if current service providers have similar options. It was suggested that all first responders and emergency personnel have access to alternative communications source, including SAT phones and other options. The group suggested clear, realistic and actionable COOP plans to address gaps. They stressed the constant updating of COOP plans, incorporating relevant contacts, teleworking requirements and specific trigger points to initiate action (e.g., when a flood stage reaches a certain height, a certain magnitude storm is approaching). The group also stressed the importance of regional plans with a specific localized detailed plan (e.g., flooding in Norfolk). These plans should be created and executed by a network of local, regional, and federal boards. One major gap identified was the lack of a network for federal employees during an event, inhibiting effective interagency coordination. Some closure information is available via TV reporting, but it would be helpful for a single federal source of information (e.g., online, centralized closure messaging bulletin). Ultimately, the group thought there needs to be more extensive planning, coordinated with stakeholders at every level, to create a comprehensive COOP plan. Though most entities reference NWS for their forecasts, the information can often conflict with localized forecasts and other sources of information. One implementation plan to solve this issue is to publish a list of authoritative sources to reference, including explanations of why each source is preferred, and what information it provides. This proposed implementation will ensure that appointed and elected officials know which resources to trust during an event. One lesson learned from the recent government shutdown was the unavailability of websites during an incident. This is especially true when networks are being accessed by thousands of users; adequate bandwidth is essential. One common platform for information was recommended, with capabilities to handle large volumes of users, relying on different entities to publish information on it."}, {"section_title": "VII.

ERMA allows responders to prepare for, respond to, and assess impacts from various incidents or conditions through analysis and visualization of environmental information relevant to all hazards. ERMA differs from a responsible party's (RP) COP as it includes both operational and environmental data, allowing holistic mapping of an event. Wright also described the requirements for a comprehensive COP, and how ERMA meets these requirements including: (1) 24/7 access for responders, (2) security capabilities to protect users and sensitive data, and (3) an intuitive interface, with data, symbology and products allowing interoperability between agencies.

NRAD is an all hazards directory for information about vessels and federal services. This searchable directory allows NOAA responders and approved external partners to identify assets that are in the region, enabling them to manage them efficiently. NRAD was created for responses in the Gulf of Mexico, but has since widened its focus nationally. NRAD is overseen by a team of data managers to update information and ensure its quality. The most important function of this tool is the \"search\" function, allowing users to find any asset of interest, with category filters and refinements such as location and type. Though many assets are defined in the system, some such as NOAA vessels, move frequently and it is important to consult with the contacts to verify status and location. Most of the data are self-reported, so data managers must remain vigilant in updating NRAD to insure it is a comprehensive source of asset information during a response."}, {"section_title": "Digital Coast, Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper, and Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-Cap)", "text": "Becky Allee, NOAA Office of Coastal Management (OCM) -Gulf Region, discussed the applications of Digital Coast and its associated tools. Digital Coast is a platform for coastal communities to access data, visualizations tools and training. It houses over 50 web-based, decision support tools, which can be accessed without additional software. The platform was first developed in 2007 by a network of partners including academia, NGO's and industry. These partners are responsible for maintaining and adding tools necessary for coastal zone management and conservation. The most used tools are shown on the home page, making the platform easily accessible for preparednessfocused end users. The Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper (CFEM), a frequently used tool, allows communities to identify vulnerabilities and types of hazards which helps start discussions of risks and areas of concern. The CFEM is a preparedness planning aid, and is not intended to replace similar FEMA resources. The tool is user friendly, with the ability to download, send, or share maps with fellow planners and community members via unique URLs. CFEM was initially created for Hurricane Sandy, but has now been adapted to regions across the nation. The Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) is another tool available on the Digital Coast. C-CAP is a database of coastal land uses around the country. It is sourced from the National Land Cover Database using LandSAT technology. The database has a 30-meter resolution, with land categories updated approximately every five years. It helps monitor trends and changes of land use, development, wetlands, and other planning considerations. C-CAP data are also used in the CFEM, allowing comparison between the two resources. C-CAP developers are working toward one-meter resolution throughout coastal regions. However, in the interim some areas may be categorized at a 10 meter resolution due to the high cost associated with this the 1 meter product."}, {"section_title": "VIMS Storm Surge Models", "text": "Derek Loftis discussed the applications of VIMS' StormSense, and associated tools such as Tidewatch Charts, and Tidewatch VA Coastal Inundation Forecast Maps. StormSense is one of the VIMS projects focusing on forecasting flooding from storm surge, rain, and tides. The objective of Storm Sense is to enhance the capability of communities to prepare for and respond to the disastrous impacts of sea level rise and coastal flooding in ways that are repeatable, scalable, measurable and make a comparative difference. StormSense operates using three major platforms: ESRI ArcGIS Online, Valarm Tools Cloud, and Amazon Web Services EC2 Cloud Platform. ArcGIS online enables dynamic inundation mapping and spatial comparisons with flood maps and the National Weather Model. The Valarm Tools Cloud receives, interprets and plots Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data for automated flood threshold exceedance alerts and serves as an input into flood visualization tools. Amazon Web Services allows public application programming interface (API) ingestion from external sources. Most of the regional data inputs originate from installed water level sensors around Norfolk. In addition to water level sensors, road inundation sensors have been deployed in frequently flooded intersections to identify when these areas are impacted. Some of StormSense's low-cost ultrasonic sensors were co-located adjacent to USGS' more expensive radar sensors to determine that their Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is 1.18 cm. This comprehensive system of sensors and analysis alerts users when certain areas are inundated or forecasted to flood. The project is geared towards response, however, has applications for city planning for flooding trends and forecasts. Tidewatch Charts provide an effective way to visualize and predict the magnitude and impacts of coastal flooding at specific locations within the Chesapeake Bay and along Virginia's shoreline. The charts are a series of water-level sensor plots updating each hour. Tidewatch Charts also feed data to sea level report cards that VIMS provides based upon NOAA reports, providing explanations of datum, trends, and all available information including consideration for local subsidence and regional ocean dynamics. In an effort to be user friendly for both communities and planners, Tidewatch Charts is a web-based application, not requiring programs such as GIS. The validation of information is undertaken through reference of more accurate NOAA and USGS sensors, as well as volunteer reporting of flooding events. Tidewatch VA Coastal Inundation Forecast Maps are used as a basis of storm surge modelling visualization. Using a web-based interactive platform, the maps do not require extra software, making them accessible to all members in a community. Tidewatch Maps are automated geospatial water level maps driven by VIMS' SCHISM hydrodynamic model, updated with NWS atmospheric inputs every 12 hours, providing inundation scenarios 36 hours in advance of a storm or flooding event. The model updates the inputs twice a day (noon and midnight), to provide continually relevant planning information. The resolution of the model is dependent on the accuracy of the LIDAR data used (average resolution = 5m). 2.3 million nodes and 1.5 million elements are incorporated into the model, and it is constantly validated and updated for accuracy."}, {"section_title": "National Hurricane Center Storm Surge Prediction Model", "text": "Mike Dutter explained the applications of the NWS and NOAA's National Hurricane Center Storm Surge Prediction Model. The goal of this model is to accurately predict and assess storm water levels, intuitively describe inundation as flooding above ground level, and to communicate actionable information. This model strives to answer many common customer questions, such as: Who and how much will get flooded? When will it arrive and leave? What will the impacts be? How often will it occur? How should I act?. One of the primary models is the Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH). SLOSH is a numerical model developed by the NWS to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical or predicted hurricanes considering parameters such as atmospheric pressure, size, forward speed and tracking data. SLOSH model physics are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, levees and other physical features. The SLOSH model also has the capability to analyze hypothetical situations such as \"What would happen if a category 1 hurricane hit Hampton Roads, VA\". The SLOSH approach incorporates three primary models for warnings/analyses with different timeframes: Probabilistic Storm Surge (P-Surge) model, Maximum Envelope of Water (MEOW) model, and the Maximum of the MEOWs (MOM) model. The MEOWs and MOMs are not storm specific, providing the worst case scenarios for a particular category storm, incorporated into the SLOSH products. The P-Surge predictions provide information during the response timeframe of an event, less than 48 hours before landfall. It focuses on actionable information, providing forecasts for storms with varying intensity and all possible tracks. These predictions can produce visualizations of many crucial elements to response, such as locations predicted to have greater than 5ft of storm surge with a 10% exceedance threshold. These models and visualizations provide actionable information, informing decisionmakers when to issue a coastal flood advisory or warning, or a storm surge warning."}, {"section_title": "Tide Forecaster", "text": "Michael Dutter described the applications of the Total Water Level Point Forecasts. This tool provides daily tide forecasts at point locations, allowing accurate historical analysis and future forecasts. The primary data input for this tool is various stream and coastal gauges along the eastern coast. This tool can provide hydrographs and enhanced warnings to affected areas. The total water predictions are integrated into Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS) with all river flood data accessible. The information and alerts from this tool are shared in text format, providing insight into the location, timing, and possible coastal impacts from a storm. The impacts shared by this tool are generalized and cannot predict specific impacts of inundation. They are meant to provide essential information for planning and preparedness."}, {"section_title": "NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services", "text": "Paul Fanelli presented on several of NOAA's coastal flood tools, including the new Coastal Inundation Dashboard, Seasonal High Tide Bulletins, and the Inundation Analysis Tool. The Coastal Inundation Dashboard provides real-time and historic coastal flooding information at a majority of the coastal water level stations operated by the National Ocean Service's (NOS) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products & Services (CO-OPS). This web mapping tool highlights realtime coastal inundation data regardless of the cause (e.g., tropical cyclone storm surge, high tide flooding, runoff events). It allows users to view real-time and 48-hour forecasts of water levels, and historic flooding information. A quick click on any station will show the latest water level data, wind speed, barometric pressure, time of next high tide, and highest forecast water level for the next day. Within the map, CO-OPS integrates the latest NWS tropical cyclone forecast information, storm surge and coastal flood watches and warnings. This allows users to easily monitor water levels at stations that may have the highest impact from a storm. Water levels are conveyed relative to the Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) tidal datum, (i.e., average daily highest tide) in order to provide a good estimate of when flooding inundation may begin. With average highest tide as the zero-line, data that are positive depict \"excess water\" being observed. Within the map, blinking station markers indicate that water levels have exceeded (or in some cases are forecast to exceed) the known minor flooding threshold usually set by the local NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO). When viewing water level data, these WFO flood impact thresholds are clearly depicted using the same colors used in NWS products, signifying minor, moderate or major flooding. Emergency managers and other coastal decision-makers can use this information to understand and prepare for the impacts of coastal flooding and monitor real-time water level conditions as a storm approaches. Sharing of information between community members is made easy through the creation of custom regional maps with unique URLs that can be sent to partners, with data constantly updating in real-time. The coastal planning community can use this information to gain a better understanding of past peak water level events and the increased frequency of days when flooding has occurred as sea levels have changed. Information such as the annual number of flood days, top 10 historic observed water levels and sea level trends can be found on a station's Inundation History page. The Seasonal High Tide Bulletin tool shows when regions around the nation may experience higher than normal tides. These predictions are based upon the relative position of the sun and moon and the distance of the moon from Earth. When the sun and moon are in alignment (full moon and new moon), the tidal forcing is amplified. When the moon is closest to Earth, the tidal forcing is also higher. When these two phenomena co-occur, there are higher than average tides. During these periods, (which typically last a few days), coastal flooding is more likely during onshore wind events, coastal storms and instances of excess runoff or can occur without any of these factors. Specific dates are provided indicating when tides will be higher than normal, allowing for planning and preparedness. This tool is region based, providing outlooks that can be used by all parties, from decision-makers to community members. The Inundation Analysis tool provides frequency and duration of inundation above a user-specified threshold elevation at a given location based on historic data from the NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services tide stations. Input thresholds and tidal datum can be input (e.g., average highest tide, average low tide) for exceedance analysis during a specified period (up to 5 years). This tool is very helpful for planning as any threshold can be used, which allows community planners to easily view whether and how often coastal water has impacted a specific location."}, {"section_title": "VIII. Workshop Outcomes", "text": "The outcomes represent actionable items, and commonalities identified during the workshop and by the organizing committee in a follow-up meeting. The three main NOAA actionable items address major gaps in training, communication, and reconstitution/COOP plans. The first gap identified is the disconnect between decision-makers and response staff. After identifying gaps in planning, policy and response, it was clear more communication is needed between those creating policy and those executing orders. Staff may not be involved in decisionmaking processes but should be to improve response and preparedness. Staff members do not necessarily have the authority to make decisions, yet have vital information that leadership may not know. The goal is to identify items actionable by staff, and those that need to be sent up to leadership. This disconnect could be partially eliminated by more consistent briefings between leadership and staff by requiring a liaison to transfer information. This challenge is policy-based and thus may not immediately be actionable by NOAA. There is a need for more training for NOAA supervisors to increase their effectiveness during response. These could be online, or in conjunction with other federal trainings, and should be directed at increasing supervisory awareness of response procedures, and consistent employee check-ins. Supervisors should regularly update staff directories, and all emergency information to have more accountability of staff during an event. These directories could be updated annually during employee performance evaluations or at other convenient times. Overall, supervisors should be aware of their responsibility for the safety of their employees, especially during response and evacuations. This information gathering, and training should be conducted prior to hurricane season, establishing updated cell phone numbers, evacuation zones, addresses, leave times, and anticipated evacuation destinations. With increased supervisory training and accountability for employees, emergency preparedness and response action will be improved. Many gaps were identified within reconstitution and COOP plans, requiring revision or creation of the plans to increase preparedness. Comprehensive reconstitution plans were a major concern, requiring action to create or modify existing plans. Reconstitution plans could be embedded within all COOP plans for them to be comprehensive. There was an identified gap between the creation and operation of local, regional and federal COOP plans. Local COOP plans should be coordinated with regional ones to improve both and ensure the effective use of resources and time. A holistic local Norfolk region COOP plan could be developed with the partners identified from this workshop. This coordinated regional COOP plan could serve as a model for others. Comprehensive COOP plans involving local, regional and federal partners would increase the preparedness of coastal regions. A tool matrix should be created that decision-makers can reference for preparedness and response. During the Tools Caf\u00e9, and workshop discussions, there were many concerns about the number of tools available, differences among tools, and uncertainty of which tools best suit specific needs. Potential users are often not aware of the available tools, hindering effectiveness. The creation of a tools matrix would streamline the process of choosing an effective tool, and increase preparedness and response. A similar platform, GulfTREE, was created for the Gulf region, and could be referenced or expanded to meet the Norfolk region's needs. There will be brief presentations on each of the tools with additional time for discussing tools' application and interaction. Following the discussion there will be time for hands-on training.
