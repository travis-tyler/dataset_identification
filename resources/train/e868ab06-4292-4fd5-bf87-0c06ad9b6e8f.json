Coprimary endpoints were the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale. The primary analysis compared 250 mg (n \u03ed 84) to placebo (n \u03ed 82) after an imbalance of infections and deaths led to early discontinuation of the 2 higher dose groups.\nThe 250 mg dose demonstrated acceptable safety. The primary efficacy analysis at 78 weeks revealed no significant differences between the treatment groups on the NTB or ADCS-ADL. Brain ventricular volume showed a small but significant increase in the overall 250 mg group (p \u03ed 0.049). At the 250 mg dose, scyllo-inositol concentrations increased in CSF and brain and CSF A\u2424x-42 was decreased significantly compared to placebo (p \u03ed 0.009).\nPrimary clinical efficacy outcomes were not significant.

[11] [12] [13] ELND005 is an orally bioavailable small molecule, which achieves steady state in plasma within 5 days, and at 2,000 mg twice daily has shown CNS penetration in healthy volunteers. 14 This profile makes ELND005 an attractive candidate as a potential disease-modifying oral treatment for AD.\nThis study evaluated safety, efficacy, and biomarker effects of ELND005 across a wide dose range. The doses of ELND005 (250, 1,000, and 2,000 mg) administered twice daily (BID) were based on cumulative phase 1 safety/pharmacokinetic data. Brain imaging and CSF biomarkers were incorporated to assess potential effects of ELND005 on disease pathology.

Random assignment was performed with an interactive voice response system using a computer-generated randomization list, which ensured that study site personnel had no knowledge of which group a given patient would be allocated to when making the determination of that patient's study eligibility. The randomization was stratified by MMSE score (16 -21 vs 22-26), \u2329POE \u24404 carrier status (1 or 2 alleles vs none), and use of approved AD symptom-atic medications (yes vs no). Cognitive, functional, and MRI assessments were performed at baseline and weeks 12 (no MRI), 24, 48, and 78. An Independent Safety Monitoring Committee (ISMC) reviewed ongoing and final study results. Administrative analyses were conducted after all patients had completed 24 and 48 weeks on study (see appendix e-1 for details). Based on the 48-week safety review, patients in the 1,000 and 2,000 mg groups were withdrawn; no changes were made to study conduct for patients in the 250 mg or placebo groups. Safety measures. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms. MRI safety assessments included fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and gradient-echo MRI sequences 18 performed every 6 months in conjunction with volumetric MRI studies; results were interpreted by site-affiliated local radiologists.\nEfficacy outcome measures. The coprimary efficacy endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 78 in Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) 19 z score and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) score. 20 Secondary clinical endpoints were the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), 21 Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), 22, 23 and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scores. 24 A 12-item ADAS-Cog version was used (75-point maximum score), including \"concentration/distractibility\" as the 12th item. Exploratory clinical outcomes were change from baseline to week 78 in MMSE 16 score and 3 responder analyses: proportion of patients having either 1) \u03fe0.3-point worsening in NTB z score, 2) \u03fd6point worsening in ADAS-Cog score, or 3) no change or improvement in NTB z score or ADCS-ADL score.

Baseline measures were well-balanced across all groups (table 1). After discontinuation of the 2 high-dose groups, the primary analysis was based on 166 patients (n \u03ed 84 250 mg; n \u03ed 82 placebo).\nSafety. The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar across the 4 dose groups. TEAEs were reported for 91.6% and 87.5% of patients in the placebo and 250 mg groups, respectively. The most common AEs in the 250 mg group are shown in table 2. The safety and tolerability profiles in APOE \u24404 carriers and noncarriers were similar. The incidence of withdrawals due to AE was higher in the 1,000 mg (16.9%) and 2,000 mg (13.2%) groups than in the 250 mg (10.2%) and placebo (9.6%) groups. The incidence of SAEs was also higher in the ELND005 groups compared with placebo (23.1, 22.5, 21.6, and 13.3%, in the 2,000 mg, 1,000 mg, 250 mg, and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of respiratory tract infections was higher in the 1,000 mg and 2,000 mg groups than in the placebo and 250 mg groups, even when adjusted for duration of exposure to account for early termination of the high dose groups. The overall incidence of SAEs was similar in the mild and moderate subgroups, except for serious infections and neurologic and psychiatric SAEs, which were lower in the mild subgroup.\nAt the week 48 ISMC review, more SAEs of infection were found in the 2,000 mg group compared to other groups, and a disproportionate number of deaths was seen in the 2 high-dose groups, with 0, 1, 5, and 4 deaths in the placebo, 250, 1,000, and 2,000 mg groups, respectively. Nine of the 10 deaths were assessed as not related to study drug by the reporting investigator. The patients who died tended to be older, and 9 of the 10 were in the moderate AD stratum (table e-3). The sponsor electively discontinued the 1,000 and 2,000 mg groups with the concurrence of the ISMC. The 250 mg group showed an acceptable safety profile and was continued. No additional deaths occurred in the 250 mg or placebo groups. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs or laboratory measures except for a dose-dependent decrease in uric acid. The mild and moderate subgroups had similar TEAE profiles, except for confusional episodes (predominantly in moderate patients).\nEfficacy. Primary endpoints. In the overall mITT population that included patients with mild and moderate AD (MMSE 16 -26), the NTB z score difference was 0.033 (95% CI \u03ea0.140, 0.205) and the ADCS-ADL difference was \u03ea1.4 (95% CI \u03ea5.4, 2.6) (figure 2; table e-2). Neither of these differences was significant. In the overall PPS population, treatment differences on the NTB and the ADCS-ADL scores were also not significant.\nSecondary and exploratory clinical endpoints. In the overall mITT population, patterns of change similar to the primary outcomes were noted for CDR-SB, NPI, ADAS-Cog, and MMSE (table e-2), none of which achieved significance. The proportion of \"responders\" who did not decline on either primary endpoint was 38% in the 250 mg and 32% in placebo groups. When the 2 high-dose groups were discontinued, \u03fd25% of patients in those 2 groups had completed week 78, and clinical assessments of discontinuing patients were partially unblinded (investigators were aware that they were in the high-dose groups). Observed treatment effects at the 1,000 and 2,000 mg doses were not significant in comparison to the 250 mg dose or placebo on the primary endpoints (summary statistics of observed values are presented in appendix e-1). Prospectively defined subgroup analyses. Demographic characteristics for the subgroups analyzed were generally balanced (table e-1). APOE \u24404 carrier status had no consistent effect on treatment outcomes. No significant treatment differences were seen in the moderate subgroup. As shown in table e-2, differences between 250 mg and placebo in the mITT analysis of the mild subgroup were 0.200 on the NTB (95% CI \u03ea0.046, 0.446; p \u03ed 0.110) and 2.3 on the ADCS-ADL (95% CI \u03ea3.4, 7.9; p \u03ed 0.426).\nIn the PPS analysis of the mild subgroup, treatmentplacebo difference of 0.403 (95% CI 0.111, 0.695) on the NTB was significant ( p \u03ed 0.007), but the ADCS-ADL difference of 2.3 (95% CI \u03ea3.8, 8.3) was not ( p \u03ed 0.459). The CDR-SB treatment differences of 0.87 (95% CI \u03ea0.44, 2.19) in the mild mITT ( p \u03ed 0.189) and 0.95 (95% CI \u03ea0.50, 2.40) in the mild PPS ( p \u03ed 0.195) were not significant, but were directionally consistent with the NTB (figure 2; table e-2). The ADAS-Cog treatment difference was not significant. Exploratory responder analyses in the mild subgroup favored treatment over placebo and were statistically significant in the PPS, but not mITT analysis (see table e-2).\nImaging biomarker endpoints. In the overall mITT population, the change from baseline in ventricular volume was greater (3.2 mL; 95% CI 0.01, 6.4; p \u03ed 0.049) in the 250 mg group (14.1 mL; 95% CI 11.7, 16.4) compared to the placebo group (10.9 mL; 95% CI 8.6, 13.2). Whole brain volume, hippocampal volume, and cortical ribbon thickness treatment differences were not significant (not shown).\nCSF biomarkers. At the week 24 (primary) time point, changes from baseline in A\u242440, A\u242442, tau, and p-tau concentrations were not significant. The week 78 samples from 20 patients showed a significant reduction in A\u242442 in the 250 mg group compared to placebo (\u03ea191.3 pg/mL [95% CI \u03ea329.6, \u03ea53.0; p \u03ed 0.009]). The decrease in tau (\u03ea39.9, 95% CI \u03ea160.7, 80.9; p \u03ed 0.497) was not significant (figure 3)."}, {"section_title": "Plasma and CSF pharmacokinetics of ELND005.", "text": "Plasma concentrations increased proportionately with dose and reached steady state between weeks 2 and 12 (not shown).

"}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The imbalance in the number of deaths and serious infections at the week 48 administrative analysis resulted in discontinuation of the 2 highest dose groups. The overall number and causes of death and the nature of infections were similar to rates reported in epidemiologic studies 31, 32 and in AD trials of similar duration. 33 The mechanistic relationship, if any, between high doses and increase in infections remains unclear but is under investigation. The 250 mg group displayed an acceptable safety profile, which was not affected by patients' APOE \u24404 carrier status. There were no reports of cerebral vasogenic edema 18 at any dose, as assessed by local site radiologists. The differences between the 250 mg and placebo groups (overall mITT, n \u03ed 166) were not significant for the coprimary (NTB and ADCS-ADL) or secondary endpoints. In the prespecified subgroup analyses, there were no consistent efficacy trends in the moderate AD or APOE \u24404 carrier or noncarrier subgroups.\nIn the prespecified subgroup of mild patients who completed the study and were compliant (PPS analysis), the 250 mg dose showed a significant and clinically relevant treatment effect on the NTB. The CDR-SB treatment difference of 0.95, although not significant, was directionally consistent with the NTB. The rate of CDR-SB decline on placebo (2.17 points over 78 weeks) was similar to that observed in the ADNI mild AD cohort (1.6 points over 52 weeks). 34 The ADAS-Cog treatment-placebo difference was not significant but was directionally opposite to the NTB. The ADAS-Cog treatment-placebo difference was largely driven by minimal decline on placebo (2 points over 78 weeks), which is one-third the rate from the ADNI mild AD cohort (4.3 points over 52 weeks). 34 The low rate of placebo worsening on ADAS-Cog was also inconsistent with the rates of placebo worsening on the NTB, CDR-SB, and ADCS-ADL in this study. The NTB was chosen as the study's primary cognitive outcome measure because of its greater sensitivity in patients with mild AD. 19, 35 The ADAS-Cog is most sensitive to change in patients with moderate disease. 36, 37 Since the NTB captures changes in delayed memory and executive function which are not well-covered by the ADAS-Cog, our findings support the choice of the NTB for studies in mild AD.\nThere is a growing consensus that amyloidtargeted agents may provide more meaningful benefit when introduced at early stages of the disease. 38 The positive cognitive trends in compliant mild patients are consistent with the preclinical effects of ELND005. In TgCRND8 mice, scyllo-inositol showed a more robust reduction of plaque accumulation when treatment was started at an earlier age. 7 In patients with mild to moderate disease, the ventricular volume increase was significantly larger in the 250 mg group but was of small magnitude. In the mild group, the increase in ventricular volume was smaller and not significantly different from placebo. Although counterintuitive, similar findings were observed with other amyloid-targeted therapies. 39, 40 The observed ventricular enlargement could be due to inositol-related osmotic effects, to blockage of the arachnoid villi during the process of amyloid clearance, or could reflect \"ex vacuo\" changes due to amyloid clearance leading to a decrease in brain volume.\nThe 250 mg dose achieved CSF concentrations similar to those associated with improved learning in animal models. 7 This dose also demonstrated a significant reduction of CSF A\u242442 at 78 weeks, which may reflect a gradual reduction of brain amyloid pathology consistent with findings in transgenic animals. 5, 7 In contrast to the CSF A\u242442 decline that is associated with greater plaque burden during the early stages of AD, the anti-aggregation effects of ELND005 are thought to result in clearance of soluble A\u2424 peptides and in decreased brain amyloid burden. The decrease in amyloid burden may be reflected in lower CSF A\u242442 levels, and possibly in larger ventricular volume at week 78.\nThe study's limitations include the decreased power to test the coprimary endpoints due to discontinuation of 2 dose groups and the small sample size of the prespecified subgroups and the CSF substudy. There were no statistical corrections for the multiple analyses.\nDespite the limitations, and the fact that the study did not achieve its primary objective, these results will inform the design of future studies. The safety findings at the highest doses helped define the AEs to be carefully monitored in future studies. The 250 mg dose demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability, CNS penetration, and target engagement (A\u242442 reduction), and showed potential cognitive benefit in patients with mild disease. These results will help optimize the dose range and choice of biomarkers, and will aid the selection of the appropriate patient population. Our findings support the concept that amyloid-targeted therapies may have their greatest benefit in patients at earlier stages of AD."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Dr. Salloway: drafting/revising the manuscript, study concept or design, analysis or interpretation of data, acquisition of data, study supervision.
