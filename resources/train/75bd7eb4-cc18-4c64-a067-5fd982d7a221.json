Further, we use an array of curve-fitting techniques on government-reported numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, separately projecting and collating curves from multiple regions across the globe, at multiple levels of granularity, combining heavily-localized extrapolations to create accurate national predictions. Findings: We achieve an R 2 of 0\u00b7999 on average through the use of curve-fits and fine-tuned statistical learning methods on historical, global data. Using neural network implementations, we consistently predict the number of reported cases in 9 geographicallyand demographically-varied countries and states with an accuracy of 99\u00b753% for 14 days of forecast and 99\u00b71% for 24 days of forecast. Interpretation: We have shown that curve-fitting and machine-learning methods applied on reported COVID-19 data almost perfectly reproduce the results of far more complex and data-intensive epidemiological models. Using our methods, several other parameters may be established, such as the average detection rate of COVID-19. As an example, we find that the detection rate of cases in India (even with our most lenient estimates) is 2.38% -almost a fourth of the world average of 9% [1] ."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic [2] , noting that there were \"more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries, and 4,291 people have lost their lives.\" Today, there are over 10 million confirmed cases. However, the availability and reliability of government-reported data remains questionable.\nWe employ a number of curve-fitting and machine-learning techniques to predict government reported numbers of infections in regions around the globe with high accuracy. In India, we note -with surprise -that this accuracy persisted through changes in testing policy, which suggests that these changes were not significant at the ground level.\nThen, we describe a parameterized method of estimating the number of infections (including unreported infections) from the reported number of COVID-19 deaths. This uses demographics adjusted infection fatality ratio (IFR), disease progression, reporting rates, and growth statistics from recent literature and produces a count consistent with other, more complex, epidemiological models (INDSCI-SIM [3] , MSEIRS [4] , etc.).\nThese estimates may be used to compute other epidemiologically-significant variables, such as detection rate, which will hopefully be useful inputs to other models. While our predictions have been successful in predicting government-reported number in May and June (25th May to 16th June), we note that, with constantly evolving and updating numbers, the accuracy of our predictions can continuously improved by running our methods on the latest data available from reliable sources. We have also applied our methods on current data (updated till 19th July, 2020) and report these predictions in Appendix F.

We also study and use the case progression in other countries to predict progression in Indian states and districts, adjusting for around 24 medical and demographic variables through a multivariate and multi-output neural network.

This was updated every time a case was added. We ignored districts with 0 cases. For all others, we started the day the first case was reported. Districts reporting an increase in infections for fewer than five days (across the period we were analyzing) were not subject to predictions using our logistic growth function. Instead, the prediction was simply the last reported total.\nUS States: Data was taken from the New York Times database [8] .

The prediction presented for these parameters are the number that the government or an authorised agency would report.\nPossible 'second-waves' of COVID-19 in certain countries like the USA can also be indirectly accounted for using our methods. As most European countries are yet to show signs of a second wave, we have avoided any detailed description on the issue. However, while using our curve-scaling methods, the seconds waves may be treated as a superimposition of a sigmoid on an earlier sigmoid. Our Machine Learning based models should not require any further modification as LSTMs are generally superior at learning such trends in sequential data. If desired, additional 'attention' modules may be appended to the LSTMs to further improve accuracy.\nWhile our methods may be applied on any country with a high number of reported COVID-19 cases, running them on data from India yeilds a detection rate of 2.9% in India, which falls in between the previously reported estimates of the same (1.45% [1] and 3.6% [21] ). It may be noted that this rate is much lower than the world average of 9% [1] and is a genuine cause of concern. Recent serological survey results [25] show that 23.48% of people have been exposed to the virus. This is fairly consistent with our prediction of 29.7% as of 19th July.
