The findings in this report come from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). The ECLS-K, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), selected a nationally representative sample of kindergartners in the fall of 1998 and is following these children through the end of fifth grade. The full ECLS-K sample is comprised of approximately 22,000 children who attended about 1,000 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year. The children attended both public (85 percent) and private (15 percent) kindergartens that offered full-day (55 percent) and part-day (45 percent) programs. All kindergarten children within the sampled schools were eligible for the sampling process, including language minority and special education students. The sample includes children from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. In the fall of 1998, about 95 percent of kindergartners were entering school for the first time. This report focuses on these first-time kindergartners. When information on children's cognitive knowledge and skills is presented, this report focuses on the children in the sample who received the cognitive assessment in English in both the fall and the spring of their kindergarten year. 1"}, {"section_title": "Findings Question 1: Gain, Differences in Gain, and Spring Kindergarten Status in Children's Knowledge and Skills", "text": "To address the first set of questions, the change from the fall of kindergarten to the spring of kindergarten in children's reading and mathematics scale scores was examined. These scores reflect children's overall performance in these domains. The possibility that particular groups of children might demonstrate more or less gain over the kindergarten was also explored 1 Approximately 30 percent of Hispanic children and 19 percent of Asian children were not assessed in English and are not included in the estimates related to cognitive knowledge and skills. The Hispanic children who were proficient in Spanish were assessed in Spanish (for details see Methodology and Technical Notes, Constructs, and Variables Used in Analysis). The Hispanic and the Asian children not assessed in English are included in the estimates related to noncognitive knowledge and skills. And, due to specific instructions listed in the child's school record, about one-half percent of children were excluded from the cognitive assessment based on a disability. (e.g., children at risk for later school difficulty might not acquire reading knowledge and skills at the same rate as children not at risk for later school difficulty). As their kindergarten year comes to a close, children demonstrate higher levels of reading and mathematics knowledge and skills than they demonstrated as they entered school for the first time. Children's reading scale scores increased by 10 points from the fall to the spring (figure A). Therefore, the gain from fall to spring is about one standard deviation (an appreciable increase). Children's mathematics scores increased by eight points from the fall to the spring (figure B). Thus, children's mathematics knowledge and skills increased about one standard deviation during the kindergarten year. For the most part, the gains children demonstrate in their overall reading and mathematics knowledge and skills do not differ markedly by child, family, and kindergarten program characteristics. For example, there is not more than a twopoint difference in the gains children demonstrate in reading and mathematics by mother's education. The absence of a substantial differential gain in children's general reading and mathematics knowledge and skills is seen again when we consider other characteristics of children, their families, and their kindergarten programs, such as children's age as they enter school and family risks for later school difficulty. The same is true when we look at school type and kindergarten program type. However when we consider the specific knowledge and skills children are acquiring (e.g., letter recognition, addition and subtraction, making friends, paying attention), children are developing particular cognitive and noncognitive knowledge and skills at different rates. "}, {"section_title": "Scale score", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Question 2: Gain, Differences in Gain and Spring Kindergarten Status in Children's Specific Knowledge and Skills", "text": "To address the second set of questions, children's specific cognitive and noncognitive knowledge and skills were examined. Furthermore, the question of whether certain groups of children were more likely to acquire specific cognitive and noncognitive knowledge and skills than others was explored (e.g., does the probability that children acquire the reading skill of sight-word recognition vary by the level of their mother's education?). Finally, information is presented on the specific knowledge and skills children demonstrate in the spring of their kindergarten year as they are preparing for first grade. In addition to the overall reading and mathematics scale scores, the ECLS-K assessment battery provides information on specific proficiencies. In the reading domain, the ECLS-K assessment battery provides information on: letter recognition; understanding of the lettersound relationship at the beginning of words; understanding of the letter-sound relationship at the ending of words; sight-word recognition; and understanding of words in context. In the mathematics domain, the ECLS-K assessment battery provides information on: recognizing single-digit numbers and basic shapes; counting beyond 10, recognizing the sequence in basic patterns, and comparing the relative size (dimensional relationship) of objects; recognizing two-digit numbers, identifying the next number in a sequence, and identifying the ordinal position of an object; performing simple addition and subtraction; and performing basic multiplication and division. Across the kindergarten year, children acquire specific knowledge and skills in reading and mathematics (figures C and D). By the end of their kindergarten year, nearly all children recognize their letters, their numbers and their shapes. The percent of children who can recognize words by sight and demonstrate an understanding of words in context, though still relatively low, increased from kindergarten entry to kindergarten exit. And the numbers of children adding and subtracting also increased from kindergarten entry to kindergarten exit. We see less dramatic changes in children's social skills and approaches to learning across the kindergarten year, with a large percentage of children exhibiting prosocial behaviors and positive approaches to learning. x  "}, {"section_title": "Percent", "text": "xi When we examined children's overall gains in reading and mathematics knowledge and skills, as measured by their reading and mathematics scale scores, by child, family and kindergarten program characteristics, we found little evidence of differential gains from fall to spring. Based on those findings, the conclusion might be that from fall to spring of kindergarten, all children are acquiring knowledge and skills at approximately the same rate, and that they are learning the same things. However, this is not completely accurate. We see a very different picture when we look at children's acquisition of specific knowledge and skills. To illustrate, children from the more disadvantaged backgrounds (those with at least one risk factor) are closing the gaps in basic skills (i.e., recognizing their letters and counting beyond 10, recognizing the sequence in basic patterns and comparing the relative size of objects). However, these same children lag further behind their more advantaged classmates when it comes to gaining more sophisticated reading and mathematics knowledge and skills (i.e., recognizing words by sight or solving simple addition and subtraction problems). In fact, the gap has widened. The same basic patterns we see when we consider cumulative family-risk factors are present when we consider other child characteristics, such as race/ethnicity. Furthermore, to illustrate, we see some evidence of differential gain in the frequency with which children demonstrate specific social skills. According to their teachers, younger children are more likely to acquire the skill of paying attention than their older counterparts during the kindergarten year. As children are completing kindergarten and preparing for first grade, almost all (94 percent) children know their letters, and 72 percent understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning of words, while 52 percent understand the letter-sound relationship at the ending of words. In fact, 13 percent demonstrate a proficient understanding of words by sight and 4 percent, words in context (figure C). In mathematics, 99 percent of children recognize their numbers and basic shapes, and the majority (87 percent) demonstrate understanding of dimensional relationships among objects (relative size). Just over half (56 percent) of children demonstrate an understanding of the mathematical concept ordinality. Moreover, 18 xii percent show they can add and subtract, and 2 percent are successfully performing multiplication and division (figure D).\nrate these behaviors as occurring never, sometimes, often, or very often. In this report, we collapse the categories into never/sometimes or often/very often. Similar to children's cognitive knowledge and skills, we see change in children's social skills and in how they approach learning (tables 5, 6, and 7). According to their teachers, 11 in the spring of their kindergarten year, a majority of children often or very often accept peer ideas in cooperative activities (77 percent), form friendships easily (82 percent) and comfort others (62 percent). This is a slight increase from when these same children entered kindergarten, when 74 percent often or very often accepted peer ideas in cooperative activities, 77 percent formed friendships easily, and 52 percent comforted others (table 5) We see less dramatic changes in children's social skills and approaches to learning across the kindergarten year, though we do see that for the most part, children are gaining in prosocial interaction and in their approaches to learning. It should be noted that the gains children make in the cognitive area cannot truly be compared to the gains children make in the social areas. For the cognitive assessment, we were able to administer a more comprehensive direct assessment. In the social area, for these very young children, we relied on the teacher's report. Therefore, the less dramatic changes we report in social skills and approaches to learning may be, in part, attributed to how well we are able to measure these different developmental domains.\nThe same basic patterns we see when we consider cumulative family risk factors are present when we consider other child characteristics, such as race/ethnicity (tables 3 and 4). For example, during the kindergarten year, black and Hispanic children closed the gap with white and Asian children in basic reading and mathematics knowledge and skills (i.e., recognizing letters and relative size). Yet, they are not acquiring the more advanced knowledge and skills (i.e., sight words and addition) at the same rate as their white and Asian counterparts. Furthermore, to illustrate, we see some evidence of differential gain in the frequency with which children demonstrate specific social skills (tables 5, 6, and 7). According to their teachers, younger children are more likely to acquire the skill of paying attention than their older counterparts during the kindergarten year (table 7).\ncontext than children in part-day kindergartens (table 3). Though no clear pattern emerges in children's prosocial behaviors (e.g., accepting peer ideas and forming friendships) by their school type or their program type, there are some interesting differences when we examine children's problem behaviors by kindergarten program type (i.e., how often they argue with others and fight with others) (tables 5 and 6). According to their teachers, children in full-day kindergarten programs are more likely than children in part-day programs to exhibit these problem behaviors. Once again, caution should be used in interpreting differences, as the same differences are observed at kindergarten entry. In terms of kindergarten program type, it is interesting to note that children in full-day programs may demonstrate slightly higher cognitive knowledge and skills, but they also are more likely to exhibit a higher frequency of some problem behaviors. When we look at which children are demonstrating gains in reading and mathematics knowledge and skills, we find an interesting picture. As children enter kindergarten, they demonstrate a wide range of knowledge and skills. At kindergarten entry, children at risk for later school difficulty (as indicated by the risk-factor index we formed) are less likely to know their letters, understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and ending of words, know their numbers, demonstrate an understanding of relative size and of ordinality (West et al. 2000). Across the kindergarten year, we see that these same children (those at risk) are gaining, in terms of basic reading and mathematical knowledge and skills (i.e., letters, relative size), on their more advantaged counterparts-in other words, the gap is closing. However, at-risk children are falling further behind in terms of the more sophisticated reading and mathematics knowledge and skills (i.e., recognizing words by sight, addition/subtraction)-in other words, the gap is widening. As a result, by the end of kindergarten, we see many of the same differences in knowledge and skills that we saw at the beginning of the school year. After a year of formal schooling, we still see differences in children's knowledge and skills by child and family characteristics (e.g., children with mothers who have higher levels of education demonstrate higher reading and mathematics knowledge and skills, children with fewer risks for later school difficulty demonstrate higher reading and mathematics knowledge and skills)."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Young children need knowledge and new experiences to develop and thrive. Schools offer a plethora of learning and development opportunities for children. Consequently, it is not surprising that across the kindergarten year children are rapidly acquiring the knowledge and skills integral to succeed in school and life.

This change is influenced by both developmental factors (e.g., age, maturation) and environmental factors (e.g., schooling, home educational activities, family resources). Across this first year of schooling, children will acquire the knowledge and skills that will prove integral to their future success in school and in life. Children enter school demonstrating a vast array of knowledge and skills, with some children further along than others (West et al. 2000). The kindergarten year serves multiple purposes and is geared toward the development of both cognitive and noncognitive knowledge and skills (Seefeldt 1990). And, depending on the child, knowledge and skills develop in different areas and at different rates across this year of school. Classically, kindergarten has represented a place where children are given the opportunity to explore their world through play. Over the last 100 years, this idea has been refined to stress the importance of opportunity for active engagement and exploration in real-world settings (Dewey 1976(Dewey , 1944Roopnarine and Johnson 1993;Seefeldt and Barbour 1994). In the United States, kindergarten took root as an agent for change to help enrich the lives of children from disadvantaged backgrounds, with education seen as an important tool for social reform (Roopnarine and Johnson 1993;Seefeldt and Barbour 1994). Early childhood education continues today to be seen as an important influence on young children's development and learning, and most children regardless of their backgrounds attend kindergarten programs. The original purpose of kindergarten-to \"support children's social and emotional adjustment to group learning\"-has been expanded to include support for children's cognitive development and preparation for the academic instruction to come (Bredekamp and Copple 1997, p. 142). While the cognitive benefits seem apparent, the effect of kindergarten on socioemotional development is less clear. Though historically the role of kindergarten was focused on socialization, a majority of children today have experience in early care and group settings prior to entering kindergarten (Bredekamp and Copple 1997;West et al. 2000;West et al. 1992). Consequently, the role of kindergarten may be evolving toward a more cognitive purpose. Over the years, research on our nation's children suggests that, by late elementary school, children are demonstrating differences in their knowledge and skills by characteristics such as socioeconomic status, level of maternal education, and race/ethnicity (Donahue et al. 1999;Reese et al. 1997). We are now beginning to document that some of these differences exist as children are just entering kindergarten (West et al. 2000). To enrich the picture of children's first experience in formal education-the kindergarten year-we need to understand the knowledge and skills children possess as they enter kindergarten and we need to gain insight into how children's knowledge and skills develop across the kindergarten year. This report attempts to answer two basic sets of questions about children's knowledge and skill acquisition during the kindergarten year. the risk index ranges from 0 risks to 4. In this report, we collapsed the index into 3 categories, 0 risks, 1 risk, and 2 or more risks. The index provides information on the potential related effects when these risks exist in concert. Finally, children's knowledge and skills are explored by whether the children are enrolled in full-versus part-day kindergarten programs and in public versus private kindergarten programs. The characteristics examined in this report are likely to be highly interrelated. For example, the number of first-time kindergartners with different numbers of family risk factors varies by race/ethnicity. About 72 percent of Hispanic and black children come from families with one or more risk factors, as compared with 61 percent of Asian children, and 29 percent of white children (Zill and West 2000). While acknowledging this, this report looks at each characteristic separately when describing the children's knowledge and skills."}, {"section_title": "Organization of Report", "text": "The remainder of this report is organized into four sections.

The ECLS-K directly assessed children's cognitive skills with a reading and mathematics battery. 6 The reading assessment captured information on children's basic literacy skills, such as understanding the directionality of print, recognizing letters, identifying sounds, word reading, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. The mathematics assessment measured children's conceptual understanding of numbers, shapes, patterns, mathematical operations, and processes for problem solving. To address children's social knowledge and skills, teachers were asked to assess individual behaviors exhibited by the children. For this report, these teacher-rated items were not scaled. Instead, children's individual behaviors will be reported on in the next section, where developmental gain in relation to specific knowledge and skills is addressed. To understand how children's reading and mathematics knowledge and skills are changing across the kindergarten year, their overall gains in their knowledge and skills will be described. Next, differences in these gains by child, family, and kindergarten program characteristics will be explored.

Consequently, the gain from fall to spring is about one standard deviation (an appreciable increase). Children's mathematics scores increased by eight points from the fall to the spring. Thus, children's mathematics knowledge and skills increased about one standard deviation during the kindergarten year. 8 7 The reading scale ranged from 0-72, with fall scores ranging from 10-70 and spring 10-71.

However, as we will see in the next section, when we consider the specific knowledge and skills children are acquiring (e.g., letter recognition, addition and subtraction, making friends, paying attention), children are developing particular cognitive and noncognitive knowledge and skills at different rates. "}, {"section_title": "Differences in Children's Knowledge and Skills by Child, Family and Kindergarten Program Characteristics: Spring of Kindergarten", "text": "As children are just beginning school, their knowledge and skills already differ (West et al. 2000;Zill and West 2000). This begs the question-at the end of their kindergarten year as they are preparing to enter first grade, do children's knowledge and skills still differ by child, family, and kindergarten program characteristics? In other words, as children enter school for the first time, their reading and mathematics knowledge and skills differ by their age at entry, the level of their mother's education, their race/ethnicity, and risk factors associated with school success, such as primary language in the home or living in a single-parent household. Do we find these same differences after a year of formal schooling? Age: Since kindergarten attendance is not mandatory in all states, parents have some flexibility in deciding when to enroll their children. Most states have age of entry guidelines that require children to have turned age 5 sometime between August 31 and January 1. Therefore, the majority of children entering kindergarten in the fall of 1998 were born between September 1992 and December 1993 (West et al. 2000). When considering the variation in children's knowledge and skills by their age, we focus our comparisons on children born between September 1992 through December 1993 (i.e., the \"mainstream\" ages). We present some limited information on children who are slightly older than the mainstream-those born January through August of 1992. These children represent a unique and diverse group (e.g., those whose parents may have delayed them to provide them with an advantage or due to developmental concerns, or whose schools may have a kindergarten readiness requirement), so we do not focus on them in our analysis. In the spring of their kindergarten year, older children possess higher reading and mathematics knowledge and skills than their younger counterparts 9 (table 2). Thus, the slight advantage older children possessed as they entered kindergarten persists across the school year. Maternal Education: Similar to when they entered kindergarten, at the end of their kindergarten year, children's reading and mathematics knowledge and skills differ by the level of their mother's education. Kindergartners whose mothers have higher levels of education demonstrate higher levels of reading and mathematics knowledge and skills than kindergartners whose mothers have less education (table 2). Race/Ethnicity: Children who are white and Asian demonstrate higher levels of reading and mathematics knowledge and skills than their black and Hispanic classmates (table 2). Again, this is a pattern we observed at the start of the kindergarten year. Risk: When considering family risks for later school difficulty (e.g., low maternal education, non-English primary language in the home), it is important to understand how these factors behave cumulatively. Consequently, we consider the impact of multiple risks on children's knowledge and skills. To do this, we constructed an index which consists of the following risk factors: mother's education less than high school, family utilization of AFDC and/or food stamps, single-parent family, and primary home language other than English. The index is scored zero, one or two or more-meaning the presence of none of the risk factors, the presence of one of the risk factors, or the presence of two or more of the risk factors. The fewer the risk factors present, the better kindergartners seem to be doing in reading and mathematics. At the end of the kindergarten year, just as they did at the beginning, children who have fewer risk factors demonstrate higher levels of reading and mathematics knowledge and skills than those with two or more risk factors (table 2).

To illustrate this, we look at how children's specific knowledge and skills change from the fall of kindergarten to the spring of kindergarten. Further, we explore whether the gains in children's specific knowledge and skills vary by child, family, and kindergarten program characteristics (e.g., those at risk for later school difficulty). Finally, we examine whether the differences in children's specific knowledge and skills by child, family, and kindergarten program characteristics (e.g., children's age, their mother's education, their race/ethnicity) persist across the kindergarten year (for more information on such differences at school entry, see West et al. 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Gain in Specific Knowledge and Skills from Fall to Spring", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cognitive Knowledge and Skills", "text": "In addition to the reading and mathematics scale scores, the ECLS-K assessment battery provides information on specific proficiencies.

The addition, subtraction, multiplication and division items are presented in the form of word problems with picture support and in numerical statements. In terms of specific knowledge and skills in reading, at kindergarten entry, two-thirds of children (65 percent) can recognize their letters and some understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and ending of words (29 percent and 17 percent, respectively). 10 When we look at these skills at the end of kindergarten, the picture is very different. As they are finishing kindergarten, nearly all first-time kindergartners are recognizing their letters (94 percent), and nearly three out of four children (72 percent) understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and about half (52 percent) understand the letter-sound relationship at the ending of words (figure 4, table 3).

For example, older first-time kindergartners are more likely to demonstrate emergent literacy skills and knowledge (i.e., recognizing their letters and understanding the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and ending of words) than younger kindergartners (table 3). Older kindergartners are also more likely than younger kindergartners to be reading (i.e., recognizing words by sight and understanding words in context) (table 3). We see a similar pattern in children's specific mathematics knowledge and skills. Almost all kindergartners know their basic numbers and shapes; however, older kindergartners are more likely than younger kindergartners to demonstrate other early mathematics knowledge and skills (i.e., relative size; ordinality) (table 4). Older kindergartners are also more likely to do simple addition and subtraction problems and even to do simple multiplication and division problems (table 4). Overall, the frequency with which children, in the spring of their kindergarten year, engage in prosocial behaviors, such as accepting peer ideas, making friends and comforting others, does not differ by their age. However, we see a difference between the older kindergartners (those just turning 6 as they enter school-born September through December 1992) and the youngest kindergartners (those just turning 5 as they enter school-born September through December 1993). How children approach learning differs by their age. Older kindergartners are more likely to persist at tasks, seem more eager to learn and to pay attention than their younger counterparts (table 7). According to their teachers, in the spring of their kindergarten year, children's social skills and how they approach learning differs by their race/ethnicity. 13 White and Asian children are more likely to accept peer ideas and form friendships than black children (table 5). Black children are more likely to get angry easily, argue with others, and fight with others than white, Asian and Hispanic children (table 6). Also according to their teachers, Asian children are the most likely to persist at tasks, seem eager to learn, and pay attention; and white children are more likely to exhibit these behaviors than black or Hispanic children (table 7)."}, {"section_title": "Risk:", "text": "To explore children's specific knowledge and skills by family risk factors, we utilize the risk factor index (discussed earlier in this report). At the end of the kindergarten year, children who have fewer risk factors are doing better than children with more risk factors in each of the specific areas of reading and mathematics measured in the ECLS-K (tables 3 and 4). This is true in terms of kindergartners' specific reading (figure 10) and mathematics (figure 11) knowledge and skills. For example, children who have fewer risks are more likely than children with more risks to recognize their letters and understand the letter-sound relationship at the beginning and ending of words. A similar pattern is evident in terms of children's ability to understand the mathematical concepts of relative size and ordinality. 13 Information on children's social skills and how they approach learning is provided by their teachers. Consequently, there may be an interaction between the teacher's race/ethnicity and the race/ethnicity of the child that is not accounted for in this analysis. For example, teachers whose race/ethnicity matches that of the children may rate children differently from teachers whose race/ethnicity is different from other children. In the spring, teachers report that kindergartners with fewer risk factors are more likely to often or very often accept peer ideas and form friendships, and less likely to argue with others, fight with others, and get angry easily than children with more risk factors (tables 5 and 6). How children approach learning is also associated with the number of family risk factors. According to their teachers, children with fewer risk factors are more likely to persist at tasks, to seem eager to learn, and to pay attention well than children with more risk factors (table 7). "}, {"section_title": "Methodology and Technical Notes Survey Methodology", "text": "The Sampling for the ECLS-K involved a dual-frame, multistage sampling design. The first stage of sampling involved the selection of 100 primary sampling units (PSU) from a national sample of PSUs. The PSUs were counties and county groups. Public and private schools were then selected within the PSUs, and children were sampled from the selected schools. Public schools were selected from the Common Core of Data, a public school frame, and private schools were selected from a private school frame developed from the Private School Survey. 15 Approximately 23 kindergartners were selected on average in each of the sampled schools. Fall kindergarten data were obtained from September to December 1998. Spring kindergarten data were obtained from March to June 1999."}, {"section_title": "Response Rates", "text": "A total of 944 of the 1,277 originally sampled schools participated during the base year of the study. This translates into a weighted response rate of 74 percent for the base year of the study. The school response rate during the spring of the base year (74.2 percent) was higher than during the fall (69.4 percent), due to some of the schools that originally declined to participate changing their minds and participating in the spring. Nearly all (99.4 percent) of the schools that participated in the fall of the base year also participated in the spring. The child base-year completion rate was 92 percent, i.e., 92 percent of the children were assessed at least once during kindergarten. The parent base-year completion rate was 89 percent (i.e., a parent interview was completed at least once during kindergarten). Thus, the overall base-year response rate for children was 68.1 percent (74 percent x 92 percent) and the base-year response rate for the parent interview was 65.9 percent (74 percent x 89 percent). About 95 percent of the children and 94 percent of the parents who participated in the fall of kindergarten also participated in the spring. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted to determine if substantial bias is introduced due to school nonresponse. Five different approaches were used to examine the possibility of bias in the ECLS-K sample. First, weighted and unweighted response rates for schools, children, parents, teachers, and school administrators were examined to find large response rate differences by characteristics of schools (e.g., urbanicity, region, school size, percent minority, and grade range) and children (e.g., sex, age, race/ethnicity). Second, estimates based on the ECLS-K respondents were compared to estimates based on the full sample. The distributions of schools by school type, urbanicity, region, and the distributions of enrollment by kindergarten type (public versus private), race/ethnicity, urbanicity, region and eligibility for free and reduced-price lunch were compared for the responding schools and all the schools on the sampling frame. Third, estimates from the ECLS-K were compared with estimates from other data sources (e.g., Current Population Survey, National Household Education Survey, Survey of Income and Program Participation). Fourth, estimates using the ECLS-K unadjusted weights were compared with estimates using the ECLS-K weights adjusted for nonresponse. Large differences in the estimates produced with these two different weights would indicate the potential for bias after nonresponse adjustments. Fifth, and last, simulations of nonresponse were conducted. The results of these analyses are summarized in the ECLS-K User's Manual and reported in detail in the ECLS-K Methodology Report. Findings from these analyses suggest that there is not a bias due to school nonresponse."}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "text": "Estimates produced using data from the ECLS-K are subject to two types of error, sampling and nonsampling errors. Nonsampling errors are errors made in the collection and processing of data. Sampling errors occur, because the data are collected from a sample rather than a census of the population. A detailed discussion of these types of errors can be found in America's Kindergartners (West et al. 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Standard Errors and Weights", "text": "In order to produce national estimates from the ECLS-K data collected during the fall and spring of the 1998-99 school year, the sample data were weighted. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities at the school and child levels and adjusts for school, child, teacher, and parent nonresponse. The first stage of the weighting process assigns weights to the sampled primary sampling units (PSUs) equal to the inverse of the PSU probability of selection. 16 The second stage of the weighting process assigns weights to the schools sampled within PSUs. The base weight for each sampled school is the PSU weight multiplied by the inverse of the probability of selecting the school. The base weights for eligible schools are adjusted for nonresponse. These adjustments are made separately for public and private schools. The base weight for each child in the sample is the school nonresponse adjusted weight for the school the child attends, multiplied by a post-stratified within-school student weight (total number of students in the school, divided by the number of students sampled in the school). The child-parent panel weight (BYCOMW0), which is the weight used to produce the estimates found in this report, is the base child weight adjusted for nonresponse to the parent interview at each round of data collection. Only those cases with completed child assessments in both fall and spring of kindergarten are included in these weighting procedures. Again, these adjustments are made separately for public and private schools. In addition to properly weighting the responses, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates were employed, because the data were collected using a complex sample design. Complex sample designs, like that used in the ECLS-K, result in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of the results. Frequently, the standard errors of the estimates are larger than would be expected, if the sample was a simple random sample and the observations were independent and identically distributed random variables. WesVarPC was used in this analysis to calculate standard errors. Replication methods of variance estimation were used to reflect the actual sample design used in the ECLS-K. A form of the jackknife replication method (JK2) using 90 replicates was used to compute approximately unbiased estimates of the standard errors of the estimates in the report. The jackknife methods were used to estimate the precision of the estimates of the reported national percentages and means."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "Comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. For reference, standard errors for tables 2 and 3 are included in the appendix. When comparisons in estimates at one point in time (e.g., fall kindergarten) were made between categorical groups (i.e., gender, race/ethnicity, school type and program type), t statistics were calculated. The formula used to compute the t statistic was: Where Est 1 and Est 2 are the estimates being compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. When comparing the gains of groups of children on the social rating scale items where frequencies are reported (e.g., change in the frequency with which males persist at tasks versus change in the frequency with which females persist at tasks), the following formula was used: When comparisons with continuous or ordinal independent variables were made (i.e., age at entry, mother's education, and the risk index), regression analysis was used. When the analyses involved continuous dependent variables-all of the cognitive scores-linear regression was used; with dichotomous dependent variables-social skills, problem behaviors, and approaches to learning-logistic regression was used."}, {"section_title": "Constructs and Variables Used in Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Children's Cognitive Knowledge and Skills", "text": "The ECLS-K direct child cognitive assessment was administered using a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), administered one-on-one with each child.

The first two pertained to their own educational backgrounds, teaching practices, experiences, and the classroom settings where they taught. For each of the sampled children they taught, the teachers also completed a child-specific questionnaire that collected information on the child's social knowledge and skills. Teachers reported on the frequency with which children demonstrated particular behaviors (e.g., accept peer ideas, fight with others, persist at tasks). Teachers rated the frequency of children's behaviors as never, sometimes, often, or very often. To present the behaviors in terms of their basic frequency (e.g., frequent versus infrequent), the categories were collapsed into never/sometimes and often/very often."}, {"section_title": "Family and Child Characteristics", "text": "Parents/guardians were asked to provide key information about their children on subjects such as family demographics (e.g., age, relation to child, race/ethnicity), family structure (household members and composition), parent involvement, home educational activities, child care experience, child health, parental education and employment status, and child's social skills and behaviors. Most of the data were collected through a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), though some of the interviews were collected through a computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), when respondents did not have a telephone or were reluctant to be interviewed by telephone."}, {"section_title": "Derived Variables", "text": "A number of variables used in this report were derived by combining information from one or more questions in the ECLS-K parent questionnaire or from other study sources. The derivation of key variables is described in this section. Children's age at entry to kindergarten. This variable was constructed using two variables: month and year of birth. These variables were combined to form five categories: children born prior to September 1992 (age 6 when they entered kindergarten), born between September-December 1992 (turning age 6 when they entered kindergarten), January-April 1993 (age 5 when they entered kindergarten), May-August 1993 (age 5 when they entered kindergarten) and September-December 1993 (age 4 when they entered kindergarten). Maternal education. This variable was constructed using the questions on the highest grade the child's mother or female guardian had completed, and whether the mother or female guardian had obtained a high school equivalency degree if she did not complete high school. This information was collapsed into four categories: less than high school, high school or equivalent, some college including vocational/technical training, and bachelor's degree or higher. Children's race/ethnicity. The race/ethnicity composite was constructed from two parentreported variables: ethnicity and race. New Office of Management and Budget guidelines were followed under which a respondent could select more than one race. Thus each respondent had to identify whether the child was Hispanic, and then select one or more races. The following are the five composite race/ethnicity categories we present in this report: white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian and Other (which includes Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and multiracial children). When race/ethnicity differences are presented in this report, white refers to white, non-Hispanic and black refers to black, non-Hispanic. Risk factor index. The risk factor index uses information on the following family characteristics: mother with less than a high school diploma, family utilized AFDC and/or food stamps, single parent family, and primary language other than English (as identified by the respondent in the parent interview). The index is a cumulative count of the individual factors, with each factor counting as 1. The cumulative count was collapsed into: 0, 1, and 2 or more-meaning the presence of none of the risk factors, the presence of one of the risk factors, or the presence of 2 or more of the risk factors. School type. The type of school in which children attended kindergarten was collapsed into two broad categories: public and private. Private schools include those with both religious affiliations and nonreligious affiliations. Information from the school administrator questionnaire, along with school sample frame data, was used to create this variable. If there was no school administrator questionnaire, then school sample frame data were used to create the composite. Kindergarten program type. This report refers to two types of kindergarten programs: full day and part day. This variable was constructed from information provided by teachers on the time(s) of day that they taught kindergarten (e.g., AM only, PM only, AM and PM, all day). Children whose teachers reported teaching AM only, PM only, or both AM and PM classes were classified as part day, and children whose teachers reported teaching all-day kindergarten classes were classified as full day. In cases where the information provided by the teachers was inconsistent (e.g., teachers who reported that they taught AM only classes and all-day classes, information from the field management system that was used by field staff to schedule in-school child assessments) was used to resolve the inconsistency.
