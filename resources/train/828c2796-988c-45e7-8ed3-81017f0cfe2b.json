[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Using the Survey of Doctoral Recipients, the magnitude and consequences of job mismatch are estimated for Ph.D.s in science. Approximately one-sixth of academics and nearly one-half of nonacademics report some degree of mismatch. The influence of job mismatch is estimated for three job outcomes: earnings, job satisfaction and turnover. Surprisingly large and robust influences emerge. Mismatch is associated with substantially lower earnings, lower job satisfaction and a higher rate of turnover. These results persist across a variety of specifications and hold for both academics and nonacademics. Estimates of the determinants of mismatch indicate that older workers and those in rapidly changing disciplines are more likely to be mismatched and there is a suggestion that women are more likely to be mismatched."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "According to assignment theory, the returns to investments in human capital vary dramatically with the quality of the match between the worker and the job (see Sattinger 1993 and Belman and Heywood 1997) . Mismatches between worker skills and job requirements have substantial costs as workers are either unable to fulfill job requirements or have skills that go unused.\nMismatches waste educational resources resulting in dissatisfied workers (Tsang 1987 ) and higher turnover (McGoldrick and Robst 1996) . Lower job satisfaction and higher turnover may reduce formal training and lower labor productivity and so firms' profits (Groot 1993 and Sloane et al. 1996) . Finally, frustration over being mismatched may independently reduce worker effort (Belfield 2000) .\nIn this paper we focus on workers with a Ph.D. in science and examine the predicted consequences of mismatch. First, we examine these workers because they play a key role in innovation and creating technological progress. As a consequence, economists have estimated the determinants of productivity for scientists , the adequacy of their supply , Stephan 1996 , National Science Board 2003 and Teitelbaum 2004 ) and the rewards to their education (Stephan and Everhart 1998) . Second, the homogeneity of this sample allows us to control for variables excluded from typical estimates in examining the consequences of mismatch. Third, managers concerned with maximizing the impact of their research and development staff need to understand the relationship between mismatch, job satisfaction since they influence productivity (Kim and Oh 2002) . Finally, substantial governmental resources are devoted to educating these workers and to improving their diversity.\nYet, concern grows as US university students pursuing advanced degrees in science become less common and as trained scientists increasingly abandon scientific careers (Preston 2004 ).\nWe are the first to use this group of workers to examine the three major consequences that have been identified with mismatch: lower earnings, lower job satisfaction and turnover. The findings are striking. Every measure of mismatch is associated with lower earnings, reduced job satisfaction and greater turnover even after controlling for a wide range of other explanatory variables and even given the relative homogeneity of our sample.\nThree major categories of theoretical conjecture explain why mismatches between workers and jobs persist in equilibrium. First, government subsidization may result in \"over education\" in which the general level of educational attainment exceeds that demanded (Freeman 1976 ).\nSecond, there may be information problems. If productivity is not known or is revealed only over a lengthy period, workers may remain mismatched based on signals that need not reflect their true productivity (Tsang and Levin 1985) . Similarly, search and information costs may be large enough that workers remain mismatched as a cheaper alternative to searching for a new job or to the firm searching for a new employee. Finally, institutional theories of the labor market have long contended that internal labor market considerations force employers to base earnings on easily observable characteristics of the worker and job (Thurow 1975) . Thus, institutional issues within the firm help determine pay and allow mismatches to remain especially when specific human capital investments bind the worker and firm together across a wide range of pay and productivity relationships. These concerns may be particularly prominent in science occupations in which the skill vintage changes rapidly hastening worker mismatch.\nA large empirical literature attempts to measure the consequences of mismatch. While the measure by which workers have \"too much education\" varies (Belfield 2000, p. 35 -37) , Groot and Maasen van den Brink (2000) provide a meta-analysis showing that the over-educated suffer a 14 percent earnings penalty (also see Chevalier 2003, Dolton and Vignoles 200 and Battu et al. 1999 ). Yet mismatch goes beyond over-education. Borghans et al. (2000) shows that workers holding a job unrelated to their field of education suffer significantly diminished earnings. Allen and van der Velden (2001) measure the wage effects of skill mismatches controlling for both educational levels and apparent educational mismatches showing that those with unused skills earn significantly less.\nPsychological theories of expectation suggest that under utilized skills cause diminished job satisfaction. Those with the greatest education and skills have the highest expectations for their jobs and careers and are more easily disappointed (Tsang and Levin 1985 and Clark and Oswald 1996) . Solomon et al. (1981) and Allen and van der Velden (2001) confirm that both under utilized skills and skill deficits are associated with significantly diminished job satisfaction. Belfield and Harris (2002) and Moshavi and Terborg (2003) find that the overeducated suffer diminished job satisfaction. Yet, the evidence remains mixed as Buchel (2002) presents German evidence that over-qualified employees have the same job satisfaction as those properly matched.\nMuch of the original reason for examining subjective job satisfaction is that it influences real economic variables including quit rates, shirking and absenteeism (Freeman 1978, Clark and Oswald 1996) . Thus, mismatched workers that have lower job satisfaction will be more likely to search for a new job. Moreover, reduced productivity associated with mismatch may encourage employers to seek alternative workers. The consequence is that the turnover rate among the mismatched should be higher (Wobers 2003 and Allen and van der Velden 2001) .\nUnlike the literature reviewed above, we go beyond simply identifying the consequences of mismatch to ask which reasons for being mismatched have the greatest consequences. We find that those mismatched because of the lack of jobs or family considerations suffer very large reductions in wages and job satisfaction. Women who are mismatched because of family considerations have particularly large reductions in earnings.\nWe also estimate the causes of mismatch. The estimations suggest that the vintage of scientific skills is a critical determinant. In general, scientists are more likely to be mismatched, and the penalty for mismatch grows when they are older. There is evidence of the traditional movement from the lab to management for workers in rapidly changing disciplines and the suggestion that women are more likely to be mismatched all else equal."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methodology", "text": "We draw our primary data from the 1997 and 1999 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) conducted by the National Opinion Research Center for the National Science Foundation. The SDR is a nationally representative sample of all Ph.D. graduates in the hard and social sciences prior to 1997 living in the US. Collected in response to the National Research Council's demand for data that allows the integration of occupational detail and academic training, the SDR is conducted every other year. The 1997 SDR is the most recent wave asking questions about overall job satisfaction. It is also the only wave asking what we identify as the secondary mismatch indicators. We selected all currently employed scientists for which full information was available yielding a sample of 31,845. 1 1 While much of the data from the SDR are publicly available, we add variables from the restricted use version. These variables include annual earnings, detailed job codes, race/ethnicity, age and marital status. See the SDR website at 'http://sestat.nsf.gov/' for details on both versions of the SDR data.\nThe primary indicator of mismatch comes from responses to the question: \"Thinking about the relationship between your work and your education, to what extent is your work related to your doctoral degree?\" The possible responses are \"closely related,\" \"somewhat related\" and \"not related.\" Those scientists working in jobs not related to their education are presumably using less of the knowledge, training and skills learned in that education. In this critical sense they may be identified as mismatched. As Table 1 The other secondary question asks, \"If you had the chance to do it over again, knowing what you do now, how likely is it that you would choose the same field of study for your highest degree?\" The answers are \"very likely,\" \"somewhat likely\" and \"not likely at all.\" While this question might simply be seen as identifying those who feel they made a bad career choice, it seems reasonable that those who are mismatched would especially regret their choice of field.\nConsistent with evidence that scientists leave their careers in large numbers (Preston 2004) , only slightly more than half of the sample report being very likely to repeat their study for their highest degree. In sum, these three questions reflect slightly different aspects of the relationship between education and the workers' current positions. Despite these differences, the three measures appear highly correlated as we will show shortly. Table 2 Using these measures, we investigate the effect of mismatch on earnings, job satisfaction and job change. The earnings measure is annual earnings in 1997 including all wages, salaries, bonuses, overtime, commissions, consulting fees and net income from business and has an average of over $70,000. The critical question on job satisfaction asks \"How would you rate your overall satisfaction with your principal job during the week of April 15 th ?\" The choices are \"very dissatisfied,\" \"somewhat dissatisfied,\" \"somewhat satisfied,\" and \"very satisfied.\" These responses are ordered values from 1 to 4 with an average of 3.4. Job change information comes from the 1999 survey which asks workers to identify one of the following: 1) their current job is different than that held in the 1997 survey but with the same employer; 2) their current job is different than that they held in the 1997 but with a different employer; 3) they hold the same job and employer as in 1997 or 4) they hold the same job with a different employer. We view positive answers to either of the first two options as evidence of a job change. A relatively large share of sample, 18.3 percent, changed jobs within the two years. We also use only those who changed employers and jobs as true job changes, and this does not alter the basic results.\nThe bottom portion of Table 1 indicates the rich set of demographic and job dimension variables that we use as controls in an effort to isolate the influence of the indicators of mismatch. These include race, gender, age, marital status, regional variables, a very large vector of job dimensions that might influence earnings, job satisfaction and turnover as well as detailed discipline indicators (see Bender and Heywood 2006 for a detailed list of these indicators). Table 3 collects the primary mismatch indicator, earnings, job satisfaction and turnover.\nThe data is presented separately for each discipline and divided between those holding academic and nonacademic jobs. Academics in general are much less likely to report any degree of mismatch (this is true across all three mismatch indicators). Academic economists report the lowest share of any degree mismatch at only 2.2 percent. Those working in computer science report a very high degree of mismatch with two-thirds reporting a degree of mismatch. This may reflect a vintage effect in which the discipline changes very quickly heightening the gap between skills learned in school and those needed on the job. Such a possibility emphasizes the need to control for the age of the worker. The single highest degree of mismatch is among those nonacademics working in \"other disciplines.\" This follows, in part, from construction. This category includes disciplines other than those in the sciences. Thus, workers in this category are necessarily working in disciplines other than that in which they were trained.\nIn terms of the outcome variables, those groups with better matches on average also have higher job satisfaction and lower job change. For example, academics, who say that they are better matched on average, report modestly higher job satisfaction and have much lower turnover. On the other hand, although more highly matched, academics earn less than nonacademics in every discipline. Further investigation, simultaneously controlling for other determinants of earnings, is warranted to see if this correlation holds. Table 4 presents typical log linear earnings equations revealing a number of anticipated results."}, {"section_title": "Consequences of Mismatch", "text": "In both the academic and nonacademic sectors women and blacks earn less, all else equal.\nSupervisors, those married, receiving pensions and working full time each earn more. Those working in the government earn less than those working in the private nonacademic sector. Age shows the standard concave pattern with earnings. Thus, for the academics in the sample, the age coefficients do not reflect Ransom's (1993) finding that higher seniority for university professors is associated with lower salaries, all else equal.\nThe results indicate that among academics those who view their primary activity as teaching earn less and that only those in management science earn more than the excluded group, economists. Although not reported, those in hard science earn more than 20 percent less than economists with the gap larger in percentage terms in the nonacademic sector than in the academic sector.\nImportantly, a large decrement in earnings is associated with the critical mismatch variables.\nIf academic workers report that their education only relates somewhat, their earnings are 6.9 percent lower holding all else equal.\n2 The comparable earnings penalty for nonacademic workers is 4.7 percent. If academic workers report that their education does not relate, their earnings are 13.8 percent lower. The comparable earnings penalty for nonacademic workers is 9.8 percent. The greater penalty in academia may reflect a greater importance of appropriate educational credentials or it may be that academic jobs not in a worker's Ph.D. field reflect a greater degree of mismatch than is true for nonacademic jobs. Recalling that at least one consensus estimate of the penalty associated with over-education was 14 percent, we are estimating a mismatch penalty of roughly the same size. This is surprising as those estimates were taken to measure the influence of having an unnecessary degree. While that may be true for some of our mismatched workers, it need not be. Workers need only report that they are working in an area (a subject matter) outside their degree.\nJob satisfaction measures force workers to consider elements of the job in addition to earnings. These elements include fringe benefits, interactions with coworkers, the value of the work itself, relations with supervisors, hours and intrinsic rewards to name only a few. As\nHamermesh (2000) argues, job satisfaction measures, at their best, hope to capture the sum of utility derived from all aspects of the job.\nAs the job satisfaction measure is an ordered response, the estimation follows a cumulative normal in an ordered probit. The results in Table 4 confirm some expectations from past work on job satisfaction but present a few surprises. Women do not emerge as the \"contented workers\" that estimations on general populations often report (Clark 1997 (2000) find that satisfaction with salary decreases with age for male academics.\nThe mismatch variables are associated with substantially lower job satisfaction. For both academics and nonacademics, working in jobs not related to their education is associated with a highly significant and large reduction in overall job satisfaction. The magnitude of this influence is understood by making projections. If we assume all variables are held at their mean levels except the mismatch variables, we can use the cut points and project the probability of being in each satisfaction level. As an illustration, if we assume that academic workers have the mean characteristics and are in jobs closely related to their education, they have a 0.655 probability of reporting the highest level of satisfaction, very satisfied. If they hold jobs only somewhat related to their education, the probability of reporting being very satisfied drops to 0.543. Finally, if they hold a job not at all related to their education, the probability of reporting being very satisfied is only 0.428. A complete set of projections is available from the authors, but it is apparent that the marginal influence of mismatch on job satisfaction is very large.\nAs discussed, one advantage of the SDR is the ability to follow the workers two years after the 1997 survey to determine whether or not they have changed their job. This measure of turnover is a dichotomous measure and becomes the dependent variable in probit specifications as shown in the last two columns of Table 4 . These estimations repeat some familiar patterns.\nThose who are supervisors and have fringe benefits are less likely to have changed jobs with the latter perhaps reflecting deferred compensation that binds workers to employers. 4 Job change becomes more likely with age but eventually turns around and becomes less likely late in life.\nThis is the inverse of the statistical pattern between age and job satisfaction reinforcing previous research that job satisfaction is inversely related to changing jobs. Black workers appear no more likely to change jobs than do white workers while those in large firms are more likely to change jobs.\nThe critical mismatch variables reveal that those working positions not related to their education have a higher probability of turnover than those in positions closely related to their education: 9.0 percentage points higher for academics and 6.2 percentage points higher for nonacademics. Given that the average turnover rate across the two subsamples is slightly above 18 percent, these are very large marginal effects. Again, there is a more muted effect for a worker being in a field only somewhat related to their education. Among academics, these workers are 4.5 percentage points more likely to change jobs and among nonacademics, these workers are 4.2 percentage points more likely to change jobs. The marginal effects for both of these degrees of mismatch are statistically significant for each subsample. Our examination of the consequences of mismatch presents a consistent picture. Using this primary indicator of mismatch, we find routine and robust partial correlations. Mismatch remains associated with lower wages, lower job satisfaction and an increase probability of changing jobs."}, {"section_title": "Other Indicators of Mismatch", "text": "The other survey measures related to mismatch present a similar, if slightly less dramatic, picture. Our estimates of the earnings equations used precisely the same set of controls as reported in Table 4 but merely replaced the mismatch variables with their alternatives. As the first panel in Table 5 shows in specification 2, academics who find their work not very similar to their expectations at the time of degree completion have 9.2 percent lower earnings while nonacademics who find their work not very similar to their expectations have 6.4 percent lower earnings. Academics who report that they would not be very likely to repeat their Ph.D. degree in the same field have 9.5 percent lower earnings while those nonacademics who report the same thing have 8.7 percent lower earnings when compared to those very likely to repeat their degree.\nAll of the coefficients from which these percentage measures are statistically significant at the five percent level and serve to further confirm the suggestion that mismatch among the highly educated is associated with reduced earnings.\nThe results on job satisfaction are more dramatic with substantially larger declines than those associated with the original mismatch indicator. Academics whose work is not very similar to their expectations have a 30.4 percentage point reduction in the probability of being in the highest satisfaction category compared to those whose work is similar to their expectations (this is now a marginal effect). Nonacademics whose work is not very similar to their expectations have a 28.2 percentage point reduction in the probability of being in the highest satisfaction category. Those academics not very likely to repeat their degree have a 40.5 percentage point reduction in the probability of being in the highest satisfaction category and those nonacademics whose work is not similar to expectations have a 30.8 percentage point reduction in the same probability. While these secondary measures may simply be alternative satisfaction measures, it remains possible that they capture important elements of mismatch as each directs the respondent to compare their work to an aspect of their education. To the extent this is correct, the results serve to confirm those presented with the original indicator.\nThe two secondary measures of mismatch also reinforce the results on job turnover. Those academics whose expectations are not very similar are 7.4 percentage points more likely to change jobs and those nonacademics whose expectations are not very similar are 10.9 percentage points more likely to change jobs. Academics who would not be likely to repeat their graduate education are 5.8 percentage points more likely to change jobs and nonacademics who are not very likely to repeat their graduate education are 6.9 percentage points more likely to change jobs compared to those who are very likely to repeat their graduate education. Thus, the secondary measures show a somewhat different pattern on job change that suggests that mismatch is more likely to result in job change for nonacademics than for academics.\nNonetheless, the general patterns are similar across all three measures and across all three consequences. All of the coefficients for both levels of mismatch are statistically significant at the one percent level."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Reasons for Mismatch", "text": "In this section we expand the dimensions of mismatch including in the analysis the reasons that workers see themselves as mismatched. The SDR asks each respondent who identifies themselves as in a job that does not at all relate to their education what is the most important reason why they have taken such a job. The reasons (with percentages giving that reason in parentheses) include: better pay and promotion opportunities (20.3%), better working conditions (4.2%), the job's location (4.7%), family-related reasons (5.8%), a job is not available in their doctoral field (24.5%), a change in career/professional interests (28.6%) or other (11.9%). The vast majority of workers cite one of three responses: better pay and promotion, the lack of jobs or changed interests. We transform these into a series of dummy variables to replace the previous general measure of job and education not at all related. Table 6 The difference by gender is also highlighted in Table 6 . The extremes are more pronounced in the female sample. The gain associated with being mismatched because of a desire for better pay and promotion shows women earning 22.6 percent more. At the same time, the loss associated with being mismatched because of family reasons is a staggering 55.9 percent.\nWomen who cite their family as a reason for their job and education not being related are earning less than half what would otherwise be the case.\nThe augmented job satisfaction estimates reveal that mismatch is never associated with greater job satisfaction even when it is associated with greater pay or promotion opportunities.\nAll of the coefficients in the right hand side of Table 6 are negative including that on pay and promotion opportunities. This pattern suggests that those who leave their doctoral discipline behind in order to earn more are not pleased with the decision. The need to meet budget expenses or provide a better standard of living for one's family may come at the cost of working in an area the scientist would rather pursue. Indeed, Preston (2004) highlights just this kind of tradeoff in exploring those scientists who choose to work outside of science. While it need not be the case that all of those mismatched in our sample have left science, working outside one's education in order to earn more comes with reduced job satisfaction. When looking within genders, it is clear that even for women who reported a more than 20 percent increase in earnings associated with working outside their educational field in order to improve pay and promotion opportunities, the move brought no improvement in job satisfaction. More generally, to the extent that job satisfaction can be taken as an indicator of utility, the fact that mismatch is never associated with increased utility (even when associated with increased income) further illustrates its high social costs. "}, {"section_title": "Using the Panel Data", "text": "One of the important aspects of the SDR is its longitudinal design. While not all variables are available in all years, we undertake a series of panel estimates to confirm the largely crosssectional results of the previous sections. In particular, we are concerned that workers who are less productive will naturally earn less and, perhaps, be less satisfied and subject to greater\nturnover. Yet, the fact that they are less productive also makes such workers more likely to be mismatched. To the extent that our controls in the cross sectional analysis above do not capture differences in productivity, the associations we have shown run the risk of merely reflecting fixed worker effects rather than the true influence of an exogenous mismatch.\nIn order to examine this issue, we use five waves of the public use SDR sample for 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2001 . As mentioned, job satisfaction is only available in 1997 and the finest breakdown by discipline is unavailable in the public use data. An additional limitation of the public use data is that annual earnings are rounded to the nearest thousand and top-coded at $150,000. Recognizing these limitations, we use the public use data to estimate an earnings equation across these five waves (in 2001 dollars). Accounting for individual fixed effects, the unbalanced panel estimation examines the role of mismatch on earnings. The variables that are constant across waves such as race and gender drop out of the estimation, while the coefficients on the mismatch variables reflect the consequences of individual workers changing in the degree of mismatch. However, these coefficients should be purged of the role of individual effects such as lower productivity that might simultaneously generate both mismatch and lower earnings. half the size, on average, as that estimated in the cross-section. We are quick to emphasize that this should be taken with care as the specification and construction of the variables differ between the two sets of estimations. Nonetheless, the fixed effect estimates emerge as smaller but still routinely negative and statistically significant.\nIn addition to controlling for fixed effects, the panel data can help inform the extent to which mismatch reflects temporary disequilibrium. Rubb (2003) has estimated that less than one in five overeducated worker moves to being matched within one year. Beginning with the group of workers that are in jobs either not related or only somewhat related to their education in 1997, only 25.7 percent reported closely related jobs in 1999 and only slightly more, 27.0 percent, reported closely related jobs four years later in 2001. Thus, the vast majority of those mismatched in the core year of our study remain so four years later suggesting that mismatch and its consequences are persistent."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Age on the Penalty for Mismatch", "text": "The complementarity between education and the experience gained working in the field of one's education may generate a quality and quantity of human capital not generated for those who are mismatched. As this process of accumulating human capital and receiving a return on that investment takes time, it seems sensible that the penalty to being mismatched may be small in the early years of a career but grow larger in the later years of a career. To test this hypothesis 7 The base group of workers in 1997 differs between these two years because of attrition that is substantial in the SDR. We did examine the determinants of those who dropped out between 1997 and 1999 finding that mismatch itself is not a significant determinant.\nwe added interactions between the mismatch indicators, how closely one's education and job relate, and the age and age squared variables. These interactions were added to the earnings specification.\nThe results provide broad confirmation that the penalty associated with mismatch is larger for older workers. The upper left panel of Figure 1 shows the predicted log earnings from a cross-sectional estimate for a hypothetical female worker with mean female characteristics as she ages. The upper right panel shows the same cross-sectional estimate for a hypothetical male worker with mean male characteristics. The pattern generally shows the lower earnings for those in jobs that only somewhat related and the still lower earnings of those in jobs that do not relate at all. As anticipated, the size of the penalty associated with mismatch for older workers typically exceeds that for younger workers. Men face a small penalty early in their careers for being mismatched, but it grows dramatically. At age 62 the penalty for being in a job that does not relate at all is $15,498 (20.9 percent) compared with only $725 (1.8 percent) at age 28.\nWomen appear to face a penalty that starts larger, grows quickly in the early years, leveling off and actually shrinking slightly very late in their careers. Thus, at age 62 the penalty for being in a job that does not relate at all is $5,411 (10.4 percent) compared with a large $2,912 (8.6 percent) at age 28.\nOn the other hand, it might be argued that these cross-sectional estimates identify differences across cohorts but give no guide as to what happens when a single cohort ages. The lower panels of Figure 1 repeat the unbalanced panel wage estimations with the age-mismatch interactions for the five waves taken from the public use sample. The coefficients on the interactions with age come from the actual aging of workers as fixed effects hold worker specific determinants constant. The pattern identified in the cross-sectional estimates is at least as evident in the fixed effect panel estimates. The size of penalty grows as workers age. While the dollar values of the penalties are smaller in the panel estimates, the tendency for the penalty to shrink slightly late in the work life of women is absent. The estimations make clear that more than simple cohort effects are reflected in the tendency for the mismatch penalty to grow as workers age."}, {"section_title": "Determinants of Mismatch", "text": "In an attempt to describe the mismatched we return to our broad mismatch measures and estimate their determinants. For each of these variables, we use the broad controls examined to date as potential determinants.

In general, the results suggest that mismatch is likely to result from a dating of scientific skills.\nThe first column of Table 8 in the former fields than in the latter fields. Another way of putting this is that the speed of change in the former fields is much slower than in the latter fields making mismatch less likely."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper has examined the consequences of job mismatch among the most highly educated workers in the economy. These workers of the knowledge economy are often thought to be critical for technological progress and growth. Understanding the consequences of mismatch is important when considering governmental policies toward scientific education including issues of subsidizing students, supporting universities and encouraging technology transfer.\nThe evidence assembled here uses three related measures of mismatch from the Survey of Doctoral Recipients and estimates their influence on three job outcomes: earnings, job satisfaction and turnover. Mismatch is associated with worse outcomes: lower wages, lower job satisfaction and higher turnover. This persists across substantial variations in estimation and holds for academics and nonacademics and for men and women. The size of the influences was surprisingly large with double digit percentage earnings reductions in earnings, being 20\npercentage points less likely to report high job satisfaction and a 1/3 increase in the turnover rate.\nThe fixed effect panel estimates suggest a statistically significant earnings penalty of about half the size estimated in the cross-section.\nWhile this paper has not tried to estimate rates of return (either public or private) on scientific education, one cannot help but be concerned about the implications of these findings. The primary mismatch variable indicates one in six academics report a degree of mismatch and nearly one in two nonacademics report a degree of mismatch. Given the large share of mismatched workers and the apparently severe consequences of mismatch a thorough review of policy options would seem in order.\nOur attempts to estimate the determinants of mismatch suggest that there may be substantial vintage effects at work as the fields in which the knowledge base changes most quickly appear to be associated with a greater chance of being mismatched. Also, there appears to be confirmation of the typical pattern of moving from the first line of science research into more administrative positions as scientists age. Moreover, the influences of the reasons for mismatch are particularly interesting. Those who are mismatched in an attempt to earn more, do earn more but remain less satisfied. This is intriguing and suggests greater inquiry into exactly what these individual do and whether they regret the decision to remain matched. If they do, it might be worth considering the options for recreating matches. The number under the coefficient estimates are t-statistics.
