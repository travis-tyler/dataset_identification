[{"section_title": "", "text": "Given the past history and future risk of storm surge in the United States, alternative storm protection techniques are needed to protect vital sectors of the economy and population, particularly within southeastern Louisiana. It is widely hypothesized that coastal wetlands offer protection from storm surge and wave action, though the extent of this protection is unknown due to the complex physics behind vegetated flow dynamics. This thesis presents numerical modeling results that estimate the relative sensitivity of waves and storm surge to characteristics embodied by coastal wetlands. An idealized grid domain and 400 km 2 (20 km by 20 km) marsh feature provide a controlled environment for evaluating marsh characteristics, including bottom friction, elevation, and continuity. Marsh continuity is defined as the ratio of healthy marsh area to open water area within the total wetland area. It is determined that increased bottom friction reduces storm surge levels and wave heights. Through the roughening of the bottom from sandy to covered with tall grass, it is estimated that waves may be dampened by up to 1.2 m at the coast, and peak surge may be reduced by as much as 35%. The lowering of marsh elevation generally increases wave heights and decreases surge levels, as expected. A 3.5 m decrease in marsh elevation results in as much as a 2.6 m increase in wave height, and up to a 15% decrease in surge levels. Reductions in marsh continuity enhance surge conveyance into and out of the marsh. For storms of low surge potential, surge is increased by as much as 70% at the coast due to decreasing marsh continuity from 100% to 50%, while for storms of high surge potential, surge is decreased by 5%. This indicates that for storms of high surge potential, a segmented marsh may offer comparable surge protection to that of a continuous marsh. Wave heights are generally increased within the marsh due to the transmission of wave energy through marsh channels. Results presented in this thesis may assist in the justification of coastal wetland mitigation, and optimize marsh restoration in terms of providing maximum storm protection.

The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 was responsible for an estimated 8,000 fatalities, primarily as a result of storm surge (Potter, 2004). Eight hurricanes and one tropical storm are listed in the ten most costly (in terms of federal aid) forms of natural disaster to strike the US since the establishment of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in 1979(FEMA, 2008. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly and third most deadly hurricane in US history, resulting in over 1800 deaths (Knabb et al., 2005) and over $80 billion in damages along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Otten et al., 2006). The principal mechanisms of hazard associated with hurricanes are wind, storm surge, and extreme rainfall. Storm surge has historically been a principle danger to life and property associated with hurricanes (US NOAA, 2008). Ninety percent of hurricanerelated deaths were caused by storm surge prior to 1970 (Otten et al., 2006). Despite technological advances in early warning and forecast systems, storm surge continues to be a major player in the arsenal of hurricane-related hazards. The vast majority of fatalities incurred by Hurricane Katrina were a direct result of storm surge. Regardless of improvements in forecasting and communication, storm surge poses an unyielding ____________ This thesis follows the style of the Journal of Geophysical Research. threat to industry and infrastructure. Flooding due to storm surge significantly impacted the tourism industry in New Orleans in the months after Hurricane Katrina, resulting in lost jobs and severely diminished tax revenues. Across the United States, the oil and gas industry was impacted by Hurricane Katrina, as storm surge waters damaged numerous oil refineries along the coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama (Knabb et al., 2005). Coastal areas of the United States particularly prone to hurricane storm surge are located along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. A mildly sloping continental shelf elevates the risk due to storm surge. Approaching hurricanes tend to raise water levels through decreased atmospheric pressure and powerful sustained winds. The magnitude of surge is inversely related to local water depth, via the momentum balance. For this reason, storm surge levels along the coast are dependent upon the characteristics of local bathymetry, with areas of steeply sloping bathymetry less prone to surge than areas of mildly sloping bathymetry."}, {"section_title": "Potential Benefit of Wetlands for Surge and Wave Energy Reduction", "text": "From a coastal engineering perspective, little can be done to completely eliminate storm surge as a coastal hazard. Recent history has proven that despite even the most complex system of levees and hydraulic structures, storm surge will relentlessly sustain damage upon coastal properties. With 43% of the US population living in coastal areas (Martinez et al., 2007), it is worthwhile to investigate alternative methods to accompany hard structures as a form of storm surge protection. Coastal wetlands, referred to by some as \"horizontal levees\" (Houck, 2006), may be a promising form of hazard mitigation to alleviate storm surge levels placed on coastal structures. Other sources state that while wetlands may slow the propagation of surge to an inland area, their relative efficiency at reducing storm surge levels is dependent upon the characteristics of the incident storm (Resio and Westerink, 2008). It is of general belief that coastal wetlands have the ability to reduce storm damage through wave dissipation and increased drag due to vegetation. While there exists a moderate body of literature regarding the reduction of hurricane wave heights due to vegetation, there is a comparatively limited number of publications regarding the ability of a coastal wetland to reduce storm surge propagation on a large-scale. Due to global sea level rise, erosion, land subsidence, and human activities, coastal wetlands have become increasingly exploited. A 33 mm decrease in marsh elevation was observed as a result of the compression forces induced by storm surge waters from Hurricane Andrew on certain salt marshes in Louisiana (Cahoon et al., 2006). Within Louisiana, an estimated 64 km 2 of wetlands is lost each year, a rate that will expose key hurricane protection levees and oil industry infrastructure to open-water conditions by the year 2050 (Otten, 2006). In order to evaluate coastal wetlands in terms of storm protection, this thesis presents the use of numerical modeling to estimate the storm surge reduction capabilities associated with characteristic qualities of coastal marsh."}, {"section_title": "Thesis Content", "text": "This thesis is comprised of five sections.

Green (2005) categorizes vegetative resistance into 1) energy loss at the bottom of the water column due to bottom friction and 2) drag throughout the water column. Drag is dominant in the case of vegetative flow, as the velocities within a vegetated canopy are greatly reduced and flow tends to be diverted around areas of dense growth (Green, 2005). Peterson et al. (2004) found through laboratory measurements that the velocities within a vegetative canopy are inversely proportional the square root of vegetation density. Danard and Murty (1994) considered the flow regime to be dependent upon plant height and depth of flow. Despite these findings that vegetated flow is a three-dimensional problem, impacts of vegetation on flow are often limited to the use of a bottom friction term, as the case in this research study. To provide a basis for investigating coastal wetlands with respect to storm protection, coastal wetlands, storm surge, and gravity water waves are examined in this  where h is total depth, and u is the depth-averaged horizontal velocity. Taking into account the forces associated with storm surge, two-dimensional depth-averaged conservation of momentum is dictated by: where g is gravitational acceleration, P is atmospheric pressure, w  Factors dominating the displacement of the free-surface may therefore be identified as wind stress, atmospheric pressure gradient, Coriolis force, bottom stress, and momentum dispersion. The dominant factor governing the setup of water levels in hurricane conditions is the forcing imparted by wind, or wind stress. Wind stress is a function of air density, wind speed, and a surface friction coefficient, and is empirically defined as where C f is a dimensionless friction coefficient, and W is wind speed at the water surface (Dean and Dalyrmple, 2002). As wind speed is increased, the water surface forms an upward slope in the direction of the wind. This results in a greater hydrostatic force along the downwind side of the water column than the upwind side, resulting in a return flow at the bottom. Governed in part by bottom friction, the return flow is reduced, resulting in a buildup of water along the downwind side of the water column. Hurricanes and extratropical storms tend to be characterized by a sharp barometric pressure gradient. This gradient, when imposed on a large body of water, may induce a setup of water focused in areas of extreme low atmospheric pressure. This mechanism is a secondary component of storm surge. Typically, barometric setup is on the scale of less than a meter, considerably less than the setup induced by wind stress. The barometric pressure component of storm surge may be estimated by where \u03b6 B is the setup due to barometric pressure gradient, \u0394p is the pressure deficit, and \u03b3 is the specific weight of water. In short, the setup due to barometric pressure gradient may be estimated by where \u03b6 B is measured in centimeters, and \u0394p is measured in millibars (Dean and Dalyrmple, 2002). A more subtle component affecting the total storm surge setup is the Coriolis setup. Longshore currents are induced by cyclonic winds traversing about a low pressure system in a counterclockwise fashion. As currents flow over long distances in the Northern hemisphere, the Coriolis acceleration will result in a right-hand deflection. At the onset of the storm, as currents traverse along the shoreline with land situated to the right, a coastal setup of water will be observed as these currents are deflected landward due to Coriolis acceleration. This component of storm surge may similarly decrease shoreward water levels when currents are flowing in the opposite direction, after a storm makes landfall.\nThis thesis presents findings derived purely from numerical model results. The principle models applied in this study (ADCIRC and STWAVE) are described herein, along with the techniques used to couple both models to integrate storm surge levels with wave energy, and vice versa. ADCIRC is a hydrodynamic model describing coastal circulation and storm surge, solving the momentum balance and conservation of mass equations on a finite-element grid, while STWAVE is a model capable of describing the nearshore transformations of gravity water waves. Section 3.2 describes this coupled execution of ADCIRC and STWAVE. To obtain the wind and pressure fields required by ADCIRC and STWAVE, two models were used (WAM and PBL), as briefly described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. The ADCIRC and STWAVE models are described in Sections 3.5 and 3.6, respectively. With the framework of the numerical modeling methodology described, Sections 3.8 through 3.10 detail the specifics on how wetland parameters are investigated in terms of wave and surge sensitivity. Section 3.11 provides an overview of the meteorological characteristics of the storms simulated in this study.\nPresented in this section are the ADCIRC and STWAVE numerical model results investigating wave and surge sensitivity of bottom friction, elevation, and continuity of an idealized 20 km by 20 km wetland feature. Each section begins with a discussion on wave impacts, followed by analysis of surge impacts. Changes in wave height are described in terms of changes in meters, while surge sensitivity is referenced in terms of percent difference. Percent differences are advantageous as they provide insight into the sensitivity of storm surge levels relative to the total surge. When applied to wave height sensitivity, percent differences proved to be cumbersome, with some percent changes on the order of thousands of percent. Therefore, changes in wave heights are referenced as numerical changes throughout this section."}, {"section_title": "Governing Equations for Waves", "text": "Assuming a fluid of constant density, a derivation of the governing equations of linear water waves begins with the continuity equation, as shown in Equation 2.1. Assuming a linear wave, the water surface position (\u03b6 ) is dependent upon wave height (H), angular frequency (\u03c9 ), wave number (k) and time (t): Kinetic wave energy per unit width along a wave crest (E) is given: The energy balance for waves is given (Svendsen, 2006): where c is wave celerity, B is a dimensionless energy parameter, D is a dimensionless energy dissipation parameter, and L is wavelength.

For linear waves in shallow water, radiation stress may be defined as  where \u03ba is the breaking index. Wave setup is accompanied by wave setdown in areas seaward of wave breaking, as the slope of the water surface counteracts the energy flux due to wave dissipation."}, {"section_title": "Modeling Storm Surge", "text": "Several numerical models have been constructed for the forecast and risk assessment of hurricane storm surge. In the 1980's, the US National Weather Service (NWS) developed the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricane (SLOSH) model for the purpose of forecasting hurricane storm surge in advance of approaching tropical storms (Zhang et al., 2008;Jelesnianski et al., 1992). While forecasting for emergency response in the U.S. is primarily done by the SLOSH model, numerous other hydrodynamic models exist for the local risk analysis of hurricane storm surge. Among model. These models generally provide a higher spatial resolution and include more of the relevant physics than previous models. ADCIRC is currently utilized by the US Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA in the analysis of hurricane storm surge risk and analysis of proposed storm protection plans across the nation. In this form of analysis, the ADCIRC model is implemented as a two-dimensional, depth-integrated hydrodynamic model that solves the momentum and mass conservation equations in spherical coordinates (latitude/longitude). The model may be forced by wind and pressure fields, tidal constituents, wave radiation stress (as output from a wave model), and user-specified boundary conditions (such as river inputs and overtopping levees). A spatially detailed grid is utilized by USACE in the assessment of hurricane surge for risk analysis. Validation studies indicate that in the hindcasting of Hurricanes Betsy (1965) and Andrew (1992), the ADCIRC model is capable of computing peak surge elevations to a mean error of +/-0.3 m (Westerink et al., 2008). The ADCIRC model is also utilized at the state level. For example, the State of North Carolina forecasts hurricane storm surge levels for the purpose of emergency management, evacuation planning, and resource deployment using ADCIRC (Mattocks and Forbes, 2008). As implemented in the North Carolina Forecast System (NCFS), peak water elevation results from the ADCIRC model were compared with NOAA tidal stations. This analysis indicated that ADCIRC was able to hindcast peak water levels to an accuracy of between -4% and -16% (Mattocks and Forbes, 2008). In low-resolution areas of the finite-element grid mesh, greater fractional errors were indicated (Mattocks and Forbes, 2008). A key advantage of the ADCIRC model is the ability to couple storm surge computations with breaking wave radiation stress forcing calculated through a numerical wave model such as SWAN (Holthuijsen et al., 1993;Ris, 1997) or STWAVE (Smith et al., 2001). The accuracy of coupled ADCIRC and STWAVE simulations was investigated in a validation study using observed water levels during Hurricane Katrina (Ebersole et al., 2007). In this study, peak water levels were computed within 0.3 to 0.5 m absolute errors (Ebersole et al., 2007).  where u is the average flow velocity, n is the Manning's roughness coefficient, R h is hydraulic radius, and S 0 is the water surface slope. Flow within a pipe is frequently described by the Darcy-Weisbach equation: where f is a dimensionless friction factor. While both the Manning and Darcy-Weisbach describe open channel flow than the Darcy-Weisbach equation (Akan, 2006). In deriving a friction factor to relate vegetation to wave dissipation, Augustin et al. (in press) approximated the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor to be equivalent to a bulk drag where C D is the drag coefficient for individual stems, l s is the stem length, d is the stem diameter, and s is the spacing between stems.  Inclusion of vegetative drag in storm surge and wave modeling presents challenges that are currently addressed through simplifications and assumptions absorbed in the bottom stress term. Many studies develop an artificially high Manning friction coefficient (n) to take into account both bottom friction and vegetative drag (Thomas and Nisbet, 2007). Two-dimensional surge models also approximate frictional effects arising from submerged vegetation into a single parameter, such as Manning's n, Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient, or a quadratic friction coefficient. Some models, including the ADCIRC finite-element model, allow for the implementation of a depth-dependent friction coefficient (Luettich and Westerink, 1999). Nevertheless, the actual physics of vegetated fluid flow are substantially approximated within storm surge models. While improvements are being made to implement a more detailed representation of vegetation in numerical storm surge models, bottom friction tends be a tuning factor in model calibration. In fact, bottom friction, wind reduction at the surface, and eddy viscosity are all factors that are modified to calibrate the SLOSH model according to observational records (Zhang et al., 2008). Though not specifically addressed in this study, vegetation associated with coastal wetlands also has an effect on wind velocities at the surface. Reid and Whitaker (1976) considered the wind stress ( s \u03c4 ) at the water surface to be altered by a sheltering coefficient, S:"}, {"section_title": "Attenuation of Storm Surge and Waves through Coastal Wetlands", "text": "where a \u03c1 is air density, K is a non-dimensional surface drag coefficient, and W is the standard anemometer-height (10 m) wind velocity. Reid and Whitaker established the sheltering coefficient (S) to be dependent on non-dimensional drag coefficients, number of vegetation elements per horizontal area, width of canopy elements, and exposed height of the canopy. Water surface profiles were computed for wind driven flow in a channel as measured in laboratory experiments by Tickner (1957), which proved to predict the measurements taken by Tickner with considerable accuracy. With a calibrated model for wind-driven flow through emergent vegetation, simulations were carried out to investigate the effects of a vegetative canopy within an enclosed basin. The basin consisted of a 3700 m by 6500 m area of 1.2 m depth. Half of the basin area was covered in vegetation, having an elemental width of 6.3 mm and a density of 6190 elements per square meter. Non-dimensional drag coefficients were adopted from the calibrated model that successfully predicted Tickner's (1957)   In addition to wind and water velocity reduction, coastal wetlands have the potential to significantly reduce wave heights. Dean (1978) suggested that a dense area of vegetation would have a damping effect on wave height, and Dalyrmple, et al. (1984) offer a method for calculating wave dissipation based on fixed cylinders. Laboratory measurements obtained by Asano et al. (1988) depict wave heights decreasing by as much as 40% due to artificial seaweed constructed from polypropylene strips (25 cm in length, 5.2 cm wide, and .03 mm thick). Asano et al. (1992) and Kobayashi et al. (1993) revealed from these laboratory measurements that attenuation of small amplitude, monochromatic wave height through artificial vegetation follows an exponential decay: where H o is incident wave height, k i is an exponential decay coefficient. Mendez et al. (1999) extended a wave dissipation solution to both monochromatic and irregular waves, dependent upon vegetation height, thickness, width, and flexibility. Computations by Mendez et al. (1999) are validated by laboratory experiments carried out by Dubi (1995). Mendez et al. (1999) found that wave dissipation is enhanced by increased vegetation height and density. However, up to a certain density (between 100 and 5000 vegetation units per square meter), the vegetation behaves as an impermeable step, resulting in an increase in wave height. Dean and Bender (2006) relate wave damping due to vegetation to a reduction in static wave setup of the water surface. Augustin et al. (in press) measured a significant reduction in wave energy through laboratory measurements. For waves propagating through 6 meters of artificial flexible vegetation stems, wave heights were reduced by between 20 and 41% (Augustin et al., in press). Field measurements are difficult to obtain during a hurricane surge event. As a result, most of the literature supporting reduction of storm surge by wetlands refers to high water marks. In 1961, the US Army Corps of Engineers released a study that relates verified storm surge heights induced by several hurricanes to a reduction due to coastal wetlands. In this study, peak surge heights are compiled for various sites located along the Louisiana coast. The relationship between peak surge height and distance from the coast is analyzed. A linear fit estimates that for every linear 4.4 km (2.75 miles) of wetland, average peak surge is decreased by approximately 0.3 m (one foot). The report states that while insufficient data is available to depict time lags of peak surge between coastal and inland stations, the relationship between surge reduction and inland distance is independent of hurricane forward speed, wind speed, and wind direction. Further, the 0.3 m reduction of storm surge levels for every 4.4 km is consistent for areas along both western and eastern Louisiana, where topography and land cover may vary between flat marshland and densely wooded ridges (USACE, 1961). Field reconnaissance of storm surge levels after Hurricane Katrina taken by Fritz et al. (2008) indicates that uprooted trees and storm surge damage decreases rapidly within the first 100 m of shoreline. Houses strategically located within several hundred meters of forest and marshlands to the south and east (upwind and upstream of the most significant hurricane wind and surge velocities) suffered less damage than structures located in the same region, showcasing the ability of coastal forests in reducing wind speeds, wave heights, water velocities, and ultimately peak surge levels."}, {"section_title": "Additional Benefits of Coastal Wetlands", "text": "Aside from storm surge and wave attenuation, coastal wetlands offer an array of environmental, social, and economic benefits. Wetlands are considered to have a high environmental value as a diverse population of plants, animals, and microbes rely on the wetland ecosystem for food, water, and shelter (US EPA, 2008a). It is becoming understood that though the processes occurring in wetlands due to these life forms, wetlands may store carbon within the soil rather than releasing it as carbon dioxide, possibly tempering the causes of global climate change (Choi and Wang, 2004). In southeastern Louisiana, for example, the coastal wetlands at the Mississippi River Delta constitute the US's largest continuous coastal ecosystem, and act as the catch basin for a watershed the size of 40% of the lower 48 US states. Known as a robust natural wastewater treatment system, wetlands have been proven effective at removing biological and chemical pollution from water (Reed, 1991;Kazmierczak, 2001;Rodgers and Castle, 2008). In coastal Louisiana, wetlands are vital in the filtration of storm water and prevention of saltwater intrusion into drinking water sources (Laska et al., 2005), valued at as much as $12,355 per hectare-year (Kazmierczak, 2001). Ninety percent of the Gulf of Mexico's freshwater input is filtered through the biologically rich wetlands surrounding the Mississippi River Delta (Day et al., 2005). With an estimated annual value of several billion dollars, coastal wetlands in Louisiana provide an assortment of natural resources. These activities include both the commercial and recreational harvest of fish, alligators, and fur mammals (Day et al., 2005). An estimated 25-35% of the United States' national fishery catch is landed in coastal Louisiana (Otten et al., 2006 (Turner et al., 1982;Day et al., 2005;Baustian and Turner, 2006;). Baustian and Turner (2006) estimate the conversion of marsh to canals in the Louisiana coastal marsh is responsible for 22% of the total wetland losses between the 1930's and 1990. Even greater than the estimated effect of direct conversion of marsh to canal is the effect of dredged-material banks associated with constructed canals (Baustian and Turner, 2006). There is evidence that the dredged sediment produced in the drilling of such canals interrupts hydrological processes, resulting in waterlogged marshland areas (Day et al., 2000;Baustian and Turner, 2006;). This factor, combined with the increased residence time of saline waters flowing inland through deep manmade canals, ultimately results in the deterioration of coastal wetlands (Day et al., 2005). Land subsidence is identified as a notable cause resulting in the loss of coastal wetlands. Subsidence is the result of the slumping of land due to the underground extraction of water or petroleum. The connection between petroleum extraction and land subsidence has been established through measurements in many parts of the world, including along the Louisiana coast (Morton et al., 2006). Morton et al. (2006) Hackney and Bishop (1981) describe the transport of debris from a salt marsh as a result of Hurricane Bob. The weak hurricane made landfall along the coasts of Louisiana and Mississippi, inducing a 1.0 to 1.5 m peak storm surge east of St. Louis Bay. In a small area of approximately 0.96 km 2 , it was estimated through field measurements that 218,000 kg of debris was transferred away from the marsh, or approximately 16.7% of the annual plant production (Hackney and Bishop, 1981) (Barras, 2006).  The hydrostatic pressure of hurricane storm surge is a component in the reduction of coastal wetlands due to storm events (Stone et al., 1997). After Hurricane Andrew, salt marshes were compressed in Louisiana by as much as 33 mm, not returning to original levels until 8 years later (Cahoon et al., 2006). A similar effect was noted in North Carolina, where soil was compressed by 20 mm by surge induced by two tropical storms (Cahoon et al., 2006). Global sea level rise presents an obvious threat to coastal wetlands. A rising sea level inundates low-lying areas and alters soil properties, resulting in an inhospitable environment for certain wetland plant growth (Donnelly and Bertness, 2001). Historical measurements estimate global sea level rise to be 10 to 15 cm per century (US EPA, 1987). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that the global sea level will rise between 18 to 59 cm by the year 2100 due to the expansion of the ocean waters and ice cap melting (Solomon et al., 2007). A degree of uncertainty remains in the prediction of sea level rise and other effects related to climate change, though sufficient evidence exists so that such threats must not be disregarded. Figure 4 depicts historical and predicted trends in sea level rise."}, {"section_title": "Restoration of Coastal Wetlands", "text": "Marsh restoration, barrier island nourishment, canal backfilling, and hydraulic structures may dampen the effects of wetland loss. While these strategies have a limited value when applied individually, a large-scale effort of both ecological and engineering approaches is expected to have the greatest potential to restore areas of mass wetland loss, such as the Mississippi Deltaic Plain (Day et al., 2007). Long-term marsh management techniques including the construction and operation of levees, weirs, pumps, and culverts have been applied to almost 20% of the Louisiana wetlands with very limited success (Boyer, 1997). Success is often tainted by the motivations of entities in charge, which may clash in a given region (Boyer, 1997). For example, a management program with the goal of reducing land loss through the exclusion of certain species may conflict a bordering land governed by a management program with the goal of harvesting wildlife (Boyer, 1997). Aerial photographs were used by Boyer (1997)  The rebuilding of eroded barrier islands is thought by some to be a promising element in the efforts to reduce wetland loss. Barrier islands reduce storm surge levels and wave heights, thereby reducing the storm-induced erosion and wetland loss (Otten et al., 2006;Day et al., 2007). Nourishment and re-creation of barrier islands entails a major dredging and placement operation, thus requiring extensive funding which is subject to rising energy costs (Day et al., 2005). Otten et al. (2006)  efforts (Neill and Turner, 1987;Baustian and Turner, 2006;Day et al., 2007). Baustian and Turner (2006)   It was also shown that plant communities living on areas once covered with dredged material resembled communities in the surrounding marshes untouched by canal effects (Baustian and Turner, 2006). Marshes may also be restored in more broad areas, involving the import of dredged material to create segments of marsh in areas otherwise covered by open water. An investigation of salt marshes in the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana indicates that after a few years, plant species of a restored marsh will resemble the species composition of surrounding natural marshes (Edwards and Proffitt, 2003). Streever 2000concluded that restored marshes replicate many of the ecological functions, and provide a suitable habitat for smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), the principal plant species native to salt marshes in the US (USDA, 2008). Wetland restoration costs are widely ranging, dependent upon energy prices and proximity to fill material sources. Of the restored marshes in Galveston, TX studied by Rozas et al. (2005), costs ranged between $28,523 and $60,344 and averaged $43,709 per hectare of added wetland (not including open water enclosed within marsh). An estimated one billion dollars per year may be provided to Gulf coast states for the purpose of coastal restoration during the next 30 years as part of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (Day et al., 2007). Each technique mentioned in this section has some degree of potential to reverse wetland loss. To optimize the restoration on a regional scale, a coalescence of both engineering and ecological efforts must be employed. Day, et al., 2007 underscored  wetland. It is hoped that this information may be used to optimize wetland restoration efforts in terms of maximizing storm protection potential."}, {"section_title": "MODELS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Execution of ADCIRC and STWAVE", "text": "To couple the effects of wave radiation stress and storm-driven flow, the ADCIRC and STWAVE models are coupled.

With the wind and pressure files obtained through the PBL model, the first run of ADCIRC provides a global surge output. This provides some data for preliminary analysis, though neglects wave radiation stress.

The PBL model translates this information into a wind file and pressure file, which is used as forcing files in ADCIRC (see Section 3.5) and STWAVE (see Section 3.6). The model is based on the assumption that the parameters of a hurricane will remain relatively constant over short durations (in this case, one hour), and that a translating storm may be estimated using a moving coordinate system. To optimize computing efficiency, wind and pressure fields are formatted in a nested grid with the origin coinciding with the eye of the storm. In this way, wind and pressure fields are depicted at a high resolution near the eye, and a low resolution far away from the storm. This nested grid format is translated with the speed and direction of the hurricane, so that the eye is constantly affixed at the origin (Thompson and Cardone, 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Wave Prediction Model (WAM)", "text": "To provide offshore conditions to drive the STWAVE model, wind fields taken from the output of the PBL model were used to drive the Third Generation Ocean Wave  (Westerink et al., 2008).

The calculation scheme featuring the GWCE formulation is advantageous over other models, as it provides a more stable representation of the water surface that is less prone to numerical instability."}, {"section_title": "ADCIRC resolves varying bottom friction through a nonlinear bottom friction", "text": "coefficient (B f ) found in the expression for bottom friction term (Westerink et al., 2008): The bottom friction coefficient (B f ) may be hinged upon one of a selection of friction factors, including Manning's n, Chezy friction coefficient, or a Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient. To provide a well-recognized and industry-standard friction specification, all bottom stress in this study is formulated around the coefficient used in the Manning equation for open-channel flow (n). For this configuration, ADCIRC relates Manning's n to the nonlinear bottom friction coefficient (Luettich et al., 2004): ADCIRC reads in the forcings from the PBL model as 1) Two-component wind velocity and 2) atmospheric pressure. The wind velocity is converted to surface stress (Westerink et al., 2008):  where W 10 is in units of m/s. ADCIRC has the capability of adjusting applied wind stress for canopy drag due to trees and structures. Canopy drag effects are not analyzed in this thesis, and will therefore not be discussed in this section. Tidal forcing was also neglected in this study to provide a controlled environment, free of extraneous effects. While ADCIRC has the ability to precisely drive flow and surface elevation through tidal forcing, the formulations and theory behind these effects are not discussed in this section.  Jensen, personal communication, February 29, 2008). STWAVE accounts for currents, wave refraction, and shoaling through energy conservation in the direction of wave propagation, \u03bc : where C gr is the group celerity relative to the current speed. Group wave celerity and wave celerity (C r ) is provided by a solution expressed:  where E is energy density within a frequency band, a \u03c9 is angular wave frequency within a static frame of reference, \u03b1 is wave direction reference to the wave crest, and the subscript j denotes the index of the grid cell in the alongshore position. Breaking within the surf-zone is specified by the Miche (1944) criterion: where H m0, max is the zero-moment, energy-based wave height, L is wavelength, and k is wave number. Wind energy is transformed into wave energy through the energy flux Where F in is the wind to wave energy flux, \u039b is a coefficient dictating the percentage of momentum transferred to the water from the atmosphere (0.75), C m is the mean wave celerity, and u * is the friction velocity, which is dependent on wind speed and drag coefficient. Wave interaction is taken into account by a nonlinear distribution of energy from the peak frequency to lower and higher frequencies. Increases in wind fetch result in an increase in the spectral peak, f p : where the subscript i is the grid column index, \u03c2 is a dimensionless coefficient, and t \u0394 is the time for a wave to travel across a grid cell. Whitecapping, wave breaking, and turbulence results in a transfer of energy from low to high frequencies. This results in a dissipation of wave energy, given by the energy flux E \u0393 : where \u03b5 equals 30, E tot is the sum of spectrum energy divided by g w \u03c1 , and k p is wave number at the spectrum peak. Recent versions (Smith, 2007) of STWAVE allow bottom friction to be imposed during wave simulations. Similarly to ADCIRC, STWAVE allows the user to specify bottom friction using the Manning's n coefficient of bottom roughness. The effects of bottom friction are imparted through an energy loss (S bf ) in the wave spectrum: where u rms is root-mean-square of the bottom velocity and \u03c9 is angular wave frequency.  "}, {"section_title": "Idealized Grid Setup", "text": "To provide a basis for general application along a number of coastlines, an idealized grid (Irish et al. 2008) having a constant continental shelf slope and smooth bathymetry is selected. Several profiles offshore of southeastern Louisiana (Figure 7) are analyzed to assist in the selection of a bottom slope.   (Chow, 1959).   Five Manning's n values are selected, ranging between 0.020 and 0.300, as shown in Table 1. Surfaces represented by the Manning's n values in this study range from sandy (as implemented elsewhere in the grid) to unrealistically rough (to provide an upper bound in model simulations).    Table 2 presents the characteristics of the grids for investigating elevation effects. The MAN1 grid used in the bottom friction analysis is a part of this suite, as it features the same bottom friction (n = 0.020) as the other elevation grids. Marsh continuity is defined as the degree of segmentation, equal to the area of marsh at an elevation of 0.5 m above sea level divided by the total area of the marsh system (400 km 2 ). To achieve a non-continuous marsh, channels are introduced, dividing the 20 km by 20 km square marsh feature into 16 squares of equal area, elevation, and bottom friction, as shown in Figure 13.  In this study, two non-continuous marshes were evaluated, having continuities of 75% and 50%, as depicted in Table 3. The 75% continuous marsh features 900 m wide channels, while the 50% continuous marsh features channels that are 2000 m wide. To provide a wide range of surge and wave conditions, a suite of storms with varying hurricane sizes and minimum pressures is selected for this study. Six storms are chosen, having minimum central pressures between 900 and 975 mb, and scale pressure radii between 20.4 and 74.1 km. Forward speed is held constant for all storms at 5.6 m/s (10.9 kts). The use of multiple storms having varying characteristics provides insight into a marsh's storm protection value during a wide range of storm conditions. Table 4 lists the properties of the storms used in the ADCIRC and STWAVE simulations, along with associated peak surge and wave characteristics as simulated for the MAN1 grid. To provide maximum surge levels at the marsh, storm tracks were shifted so that the marsh was located to the east of the storm at landfall. Each storm was shifted by a distance equal to the pressure radius. A trial run of ADCIRC simulations proved this to be an adequate method in allowing the peak surge to impact the marsh. Figure 15 depicts a representative storm track used in this study.  "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Detailed in this section are the numerical models and methods used to investigate the effects of certain physical wetland properties on hurricane storm surge. The primary models used in this study are the ADCIRC and STWAVE models, which provide descriptions of hydrodynamic and wave effects, respectively. These models are supported by the WAM and PBL models, which provide input used in the ADCIRC and STWAVE simulations. To provide a controlled environment and for investigating wave and surge sensitivity to marsh properties, an idealized grid is modified. A bottom slope resembling that of the northern Gulf of Mexico coast is used, yet the bathymetry remains appropriately generic so that study results may be applied to locations elsewhere. grid. It should be noted that storms of increasing incident wave height correspond to storms of increasing surge potential throughout this study. Grid suites described in the previous sections provide a controlled environment in which each wetland characteristics of interest may be investigated in solidarity. Results of simulations over these grid suites are discussed in the next section (Section 4)."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity to Bottom Friction", "text": "Changes in wave heights due to increased bottom friction are shown in Figure   16. Within the marsh, wave heights are reduced for all configurations of increased bottom friction. Incoming peak wave periods ranged between 8 and 13 seconds, and peak incident wave heights ranged between 4.0 and 10.3 m (as shown in Table 4). As provided for peak surge, a metric was established to classify storms according to their wave action. This was established as wave potential (H base ), determined by calculating the average peak significant wave height within the 400 km 2 marsh area for the base scenario. It should be noted that due to breaking and bottom friction dissipation, this wave potential is substantially lower than the incident wave height (see Table 4). Through this parameter, results are ordered in Figure 16 in a way that depicts the effects of increasing average wave heights within the marsh. This also coincides with the     The relationship between Ursell parameter for peak significant incident wave height and bottom friction is depicted in Figure 19. The Ursell parameter is given by: Through the calculation of Ursell parameter based on peak incident wavelength, average wave height within the marsh, and average depth within the marsh, a convergence is observed in Figure 19 based on the Manning's n value of the marsh.   storm of 4.4 m surge potential features a pressure radius of 20.4 km and a minimum pressure of 900 mb, while the storm of 3.5 m has a pressure radius of 38.9 km, and minimum pressure of 941. This suggests that storm size is a secondary factor contributing to the marsh's ability to reduce storm surge, as the larger, weaker storm produces a surge less influenced by bottom friction than the stronger, smaller storm. Therefore, surge sensitivity to bottom friction (in terms of percent differences) is primarily affected by total water depth (surge potential), and secondarily affected by the extent of the alongshore distribution of surge. This is graphically depicted in Figure 22. This reverses the previously mentioned buildup and shadowing effect. Therefore, as the hurricane is positioned landward of the marsh (to the north), there is an increase of water levels to the west and a decrease in water levels to the east. This translates to changes in the peak water levels (maximum water surface elevation observed at each node point at any given time step). The peak elevation percent difference plots ( Figure 21) capture these effects. In all cases, peak water levels are increased southeast of the marsh by no more than 5%. Decreases in peak surge of 10% and less are noted to the west of the marsh for most of the results.   Linear relationships between peak surge at shoreline, pressure deficit, and storm pressure radius as determined by Irish et al., 2008. (From Irish et al., 2008. To derive an equation based on Manning's n and storm parameters, peak depths based on ADCIRC simulation results were plotted based on the linear relationship between ( ) / p \u0394 \u03b6 and R max as presented in Irish et al. (2008), as shown in Figure 24. This was achieved by taking the slope (m s = 1.34 x 10 -4 ) and y-intercept (b y = 0.02511) of the best fit line for a bathymetry slope of 1:1000, and developing a characteristic dimensionless surge function, given by: In this equation, total depth (h) replaces the peak surge (\u03b6 ) used by Irish et al. (2008) in deriving linear relationships presented in Figure 24. This substitution is justified, as peak surge referenced by Irish et al. (2008) is based on peak surge at the coastline of an idealized grid, where the total depth equals peak surge (h = ) \u03b6 . Figure 25 presents this parameter as a function of Manning's n.  "}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity to Marsh Elevation", "text": "Decreased marsh elevation results in increased wave heights, as shown in Figure   27. A uniform response is revealed in this figure for storms of varying potential. In this figure, peak significant wave height changes are depicted in meters, with storm-induced wave potential becoming increasingly large from top to bottom. The uniform increase in peak significant wave heights is a product of the depth-dependency of the waves propagating through the marsh. Depth-limited, deep-water waves approaching the marsh become dependent upon the Miche criterion (Equation 3.10) for breaking as they transition to the shallow water within the marsh. For the storm of greatest wave potential, wave heights are increased by between 0.4 and 0.5 m for a marsh at 0.2 m below sea level. As the marsh is degraded to 3.0 m below sea level, peak significant wave heights induced by this storm are more substantially increased, by between 1.9 and 2.1 m.   . Ratio of seabed elevation (z) to base case elevation (z base ) versus ratio of average peak significant wave height to total depth within the marsh (H base /h). In general, modeling results show that decreases in marsh elevation result in decreases in surge. This is due to the inversely proportional relationship between surge and total water depth, as shown in the momentum balance (Equation 2.2).  A three-part effect is notable within the marsh due to lowered marsh elevation. In most of the results (particularly those of moderate to low surge potential), surge is lowered along the coast, raised within the marsh, and decreased along the seaward edge of the marsh. Areas of lowered peak surge along the landward and seaward edge of the marsh are a result of the inverse relationship between surge and depth. The increased peak surge within areas central to the marsh is a result of increased conveyance of water across the marsh boundary due to lowered marsh elevation. This three-part effect is most dramatic in storms of low surge potential. For example, from the coastline to the edge of the marsh, surge is decreased by 10%, increased by 10%, and once again decreased by 15% due to a lowered seabed to 3.0 m below sea level in the case of the storm of lowest surge potential ( base \u03b6 = 1.8 m). Surge levels become less sensitive to lowered bathymetry as surge potential increases. This is depicted in Figure 30, which relates the percent change in maximum peak surge along the coast to marsh elevation. The relationship between coastal surge sensitivity and marsh elevation approaches a constant slope as surge potential is increased. As shown by the red and purple lines in Figure 30, a nearly linear relationship exists between maximum percent change along the coast and marsh elevation for all but the lowest wave potential cases.   "}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity to Marsh Continuity", "text": "In the analysis of wave and surge sensitivity to marsh continuity, results from grids having continuity of 50% (CON2) and 75% (CON1) are compared with a grid having a continuity of 100% (BASE). Each of the CON1, CON2, and BASE grids feature a marsh Manning's n of 0.035 (tall grass) and an open-water Manning's n of 0.020 (sand). The CON1-2 and BASE grids are identical with the exception of the channels providing a non-continuous marsh in the CON1-2 grids. In essence, this    Figure 35 shows the relationship between the ratio of average peak significant wave height to depth, and marsh continuity. Average wave heights within the marsh are slightly decreased in comparison with depth as continuity is decreased from 100% to 75%. However, as continuity is further decreased to 50%, average peak wave heights are once again increased in comparison with depth, as a result of transmission through the widened marsh channels. For the storms of lowest surge potential (blue, cyan, and green lines) the wave height to water depth ratio for 50% continuity is increased to levels that are greater than that associated with 100% continuity. This indicates that the increased wave transmission through the channels is dominating for storms of low wave potential. However, for the storms of large wave potential, wave height to water depth ratio remains lower than observed for 100% continuity, indicating that refraction effects are dominating for these storms. Percent changes in surge due to increased marsh continuity are dominated by conveyance of water into and out of the marsh, as shown in Figure 36. Due to decreased marsh continuity of c = 75%, coastal surge is increased by as much as 50% in the case of the storm of lowest surge potential ( base \u03b6 = 1.6 m). A further reduction in continuity to c = 50% results in a 70% increase in coastal peak surge. Increases in peak surge along the coast are a result of the transmission of water through the marsh channels. As continuity is further decreased, marsh channel width accordingly increases, resulting in greater conveyance of water into the coastal boundary of the marsh. Velocity vectors depicting this effect are presented in the upper pane of Figure 37. Increasingly wide channels within the marsh also usher in the opportunity for water to flow out of certain areas within the marsh, as depicted in the lower portion of Figure 37. In comparing the upper and lower pane of Figure 37, it is shown that while the storm is approaching (upper pane of Figure 37), water is being conveyed through the marsh, from east to west. After storm landfall, outward flow is observed, diverging from the marsh's center to the east and west. This is also evidenced in the peak surge decreases along the seaward edge of the marsh, especially prominent in the storm of lowest surge potential (first line of Figure 36). In this scenario, a 5 to 10% decrease in surge is noted within the marsh channels due to the shifting of surge water from the seaward marsh boundary to the coastal marsh boundary. As surge potential increases, these decreases become less pronounced. Figure 37. Instantaneous water surface elevation and velocity vectors for 2.5 h before (top) and 1.25 h after (bottom) hurricane landfall (Storm 1). While storms of low surge potential induce an increase in coastal surge levels due to decreased marsh continuity, an opposite effect is associated with the storms of high surge potential. In these cases, surge is decreased at the coast by as much as 5% in the case of c = 50% continuity for the storm of highest surge potential ( base \u03b6 = 6.0 m). This is a result of increased conveyance within the marsh allowing an outflow of surge waters from the marsh during times of peak surge. Nevertheless, increases in peak surge are still noted within the marsh due to channeling from the seaward to central areas of the marsh. The relationship between marsh continuity and volume of surge (total volume of water stored within the marsh due to peak water levels) within the marsh is depicted in Figure 38. A drastic increase in surge volume is noted for the storm of lowest surge potential. However, with increasing surge potential, it becomes evident that marsh continuity has a much more slight effect on surge volume. Given the storm of highest surge potential (purple line in Figure 38), surge volume within the marsh is decreased with decreasing marsh continuity, indicating an outward flow dominating at times of peak surge. Figure 38. Changes in peak surge volume within the marsh due to decreased marsh continuity. A similar effect is noted for coastal peak changes in surge due to decreased marsh continuity. As presented in Figure 39, peak surge at the coast is substantially increased with decreasing marsh continuity for the low potential storms (as indicated by the blue and cyan lines). However, as surge potential increases, increases in surge at the coastline due to decreased marsh continuity become more subtle, transitioning to a decrease in peak surge for the storms of high surge potential (red and purple lines). This suggests that for storms of greater surge potential, a non-continuous marsh may provide a level of storm protection comparable to that of a fully continuous marsh.    Irish et al. (2008) provide an empirical formulation for predicting storm surge depths given meteorological parameters and wetland characteristics. Each predicted formulation calculated and compared with ADCIRC results. For the empirical relationships predicting peak surge depth, R 2 values range from 0.93 to 0.96, and root mean square errors range from 0.3 to 1.4 m."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Computations provided by the ADCIRC and STWAVE numerical models indicate that, given a 20 km by 20 km area of idealized marsh, properties of bottom friction, elevation, and marsh continuity have a definite and wide-ranging effect on peak surge levels and wave heights. Increased bottom friction results in significant decreases in storm surge levels, particularly for weak storms that produce low to moderate levels of storm surge (less than 2.0 m of peak surge). Surge reductions are less pronounced for storms of larger surge potential. Wave heights are similarly dampened by bottom roughness. The lowering of marsh elevation generally induces a decrease in surge levels due to the inversely proportional relationship between surge and total depth. Conversely, decreased marsh elevation results in an increase in peak significant wave height, due to the fact that waves are limited in height by total depth. The segmentation, or reduction of marsh continuity, results in increased coastal surge levels for low to moderate surge potential events, and slight decreases in surge for high surge potential effects. This suggests that a comparable degree of surge protection may be provided by both a continuous and non-continuous marsh, given a hurricane producing extreme amounts of surge. Wave heights are generally increased due to decreased marsh continuity, primarily resulting from wave propagation through marsh channels. However, due to effects of wave refraction, average wave heights within a noncontinuous marsh are not increased until the marsh is significantly segmented, at 50% continuity. Given the need to both restore wetlands and protect increasingly populated areas from hurricane damage, a greater body of research is needed to understand the true capabilities of coastal wetlands for providing protection from storm damage. in Louisiana, it is of paramount importance that funding be applied in the most efficient way possible to provide a sustainable storm protection solution. It is the hope of the author that this thesis will reveal general, quantitative relationships between surge and wave response and physical marsh characteristics, ultimately providing information that may be used to optimize a restoration plan within the Mississippi Delta region and other coastal regions in the US in terms of storm protection. Furthermore, while this work focuses on hurricane impacts, results may also be extended to broader applications, such as surge and wave impacts of extratropical storms. The idealized nature of the modeling domain used in this study provides a basis for applying results to many coastal locations worldwide."}]
