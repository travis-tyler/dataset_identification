[{"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "Following the events at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, the NRC established a senior-level agency task force referred to as the Near-Term Task Force (NTTF). The NTTF conducted a systematic and methodical review of the NRC regulations and processes and determined if the agency should make additional improvements to these programs in light of the events at Fukushima Dai-ichi. As a result of this review, the NTTF developed a comprehensive set of recommendations, documented in the enclosure to . These recommendations were enhanced by the NRC staff following interactions with stakeholders. Documentation of the NRC staff's efforts is contained in SECY-11-0124, \"Recommended Actions to be Taken Without Delay From the Near-Term Task Force Report,\" dated September 9, 2011 (Ref. 3), and SECY-11-0137, \"Prioritization of Recommended Actions to be Taken in Response to Fukushima Lessons Learned,\" dated October 3, 2011 (Ref. 4). As directed by the staff requirements memorandum in the enclosure to , the NRC staff reviewed the NTTF recommendations within the context of the NRC's existing regulatory framework and considered the various regulatory vehicles available to the NRC to implement the recommendations. SECY-11-0124 and SECY-11-0137 established the staff's prioritization of the recommendations based upon the potential safety enhancements. As part of the staff requirements memorandum for SECY-11-0124, dated October 18, 2011 (Ref. 6), the Commission approved the staff's proposed actions, including the development of three information requests under 10 CFR 50.54(f). The information collected will be used to support the NRC staff's evaluation of whether further regulatory action should be pursued in the areas of seismic and flooding design and emergency preparedness. In addition to Commission direction, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, Public Law 112-074, which contains the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2012, was signed into law on December 23, 2011. Section 402 of the law requires a reevaluation of licensees' design basis for external hazards. In response to the aforementioned Commission and Congressional direction, the NRC issued a request for information to all power reactor licensees and holders of construction permits under 10 CFR Part 50 on March 12, 2012 (50.54(f) letter) ((Ref. 1). The March 12, 2012, 50.54(f) letter includes a request that respondents reevaluate flooding hazards at nuclear power plant sites using updated flooding hazard information and presentday regulatory guidance and methodologies. The letter also requests the comparison of the reevaluated hazard to the current design basis at the site for each potential flood mechanism. If the reevaluated flood hazard at a site is not bounded by the current design basis, respondents are requested to perform an integrated assessment. The integrated assessment will evaluate the total plant response to the flood hazard, considering multiple and diverse capabilities such as physical barriers, temporary protective measures, and operational procedures. The NRC staff will review the responses to this request for information and determine whether regulatory actions are necessary to provide additional protection against flooding. This ISG is specific to the assessment of tsunami, surge, or seiche hazards. On October 26, 2012, the NRC staff issued a draft version of this ISG and published a notice of its availability for public comment in the Federal Register (77 FR 65417). The 30day comment period ran October 26, 2012, through November 26, 2012, during which the staff received 38 public comments. Comments were received related to the following topical areas: (1) general comments; (2) comments specific to the storm surge evaluation; and (3) comments specific to the tsunami evaluation. In public meetings on October 24-25, 2012, and November 14, 2012, the NRC staff interacted with external stakeholders to discuss, understand, and resolve public comments. Modifications were made to text of the ISG in response to the public comments and the outcomes of the public meetings. Full detail of the comments, staff responses, and the staff's bases for changes to the ISG are contained in \"NRC Response to Public Comments\" to JLD-ISG-2012-06 (Docket ID NRC-2012-0261) (Ref. 7)."}, {"section_title": "RATIONALE", "text": "On March 12, 2012, the NRC issued a request for information to all power reactor licensees and holders of construction permits under 10 CFR Part 50.

Section 2 (Acceptance Criteria) continues with a discussion of existing regulatory guidance (Section 2.1) and guidance updates (Section 2.2) based on the ongoing new reactor safety reviews and current state of knowledge. Section 2 gives particular attention to terms and definitions, as well as current good practices. Section 3 (Surge Hazard Assessment) closely follows the format provided in Section 2.4.6 of Regulatory Guide 1.206, \"Combined License Applications for Nuclear Power Plants,\" and NUREG-0800, \"Standard Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants (LWR [light-water reactor] Edition)\" (SRP). Section 3.1 (Overview) describes the Hierarchical Hazard Assessment (HHA) approach and the role that deterministic and combined deterministic-probabilistic methods play in surge hazard assessments. Section 3.2 (Meteorological Parameters) describes deterministic and combined deterministicprobabilistic storm-generating methods for input into numerical surge models, which are discussed in Section 3.3. In Section 3.3 (Surge Parameters), pre-surge modeling steps are discussed, beginning with vertical datums (Section 3.3.1) followed by antecedent water levels (Section 3.3.2). Section 3.3.3 (Surge Water Levels) provides a discussion of two state-of-the-art surge models that the NRC and other Federal agencies use.

References are provided in Section 7."}, {"section_title": "Historical Perspective", "text": "In 1959, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) contracted the National Weather Service (NWS) to develop a hypothetical hurricane that could be used to design hurricane protection projects along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts of the United States. The NWS, as part of its National Hurricane Research Project, set out to define \"the most severe storm that is considered reasonably characteristic of a region.\" A storm with such characteristics was termed the \"Standard Project Hurricane\" (SPH). The U.S. Weather Bureau Report No. 33 (Graham and Nunn, 1959) describes this effort. NWS Technical Report 23 (Schwerdt et al., 1979) redefined the SPH as \"a steady-state hurricane having a severe combination of values of meteorological parameters that will give high sustained wind speeds reasonably characteristic of a given region,\" removing the idea from the definition of the SPH that the SPH pertained to the \"most severe storm\" for a particular area. The concept of a \"probable maximum hurricane\" (PMH) also was introduced as \"a hypothetical steady-state hurricane having a combination of values of meteorological parameters that will give the highest sustained wind speed that can probably occur at a specified coastal location.\" The PMH was intended to be an event much rarer than the SPH, but NWS Report 23 (NWS 23), \"Meteorological Criteria for Standard Project Hurricane (SPH) and Probable Maximum Hurricane (PMH) Wind Fields, Gulf and East Coasts of the United States,\" did not offer an objective definition. In 2007, the evaluation of the PMH characteristics was superseded by the adoption of the probable maximum storm surge (PMSS) hazard assessment. Historically, design-basis surge and seiche hazard flood estimates for nuclear power plants (NPPs) have been developed using deterministic analysis approaches based on the \"probable maximum\" or \"maximum credible\" event concept (i.e., the event thought to have \"virtually no risk of exceedance\"). The level of analysis may range from very conservative, based on simplifying assumptions, to detailed analytical estimates of each facet of the floodcausing mechanism studied. In response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the NRC formed a storm surge research program focused on developing modern, risk-informed, hazard assessment techniques and additional guidance through cooperation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and USACE. This research program produced several technical reports. NOAA, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories, USACE, and commercial contractors currently are assisting the NRC's Office of New Reactors (NRO) in reviewing storm surge hazards and updating regulatory guidance. In 2009, the NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) tasked the USACE Engineer Research and Development Center/Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory (ERDC CHL) to review NOAA Technical Report NWS 23 and NRC Regulatory Guide 1.59, \"Design Basis Floods for Nuclear Power Plants.\" ERDC CHL found that several assumptions in the PMH described in NWS 23 are not consistent with the current state of knowledge and recommended that the PMH concept be updated in accordance with new theoretical concepts and data (USACE, 2009). The 2009 ERDC CHL report also states that the ocean model recommended in Regulatory Guide 1.59 (1977) is \"extremely limited by restrictions and simplifications made in order to make the problem computationally tractable given the computer resources available in the early to mid-1970's\" (Resio et al., 2012;USACE, 2009). The review findings recommended adoption of a modern combined system of wind, wave, and coastal circulation models that properly define the physical system and include an appropriate nonlinear coupling of the relevant processes. Thus, the simplified methods provided in Appendix C, \"Simplified Methods of Estimating Probable Maximum Surges,\" of Regulatory Guide 1.59 (1977) are not considered acceptable or used for new reactor application storm surge hazard assessments. However, the approach provided in NWS 23 (1979) is still acceptable for licensing decisions.\nIn response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the NRC coordinated a tsunami safety study in 2005 with the National Tsunami Safety initiative that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducted. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and the Pacific Marine and Environmental Laboratory (PMEL), which is a part of NOAA, conducted the NRC tsunami hazard study. This effort resulted in the publication of two documents: NUREG-CR 6966 (Prasad, 2008), which was published in final form in March 2009, and NOAA Technical Memorandum OAR PMEL-136, \"Scientific and Technical Issues in Tsunami Hazard Assessment of Nuclear Power Plant Sites,\" which was published in 2007. In 2006, the NRC also initiated a long-term tsunami research program. This program, which includes cooperative work with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NOAA, was designed both to support activities associated with the licensing of new nuclear power plants in the U.S. and to support development of new regulatory guidance. This research program has resulted in several publications and made important contributions to tsunami modeling approach and standards, as summarized in conference papers by . The NRC research program includes assessment of both seismic-and landslide-based tsunamigenic sources in both the near and far fields. The inclusion of tsunamigenic landslides, an important category of sources that affect tsunami hazard levels for the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, is a key difference between NRC's research program and most other tsunami hazard assessment programs that existed at the time. The initial phase of work undertaken by the USGS as part of the research program consisted of collection, interpretation, and analysis of available offshore data, with significant effort focused on characterizing offshore near-field landslides and analyzing their tsunamigenic potential and properties. This work is summarized in ten . In addition, a compendium of eight papers was published in a special edition of Marine Geology Special Issue: Tsunami Hazard along the U.S. Atlantic Coast, Volume 264, Issues 1-2, (2009), which documents the results of the NRC research program. More recently, as part of the NRC research program, the USGS has performed studies to fill in gaps in the original data set. The USGS and NRC have also investigated the potential for increased implementation of probabilistic hazard assessment methods. This effort included holding a workshop to investigate probabilistic hazard assessment of landslide-induced tsunami (Geist and ten Brink, 2012). The NRC may augment its guidance on tsunami hazard assessments after the completion of ongoing research."}, {"section_title": "Acceptance Criteria", "text": "\n2.1."}, {"section_title": "Existing Regulatory Guidance", "text": "The applicable regulatory requirements for identifying surge and seiche hazards are as follows: \u2022 10 CFR Part 50, \"Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities.\" General Design Criterion 2 (GDC 2), \"Design Bases for Protection against Natural Phenomena,\" of Appendix A, \"General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,\" requires that structures, systems, and components important to safety be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena such as floods, tsunamis, and seiches without loss of capability to perform their safety functions. Criterion 2 also requires that design bases for these structures, systems, and components reflect (1) appropriate consideration of the most severe of the natural phenomena that have been historically reported for the site and surrounding region with sufficient margin for the limited accuracy and quantity of the historical data and the period when the data have been accumulated, (2) appropriate combinations of the effects of normal and accident conditions with the effects of the natural phenomena, and 3the importance of the safety functions to be performed. \u2022 10 CFR Part 100, \"Reactor Site Criteria,\" requires that physical characteristics of the site, including seismology, meteorology, geology, and hydrology, be taken into account when determining the acceptability of a site for a nuclear power reactor. Other NRC guidance documents, such as NUREGs and regulatory guides, describe methods that the NRC staff considers acceptable to use in implementing specific parts of the agency's regulations, to explain techniques the staff uses in evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and to provide guidance to applicants and licensees. Compliance with recommendations contained in the NRC guidance is not mandated. Thus, in addition to the applicable regulatory requirements, the NRC staff uses appropriate sections of the following guidance documents for the identified acceptance criteria: \u2022 NUREG-0800, \"Standard Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants (LWR Edition),\" provides guidance to NRC staff in performing safety reviews under 10 CFR Part 50 and 10 CFR Part 52, \"Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants.\" Section 2.4.5 provides general guidance for estimating flooding due to storm surge and seiche. \u2022 NUREG/CR-7046, \"Design-Basis Flood Estimation for Site Characterization at Nuclear Power Plants in the United States of America,\" issued November 2011, provides present-day methodologies and technologies that can be used to estimate design-basis floods at nuclear power plants for a range of flooding mechanisms. Sections 3.5, 3.6, Appendix E, and Appendix F provide additional guidance and an illustrative case study for a probable maximum storm surge analysis . \u2022 Regulatory Guide 1.59, \"Design Basis Floods for Nuclear Power Plants,\" Revision 2, issued August 1977, as supplemented by best current practices (NRC, 1977). \u2022 Regulatory Guide 1.27, \"Ultimate Heat Sink for Nuclear Power Plants,\" Revision 2 (NRC, 1976a). \u2022 Regulatory Guide 1.102, \"Flood Protection for Nuclear Power Plants,\" Revision 1, provides guidance for the protection of nuclear power plants from flooding (NRC, 1976b). \u2022 Regulatory Guide 1.206, \"Combined License Applications for Nuclear Power Plants.\" Section C.I.2.4.5 provides general guidance for estimating flooding due to storm surge and seiche (NRC, 2007). \u2022 ANSI/ANS-2.8-1992, \"American National Standard for Determining Design Basis Flooding at Nuclear Reactor Sites,\" provides a methodology for estimating storm surges and seiches at estuaries and coastal areas on oceans and large lakes. Appendix C gives a simplified method of estimating surges on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts (ANS, 1992). \u2022 JLD-ISG-2012-05 provides guidance for performing the integrated assessment for flooding, when necessary (NRC, 2012b)."}, {"section_title": "Updates to Guidance", "text": "In the SRP 2007 update, the adoption of the PMSS superseded the evaluation of the PMH characteristics. The 2007 update also clarified the PMH. The SRP relates the PMSS and the PMH when it states that the \"PMSS is the surge that results from a combination of meteorological parameters of a probable maximum hurricane (PMH)\u2026and has virtually no probability of being exceeded in the region involved.\" To avoid confusion with strictly probabilistic flood hazard assessments, the \"probable maximum\" terminology referenced in NUREG-0800, Regulatory Guide 1.59, Regulatory Guide 1.206, and ANSI/ANS-2.8-1992 is not used in this guidance. Instead, the terms \"simulated\" and \"design basis\" are used and the following terms are defined in the Appendix: No other Federal agencies, such as the USACE, NOAA, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), currently use the \"probable maximum\" or \"standard project\" terminology for storm surge. However, NRC guidance uses these terms. This document is the first attempt to make NRC guidance more consistent with the guidance of other Federal agencies. NUREG-0800, Revision 3 (March 2007), recommends the DBSS that the PMH induces should be estimated as recommended by Regulatory Guide 1.59 and supplemented by current best practices. However, the determination of the storm surge from bathystrophic models (Bretschneider, 1966;Bodine, 1969;Pararas-Carayannis, 1975) used in Regulatory Guide 1.59, which is based on earlier wind field calculations, is not consistent with the current state of knowledge. Therefore, the DBSS estimates using the simplified methods provided in Appendix C of Regulatory Guide 1.59 (1977) are not considered acceptable and are not used for new reactor application storm surge hazard assessments. However, the approach in NWS 23 (1979) is still acceptable for licensing decisions. The current practice in storm-surge modeling is based on the use of coupled hydrodynamic ocean circulation and wave models, both driven by a planetary boundary layer (PBL) model that provides atmospheric forcing (Figure 1). Storm surge models should be validated using historical information and data in the region of interest. For seiche, analytical methods can be used for screening. However, if seiche cannot be eliminated from further consideration using analytical methods, numerical modeling will be necessary. Seiche models should be validated using historical information and data in the region of interest. The NRC Web site (NRC, 2012) provides combined license (COL) and early site permit safety analysis reports and NRC requests for additional information (RAIs) addressing surge and windwave evaluations associated with recent new reactor reviews.\nSection 2.4.6 of NUREG-75/087 (1975) provided guidance on tsunami hazard safety reviews. However, this guidance included few details or quantitative techniques. To fill this information gap, the NRC funded a study of tsunami hazard on the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf Coasts of the United States, which was published as NUREG/CR-1106 (Brandsma et al., 1979). However, NUREG/CR-1106 only addresses distant seismic-generated tsunami and does not consider the effects of locally generated tsunami (e.g., submarine landslides). RG 1.59 (1977) mentions tsunami as a source of flooding but does not provide detailed guidance on tsunami hazards assessment. Regulatory Guide 1.59 is currently being updated and will include guidance on tsunami hazard assessments. NOAA Technical Memorandum OAR PMEL-135 (\"Standards, Criteria, and Procedures for NOAA Evaluation of Tsunami Numerical Models\") and NOAA Technical Memorandum OAR PMEL-136 (\"Scientific and Technical Issues in Tsunami Hazard Assessment of Nuclear Power Plant Sites\") were produced in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. These documents form the basis of the 2007 tsunami-related updates to NUREG-0800. Additional publications addressing tsunami hazards include NUREG/CR-6966 (Prasad, 2008), and the work of ten . No other Federal agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) currently use the \"probable maximum\" or \"standard project\" terminology. However, existing NRC guidance continues to use these terms. This document is the first attempt to make NRC guidance more consistent with the guidance of other Federal agencies. In this ISG, the term design-basis tsunami hazard (DBTH) replaces probable maximum tsunami (PMT). For examples of new reactor tsunami hazard safety assessments, the NRC Web site (NRC, 2012a) provides combined license and early site permit safety analysis reports and related NRC requests for additional information (RAIs)."}, {"section_title": "Surge Hazard Assessment", "text": "All coastal nuclear power plant sites and nuclear power plant sites located adjacent to cooling ponds or reservoirs subject to potential hurricanes, windstorms, and squall lines must consider the potential for inundation from storm surge and windwaves. For example, a hurricane, extra-tropical storm, or squall line could cause a water-level change in an adjacent body of water. The resulting change in water levels, if not considered in the project design, could affect safety-related structures located at the plant site. All water wave processes, including surge, consist of generation, propagation, and dissipation. provide a discussion of two state-of-the-art surge models that the NRC and other Federal agencies currently use."}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Site hazard assessments follow a progressive screening approach, consisting of a series of progressively refined methods that increasingly use more detailed site-specific data to demonstrate whether the site is protected from the adverse effects of severe floods. This approach ( Figure 2) is formalized in the HHA approach described in NUREG/CR-7046 . The HHA approach provides a roadmap for applying a hierarchy of conceptual and mathematical models for the efficient determination of design-basis flood mechanisms and levels. Probabilistic-only and the deterministic-only approaches to the estimation of very lowprobability storm surges have their strengths and deficiencies, depending on the safety hazard assessment objective. Previous site hazard assessments for storm surge have used a deterministic-only HHA approach. However, other Federal agencies recently begun to join the two approaches to provide some advantages over either approach implemented independently (Resio et al., 2012). This document is the first attempt to make NRC guidance more consistent with other Federal agency guidance. The USACE has developed a probabilistic-deterministic methodology for storm surge hazard assessment that can be combined with the HHA approach to provide a DBSS with risk information. The methodology uses an integrative, interdisciplinary approach that incorporates state-of-the-art knowledge in hurricane science, hydrology, and probabilistic methods. This methodology involves the following steps: (1) Selection of a stochastic set of simulated storm tracks affecting the region of interest. (2) Hydrodynamic simulation of the region of interest using a high-resolution surge model and the simulated storm tracks to generate time histories of wind speeds and corresponding time histories of storm surge heights at sites within the affected region. (3) Use of wind speed and storm surge height information generated in Steps 1and 2to develop probabilistic information on the joint probability of wind speed and storm surge height events (Resio et al., 2012). Regardless of the method used, an assessment of sensitivities and uncertainties should be provided for model parameters that may have significant influence on design-basis storm surge estimates.\nDesign-basis flood (DBF) estimation for power plant sites in tsunami hazard zones should consider the effects of tsunami or tsunami-like waves, including runup, flooding, erosion, hydrodynamic forces, debris loads, and rundown or return flow of water. The absence of tsunami events in the site or regional historical record, or upriver location from a coast, is not a sufficient basis to eliminate the need for a detailed tsunami hazard assessment. If a regional or site-specific screening, as described in NUREG/CR-6966 (Prasad, 2008), determines a site is subject to tsunami hazards, a detailed assessment should be undertaken to ensure that the plant design bases account for these hazards adequately. This step should include identification of potential tsunami source mechanisms, estimation of source characteristics, initiation of the tsunami wave, propagation toward the site, and estimation of tsunami hazards at the site. For deterministic and probabilistic approaches, a detailed description of the controlling tsunami generator (e.g., location, dimensions, orientation, and maximum displacement) should be provided. In addition, a detailed description of the analysis procedure and models used to estimate tsunami wave height and period at the site, as well as the development of input parameters, should be included. For tsunami hazard safety evaluations, a deterministic screening approach consisting of a series of progressively more refined methods that increasingly use more detailed sitespecific data is used to demonstrate whether the site is protected from the adverse effects of severe floods. This approach has been formalized in the HHA approach described in NUREG/CR-7046  and NUREG/CR-6966 (Prasad, 2008). On the other hand, the use of probabilistic methods facilitates estimation of a range of tsunami and their associated probabilities rather than focusing on a single, large tsunami that is construed to represent an upper bound. Probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment (PTHA) combines the use of deterministic hydrodynamic ocean wave and source generation models and probabilistic methods. Although the NRC has not published guidance on frameworks and toolsets for PTHA, the NRC will accept PTHA and deterministic approaches for tsunami hazard reevaluations. Example applications of PTHA methodologies can be found in the technical literature (e.g., Uslu, 2008;Geist, E.L. and T. Parsons;Arcas and Uslu, 2010). The NRC continues to sponsor research in this area with USGS and NOAA (Gonzalez et al., 2009;Geist and Parsons, 2006;ten Brink et al., 2009). Regardless of which approach is adopted, a tsunami hazard submittal should include an assessment of sensitivities and uncertainties that may have significant influence on DBTH estimates. The details for reporting of the tsunami hazard assessment can be found in RG 1.206 and NUREG-0800."}, {"section_title": "Meteorological Parameters", "text": "Storm surge can result from several different types of storms (e.g., tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, squall lines, and hybrid storms). For example, extra-tropical cyclones, also known as Northeasters, move along the Atlantic coast with winds from the northeast onto the shoreline, typically producing winds ranging from 30 to 40 mph (48 to 64 km/h) with gusts that can exceed 74 mph (119 km/h). Although below hurricane force, these winds can persist for several days to a week and generate large waves and storm surges. In comparison, wind speed and storm surge elevations are more severe in hurricanes. Their shoreline effects tend to be more localized, and they are generally confined to stretches of coastline of about 65 miles (105 km) or fewer. For the storm surge hazard assessments, the historical record for each storm type appropriate to the region should be examined to determine estimates for extreme winds. This detailed analysis of historical storm events in the region should be augmented by synthetic storms parameterized to account for conditions more severe than those in the historical record, but considered to be reasonably possible on the basis of technical reasoning. This guidance considers four techniques for synthetic storm generation: PMH and JPM are used for generation of synthetic hurricanes ( Figure 3). ANSI/ANS-2.8-1992 and EST are used to generate synthetic extra-tropical storms and squall lines."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Parameters", "text": "This section applies to all coastal sites, excluding the Great Lakes, as described in ANSI/ANS-2.8-1992."}, {"section_title": "Probable Maximum Hurricane", "text": "The NOAA NWS Technical Report 23 (Schwerdt et al., 1979) describes the PMH method in detail. PMH meteorological parameters, as described in NUREG-0800, Section 2.4.5, define the physical attributes of the PMH to derive wind fields that can serve as input into an atmospheric model. Storm surge model simulations are performed with numerous combinations of PMH parameters to obtain the highest design-basis storm surge (DBSS) at the site. NOAA NWS Technical Report 23 (NWS 23) provides methods for estimating PMH wind fields. The PMH is defined as a hypothetical steady-state hurricane with a combination of values of meteorological parameters that will give the highest sustained wind speed that can probably occur at a specified coastal location (NOAA, 1979). The term steady-state is meant to indicate that there is no change in the value of hurricane wind-field parameters during, at least, the last several hours before the PMH makes landfall. The meteorological parameters that define the PMH wind field include the hurricane peripheral pressure, central pressure, radius of maximum winds, forward speed, and track direction. Note that the NWS 23 method provides no risk information (e.g., return period) and is only applicable to the deterministic storm surge analysis of hurricanes. The PMH parameter values in NWS 23 were based on data from historical hurricanes from 1851 to 1977 and were presented for multiple locations along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean coastlines corresponding to their milepost distances from the U.S. to Mexico border. Comparisons of hurricane climatology during the period evaluated in NWS 23 with hurricanes making landfall after 1975 indicate that the NWS 23 parameters for the PMH are still applicable (NOAA, 2007;Ho et al., 1987;Knutson et al., 2010). However, consistent with NUREG-0800, Section 2.3, a detailed site-or region-specific hurricane climatology study should be provided to show that the PMH parameters are consistent with the current state of knowledge. Surge elevation increases with increasing hurricane size. In addition, based on site-specific topography or bathymetry, the increase in storm surge with increasing hurricane size may reach an upper bound. Thus, this behavior should be further investigated by varying the PMH size (radius of maximum wind) beyond the upper bound specified in NWS 23 for a PMH approaching the site (Irish et al., 2008a;Resio and Westerink, 2008). ANSI/ANS-2.8-1992, Section 7, provides additional guidance on the critical combinations of PMH parameters.

Statistical simulation methods such as JPM are needed for coastal flood frequency analysis primarily because of the unavailability of sufficient historical record from which to derive frequencies by more conventional means, such as gage analysis. Hurricanes, for example, are both sporadic and of limited spatial extent, contributing to a great deal of sample variation (sample error) in local tide gage records. As such, JPM is widely used in coastal flood studies that USACE and FEMA perform. For example, Federal agencies adopted the JPM for critical post-Katrina determinations of hurricane surge frequencies (IPET, 2007). The JPM has been used for simulating hurricanes since the late 1960s. The original JPM application, while not called JPM, was developed for predicting wave loads on offshore structures in the Gulf of Mexico (Russell, 1968). The JPM approach that Russell used was a full Monte Carlo simulation in which model hurricanes were simulated using straight-line segments with wind and wave fields computed using hurricane wind and wave models. The methodology was first introduced because the number of historical events (hurricanes) at any one location is insufficient to enable standard statistical techniques (such as extreme value analyses) to estimate flood risk, wave height risk, wind speed risk, etc. The JPM method can be used as an alternative to PMH for deterministic storm surge analysis or used as an option in a combined deterministic-probabilistic analysis for risk information. The JPM approach is a simulation methodology that relies on the development of statistical distributions of key hurricane input parameters (central pressure, radius of maximum winds, translation speed, and heading) and sampling from these distributions to develop model hurricanes. The simulation results in a family of modeled storms that preserve the relationships between the various input model parameters, but provides a way to model the effects and probabilities of storms that have not yet occurred. The method known as JPM-OS (Joint Probability Method-Optimum Sampling) also can be used, which reduces the number of JPM simulated storms needed (Toro et al., 2010). Resio et al. (2007) first introduced long duration tracks that mimic the behavior of hurricanes while they are off shore (and generating a wave field). Vickery et al. (2000a) introduced modeling the full storm track from a wind-only point of view. The simulation methodologies that Resio et al. (2007) and Vickery et al. (2000b) used both attempt to properly model the correlations between storm intensity (central pressure) and radius to maximum winds (RMW). Vickery et al. (2000a) also modeled a relationship between RMW and the Holland B (Holland, 1980) parameter. Overall, the JPM approach has the conceptual advantage of considering all possible storms consistent with the local climatology, each weighted by its appropriate rate of occurrence. Unlike the NWS 23 method, the key model hurricane parameters are developed through an analysis of continuously updated local climatology derived from NOAA's historical hurricane database (HURDAT; Landsea et al., 1996;Landsea et al., 2004;Blake et al., 2007;Blake and Gibney, 2011;and NOAA, 2012b). All parameter combinations analyzed (each defining a synthetic storm) should be simulated using a surge model constructed to accurately represent the site's bathymetry, topography, and ground cover. For examples of detailed discussions and guidance on the application of the JPM to coastal issues see Ferro (2007), Niedorodu et al. 2010, Phan et al. (2007), Resio et al. (2007;, Schmalz (1983), Scheffner et al. (1996), and Toro (2007). Divoky and Resio (2007) provides a comparison of JPM and EST methods. The NRC and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) also used the JPM method for design-basis hurricane wind speeds for nuclear power plants (Vickery et al., 2011;NRC, 2011) and minimum design loads for buildings and other structures (ASCE, 2010). The Empirical Simulation Technique (EST) (Scheffner et al., 1999) quantifies the return periods of storm surges. Statistical simulation methods, such as EST, are necessary for coastal flood frequency analysis primarily because there is an insufficient historical record from which frequencies could be derived by more conventional means, such as gage analysis. For this reason, USACE and FEMA widely use EST in coastal flood studies that they have performed."}, {"section_title": "Extra-tropical Storm and Squall Line Parameters", "text": "The EST method is an option for a combined deterministic-probabilistic methodology. However, unlike tropical storms, a set of storm parameters does not easily represent extratropical storms. Thus, the EST frequency analysis is recommended to determine storm surge stillwater return periods for extra-tropical storms. EST site estimates are based entirely on the historical storms and flood levels observed at that site. Alternate life cycles are simulated by assuming that storm occurrence follows a Poisson process and by implementing a bootstrap resampling from the set of observed events to construct synthetic records. Flood frequency and variability estimates are then derived from this synthetic data. The only assumption is that future events will be statistically similar in magnitude and frequency to past events. The method begins with an analysis of historical events that have affected a specific location. The selected database of events is then parameterized to define the characteristics of the event and the impacts of that event. Parameters that define the storm are referred to as input vectors. Response vectors define storm-related impacts, such as surge elevation, inundation, and shoreline or dune erosion, etc. These input and response vectors are then used as a basis for generating life-cycle simulations of storm-event activity with corresponding impacts. For detailed discussions and guidance on the application of the EST method to coastal issues, see, for example, Scheffner et al. (1996), Scheffner et al. (1999), Wilbury et al. (2007), Zimmer (2008), RENCI (2011), and FEMA (2011, 2012). The USACE Coastal Engineering Design and Analysis System (CEDAS) includes an EST model for the generation of storm profiles (USACE, 2012b).

SLOSH is a depth-averaged two-dimensional finite difference model on curvilinear polar, elliptical, or hyperbolic grid schemes. Modification of storm surges because of the overtopping of barriers (including levees, dunes, and spoil banks), the flow through channels and floodplains, and barrier cuts and breaches are included in the model. The effects of local bathymetry and hydrography also are included in the SLOSH simulation. SLOSH also incorporates an atmospheric model for tropical cyclones. The SLOSH model inputs are hurricane pressure difference, hurricane track description including landfall location, forward speed, and size, given as the radius of maximum wind, which define the physical attributes of a hurricane in performing a storm surge simulation (Jelesnianski, 1992). NOAA provides two models: (1) SLOSH Display Program, and 2 Jelesnianski (1992), NOAA (2006NOAA ( , 2009, and Glahn et al. (2009). SLOSH model predictions have been validated against observed hurricane surge levels at several locations (Jelesnianski, 1992;Jarvinen, 1985). For example, as an emergency management tool, SLOSH is applied to the entire U.S. East Coast, Gulf of Mexico coastlines, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The errors of the SLOSH model predictions, defined by subtracting the observed surge water levels from model predictions, were evaluated for 10 storms in 8 SLOSH model basins, 90 percent of which were in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on a comparison of the SLOSH simulated surge heights against observations, NOAA concludes that the model results generally stayed within \u00b1 20 percent for significant surges (Jarvinen, 1985). SLOSH does not include astronomical tides, wave run ups, or additional heights generated by wind-driven or breaking waves on top of the stillwater storm surge. In addition, the SLOSH v3.95 FORTRAN code that NWS provides contains a limitation in which grid cells with elevations greater than 10.7 meters (m) (35 feet (ft)) NAVD88 were removed from the flooding computation (i.e., these cells could never be flooded). NWS confirmed that the 10.7 m (35 ft) limit for surge in the SLOSH program is historical and does not pose any particular problems when it is relaxed. The SLOSH program code should be validated with and without the changes in the code to determine that the changes in the code are effective and accurate in allowing flooding at elevations greater than 10.7 m (35 ft). One method is to compare the same hurricane scenario for each code through validation against historical storm surge data. NOAA has developed the Extra-Tropical Storm Surge Model (ET-Surge; NOAA, 2012d), which can use a separate planetary boundary wind model in conjunction with a modified SLOSH model to predict storm surge based on large extra-tropical storms as opposed to the tropical storms for which SLOSH was originally developed (Kim et al., 1996).

The major difference between the two is in their treatment of moving shoreline boundaries. During 2003, COULWAVE was applied to the 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami with a landslide source; the results agreed reasonably well with field surveys and observed data. Recently, several finite element models also have been developed based on Boussinesq-type equations. NUREG/CR-6966 (Prasad, 2008) provides additional details and guidance.
