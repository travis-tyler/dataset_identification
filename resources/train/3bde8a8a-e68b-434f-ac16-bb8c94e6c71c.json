Accurate construction of brain functional network from regional rs-fMRI time series is an essential step prior to the subsequent statistical analysis or disease classification (Eguiluz et al., 2005; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010; Van Den Heuvel and Pol, 2010) . Many approaches for brain functional network modeling have been proposed in the past (Smith et al., 2011) . One of the most popular ways is to represent a brain network as a graph that comprises nodes and edges (Sporns et al., 2004; Supekar et al., 2008) . The definitions of nodes and edges in a graph may differ in scale, but in this article, we construct a macroscopic brain functional network by treating the brain regions, or regions of interest (ROIs) from predefined atlas (Craddock et al., 2012; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) , as nodes and the functional connectivity (estimated using the observed regional mean blood-oxygen-level-dependent [BOLD] time series) between each pair of regions as an edge (Smith et al., 2011) .\nWith the above definitions, the most popular approaches for brain network modeling are based on inter-regional Pearson's correlation (PC) (Hampson et al., 2002; Power et al., 2011; Wee et al., 2012) and partial correlation (Fransson and Marrelec, 2008; Salvador et al., 2005) . While the former is easy to understand and can capture pairwise functional relationship based on a pair of regions, the latter can account for more complex interactions among multiple brain regions. But the estimation of partial correlation involves an inversion of a covariance matrix, which may be ill-posed due to the singularity of the covariance matrix. To overcome this issue, a number of representative approaches with l 1 -norm regularization have been introduced by adding a sparsity term since the brain network is believed to be sparse, i.e., some insignificant or spurious connections caused by the low frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuation of BOLD signals (Fransson, 2005) and physiological noise are forced to be zero, thus making the constructed sparse connectivity relatively easier to be interpreted. To a certain extent, the constructed sparse brain network is neurologically justified by the fact that brain regions have only \"first-order/direct\" interactions with a few regions, instead of connecting with all brain regions. Two major types of representative approaches, i.e., l 1 -norm regularized maximum likelihood estimation (Huang et al., 2009; Rosa et al., 2015; Yuan and Lin, 2006) , a.k.a. graphical LASSO (Friedman et al., 2008) , and l 1 -norm regularized linear regression or sparse representation (SR) (Meinshausen and B\u20ac uhlmann, 2006; Peng et al., 2009) , have been widely applied to construct brain network for brain disease studies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Huang et al., 2010) , and autism spectrum disorder (Lee et al., 2011) . More recent representative approaches also take group structure into consideration by adding a group sparsity constraint because of the modular structure of the human brain (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010) . To further introduce sparsity within each group, sparse group representation (SGR) has been developed by combining l 1 -norm and l q;1 -norm constraints, which finally achieves both inter-and intra-group sparsity (Jiang et al., 2015) .\nA common issue of all the aforementioned sparsitybased network construction methods is that the sparse constraint term penalizes each edge equally. In other words, when learning SR for a target ROI, the BOLD signals from all other ROIs are treated equally. Such process ignores the inherent similarity between BOLD signals of the target ROI and the other ROIs during network reconstruction. Consequently, this will usually result in a sparse but difficult-to-understand \"brain network\". We assume in this article that a target ROI's signal is prone to be represented by signals from the ROIs whose BOLD activities are highly synchronized with the target ROI. Based on this assumption, the constructed sparse brain functional network may be more reasonable. On the other hand, not all the weak links to the target ROI have to be removed. Instead, with a delicately designed learning-based framework, the connectivity network can be learned by minimizing an objective function consisting of both a datafitting term and a \"weighted\" sparse regularization term. In this way, some ROIs with signals weakly correlated to the target ROI can still be kept, as long as they can largely reduce the data-fitting error. In this article, we combine the merits of both pairwise correlations and the SR to better model the brain functional network. Specifically, we make better use of the pairwise correlation from PC to drive sparse model, instead of simply discarding this important information. In light of this, we introduce a \"functional connectivity strength-related\" penalty in SR, namely, weighted sparse representation (WSR). Figure 1 shows the simple example of brain networks constructed by PC, SR, and our proposed WSR from real fMRI data. In this proof-of-concept case, the PC-based network is denser compared with the two SR-based networks (by SR and our proposed WSR method, respectively). Due to equal penalization, the network constructed by SR looks as noisy as a random network, probably due to the fact that it often misses many important connections that should have close relationships. In contrast, by considering pairwise functional connectivity strength (derived from PC) in sparse coding, the links with strong connectivity strength are less penalized. By retaining both sparsity and connectivity prior, the network constructed by the WSR is thus more biologically meaningful (i.e., having a clearly structured connectivity matrix or modular architecture). This is because that the relationship between two regions is measured by considering both pairwise correlation and the contribution of other regions. Moreover, to further make the penalty consistent within each subset of links with similar pairwise connectivity strength, we additionally propose a group structure-based constraint in the model. In this way, similar links will share similar penalties during network construction. Thus, we can jointly model the whole-brain network, instead of independently modeling each ROI; in this way, each ROI's construction will gain benefit from other ROIs' constructions. This joint estimation strategy can result in more biologically meaningful brain functional network. We call our method \"connectivity strength-weighted sparse group representation (WSGR),\" which integrates (1) sparsity, (2) functional connectivity strength, and (3) group structure in a unified framework.\nWe hypothesize that, based on our method, brain network construction will be more reasonable and better reflect the true functional organization architecture of the human brain. To validate this, we conduct experiments on real fMRI data, construct different brain functional networks based on our method and other competing methods (PC, SR, and SGR), and use these networks to conduct individualized diagnosis of brain disorder (i.e., distinguishing MCI subjects from normal controls). The results show that our method, even with simple feature selection and linear support vector machine (SVM), achieves superior classification performance compared with other methods. The selected features (i.e., network connections) can be utilized as potential biomarkers to guide early intervention of AD in the future.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we detail the proposed brain network construction model. Then, we apply the constructed brain network for MCI classification in Section 3. The experiments and results will be given in Section 4, followed by discussions and summary in Sections 5 and 6, respectively."}, {"section_title": "WSGR-BASED BRAIN NETWORK CONSTRUCTION", "text": "In this work, we propose a WSGR for brain functional network construction, which considers traditional correlation as connectivity strength to guide sparse modeling for brain network construction. Overview of the proposed construction framework is shown in Figure 2 .\nIn a classical brain functional network construction problem, the brain can be parcellated into N ROIs according to a certain brain atlas. The regional mean time series of the i th ROI can be denoted by a column vector\nwhere M is the number of time points in the entire time series, and thus X5 x 1 ; x 2 ; . . . ; x N \u00bd 2 R M3N denotes the data matrix of a subject. By modeling brain functional network as a graph, a key step is to estimate the connectivity matrix W 2 R N3N , given the N nodes (i.e., x i ; i51; 2; . . . ; N), each representing an ROI's signal.\nThe traditional sparse brain network modeling of the i th ROI x i can be formulated as a standard l 1 -norm regularized optimization problem, and the whole-brain network construction can be defined as\nwhere W ji is the estimated functional connectivity between x i and x j after excluding the confounding effects of other regions."}, {"section_title": "Connectivity Strength-Based Weighting and Weighted Sparse Representation (WSR)", "text": "The l 1 -norm regularization involved in Eq.\n(1) (the second term) penalizes each representation coefficient (W ji ) with the same weight of one. In other words, it treats each ROI equally when reconstructing signals (x i ) for a target ROI. Thus, the inherent pairwise correlation with respect to x i , i.e., \"functional connectivity strength,\" is completely discarded during the optimization. As a result, this type of sparse modeling methods may tend to select only the ROIs with weak connectivities to the target ROI, as long as this can minimize the objective (1). Moreover, the representation of one ROI is independent of the representations of other ROIs. This \"independent representation\" can lead to less biologically meaningful brain network. The estimated representation coefficients of the functionally similar ROIs could vary largely in an unconstrained way. Considering these issues, we argue that the prior functional connectivity strength should be incorporated into the brain functional network construction.\nSpecifically, we can introduce a connectivity strengthweighted sparse penalty in Eq. (1) to take the strength of functional connectivity into account. We suppose that if the BOLD signals of two ROIs have a high correlation, indicating a strong link between each other, then this strong functional link should be less penalized to make it more possible to be chosen to represent the target ROI. Meanwhile, a weak functional link will be penalized more, i.e., with a larger weight, to impede it being chosen. In this way, the constructed sparse brain functional network will be more reasonable.\nThe penalty weight C ji , i.e., the link between the i th ROI x i and the j th ROI x j , can be defined as an exponential function of the PC coefficient:\nwhere P ji is the PC coefficient between the i th ROI x i and the j th ROI x j , and r is a positive parameter used to adjust the weight's decay speed for the connectivity strength adaptor. Accordingly, the connectivity strength-WSR can be formulated as\nwhere C 2 R N3N is the connectivity strength adaptor matrix, with each element C ji being inversely proportional to the similarity (i.e., PC coefficient) between the signals in j th ROI x j and the signals in the target ROI x i ."}, {"section_title": "Grouping of Similar Subnetworks and Weighted Sparse Group Representation (WSGR)", "text": "Note that the above reconstruction of x i , i.e., the i th ROI's construction, is independent of the reconstructions Figure 2 .

To further make the connectivity strengthweighted penalty consistent across all links which have similar functional connectivity strength, we propose a group constraint on the similar links (within a subnetwork) for allowing them to share the same penalty during the whole-brain network construction. In this way, we can model the whole-brain network jointly, instead of separately modeling each ROI. Of note, we use connectivity strength to group the ROIs into subnetworks although existing other grouping ways, such as using diffusion tensor image-based tractography to group the ROIs.\nTo identify the group structure in the brain network, we partition all links, i.e., pairwise connections among ROIs, into K nonoverlapping groups based on the PC coefficients. Specifically, assuming that the numerical range of the absolute value of the PC coefficient jP ij j is P min ; P max \u00bd with P min ! 0 and P max 1, we partition P min ; P max \u00bd into K uniform and nonoverlapping partitions with the same interval D 5 P max 2P min \u00f0 \u00de =K. Then, the k th group can be defined as G k 5 i; j \u00f0 \u00dejjP ij j 2 P min 1 k21 \u00f0 \u00deD; P min 1kD \u00bd \u00c8 \u00c9 . Figure 3 shows an exemplar grouping results with K 5 5 from a randomly selected subject, for illustration purpose.\nTo integrate constraints on functional connectivity strength, group structure, as well as sparsity in a unified framework, we propose a novel weighted sparse group regularization as formulated below:\nwhere\nis l q -norm (with q 5 2 in this work). d k is a predefined weight for the k th group, i.e.,\njP ij j and jG k j represents the number of links in the k th group (G k ). r is the same parameter in Eq. (2), which is set as the mean of all subjects' standard variances of absolute PC coefficients. After obtaining groups, with E 1 < E 2 < . . . < E K , we can penalize the group with higher E k by smaller d k and vice versa. Eq. (4) can also be expressed in a matrix form as follows: \nis the F-norm of matrix, denotes the elementwise multiplication. Unless specifically noted, we denote jj\u00c1jj 1 def 5 P N i;j51 j\u00c1 ij j in this article. To avoid a trivial solution of W5I, we further enforce the constraint W ii 50, equivalent to remove signals of the i th ROI from X when representing itself.\nIn Eq. (5), the first regularizer (which can be regarded as l 1 -norm penalty) controls the overall sparsity of the reconstruction model, and the second regularizer (l q;1 -norm penalty) contributes the sparsity at the group level. k 1 and k 2 are the two parameters used to balance the tradeoff between the (first) l 1 -norm regularization and the (second) group regularization in the objective function. It is noteworthy that our proposed model can be treated as a generalized form of sparse brain construction models. Specifically, if C ji 51 and k 2 50 in Eq. (4), our model reduces to the SR model. If k 2 50, it will degrade to the WSR model. Moreover, if C ji 51, the proposed method shares the same formulation with the SGR (Simon et al., 2013) . In the experimental section, we also include these three special cases for comparison.

Individuals with MCI may progress to AD with an average conversion rate of 10-15% per year, and more than 50% within 5 years (Gauthier et al., 2006; Petersen et al., 2001) . Thus, accurate and early diagnosis of MCI is crucial to reduce the risk of developing AD and the possible delay of dementia with appropriate pharmacological treatments and behavioral interventions. Functional connectivity analysis has shown potential in diagnosis of MCI before appearing of clinical symptoms (Chen et al., 2016; Fox and Raichle, 2007; Friston et al., 1993; Greicius, 2008; Rombouts et al., 2005; Sorg et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007) . But its performance depends on the accuracy of constructed brain network. Therefore, we use MCI identification as a way for validating our proposed brain network construction model. Specifically, the estimated brain network is applied to classify MCI and normal control (NC) subjects. Note that the connectivity matrix W learned from SR-based methods could be asymmetric. Thus, similar to other related works (Elhamifar and Vidal, 2013; Lee et al., 2011; Wee et al., 2014) , we simply make it symmetric as\nand then use W \u00c3 to represent the final network, which has N N21 \u00f0 \u00de=2 effective links due to the symmetry of W \u00c3 .

To reduce the negative effect on brain network modeling caused by excessive framewise head motion, we estimate framewise head motion and exclude subjects who have too many frames with excessive framewise head motion. Specifically, we calculate framewise displacement (FD) based on Power et al.'s (2011) algorithm and exclude the subjects with more than 2.5 min (50 frames) data of FD > 0.5 from further analysis (Wu et al., 2015) . However, we do not censor the data of the remaining subjects to ensure them to have the equal number of rs-fMRI data, to make the functional connectivity network modeling results comparable across subjects.

Regarding the effectiveness of using the connectivity strength-based weights, we can see that the sparse constraint with the connectivity strength-based weights (Figure 5d,e) is more reasonable in modeling brain functional network than its counterparts without weights (Figure 5b,c) . Compared with the traditional SR models, some connections with high connectivity strength are enhanced by the WSR models, and vice versa.

A leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) strategy is adopted in our experiments. To set the values of the regularization parameter (i.e., k in SR and WSR, and k 1 , k 2 in SGR and WSGR), we employ a nested LOOCV strategy on the training set to grid-search the respective parameter values in the range of 2 25 ; 2 24 ; . . . ; 2 1 ; 2 2 \u00c2 \u00c3 . Specifically, given a total of S subjects, one of them is left out for testing, and the remaining S21 subjects are used for training. Then, we select the optimal parameter values by grid-searching on the training set with the nested LOOCV strategy. Specifically, among these S21 subjects, a training subset with S22 subjects was formed by leaving one training subject out to test in the nested LOOCV procedure (based on the t-test with default r Weighted Sparse Group Model for MCI Classification r r 2377 r p < 0.05 for feature selection, and the linear SVM with default c 5 1 for classification). Thus, there are S21 different training subsets and S21 corresponding testing samples. The combination of regularization parameters that gives the best performance is selected as the optimal parameters. Then, by backing to the training set with S21 subjects, we apply the optimal regularization parameters onto the S21 different training subsets, each with S22 subjects. Note, there are S21 classifiers that are used to classify the completely unseen testing subject. The final classification decision is determined via majority voting. Every subject in the whole dataset will be left out for testing, so the above process repeats S times. Finally, an overall cross-validation classification accuracy is calculated. To evaluate the classification performance, we use seven evaluation measures: accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), area under curve (AUC), Youden's index (YI), F-score, and balanced accuracy (BAC). The detailed definitions of these seven statistical measures except area under ROC curve (AUC) are provided in Table II, . In this article, we treat the MCI samples as positive class and the NC samples as negative class.\nAs shown in Figure 6 , the proposed brain network construction model (using weighted group sparsity) achieves the best classification performance with an accuracy of 84.85%, followed by WSR with an accuracy of 79.80%. By comparing these results, we can verify the effectiveness of connectivity strength-based weights from two aspects. First, it can be observed that the WSR model with connectivity strength-based weights performs much better than PC and SR models. Second, the classification result of the WSGR model outperforms the SGR model (with an accuracy of 72.73%). Similarly, by comparing the results of the SR and WSR models with those of the SGR and WSGR models, the effectiveness of our introduced group structure-based penalty can be well justified. The superior performance of our method suggests that the weighted group sparsity is beneficial in constructing brain networks and is also able to improve classification performance.

For the group sparsity by l q;1 -norm, there are some similar models on the network construction in the literature. For example, Varoquaux et al.
