This annual report summarizes the work of the programs under the auspices of the IRMC and provides evaluation data on their effectiveness. Following a letter from the Delaware Secretary of Education, the report summarizes findings from the Baseline Evaluation of Quality in Early Care and Education Programs demonstrating that additional work is needed to help all programs meet high quality standards. Findings from the Delaware Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, tracking progress of 717 children from kindergarten through third grade, are summarized to demonstrate that investments in early care and education lead to improved school success. Information is provided on the number of children receiving assistance through the Early Childhood Assistance Program, the number eligible for the Program for Children with Disabilities, and the number of children with disabilities receiving services through Child Development Watch, the birth to 3 program. The positive impact of birth to 3 services on the development of children with disabilities is then summarized.

The IRMC is charged with fostering an interagency approach in coordinating the delivery of early care and education services in Delaware, promoting interagency collaboration in providing service to those eligible for the Program for Children with Disabilities, providing administrative oversight for the state Early Childhood Assistance Program, and coordinating the implementation of the recommendations of the report: \"Early Success; Creating a Quality Early Care and Education System for Delaware's Children.\" This FY 2003 Annual Report summarizes the work of the programs under the auspices of the 1RMC and provides evaluation data that demonstrate that these programs make a positive difference in the lives of the children and families they serve. The Delaware Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, which tracks the progress of 717 children from kindergarten through third grade, demonstrates that our investments in early care and education are leading to improved school success. The Baseline Evaluation of Quality in Early Care and Education programs, released in September of 2002, demonstrates that we must continue to work to help all programs meet high quality standards. The State has dedicated itself to improving the academic achievement of its students. The value of early care and education programs in this effort is clearly evident. Investments in support of our youngest citizens are important to their success in school and in life.   What did we learn about the fees charged for child care in Delaware? The fmancial aspect of caring for and educating children is a pressing concem (or families, teachers, employers, and other agencies that work with children and families. In order to give an accurate portrait of the fees charged for infant and toddler, full-day preschool, part-day preschool, and school age programming in Delaware, the average fees, as well as the range of fees, are presented in Tables 2 -4. What is the standard fee for one infant child to attend your program for one week of service? -   What does the study tell us about the 9uality of early care and education in Delaware? One method used to determine the quality of early care and education settings was to observe those settings using one of four environmental rating scales fe. The following statements represent samples of the types of data that emerged from the observations: On a scale from one to seven, one being poor and seven being superior... 82% of family child care programs were rated a three or above in fostering language and reasoning skills. 79% of center-based infant and toddler care provides were rated a three or aboke in demonstrating appropriate interactions. 87% of ftill-day center-based 3-5 year old programs were rated a three or above in terms of prodding adequate vace and furnishings. 94% of the Head Start/ECAP programs were rated a three or above in prodding appmpriate cadmium. 86% of part-clay 3-5 year old programs were rated a three or above in providing appropriate program stmcture. 86% of the school-age prcgrams were rated a three or above in prodding professional development opportunities for their staff.

In an effort to determine the outcomes of these efforts, a longitudinal study was funded to track the progress of children receiving these services as compared to their peers. Seven hundred seventeen students, one-third with a disability, one-third living in poverty, and one-third from the general population, have been followed over five years since their entry into kindergarten. The students' academic and discipline records have been tracked to determine their overall success during their first four years in public school. Of these 717 students, 415 participated in the third grade Delaware Student Testing Program in Spring 2001. Forty-two of the children in this group who were living in poverty participated in an Early Childhood Assistance Program (ECAP) when they were four years old.

Using a triennial schedule, programs are comprehensively monitored once every three years to assess their compliance with implementation of the Head Start Performance Standards. Seven programs were monitored during 2001-2002. Programs identified as not complying with the Standards are required to develop Quality Improvement Plans specifying how they will correct the non-compliance issues."}, {"section_title": "Student Identification System", "text": "Children receiving services through ECAP are now enrolled in the Delaware Student klentification System (DELSIS) and assigned a student identification number. Children will maintain that number throughout their school enrollment. This will allow Young children who are found eligible for special services can begin receiving those services at the age of three in Delaware. In some cases, for children with more severe disabilities, services can begin at birth. All school districts in the state provide special education services including speech therapy and other related services. Services may be provided at home or in a community setting or they might be provided in a classroom in an elementary school building. A preschool setting where young children receive special educations should look like any other preschool setting with both typically developing preschoolers and those who might need some specialized help. As of March 2002, 935 three-year-okl children who have developmental or speech delays and four-year-old children with speech delays were eligible for service under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. and other preschool special education programs were able to transition into the regular education program by the time they were 6 and 7 years old. Using DELSIS data, separate cohorts of children in the PCD programs were tracked beginning in December 1997. The status of these children was tracked using data collected through a special education count done on December 1 of every year. Using data collected December 1, 2001, a snapshot picture emerges of where these separate cohort of children were in the 2001-2002 school year. Children who began receiving services in 1997 are now eight and nine year old children in the public school system. Of the 1997 cohort of children, 272 were still enrolled in public schools in December of 2001. Of those, 148 remained in special education. Nearly half were attending school as regular education students. Another cohort of children who first entered special education in 1998 had similar results. Of the original 456 children in the 1998 cohort, 395 remained enrolled in public schools in December of 2001. Of those children, 153 are now enrolled as regular education students. This trend continues looking at students newly identified as requiring special education services in 1999 and in 2000. Of the 409 students identified in 1999 and still enrolled in public schools in 2001, 123 had transitioned to regular education after either one or two years of early intervention through special education services. Likewise, of the preschool children identified in 2000, there were 45 who are now enrolled as regular education kindergarten students. Children, who participated in preschool special education, including those in the PCD program, had significantly higher grades than their peers who were identified with a disability in kindergarten or first grade. These students with disabilities had significantly fewer teacher and parent concerns about their academic and behavioral development than those children with disability who had not participated in preschool special education tr) "}, {"section_title": "Information for Early Care and Education Providers", "text": "A Growing Together Portfolio for Early Care and Education Providers was distributed to chiklcare and preschool pmgrarris statewide.

The average rate of development for children without disabilities is 1.0. This means that for every month that prrws, children acquire one month of developmental skills. A rate of development greater than 1.0 indicates that a child is advancing at a higher rate than expected. Of the 25 children tracked for the Child Outcomes study: their mental (cognitive) skills developed at an average rate of 1.34; their motor skills developed at an average rate of 1.19; and their play skills developed an average rate of 1.25. Children with mild or moderate disabilities developed at a greater rate (1.37) than children with more severe disabilities (1.19). Children living in poverty had approximately the same rate of development (1.28) as children who did not live in poverty (1.36) Looking at the 25 children individuals, only one child had a rate of development less than 1.0 and two children had rates of development of 1.5 or greater.

This process should be concluded and voluntary state standards shoukl be endorsed by the Departments of Education, Health and Social Services, and Services for Children, Youth, and Their Families by September 2003. Observation #2 The Departments of Education, Healih and Social Services, and Services for Children, Youth and Their Families should be congratulated for the work individual departments have initiated toward implementing the recommendations of the Early Success report. The initiatives of these three departments, however, appear fragmented and should be more consistently connected to maximize their impact on program quality across the state."}, {"section_title": "DECEC DECEC", "text": "Recommendation #2 Increasing the communication and collaboration between departments will produce a more comprehensiw system of service delivery. To achieve that goal, during the course of the next year. the Council will look into best practice early care and education models employed by other states. The Council will explore the effectiveness of a single source of oversight for all early education and childcare programs as a better way to achieve a quality early care and education system. The Council will use this information to de.elop a recommendation for Delaware. Observation * 3 The Council applatxls the efforts of the Office of Child Care Licensing to increase minimum standards to improve the quality of care for all children in the state. However, all centers vrill face significant costs in implementing the rule revisions that are cunently being discussed by the Child Care Center Rule Revisions Task Force.

Therefore, the Council requests that the IRMC authorize the Office of Child Care Licensing, Division of Social Services and Department of Education to prepare an estimate of the costs to centers to implement the revisions being discussed by the Child Care Center Rule Revisions Task Force, particularly as they apply to the areas of professional development, quality enhancements, and staff/child ratios. Sources of funding to help providers meet these costs must be identified to support implementation of the revised rules and regulations. Observation #4 Early care and education providers report that Purchase of Care (ROC) rates do not cover the cost of care and, in many cases, only cover about 65% of the actual tuition cost. Currently, many providers do not accept POC clients because it is hard to make up this shortfall. Salaries for childcare workers are often at, or just above, minimum wage. Provides who accept a high percentage of POC clients cannot afford to pay their staff higher wages. POC reimbursement rates have an affect on the availability of programs that accept POC-eligible families.
