[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Many prognostic models for cancer use biomarkers that have utility in early detection. For example, in prostate cancer, models predicting disease-specific survival use serum prostate-specific antigen levels. These models typically show that higher marker levels are associated with poorer prognosis. Consequently, they are often interpreted as indicating that detecting disease at a lower threshold of the biomarker is likely to generate a survival benefit. However, lowering the threshold of the biomarker is tantamount to early detection. For survival benefit to not be simply an artifact of starting the survival clock earlier, we must account for the lead time of early detection. It is not known whether the existing prognostic models imply a survival benefit under early detection once lead time has been accounted for. In this article, we investigate survival benefit implied by prognostic models where the predictor(s) of disease-specific survival are age and/or biomarker level at disease detection. We show that the benefit depends on the rate of biomarker change, the lead time, and the biomarker level at the original date of diagnosis as well as on the parameters of the prognostic model. Even if the prognostic model indicates that lowering the threshold of the biomarker is associated with longer disease-specific survival, this does not necessarily imply that early detection will confer an extension of life expectancy."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Many models for cancer prognosis include as predictors biomarkers that may have utility in early detection (Shariat and others, 2008) . For example, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is used as a key predictor in 16 L. Y. T. INOUE AND OTHERS models for prostate cancer survival (Kattan and others, 2008) and CA-125 has been explored for its utility in predicting ovarian cancer survival (Gupta and Lis, 2009) .\nIn these models, higher biomarker values are typically associated with poorer prognosis in terms of disease-specific survival from diagnosis. While the models themselves do not sanction a causal interpretation of the association between marker values and survival, this interpretation is often made in practice since markers typically increase as disease progresses and since a disseminated tumor is typically much less curable than a localized one.\nBecause these models include early detection biomarker as a predictor of prognosis, they models are often interpreted as making a statement about the improvement in survival that would arise from detecting disease at a lower threshold of the biomarker. However, to lower the threshold of the biomarker requires advancing diagnosis. The interval by which diagnosis is advanced is called the lead time, and this must be taken into account when projecting survival benefit consequences of lowering the threshold of the biomarker value. For example, assume that median survival is 8 years when PSA is 10 ng/mL at diagnosis and 12 years when PSA is 2.5 ng/mL at diagnosis. If it takes only 2 years for PSA to rise from 2.5 to 10 ng/mL, the prognostic model would imply a survival benefit of 2 years. However, if it takes 4 years for PSA to rise from 2.5 to 10 ng/mL, there is no real increase in life expectancy and no true survival benefit. In this case, the apparent improvement in disease-specific survival is entirely accounted for by the lead time (see Figure 1) . Thus, whether the prognostic model implies a true survival benefit, and the magnitude of any such benefit, depends on the lead time. The lead time, in turn, is determined by the difference in marker values (in the above example, 2.5 and 10 ng/mL) and the rate of change of the biomarker.\nIn this article, we aim to quantify the consequences of models for cancer prognosis that include an early detection biomarker. The central question that we address is: \"Based on a prognostic model, if the threshold for the marker value at diagnosis could be lowered by a specific amount, what would be the corresponding change in the distribution of the patient's life expectancy?\" In our development we focus on net diseasespecific survival, or disease-specific survival in the absence of other-cause mortality. We consider two different measures that capture the change in life expectancy when lowering the threshold of the marker. The first is the difference in median disease-specific survival from diagnosis at a lower versus a higher threshold for the marker. We derive conditions under which this difference exceeds the corresponding lead time. The second is the ratio of the hazard of disease-specific mortality under the lower versus the higher threshold for the marker value. We determine parameter settings for both the prognostic and biomarker models that produce a lower value of this ratio and, correspondingly, a greater benefit due to early detection. We then build on these results in an investigation of the relative benefits associated with different marker thresholds for early detection. In both the median survival and hazard ratio (HR) settings, we provide results assuming that disease-specific survival has an exponential distribution. We also explore extensions of our findings to the Weibull distribution and, in the case of the HR, to more general survival distributions."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Background and notation", "text": "Many cancer survival models are proportional hazards models (Iasonos and others, 2008; Kattan and others, 2008) where the hazard function for disease-specific death, h(\u00b7), is of the form h(u) = h 0 (u) exp(X \u03b2) with h 0 (\u00b7) denoting the baseline hazard function, X the vector of covariates, \u03b2 the vector of corresponding regression coefficients, and u the time from disease detection.

We write early diagnosis to refer to the hypothetical earlier timepoint and corresponding marker threshold value. We define the lead time as the difference = a A \u2212 a E . Note that this definition of lead time is consistent with that used in the screening literature when a A represents age at diagnosis in the absence of screening and a E represents age at screen detection.\nWe assume that the underlying biomarker mean level m(t) is a function {m(t); t > 0} and m(t) = exp{\u03b8 1 + \u03b8 2 (t \u2212 a O ) + }, where t relates to subject's age, x + = max(x, 0), and \u03b8 2 > 0. To make the intercept interpretable, t = 0 refers to a known reference age, say 20 years old (correspondingly, ages at disease events depicted in Figure 1 would be in the same scale). The above implies that before disease onset the biomarker mean level is exp(\u03b8 1 ) and after disease onset the annual change in the biomarker mean level is exp(\u03b8 2 ). For simplicity, we refer to \u03b8 2 as the biomarker change rate. Given this model, biomarker thresholds greater than exp(\u03b8 1 ) allow for disease detection.

Thus, condition (2.2) implies that early detection is more likely to be beneficial if the biomarker has a high rate of change and/or if disease, once diagnosed, is not rapidly fatal."}, {"section_title": "Investigating the magnitude of the implied benefit", "text": "In this section, we investigate the extent to which survival is improved by early detection and how the improvement depends on the parameters of the biomarker and prognostic models. The HR is the most commonly used metric for quantifying survival benefit when proportional hazards models are used. Therefore, we consider this measure here. Specifically, we summarize survival improvement using the ratio of the hazard following early detection to the corresponding hazard following actual diagnosis. Let h(\u00b7 | X A ) and h(\u00b7 | X E ) denote the hazard functions describing the risk of disease-specific death from diagnosis at a A and a E conditional on predictors X A and X E , respectively.

See Appendix A3 (see supplementary material available at Biostatistics online) for the derivation of this HR. Note that the HR depends on time from actual diagnosis unless the baseline hazard is constant. A lower HR indicates a greater improvement in life expectancy with lowering the biomarker threshold for early diagnosis. Next we derive results concerning survival improvement under three hazard models: (1) sole predictor is age at disease detection, denoted by a (in years), (2) sole predictor is the biomarker level at disease detection, denoted by m(a) (in ng/mL), or (3) both age and biomarker level at detection are predictors.

In the case of PSA, the standard threshold is 4.0 ng/mL, but there have been calls to lower this to 2.5 ng/mL given the observation that latent disease can be prevalent at non-trivial frequencies even at low PSA levels. We can use the HR formulations above to examine the improvement in disease-specific survival over a range of early detection thresholds for a biomarker. Define the relative hazard ratio RHR(m 0 , m 1 ) as the ratio of the post-lead-time hazard ratios for PSA thresholds m 1 and m 0 . In what follows, we assume that m 1 < m 0 .

Under a prognostic model based on both the biomarker and age at detection, the improvement in survival benefit grows (i.e. RHR 3 shrinks) as the age interval a S 1 \u2212 a S 0 expands. For fixed m 0 and m 1 , this interval depends on the biomarker rate of change and will be longer for slower rates. Therefore, the slower the biomarker rate of change, the more preferable the lower threshold will be.

These patients were treated with radical prostatectomy at four institutions (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, University of Michigan, and Baylor College of Medicine) from 1987 to 2005. The overall prostate cancer mortality was 7%. The cohort is described in detail in Eggener and others (2011) . We fit parametric exponential and Weibull models which either included only PSA at disease diagnosis or included both PSA and age at disease diagnosis as predictors of prostate cancer-specific survival.\nWe based our ranges for PSA coefficients on Etzioni and others (2005) and Inoue and others (2004) who analyzed longitudinal PSA levels from subjects in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (Thompson and others, 2003) and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (Carter and others, 1992) . Specifically, for the biomarker model, we use \u03b8 1 = 0.30 and \u03b8 2 = 0.10 or 0.20; that is, before disease onset the biomarker level remains fixed at exp(0.30) = 1.35 ng/mL, and after disease onset the biomarker grows at a rate of 10% or 20% per year.\nIn the next section, we present overall results and results stratified by grade of disease (Gleason < 7 versus 7). In our sample, 10 890 patients were classified with low-grade disease and 631 patients were classified with high-grade disease. We expect the baseline disease-specific hazard to be considerably higher for the high-grade cases. Table 1 presents the results of the prognostic model fits and our projections of the post-lead-time HR when moving from a higher to a lower PSA level at diagnosis under the exponential survival model. The prognostic model results indicate that, although PSA at diagnosis is predictive of disease-specific survival, its effect is rather modest. For a 1 ng/mL increase in PSA at diagnosis, the disease-specific hazard increases by exp(0.002) = 0.2%. The effect of a 1 year increase in age is an order of magnitude greater estimated at 3% for the overall sample. Based on our analytical results, we therefore anticipate than even if we lower PSA by several points, this will not greatly impact life expectancy; the impact of detecting disease at a younger age is likely to be considerably greater. However, in the case of high-grade cases, detecting disease at a younger age is likely to adversely impact prognosis."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Regression coefficients for the prognostic model under the Weibull survival model are similar, but the baseline hazard is increasing.

Suppose an individual is diagnosed when PSA is m(a A ) = 10.0 ng/mL. What would the projected survival benefit be if he is detected when PSA threshold is m(a E ) = 4.0 ng/mL? How does it compare with the survival benefit if he is detected when PSA threshold is m(a E ) = 2.5 ng/mL? Table 1 answers these questions using hazard functions h 2 and h 3 . For each hazard function, we consider different fixed values for the PSA rate of change. The estimated standard errors (SEs) and 95% CIs for the HRs were derived under asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimators of the regression coefficients of the exponential survival model for disease-specific death.\nExamining the overall results, when moving from a PSA of 10.0 to a PSA of 4.0 ng/mL, the PSA model implies a lead time of 9.2 years when \u03b8 2 = 0.10 and of 4.6 years when \u03b8 2 = 0.20. In both cases, however, when including only PSA, the HR of disease-specific death for an early diagnosis relative to his actual diagnosis is 0.99 (95% CI = [0.98, 1.00]). In other words, the model does not rule out no benefit from earlier detection. The results are similar if instead disease is detected when PSA first exceeds 2.5 ng/mL. In contrast, the model that includes both PSA and age at diagnosis implies a survival benefit in this context. With early detection at a PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL when \u03b8 2 = 0.10, the hazard of disease-specific death for a subject detected early is 0.77 times that for his actual diagnosis [95% CI = (0.63, 0.93)]. The HR is 0.87 (95% CI = [0.79, 0.96]) when \u03b8 2 = 0.20. Moreover, the HR is lower if early detection occurs at a PSA threshold of 2.5 ng/mL.\nSimilar conclusions apply to low-grade disease. For high-grade disease, the model that uses only PSA as a predictor of disease-specific survival implies some survival benefit. However, the model that includes both PSA and age does not rule out harm from early detection. This is because the regression coefficient for age is negative. Thus, for example, when \u03b8 2 = 0.10, when moving from a PSA of 10.0 to a PSA of 4.0 ng/mL, the hazard of disease-specific death for an early diagnosis is 1.25 times higher than his actual diagnosis [95% CI = (0.74, 2.00)]. Figure 2 presents the relative HRs corresponding to h 2 and h 3 to illustrate the added benefit, if any, of lowering the threshold for PSA positivity from 4.0 to 2.5 ng/mL. For example, considering overall results, RHR 2 (2.5, 4.0) = 1.00 and so lowering the threshold from 4.0 to 2.5 ng/mL is associated with no improvement in survival benefit under a hazard for prognosis that depends only on PSA. This does not vary with the biomarker rate of change. In contrast, RHR 3 depends on the biomarker rate of change. In this case, if the biomarker changes at a rate of 10% per year, we find that RHR 3 (2.5, 4.0) = 0.88 [95% CI = (0.79, 0.97)], indicating that the 2.5 ng/mL threshold is associated with a 12% improvement in survival benefit relative to the 4.0 ng/mL threshold. As the biomarker rate of change increases, the lead time decreases, and the corresponding RHR is higher. Thus, men with a faster PSA change rate do not gain as much from a lower PSA threshold as do men with a slower PSA change rate.

Even in randomized trials of early detection, inferences about benefit are limited by trial protocols and short follow-up or contaminated by non-compliance. Prognostic models that include early detection biomarkers as covariates make implicit statements about the expected benefit of early detection. Our work on this topic has focused on quantifying the benefit and determining whether and how it goes beyond a lead time effect. Under exponential and Weibull survival models, we derived conditions on marker change rate and prognostic parameters that are associated with greater benefit due to early detection. For example, we found that cases with a faster biomarker change rate or higher biomarker levels at actual diagnosis will generally have greater benefit from advancing diagnosis by a given lead time. Conversely and as might be expected, for a given rate of biomarker change, longer lead time confers greater survival benefit.\nOur results are based on several assumptions. The first is that the association between the biomarker and disease-specific survival embodied in the prognostic model is biologically based and may therefore be interpreted causally. This assumption is critical in order to interpret survival differences projected by the prognostic model for different biomarker threshold levels as the expected survival gains an individual might expect if his biomarker levels change by the same amount. The second is that post-lead-time survival times in the absence and presence of early detection have the same baseline survival hazards. Another assumption is the exponential growth of the biomarker in cancer cases. This is standard in studies modeling known cancer biomarkers such as PSA (Inoue and others, 2004; Morrell and others, 1995; Pearson and others, 1994; Slate and Turnbull, 2000) and CA-125 (Skates and others, 2001) . Under this assumption, the magnitude of the survival benefit depends on the biomarker value at actual detection so that the benefit from shifting the biomarker value from m C (a * + ) to m S (a * + ) is greater than when shifting from m C (a + ) to m S (a + ) when a * > a and > 0. This is a consequence of the exponential growth of the biomarker and may not occur under alternative biomarker model formulations. For example, when the biomarker has linear change, the benefit for a specified lead time does not depend on the biomarker level at actual diagnosis.\nUnder the above assumptions, we derived conditions under which proportional hazards models of disease-specific survival, as used, for example, in prostate cancer nomograms (Kattan and others, 2008) , induce a benefit in terms of median disease-specific survival. This benefit depends on lead time, but it also depends on the rate of change of the biomarker, which could be affected by other clinical and pathologic variables. For example, Inoue and others (2004) showed that PSA rates of change increased with grade of disease. Thus, the projected benefit will vary for high-versus low-grade cases as well as for men with higher versus lower PSA levels at actual detection.\nWe have expressed the survival benefit in two different ways: in terms of the difference in median survival and in terms of HRs. However, there may be other metrics with which to measure the implicit gains. For example, life-years saved or gains in life expectancy may be more appropriate in certain contexts. Whatever measure is used will need to account for lead time as we have done, for example, in focusing on post-lead-time HRs.\nAll of our results are based on models for net disease-specific mortality in the absence of competing risks mortality. We expect that estimates of survival benefit will be lower in the presence of other-cause deaths, which will reduce disease-specific deaths in both the absence and presence of early detection. In this case, the survival benefit may depend not only on the prognostic and biomarker model parameters but also on the hazard of other-cause mortality. Further work will investigate the role of the risk of other-cause death when modeling crude disease-specific survival.\nWe have used estimates from a prognostic model to project differences in expected post-lead-time survival among detected cases were they to be diagnosed earlier with lower PSA threshold levels. The benefits of earlier detection will only be relative to the distribution of diagnosis times in the prognostic dataset. If the prognostic dataset includes screen-detected cases, which tend to show inflated survival anyway due to lead time and overdiagnosis, then this will limit the benefit that can reasonably be expected from further lowering the PSA threshold. This is almost certainly the case in our example dataset which includes cases diagnosed through 2005. In addition, cases in this dataset were treated with radical prostatectomy and therefore were localized. Both of these factors are likely to be behind the modest benefit that we projected from lowering PSA at diagnosis.\nFinally, in our application, the biomarker growth was informed from another study since PSA data were only available at diagnosis. Joint modeling of the biomarker growth and the time-to-event processes as done in Law and others (2002) , Taylor and others (2005) , Soto and others (2008) , and Proust-Lima and Taylor (2009) is another direction for future work.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that models of cancer prognosis that include early detection biomarkers can be used to project the likely benefits of early detection, but only under certain assumptions and only if lead time is taken into account. The results presented here could, in principle, be used to predict longterm benefit in cancer early detection trials (Andriole and others, 2009; Schr\u00f6der and others, 2009 ) by comparing, for example, the projected post-lead-time survival on early detection and control arms given mean ages and biomarker values at diagnosis on both arms. This will require marginalizing the expression for median benefit over the distributions of the covariates in both arms of such trials. Some adaptations to the methods will also be necessary to account for the presence of overdiagnosed cases in the early detection arm. With this information we could potentially produce long-term estimates of survival benefit due to early detection which are not currently observable in practice given the limited follow-up of these studies."}, {"section_title": "SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL", "text": "Supplementary material is available at http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org."}]
