During that time, our ability to track changes and predict enrollment trends has improved. Consequently, there are reliable data on the number of students enrolling in and graduating from S&E and other higher education programs. There is also a robust body of data and publications on employment trends and workforce characteristics in S&E fields (CAWMSET 2000 , NSF 2000 , NSB 2006 ). Nonetheless, there are scant data on the employment preferences and salary expectations of S&E students (NSF 2001) . As a result, we know little about what kinds of workplaces current S&E students are willing to work in and what kinds of salaries they expect to earn when they enter the workforce.\nThis article focuses on the employment preferences and salary expectations of four-year college and university students in life sciences and other S&E programs nationwide. It reports the findings of a national survey of students in five life sciences fields (biological sciences, forestry, natural resource management, agricultural sciences, and environmental sciences), a physical science field (geosciences, comprising geology, earth science, and atmospheric science), an engineering field (environmental engineering), and two social science groups (geography students and students pursuing degrees in fields such as environmental sociology and political ecology). The study examines students' willingness to work in five types of institution upon graduation: academia, government agencies, corporations (for-profit organizations), environmental organizations, and other nonprofits. It also reports the minimum salaries students indicated they were willing to accept upon graduation."}, {"section_title": "Related research", "text": "Between 1983 and 2003, enrollment in American institutions of higher education rose from 12.6 million to 15.7 million students. Demographers predict that the college population will continue to increase, because the number of people in the population between the ages of 20 and 24 years is expected to rise until about 2015. As the number of students enrolled in institutions of higher education has increased, so too has the number of S&E degrees awarded. Despite some fluctuations between 1983 and 2002, the numbers of S&E bachelor's and master's degrees awarded in 2002 attained new highs of 415,600 and 99,200, respectively. Consequently, in 2002 , S&E degrees accounted for 32 percent of the bachelor's degrees awarded. Moreover, after a four-year decline, the number of doctorates awarded rose in 2003 (NSB 2006) .\nHow does this affect the status of women and minorities in S&E programs? The data show that the number of women enrolled in S&E disciplines has increased steadily for some time. Women have earned 50 percent or more of the bachelor's degrees awarded in S&E disciplines since 2002. In 1983, women comprised 36 percent of the graduate students in S&E; they comprised 47 percent of the group in 2003. The percentage of underrepresented minority students (blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans) enrolling in S&E fields has also increased. Underrepresented minorities constituted 6 percent of S&E students in 1983; in 2003 they constituted 11 percent. Over the same period, the percentage of Asian students in S&E disciplines climbed to 7 percent. The proportion of bachelor's degrees awarded to minorities in S&E fields has also risen in this time period. From 1983 to 2002, the proportion of S&E degrees awarded to Asians increased from 4 percent to 9 percent, and the proportion awarded to underrepresented minorities increased from 9 percent to 16 percent. There have been increases in the proportion of master's degrees awarded to women and minorities in this period as well. The proportion of S&E master's degrees awarded to women increased from 31 percent to 44 percent. The proportion grew from 5 percent to 7 percent for Asians and from 5 percent to 11 percent for underrepresented minorities. The findings are similar at the doctoral level, where women earned 45 percent of the S&E doctorates awarded in 2003. The proportion of S&E doctorates awarded to underrepresented minorities rose from 3 percent to 5 percent between 1983 and 2003; the proportion for Asians increased from 2 percent to 4 percent in the same period. Experts predict that the greatest increase in the growth in enrollment of S&E students will be from minority students. In addition, women and minorities now constitute a robust part of the S&E workforce; women make up 24.7 percent of the S&E workforce, while blacks comprise 6.9 percent, Hispanics 3.2 percent, and Asians 14 percent (NSB 2006 ; see also Babco and Jesse 2005) . This raises another question: With the changing demographics of S&E programs, how are factors such as gender and race related to employment preferences and salary expectations?\nThe 1997 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), a biennial survey sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) , included a module that explored the job preferences of the recent doctorate holders in the sample. The SDR asked those obtaining doctorates between 1990 and 1996 to indicate what their actual employment was at the time of the survey as well as what type of job they wanted to have at the beginning of their doctoral careers. The study found that, on average, most respondents were actually working in the fields they most desired to work in when they began their doctoral studies. For instance, 61 percent wanted to work in a college or university setting when they began their doctorate; 48 percent were actually working in that setting when surveyed. Table 1 shows the desired and actual employment of recent S&E doctorate holders in various sectors. The SDR also tracks the earnings of recent and long-time doctorate holders (NSF 2001) .\nThe data presented below are important because we know little about what institutions students currently enrolled in S&E programs want to work in and what their salary expectations are. This information is crucial in helping us understand how students' desires and expectations match the realities of the job market. For instance, the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) tracks the beginning salaries offered to college graduates who recently earned a bachelor's degree. They report that starting salaries are rising-salaries were higher in most disciplines in 2006 than a year earlier. Engineers earned the most. Whereas the starting salaries of chemical engineers averaged almost $56,000, starting salaries in the biological/life sciences hovered around $30,000 (NACE 2006) . Data from the NSF corroborate these findings. The NSF reports that median salaries for recent S&E bachelor's degree holders increased more rapidly than salaries for non-S&E bachelor's degree holders. In 2003, engineering graduates with a bachelor's degree had a median income of $53,000. The median starting salary for all the sciences was $36,000. The median starting salary for master's degree holders was about $71,000 for engineers and about $52,000 for all the sciences (NSF 2005 , NSB 2006 Source: NSF (2001) ."}, {"section_title": "Study description and sample characteristics", "text": "The study lasted from October 2003 to May 2005. Surveys were administered to students in S&E programs that were environmental in nature. \"Environment\" was defined broadly to encompass the aforementioned disciplines. Colleges and universities with the relevant programs were identified through an online directory of US universities (www.utexas.edu/world/ univ/state) and the National Wildlife Federation's Conservation Directory (NWF 2003) . Potential participants were then identified through departmental Web pages and student organizations. Contact information was found for students at 350 colleges and universities with relevant programs. A stratified random sampling frame was used; public universities, liberal arts colleges, and other private universities formed the three strata. Two hundred colleges and universities were selected from the pool. Five thousand surveys were then administered to students in the relevant programs in these universities. Respondents had the option of completing a paperor Web-based version of the questionnaire. A total of 1239 students from 185 colleges and universities completed and returned the surveys. Students from 93 percent of the colleges and universities that were selected for inclusion in the study participated. The actual response rate for the survey was 25 percent.\nOf the 1224 students identifying their racial backgrounds, 5 were either mixed race or Arabs. Because this subsample was so small, these respondents were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1219 respondents, 348, or 28.5 percent, were members of minority groups, and 871, or 71.5 percent, were white. Further analyses of the sample show that 10.0 percent (122) of the respondents were Asian, 9.1 percent (111) were Hispanic, 7.9 percent (96) were black, and 1.6 percent (19) were Native American (see figure 1) . A total of 1214 respondents identified their gender; there were 708 females and 506 males."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of selected S&E departments", "text": "For analytic purposes, the sample was grouped into nine broad disciplinary clusters. Of the 1224 students who identified disciplinary units to which they belonged, 31.2 percent indicated they belonged to units in the biological sciences, 21.3 percent in natural resources, 15.9 percent in the geosciences, and 9.3 percent in the agricultural sciences. There were 7.6 percent in forestry, 5.8 percent in geography, 4.2 percent in the environmental sciences, 3.3 percent in environmental engineering, and 1.4 percent in the social sciences.\nThe racial characteristics of the departments varied widely. The percentage of minority students in each department ranged from 13.5 percent to 52.7 percent (figure 2). The lowest percentages of minority students in the sample were found in geosciences and geography departments, whereas more than half of those in the agricultural sciences belonged to minority groups. Further analysis of the racial composition of these fields shows that Native Americans in the sample were found in the highest percentages in the social sciences and environmental engineering. Hispanics were found in the highest percentages in environmental engineering and environmental sciences. Blacks were most likely to be concentrated in the agricultural and social sciences, while Asian students were found in all the fields in relatively high proportions.\nThere were 504 doctoral students, 517 master's students, and 212 undergraduates in the sample. Forty-six percent of the undergraduates belonged to racial minorities, as did 21.6 percent of the master's and 28.2 percent of the doctoral students. Sixty-five percent of the undergraduate respondents were female, as were 62.3 percent of the master's students and 51.7 percent of the doctoral students."}, {"section_title": "Willingness to work in five types of institution after graduating", "text": "Respondents were asked to rate their likelihood of working in a particular type of institution upon graduation on a sixpoint Likert scale, with 0-1 being classified as unlikely and 2-5 being classified as likely. Analysis of the sample mean scores Professional Biologist showed that working in a government environmental agency and teaching in academia had the highest mean scores (3.10 and 3.09, respectively). Environmental justice organizations had the lowest mean score of 1.79. In terms of percentages, 84.7 percent of the sample indicated they would be willing to work in a government environmental agency upon graduation (see table 2 ). Academic institutions were next; 79.1 percent of the respondents indicated they would be willing to teach, and 78.7 percent indicated a willingness to work as research scientists, in such institutions. Though the percentages were lower, almost threequarters of the respondents indicated a willingness to work in mainstream environmental organizations. The institutions that were the least attractive to respondents were environmental justice organizations (52.1 percent) and corporations without an environmental division (49.2 percent).\nAs table 2 shows, there was significant variation among respondents in the various S&E fields vis-\u00e0-vis their willingness to work in the different types of institutions. Respondents from the environmental sciences (84.0 percent), geosciences (83.1 percent), and biological sciences (83.4 percent) were most likely to say they were willing to teach in academia. Social science students (70.6 percent) were the least likely to say they were willing to teach in academia. Regarding research in academic institutions, respondents from geography and the biological sciences were the two groups most likely to indicate they were willing to work as researchers in academia upon graduation. While 88.7 percent of geography students and 87.7 percent of biological sciences students indicated a willingness to work in this arena, only 52.9 percent of social sciences students felt the same way.\nThere was also quite a broad range in the willingness of respondents to work in mainstream environmental organizations. Whereas 87.8 percent of environmental sciences students expressed a willingness to work in such institutions upon graduation, only 66 percent of geosciences students indicated such a preference. While 74.6 percent of geographers and 73.5 percent of environmental sciences students said they were willing to work in an environmental justice organization upon graduation, less than half of the respondents from the biosciences, geosciences, forestry, and agricultural sciences felt this way. More than half the respondents in all fields expressed a willingness to work in nonenvironmental nonprofits.\nOnly 58.8 percent of social science students indicated they were willing to work in a government environmental agency upon graduation; however, more than threequarters of all other respondents said they were willing to work in an agency of this type. More than two-thirds of respondents from all disciplines indicated a willingness to work in a nonenvironmental government agency upon graduation.\nEnvironmental engineers (82.5 percent) and geosciences students (74.7 percent) were most likely to say they were Note: \"Total mean rating\" refers to the rating on a scale of 0 to 5 that respondents gave to the likelihood of working in each institution; the mean score for whole sample is included in this row.\nwilling to work in corporate environmental settings; by contrast, only 59.2 percent of the students in geography and 58.1 percent of those in natural resources said they were willing work in such settings. Though more than half of the respondents from the agricultural sciences, social sciences, geosciences, and environmental engineering said they were willing to work for a nonenvironmental corporate entity, fewer than half of the respondents from other fields said likewise. Figure 3 and table 2 show the percentages of white and minority respondents indicating a willingness to work in particular types of institutions. Though the analysis of white and minority students' responses shows almost identical percentages of respondents willing to work in mainstream environmental organizations or as researchers in academia, more detailed analysis shows significant variation among different racial groups in the sample. There was a noticeable difference between blacks and other racial groups when the relationship between race and the willingness to teach in academic institutions was examined: 82.5 percent of Asians, 79.9 percent of whites, and 78.2 percent of Hispanics were willing to work as teachers in academic institutions. However, only 69.8 percent of blacks expressed such willingness. The variation in the sample was even more dramatic when willingness to research in academia was examined. Asians (88.2 percent) were far more likely than any other group to indicate willingness to research in academic institutions. Native Americans (89.5 percent) were most likely to say they would work for mainstream environmental organizations, and Asians (63 percent) were most likely to indicate willingness to work for environmental justice organizations. Blacks (63.2 percent) were far less likely than others to say they were willing to work for mainstream environmental organizations. Whites (49.7 percent) were the least likely to indicate a willingness to work for environmental justice organizations.\nNative Americans (78.9 percent) were most likely, and whites (64.8 percent) least likely, to indicate a willingness to work in nonenvironmental nonprofits. While 78.9 percent of Native Americans and 80 percent of Asians said they were willing to work in government environmental agencies, approximately 85 percent of the other respondents said the same. Blacks (92.6 percent) were far more likely than others to say they were willing to work in nonenvironmental government agencies. Blacks were also most likely to say they were willing to work in corporations upon graduation.\nWomen were less likely than men to say they would work in academia as teachers or researchers. Gender differences were also apparent in questions exploring willingness to work in nonprofits and corporations. Women were more likely than men to say they were willing to work in three types of nonprofits (mainstream environmental organizations, environmental justice organizations, and other nonprofits), while men were more likely than women to express willingness to work in corporations.\nDoctoral students were significantly more likely than other students to say they were willing to work in academia as teachers and research scientists. In contrast, doctoral students were less likely than other students to say they were willing to work in environmental justice organizations and other nonprofits. Master's students were more likely than other students to say they would work for mainstream environmental organizations and government environmental agencies.\nThe youngest respondents (18-to 24-year-olds) were significantly less likely than older respondents to indicate a willingness to teach or research in academic institutions upon graduation. However, older respondents were less likely to signify willingness to work in corporations, environmental justice, and nonenvironmental organizations than the youngest respondents.\nThe findings of the 2004 American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) salary survey corroborate the above findings; of the 6124 scientists studied in the AAAS survey, only 15 percent worked in industry (Holden 2004) . As mentioned before, most of the recent doctorate holders in the SDR who wanted to work in academia at the beginning of their doctoral studies actually worked in academia at the time of the survey. However, more of the SDR respondents worked in industry than initially wanted to: Only 24.3 percent wanted to work in business or industry at the start of their doctoral studies, but 32 percent actually ended up working in business or industry. Four percent had a desire to work in government, and 9.2 percent were actually working in government at the time the survey was conducted. In the SDR, the geoscientists and biological scientists were among the groups most desirous of working in academia (NSF 2001 dustry was the largest employer of these graduates: 68 percent of the bachelor's degree holders and 58 percent of the master's degree holders were employed in this sector. The second largest employer was educational institutions; 21 percent of S&E bachelor's degree holders and 28 percent of master's degree holders were employed in this sector. The government sector employed 11 percent and 14 percent of S&E bachelor's and master's degree holders, respectively (NSF 2005 , NSB 2006 ). The findings of this study corroborate the NSF employment data in that 68.1 percent of undergraduates and 69.7 percent of master's students in this sample said they were willing to work in corporate environmental entities and more than half said they would work in other corporations. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) that provide information on environmental jobs were also examined. BLS data showed that more than half of biological scientists, conservation scientists, foresters, forest technicians, social scientists, environmental scientists, and hydrologists worked for a government entity. Sixty-one percent of chemical science technicians worked in corporations; so did 29 percent of environmental engineers, 27 percent of biological technicians, 18 percent of agricultural technicians, about 45 percent of geoscientists, 23 percent of geosciences technicians, and 29 percent of environmental scientists (BLS 2005a) . Hence, BLS data indicate that the preference of respondents to work in government is realistic."}, {"section_title": "Ideal job", "text": "Respondents were asked to indicate in which of the institutions discussed above they thought they could find their ideal job. More than a third of the respondents (34.7 percent) thought their ideal jobs would be teaching in academia. Another 21.5 percent thought their ideal job would be in a government environmental agency. Fewer than 10 percent thought their ideal job would be located in a nonprofit, corporation, or nonenvironmental government agency ( figure  4, table 3 ).\nOf the geography students, 40.8 percent thought their ideal jobs would be as teachers in academia. The students least likely to agree were those in forestry; only 24.4 percent of such students thought their ideal jobs would be teaching in academia. There was significant variation among students vis-\u00e0-vis ideal jobs as research scientists in academia. Though none of the social science students thought this could be their ideal job setting, 20.1 percent of the students in the biological sciences saw this as ideal.\nWhile 37.2 percent of white students responded that their ideal jobs would be teaching in academia, Asian students were least likely to feel the same way. Only 25 percent of Asian students indicated that teaching in academia would be their ideal job. Regardless of the fact that Asians were less likely to choose this option than other racial groups, this was the ideal job option chosen most frequently by Asian students. Whereas 12.5 percent of Asians saw corporate environmental entities as ideal, only 5.4 percent of blacks did the same. Blacks (37 percent) and Native Americans (38.9 percent) were most likely to indicate that their ideal job would be in government environmental agencies. A third of the Hispanic students indicated that their ideal jobs would be teaching in academia.\nThe gender pattern observed earlier repeated itself: Women were much more likely than men to see nonprofits as ideal workplaces and less likely than men to view corporations in this light. Doctoral students differed significantly from other students. They were more than twice as likely as other students to say their ideal jobs would be in academia as teachers, and much less likely than other students to say their ideal jobs would be in other types of organizations. Furthermore, the older respondents got, the more likely they were to say that teaching in academia was their ideal job.\nWhen asked why particular jobs were ideal, the most frequent responses given by respondents were that they provided opportunities to research (17.7 percent); that respondents were passionate about them (16.7 percent); and that they provided job security (10.6 percent), financial opportunities (9.1 percent), and opportunities to make a difference in the world (8.6 percent). Respondents in the 2004 AAAS salary survey also reported that being passionate about their work and being happy in their jobs were important elements of success in their careers (Holden 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Salary expectations", "text": "Respondents were asked to state the minimum salary they would accept upon graduation. The mean minimum salary was calculated. However, to facilitate more detailed analyses, responses were grouped into five categories: $0-$29,000, $30,000-$39,000, $40,000-$49,000, $50,000-$59,000, and $60,000 and over. Generally speaking, respondents had modest salary expectations that were comparable to what was being paid to new S&E graduates. The mean minimum salary expected by the sample was $39,371. Fifty-one percent of the respondents said they would accept less than $40,000 as their minimum salary upon graduation. Only 11 percent of the respondents said they wanted a minimum salary of $60,000 or more (table 4) .\nStudents of environmental engineering, agricultural sciences, and geosciences expected the highest wages. The mean minimum acceptable salary of $50,103 indicated by engineering students was much higher than the mean minimum salaries indicated by students in other fields. Over half of the environmental engineering students indicated that the minimum salary they would accept had to be $50,000 or more. In contrast, students in the biological and social sciences had the most modest salary expectations. Of the students in the social sciences, 62.6 percent said they would accept a minimum salary of less than $40,000, and only 6.3 percent expected to earn a minimum of $50,000 or more. Similarly, 59.7 percent of students in the biological sciences would accept a minimum salary of less than $40,000, and only 13.2 percent expected to earn a minimum of $50,000. More than half the students in forestry and natural resources also said that they would accept a minimum salary that was less than $40,000 per annum.\nWhen race was analyzed, Asian students generally expected higher wages than other students. Asians had the highest mean minimum acceptable salary of $44,954; the white students' mean of $38,294 was the lowest. While 55.5 percent of Native American students, 54.6 percent of white students, 49.5 percent of Hispanic students, and 41 percent of black students would accept minimum salaries that were less than $40,000, only 30.6 percent of Asian students said they would do likewise. In a similar vein, Asian students were more likely (38.8 percent) to indicate they would accept a minimum salary that was $50,000 or more. In contrast, less than 30 percent of the other students expected a minimum salary in this range.\nThese results are of interest to mainstream environmental organizations, which have been criticized over the last decade and a half for lacking racial diversity. Leaders from these organizations have responded to the criticism by arguing that they have few minority staff because minorities are not qualified for jobs in these organizations, will demand wages that are too high for the mainstream environmental nonprofits to pay, or are not willing to work in said organizations (Shabecoff 1990 , ECO 1992 . A 1992 study of 63 mainstream environmental organizations found that 32 percent of them had no minorities on staff. A 2002 study found that only 11.5 percent of the staff of 61 mainstream environmental organizations were members of racial minorities (ECO 1992 , Stanton 2002 .\nAlthough an NSF study reports that Asians, blacks, and Hispanics comprise 24.1 percent of the S&E workforce (NSB 2006) , a study of 168 mainstream environmental NGOs, 39 environmental justice organizations, and 38 government environmental agencies I conducted between 2004 and 2006 revealed that ethnic minorities were still underrepresented in that sector of the workforce. The study found that all minorities combined constituted 17 percent of the staff of the 243 organizations studied. More specifically, minorities comprised 14.6 percent of the staff of mainstream environmental organizations, 15.4 percent of the staff of government environmental agencies, and 77.8 percent of the staff of environmental justice organizations. Thirty-five percent of the mainstream environmental organizations indicated that they had no minorities on staff; so did 19 percent of the government environmental agencies and 11 percent of the environmental justice organizations. Ninety-three percent of the mainstream environmental NGOs, 86 percent of the government environmental agencies, and 85 percent of the environmental justice organizations reported hiring staff in the three years before they were interviewed for the study. Of those hiring staff, 34 percent of the mainstream environmental NGOs, 29 percent of the government environmental agencies, and 4 percent of the environmental justice organizations did not hire any minority staff. Though mainstream environmental organization leaders question whether minorities are willing to work in these kinds of organizations, the findings discussed above indicate that minorities are indeed willing to work in environmental nonprofits. The findings also indicate that minorities have salary expectations that are well within the range being paid by mainstream environmental organizations. My organizational study found that mainstream environmental organizations were paying a mean salary of $30,495 to new employees with a bachelor's degree, $37,543 to new employees with a master's degree, and $52,538 to new employees with a doctorate. The mean minimum acceptable salary that minority students indicated in this study was $36,489 for undergraduates, $42,380 for those in master's programs, and $45,876 for doctoral students. (It should be noted that white undergraduates also had mean minimum salary expectations that were higher than the mean minimums being paid by mainstream environmental organizations.) Despite the differences in means, there is still a robust pool of minority students whose salary expectations fall within the range of that being paid by mainstream environmental organizations. Of the mainstream environmental organizations surveyed, 90.8 percent paid new workers with a bachelor's degree less than $40,000 to start. In comparison, 64.3 percent of minority and 77.5 percent of white undergraduates indicated that they would accept a minimum salary of less than $40,000. While 56.6 percent of the mainstream environmental organizations offered new workers with a master's degree less than $40,000 to start, 39.4 percent of minority and 64.7 percent of white master's degree students said they would accept a minimum salary in this range. Most mainstream environmental organizations were paying new staff with doctorates between $40,000 and $59,000. This matched the salary expectations of most minority and white doctoral students.\nOn average, women indicated that they would accept lower salaries than men. The mean minimum salary male respondents would accept was $41,275; in comparison, the mean for female respondents was $38,115. While 55.6 percent of the female respondents said they would accept less than $40,000 as a minimum salary, 43.9 percent of the male respondents would. Only 19.9 percent of the female respondents indicated that the minimum salary they would accept would have to be $50,000 or higher; 25.7 percent of the male respondents said the same. Female Hispanic students deviated from the remainder of the female students in that they had mean min- imum salary expectations that were 11 percent higher than those of Hispanic males. By contrast, black males indicated they would accept mean minimum salaries that were 5 percent higher than those indicated by black females; white males indicated mean salaries that were 9 percent higher than those indicated by white females; Asian males indicated mean salaries that were 12 percent higher than those indicated by Asian females; and Native American males indicated mean salaries that were 23 percent higher than those indicated by Native American females. Overall, Asian men had the highest mean minimum salary expectation and Native American women the lowest.\nUndergraduates expected the lowest minimum salaries, followed by master's students and doctoral students. The mean minimum salary undergraduates expected was $34,254. The mean for master's students was $37,260, and the mean for doctoral students was $43,504. Seventy-one percent of undergraduates said they would accept a minimum salary of less than $40,000. In contrast, only 34.6 percent of doctoral students would accept less than $40,000 as their minimum starting salary. In general, age was also correlated with salary expectations. While the mean minimum salary expected by 18-to 24-year-olds was $36,016, the mean for 25-to 29-year-olds was $40,042. The mean was $42,023 for 30-to 34-year-olds and $41,512 for respondents 35 and over.\nHow do the salary expectations of respondents in the sample compare with others in the general population and with the salaries being paid to new college graduates? NACE reports that among recent graduates with bachelor's degrees, engineers could expect starting salaries over $50,000, those in the geosciences about $40,000, those in agriculture around $36,000, those in the biological sciences about $30,000, and those in conservation or forestry about $27,000 (NACE 2006) . It seems that most of the undergraduates in the study reported here have salary expectations that are within the range of what is being paid by employers (i.e., 64.3 percent of the undergraduates in the sample said they would accept a minimum salary of less than $40,000 upon graduation).\nA 2004 Wall Street Journal poll of 1000 undergraduates found that 45 percent of the respondents expected to earn $30,000 or more upon graduation; 21 percent of those surveyed expected starting salaries of $40,000 or more (Kim 2004) . Students in this study had somewhat higher salary expectations than those in the Wall Street Journal sample: 66 percent of undergraduates said the minimum salary they would accept would be $30,000 or more, and 29.2 percent said the minimum salary they would accept would be $40,000 or more. This could be because this study has a sample of S&E undergraduates, whereas the Wall Street Journal poll was conducted among undergraduates from a broader range of academic fields.\nAs reported above, female respondents indicated lower acceptable minimum salaries than men. Women's salary expectations match the realities of the job market, in which men still generally earn more than women in similar occupations. Data from a 2005 BLS report showed that the mean weekly earnings of men outpaced that of women. For instance, a survey of 712,000 men in biological, physical, and social science occupations found that the men earned a mean weekly income of $1073 ($55,796 per year), while the 452,000 women earned a mean weekly wage of $837, or $43,524 per year (BLS 2005b ).\nAn NSF study of median annual salaries of full-time employed scientists and engineers holding doctorates found substantial gender and racial differences in earnings-women had lower median salaries than men, and minorities had lower median salaries than whites, in 2003. Whereas the median salary in the sciences was $83,700 for men, it was $68,000 for women. The median salary was $85,000 for white males and $68,000 for white females. In contrast, Asian men and women earned $82,000 and $70,000, Hispanic males and females earned $75,400 and $61,000, and Native American males and females earned $72,000 and $68,000, respectively. As a group, blacks had the lowest median salaries: Black males and females earned $69,700 and $66,000, respectively (NSF 2006) .\nThe wage differential between men and women can also be seen in other national surveys, including the 2004 AAAS salary survey. Though the salary gap between males and females had narrowed between 2001 and 2004, the median salary for men working in academia in 2004 was $83,000 while the median salary for women was $67,000. Scientists working in nonacademic settings earned more than academics, but the male-female salary gap persisted. The median income for male scientists in nonacademic settings in 2004 was $98,000, while the median salary for females was $78,000 (Holden 2004) .\nResearchers have studied the phenomenon of lower salary expectations among female workers. They have found that gender differences in pay are accepted by both men and women, and that despite large wage gaps and differences in levels of authority, women are not more likely to report being dissatisfied with their jobs than men. Phelan (1994) theorizes that women may have a different sense of entitlement than men. Women could also have different values than men concerning what makes them satisfied with a job; they could be comparing themselves to other women-who are also undercompensated-in the workforce; and job satisfaction is not necessarily determined by factors such as salary and advancement opportunities (Crosby 1982 , Bokemeier and Lacy 1986 , Phelan 1994 .\nThe racial and gender differences in salary can be partly explained by the fact that larger numbers of women and minorities have entered the S&E workforce more recently, and therefore have less work experience. Wage differences can also arise from the segregation of males and females, or whites and minorities, into different types of jobs that are compensated differently. Studies have also found that a split labor market operates in which minorities are paid less for the same job than whites, and that lower starting salaries are paid to minorities than whites (Baron and Bielby 1985 , Phelan 1994 , Seidel et al. 2000 , NSB 2006 ). However, despite the reality of earning less than whites once they enter the work-force, the mean minimum salaries that minorities reported would be acceptable to them were slightly higher than those reported by whites."}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks", "text": "The study uncovered important findings that will be the topic of further research. For instance, the question of why women have lower salary expectations than men, while minorities do not have lower salary expectations than whites (when in reality both women and minorities tend to earn less than white men), is an intriguing one. In a study of this sort, coverage and nonresponse are concerns. The sample frame was limited to students in selected colleges or universities and departments for whom contact information could be found; this introduces a bias as those for whom no contact information was available were not included.\nAnother aspect of coverage-use of Internet-based surveys-can introduce a source of bias. However, though there is a widely recognized digital divide in terms of access to the Internet between whites and underrepresented minorities, and between the middle and lower class, recent studies have shown that the racial divide dwindles as educational attainment increases. Analysts argue that in surveys of college students, coverage is not a problem, given students' widespread access to the Internet (Dillman and Bowker 2001 , Servon 2002 , NTIA 2004 .\nThe response rate of this study is lower than one typically finds with mail surveys or interviews. Survey experts have analyzed Internet survey response rates and found that they tend to be lower than for mail surveys or interviews. Several Internet-based studies report response rates between 10 and 50 percent. The lower response rates can result from software incompatibilities, navigational difficulties, limitations in the subjects' knowledge of computers and comfort with the technology, notifications sidetracked by spam filters, and the length of the survey (Dillman et al. 1998 , Couper 2000 , Dillman and Bowker 2001 , Gunn 2002 , Kwak and Radler 2002 . The survey the respondents were asked to complete was lengthy and covered sensitive topics; this could have dampened the response rate.\nIn conclusion, the study found that respondents had a strong sense of where they were willing to work and what kinds of jobs were ideal for them. They also had a realistic sense of the salary to expect upon entering the workforce. This study pointed to racial and gender differences as well as differences in S&E fields that can enhance our understanding of students' work preferences and salary expectations. It is an important step in helping us understand more about how S&E students think about the workplace, how early they develop preferences for certain work environments, and how well those preferences are aligned with the realities of the job market and the preferences and experiences of workers already in the S&E workforce."}]
