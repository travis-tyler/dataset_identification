[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project is a proposed project to establish a shipping route between India and Sri Lanka in the shallow straits. The ocean floor between India and Sri Lanka near the Mannar coast is not navigable due to shallow water depths. Due to this India does not have a continuous shipping channel connecting her west coast to east coast. Therefore, the government of India has proposed the dredging of the sea between India and Sri Lanka to create a navigational canal to save up to 780 km of navigating distance and 30 hours of sailing time allowing ships to navigate from west to east coast of India instead of having to circumnavigate Sri Lanka. The total length of Sethusamudram Shipping Canal would be around 260 km; in the Gulf of Mannar the distance is about 120 km from Tuticorin Port to Adam's Bridge and a further 140 km from Adam's Bridge to Bay of Bengal in the Palk Bay. The proposed depth of the canal is 12 m enabling 10,000 to 12,000 GRT vessels to pass through."}, {"section_title": "Introduction to Tsunami and Storm Surge", "text": "The Sri Lankan coastline was devastated by the Indian Ocean Tsunami on 26 December 2004 which was caused by a gigantic submarine earthquake 400 km west of northern Sumatra. The name Tsunami comes fr the harbo the wave. As deep ocean water depths ranged between 4000 to 5000m, such waves can voyage at speeds up to 800km/hour; hence they can shield trans-oceanic distances in a matter of hours. However, due to these massive wavelengths tsunami waves generally occupy periods in the vicinity of 10 to 30 minutes and amplitudes, in bottomless water, typically smaller than 1m. It is very vital to understand that the combined action of nearshore processes and local geomorphologic features influence the degree of the final effect at a given location. The threat of tsunami lies not in deep water, but rather when they come ashore. As the tsunami wave leaves the deep water and reaches shallow waters near the shore, it undergoes an alteration called wave shoaling. Apart from the shoaling process, the wave is also subject to refraction, diffraction and reflection resulting in very large distinctions in the run up height. Sea surface temperature rise due global warming might increase the intensity and recurrence frequency of the extreme weather phenomena such as tropical cyclones, flooding and torrential rain in the future. Storm surges are generated primarily by the extreme winds from low pressure atmospheric systems. Further, secondary factors such as atmospheric pressure rotation and associated wave setup also influence the intensity of the storm surge. Hence, a storm surge is a rise of sea water level above the predicted astronomical tide level, resulted from the combined effects of strong winds, reduced atmospheric pressure over a shallow water body and other secondary factors. Bay of Bengal is a place where cyclones are generally originated. As Sri Lanka is situated near Bay of Bengal these cyclones affect Sri Lanka as well (Ramesh, 2005). Storm surges and flooding are considered the main impacts of cyclones. The objective of this research is to estimate the impact of tsunami and storm surge events after the construction of the SSCP through the use of hydrodynamic modelling."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Models", "text": "Storm surge is an abnormal rise in sea level accompanying a tropical cyclone or other intense storm, and whose height is the difference between the observed level of the sea surface and the level which would have occurred in the absence of the cyclone (i.e. astronomical tide level). In the past several decades, there are many storm surge studies conducted world wide. Harris (1956) is the first person to start systematic studies on storm surges due to tropical cyclones on the East Coast of the United States. In his pa distinct processes that can alter the water level in tidal water regions during a storm surge (Vatvani, 2012). There are pressure effects, the direct wind effect, effect of w rotation and the rainfall effect. Pore (1964Pore ( ,1965 included two more factors involved in the generation and modification of storm surges. Those are the height of the tide and modifying effects of coastline and bathymetry. Numerical model studies of hurricane-induced storm surge began in the early 1970s. Jelesnianski (1972) developed the Special Program to list Amplitude of Surges from Hurricanes in 1972. After that, Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) was developed and widely used by NOAA for coastal flooding and inundation forecasts along the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard of the United States (Shen, 2009). Despite its popularity, the SLOSH model has several disadvantages which need to be improved. First, because its use of structured grid, the SLOSH model has a limitation in resolving complicated coastlines and thus severely restricts its capability for accurate simulation of inundation. Second, the advection terms in the momentum equations are neglected in this model, which will influence the accuracy of the simulation. In recent decades, many other models using different numerical schemes have been developed for the simulation of storm surges in different areas (Vatvani, D, 2012). One of these models is the ADCIRC model, which employs the unstructured grid and is able to resolve the complex coastline as well as the bathymetry of shallow water quite well."}, {"section_title": "Tsunami Models", "text": "During the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004, the southern part of Kerala was generally safe from a major tsunami, mainly because the tsunami waves from Sumatra region travelling south of the Sri Lankan island, moderately diffracted northward and affected the central part of the Kerala coast. Since the tsunami is a long gravity wave during the diffraction process, the rather wide turn it has to take spared the south Kerala coast. On the other hand, excavating the Sethu Canal might provide a more direct route for the tsunami and this could influence south Kerala. The project will have serious bad impact in Kerala Coast. The Bay of Bengal entrance of a sea canal project linking India's coasts should be readjusted from facing east to northwest to protect the Kerala coast from future tsunamis (Ramesh, 2005a). ation model has been accepted but it was corrected by international tsunami authorities. The model explains tsunami propagation in general terms, but fails to give us a clear idea of tsunami wave action in Palk Bay area. Tsunami simulation models by Steven N. Ward of University of California, explain graphically the way of tsunami waves action in Palk Bay on December 26th (Ramesh, 2005b)."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model Domain", "text": "In "}, {"section_title": "Bathymetry Data", "text": "Bathymetric data provides a representative bottom configuration that is to be constructed to represent the SSCP.
