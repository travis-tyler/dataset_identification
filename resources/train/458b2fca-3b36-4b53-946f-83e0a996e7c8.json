The purpose of the assessment is to determine students' daily life performances in mathematics, science and reading literacy. PISA results and reports are amongst the sources of reference that countries examine in order to organize their education policies. Although not PISA's aim, based on these results countries compare each other in terms of student performance and make critics.\nSuch large-scale assessments, which are conducted by being translated into different languages, should be reliable and valid. Otherwise, the interpretations about students made will be scientifically incorrect or incomplete. Wrong decisions can be made on students whose tests scores are not objective. Today, one of the issues discussed amongst test developers and psychometrics is the comparability of results from tests. For example, if two students with the same achievement level do not perform the same in a mathematics question, what may be the reason for this? Is there a problem with the validity of the test or is the performance affected by different variables?\nPISA technical reports (OECD, 2012 (OECD, , 2014b are provided on the validity and reliability of measurement instruments. However, the analyses explained in the technical report are limited. An in-depth examination of the tests measuring cognitive and affective properties in PISA, which provides a large data source, will be beneficial. In the present study, the construct validity of the mathematical cognitive domain test was examined for Turkey. For this, differential item functioning (DIF) of the items was examined according to gender, and the sources of DIF was examined.\nValidity refers to what construct the test measures and how accurately the test measures that construct (Turgut & Baykul, 2014) . The interpretations made based on findings obtained from a measurement tool whose validity was not proven will not carry weight. Although different methods are used to determine validity, differentiation in the probability of individuals with the same ability or achievement level in different groups (focus, reference) responding to an item is examined using differential item functioning methods (Hambleton & Rogers, 1995) . For example, the probability of giving the correct answer to the item is supposed to be equal for students with the same ability in the same group or in the different groups. If the students who are within the same population but are the member of separate groups, they can have a different probability of giving the correct answer. This is associated with item bias (Dogan, Hambleton, Yurtcu, & Yavuz, 2018; Zumbo, 1999) . Examining item bias which characteristics is supposed to be discussed is important because item bias based on many different group characteristics (gender, language, socio-economic status, race, etc.) may occur (Millsap & Everson, 1993) .\nThere are many analysis techniques based on traditional approaches. Many of them accept the assumption that the function of differentiating factors for individuals with the same characteristics is found in the same pattern. However, individuals are often clustered within different organizations such as class, school, country, and the behaviors of differentiating factors also vary in each organization. Therefore, using multilevel methods that do not ignore the relation between clusters is recommended for DIF determination (Adams, Wilso, & Wu, 1997; Kamata, 2001) . In this study, two approaches were used. One of these approaches was Generalized Hierarchical Linear Models (HGLM) as multilevel model (Kamata, 1998 (Kamata, , 2001 ). The other approach was logistic regression (LR) as traditional approach (Zumbo, 1999) . Thus the results of the two approaches will be compared.\nExpert opinions are vital to reveal the items' bias. The sensitivity review is to put forth the source of bias in the items. Taking into consideration the individuals with the same performance, experts examine the possibility of individuals responding to the items solely because the item contents are close to a specific group's experiences. In the study, the opinions of the experts who specialized in writing the test items on the related subject were taken.\nHow the probability of students responding to an item might change based on different variables can be determine by using HGLM. Also the disappearance of DIF in items can be examined. In the study, the variables of self-efficacy, mathematics anxiety and mathematics interest, which all believed to be effective on student achievement, were examined how changed magnitude of DIF."}, {"section_title": "Detecting DIF with HGLM", "text": "Data in the social sciences mostly has a clustered structure. Repeated measures are found in clusters made up of individuals whereas individuals are found in different organizational units. For example, the items in the test are answered by students and these students are in a class, and the school is made up of these classes. While the smallest unit of organization in this example is the item, the highest unit is the school. For this reason, the elements of each level in a hierarchy are commonly affected by the specific characteristics and experiences of the upper levels. In measurements the assumption of observations is independent of each other is not unacceptable. This will lead to loss of information and Type I and Type II error rates (Hox, 2002; Snijders & Bosker, 1999) . Researchers suggest that hierarchical models that do not ignore this assumption are used in data analyses (Hox, 2002; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) .\nThe DIF detection method used in the study is the proposed HGLM model for binary coded items by Kamata (1998 Kamata ( , 2001 . The reason for using HGLM is because HGLM takes into consideration the clustered data structures in large-scale assessments; gives information about the psychometric properties of the test; examines the sources of DIF by adding different characteristics to the model and because there is no need to separate the sample into two groups as reference and focus (Qian, 2011) . HGLM model developed for binary coded items and allows missing data in responses during parameter estimation (Kamata, 1998 (Kamata, , 2001 ). The first level of the HGLM model is the item level while the second level is the student level. Levels can be increased according to the purpose of the study. This study was designed based on the two-level HGLM approach. The log odd of \"j\" student's (in class \"m\") probability of correctly answering the item \"i\" is calculated without adding the group variable to the models. Then, Group variable (gender) in which the DIF will be examined is added to the second level, and the significance of this variable on the items is tested. In the third step, different student characteristics are added to this level, and possible DIF sources can be examined by looking at the change of magnitude of DIF."}, {"section_title": "Detecting DIF with Logistic Regression", "text": "Logistic regression approach is the one of the most recommended methods for determining DIF (Clauser & Mazor, 1998; Swaminathan &Rogers, 1990) . DIF is divided into uniform and non-uniform. Uniform DIF occurs when no interaction between ability and group membership can be found. Non-uniform DIF occurs when interaction between ability and group membership can be found (Camilli & Shepard, 1994; Swaminathan & Rogers, 1990) . Results of simulation-based studies revealed that LR approach was powerful at a comparable level in detecting uniform DIF than Mantel-Haenszel (MH) and Simultaneous Item Bias (SIB) methods and LR approach was quite powerful in detecting non-uniform DIF (Rogers & Swaminathan, 1993; Swaminathan & Rogers, 1990 ).\nIn the LR process, item responses are used as dependent variables, and group variable (reference=1 and focus=0), total score calculated for each individual, group and total score-group interaction are included in the models as independent variables. With this method, the DIF based on the relationship between item response and total score is determined, whereas the type of DIF is determined with the testing of the group and group total score interaction (Zumbo, 1999) . By comparing the regression coefficients and the fit indices of the three different models obtained by the addition of this independent variable to the model, information about item bias and the significance level of this bias is obtained."}, {"section_title": "Gender Differentiation in Mathematic Achievement", "text": "Numerous studies at national and international level have reported gender differentiation in mathematics performance. Analyses of NAEP data revealed a small but persistent gender gap in scores (Lubienski, McGraw, & Strutchens, 2004; McGraw, Lubienski, & Strutchens, 2006) . Analyses of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study showed no gender gap at the beginning of kindergarten. However, a gender gap began to form during the early elementary years. In fact, this gender gap favored boys by third grade (Fryer & Levitt, 2010; Robinson & Lubienski, 2011) . Kane and Mertz (2012) examined the gender differences in countries' mathematical performances from the large-scale tests such as TIMSS and PISA, and found that these gender differences occurred in many countries.\nTurkey's PISA results indicate obvious achievement differences between boys and girls. Girls show a better performance than boys in science and reading whereas boys perform better in mathematics than girls (OECD, 2014a) . While the study emphasized that there was no significant difference between the genders in terms of achievement in elementary school, they also revealed that the gender difference in mathematics and science began in middle school. In middle school, girls' mathematics achievement, in particular, displayed an apparent drop (Sanders & Nelson, 2004) . In many studies conducted in recent years, examination of the reasons behind the differences in achievement has gained importance. It was emphasized that different characteristics such as race, socio-economic status, affective and cognitive characteristics could be the reason for this difference (Harris & Herrington, 2006; Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 2005) . For example, Gallagher et al. (2000) reported that boys were more flexible in applying problem-solving strategies than girls. Girls abided by the in-class learning steps more than boys. They showed this as the source of differentiation between the performances.\nIn the education reforms and specifically in reforms in the mathematics education, the importance of raising individuals who can think, understand and establish cause and effect relationships and who have mathematical ability is emphasized for the future (National Research Council, 2001) To be able to raise individuals with these qualities, the teaching and the materials used in teaching are expected to be valid, reliable and appropriate to the student level. It is important to determine the factors leading to differences amongst individuals with similar performances. In this way, students can be evaluated fairly, and the right decisions can be made about them."}, {"section_title": "Student Characteristics as Potential Sources", "text": "Mathematical anxiety, one of the affective characteristics discussed in this study, involves anxiety and tension felt by the student in his or her daily and academic life while dealing with subjects based on mathematics (Vahedi & Farrokhi, 2011) . Having difficulty in mathematics can be caused not only by the student's inadequacy in mathematical learning but also by mathematics anxiety (Maloney & Beilock, 2012; Vukovic, Kieffer, Bailey, & Harari, 2013) . Mathematics anxiety can have a negative effect on mathematics performance. The student with anxiety has less confidence in solving math problems and feels inadequate. This negatively affects the student's future mathematics performance (Vahedi & Farrokhi, 2011) . The results of studies on Western societies revealed that girls have math anxiety at higher levels compared to boys (Else-Ques, Hyde, & Linn, 2010; Frenzel, Pekrun, & Goetz, 2007; Goetz et al., 2013) . Goetz et al. (2013) determined that girls had lower perceived competence than boys even though they had the same average grades in mathematics. Parallel to this finding, girls reported higher levels of anxiety than boys.\nThe student's interest towards a subject involves indicators such as willingly participating in the class and believing that the subject is important for his or her career. As a student's interest level towards a subject increase, his or her ability to use cognitive processes also increases. According to the results of Lubinski and Benbow (2006) 's longitudinal study on how to increase students' interest towards mathematics, when the students' interest increases, the importance they gave to mathematics also increases. These students believe that mathematics has an important place in their future careers. While studies revealed very few gender gaps in mathematics interests and mathematics achievement between boys and girls in elementary school (Wigfield et al., 1997) , studies showed prominent gender gap when children reach adolescence and girls began to report less interest towards mathematics. In their study, Frenzel et al. (2007) found that boys were more interested in mathematics than girls. ies.ccsenet.org International Education Studies Vol. 12, No. 8; According to the results of studies conducted by using international data like TIMSS and PISA, boys had more positive attitudes towards mathematics than girls in almost all the participating countries (Else-Quest et al., 2010; Liu &Wilson 2009) . Girls consider mathematics as a male-dominated field, and they prefer the fields with more verbal cognitive processes.\nStudents' mathematics self-efficacy, as another affective characteristic, is also discussed in this study. Self-efficacy involves a person's task-specific, instead of general, perception, belief and expectation about one's own ability to achieve in a specific area (Bandura, 1997) . Self-efficacy is generally considered as a predictive characteristic that helps the student with his or her choices, effort in a subject and commitment in academic issues (Bandura, 1977) . Individuals with higher levels of self-efficacy attempt more cognitively challenging problems are more effortful, use productive problem-solving strategies and persist longer (Pajares, 1996; Pajares & Graham, 1999) . Studies reported that boys have higher self-efficacy in mathematics than girls whereas girls show higher self-efficacy in language arts (Meece, Glienke, & Burg, 2006; Siegle & Reis, 1998) .\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the differential item functioning of items in the PISA 2012 mathematics test for the gender using HGLM and LR approaches and to obtain expert opinions on item bias.\nFurthermore, potential sources were tested by HGLM."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "The research consists of two parts: quantitative and qualitative.

Evaluations were made using the common findings. Uniform and non-uniform DIF were detected.\nFor logistic regression analysis, three-step regression equation was created based on total score and group variable, and group variable and total score interaction according to student performance. Then, items with DIF were detected by testing the differences between the chi-square values of models (\u0394\u03c7 2 (3-1) and \u0394\u03c72 (2-1) ) and the regression coefficients in each step.\nThe data obtained from the tests performed on students in the field of education shows a multi-level structure. Students in the same classroom and school can be affected by similar characteristics. Since this assumption is not taken into consideration in analyses based on traditional regression method, there is a probability of higher risk error. The PISA sample is selected based on a stratified sample structure. Therefore, this study used Hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM) method. According to this approach, the item is at the lower level of the hierarchical level. The probability of student answering the items in the test is affected from each other. Also, each answer is influenced by the student's characteristics. The likelihood of responding to item may vary according to the student characteristics.\nIn HGLM, only items that are coded as dummy were added to Level 1. In Level 2, two-category group indicator variable was added to each equation.

Table 2 includes the results of LR. It was found that six items have DIF. Uniform and non-uniform DIF were identified by examining the differences between the chi-square values \u0394\u03c7 2 (3-1) and \u0394\u03c72 (2-1) in Table 2 . Accordingly, six items (item 1, item 2, item 3, item 4, item 7 and item 9) displayed uniform DIF. Four of them are significant at the level of 0.01. It was also determined that the same six items presented non-uniform DIF. Four items are significant at the level of 0.01. The significance levels of the items with DIF were examined based on differentiation between R 2 s. Gierl, Jodoin, & Ackerman (2000) expressed 0.035 as the criterion value. The values were smaller than 0.035. Therefore, the magnitude of DIF was not significant. Vol. 12, No. 8; DIF findings obtained using the HGLM method is presented in Table 3 . In HGLM analysis, one item needs to be defined as the reference item. In the study, item 13 was identified as the reference item. According to Table 3 , two items were significant at the 0.01 level, and one item was significant at the 0.05 level. In other words, these items displayed DIF, while item 7 and item 9 works in favor of boys, item 4 works in favor of girls. The common items 4, 7 and 9 were determined to display DIF based on logistic regression and HGLM.\nWhen the structural and content characteristics of the items were examined: The items' difficulty values were 0.715, 0.806, 1.855, -2.885, -0.795, -0.955, 0.602, 1.013, 2.845, 0.004, 0.436, 4.815 and 0.616 respectively. Item 5 has an easy item difficulty degree and Item 7 has a medium item difficulty degree whereas Item 9 has a difficult item difficulty degree.\nIn favor of girls, Item 4 is an item requiring reading graphics where the student needs to compare different situations. Cognitive characteristic of the item is interpretation. The item's subject is uncertainty. The item's context is social.\nIn favor of boys, Item 7 aims to measure student's ability to calculate percentages which is based on real life situations. Cognitive characteristic of the item is employment. The item's mathematical subject is determining quantity. The item's context is scientific.\nIn favor of boys, Item 9 aims to measure student's problem-solving ability on subjects of reduction of fuel consumption and cost which are based on real life situations. Cognitive characteristic of the item is formulation. The item's mathematical subject is change and relations. The item's context is scientific.\nIn the last step of the study, a second model was developed in order to determine the sources of DIF and how magnitude of DIF changed according to selected variables. At this time, the gender variable, which was in the first model, was kept constant and the other three variables were added to the model (ANXMAT, INTMAT, MATHEFF). Table 4 shows how the beta coefficient changed when other variables were added to the model. The findings revealed that the Items 4, 7 and 9 which were found to display DIF according to gender still displayed DIF when the three variables were added to the model. When student's anxiety level increased, the probability of the student answering correctly decreased for Item 2 (-0.242, se=0.113 p=0.033), Item 3 (-0.253, se=0.124, p=0.042) and Item 11 (-0.444, se=0.111, p=0 .000). Student's interest only increased in Item 7's correct answering probability (0.260, se=0.113, p=0.022) . In PISA, the student's self-efficacy for mathematics is determined by the student's confident level. As the student's MATHEFF level increased in Item 1 se=0.122, se=0.115, p=0.006) , the probability of the student answering the question correctly decreased whereas in item 11 (0.260, se=0.126, p=0.038) , this probability increased.\nAfter the comparison of the methods used in determining DIF, 14 experts were asked about item bias according to gender.

For this purpose, whether the probability of answering the 13 items in the test was differentiated or not was tested for gender using hierarchical generalized linear models and logistic regression approach. According to the literature, the DIF sources were examined in terms of the anxiety, interest and self-efficacy variables. The disappearance of DIF was also examined. Then, expert opinions were taken to prove the item bias.\nThe study results have been reached after taking certain steps. First, logistic regression approach and then HGLM was used. Six items displayed DIF in logistic regression approach whereas three items presented DIF in HGLM. DIF in logistic regression approach, a traditional approach, is based on the interpretation of chi-square values. Chi-square value is affected by the sample size (Zumbo, 2009 Vol. 12, No. 8; found biased in logistic regression approach. The reason why the HGLM method was preferred is because the sample structure in large scale test applications such as PISA shows a stratified structure. When the probability of answering the item is taken into consideration, the probability of a student answering an item might be affected by the student's own characteristics (Raudenbush & Bryke, 2002) . Here, while the first level is made up of answers given to the items, the second level is made up of student characteristics. Another important point in the analysis based on DIF is to examine the DIF size. When DIF sizes of the six items were examined according to the related criteria, the magnitude of DIF was found small. However, three items were found to display DIF in both of the analysis methods. For this reason, the analysis was continued and the steps were followed on these three common substances.\nOne of the three items with DIF was in favor of girls. The content of this item was based on reading and interpreting graphs about the change in music bands' album sales throughout the year. The vast majority of experts did not determine the item as being biased. Those who found the item biased believed that there might be a problem with the context of the item.\nThe items in favor of boys were mostly based on daily life. They were also at problem-solving application and formulation level. Gallagher et al. (2000) found that girls in particular strictly follow learning-based steps in the classroom, and they insist on applying these steps when they are faced with a problem situation. In addition, male students are more flexible in using problem-solving strategies and can try different ways to solve a problem. Studies conducted by Geary (1996) and Halpern (2000) support the previous finding. According to these studies, girls are successful in algebra, which is a part of mathematics that has a certain structural language. However, their performances tend to decrease in large-scale tests which include high risk and in which the content differ from the education program. Half of the experts determined these two items to be biased rather than the item in favor of girls and emphasized the context of the items were more associated with male professions. While the items in favor of boys were at medium and hard difficulty level, they required problem-solving ability based on daily life. Studies have shown that male students are more advantageous in problem solving in geometry, cause-effect determination and spatial situations in nature (Geary, 1996; Hyde, Fennema & Lamon, 1990 ). In addition, as the item difficulty increases, they are more disadvantaged in terms of mathematics performance (Bielinski & Davidson, 2001; Penner, 2003) .\nAs a result of the addition of mathematics anxiety, mathematics interest and mathematics self-efficacy variables to the model, DIF was not eliminated according to gender, instead only minor changes were observed.\nSince the results of large-scale testing applications such as PISA, TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) and PIRLS (The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) lead countries' education policies, the tests used in these applications should be valid and reliable. Researchers can examine the psychometric properties of these large-scale tests by taking into account the different characteristics of the student or the country. Also DIF sources according to gender can be examined by variables at the teacher and school levels."}]
