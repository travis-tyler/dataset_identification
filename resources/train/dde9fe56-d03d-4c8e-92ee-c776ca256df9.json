[21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Some of us recently proposed a hypothetical model describing the temporal evolution of these 5 biomarkers over the entire adult lifespan of an individual who develops AD dementia. 27 This model is based on the assumption that different AD biomarkers do not change in an identical fashion over time but rather in an ordered and sequential manner and likewise approach a pathological level in an ordered manner. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] This was proposed as a hypothetical model with validation awaiting additional data.\nThis hypothetical model can be divided into 2 conceptual components. The first is the order in which each biomarker significantly departs from normal (which was addressed in an earlier article 33 ). The second conceptual component, which is the subject of this article, is the shape of the trajectory of each biomarker curve as the disease progresses. The trajectory shape can be envisioned from a plot of each biomarker where the horizontal axis represents clinical disease severity and the vertical axis represents the degree of abnormality of each biomarker, from most normal to most abnormal. In our model, we hypothesized that biomarker trajecto-ries have a sigmoid shape. 27 For reasons described later, we did not directly test for sigmoid-shaped trajectories in this article. Rather, we evaluated the shape of biomarker curves by modeling the baseline and longitudinal within-subject rate of change in 5 AD biomarkers as a function of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, adjusted for age, in 2 large cohorts separately for APOE \u03b54 noncarriers and carriers. Then, as illustrated in Figure 1 , we tested for evidence of nonzero, nonlinear, nonconstant, and interaction terms in baseline values and within-subject rates of biomarker change based on longitudinal values."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PARTICIPANTS AND DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION", "text": "Two separate cohorts were created by pooling data from 2 Mayo Clinic studies and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

At baseline, all participants met diagnostic criteria for being cognitively normal or having MCI or AD dementia. 35 Clinical disease severity was scored with the MMSE. 36 For Mayo Clinic participants, a 38-point test, the Short Test of Mental Status, 37 was converted to MMSE scores using an algorithm developed at our center. 38 Short Test of Mental Status values transformed to MMSE scores are reported simply as MMSE scores throughout the article.\nWhile we wished to maximize sample size, we also recognized that all participants within a cohort must have every biomarker test result to perform valid within-cohort comparisons. None of the Mayo Clinic participants had CSF samples taken, while many more Mayo than ADNI participants had amyloid PET studies available. We therefore created 2 cohorts, whom we refer to as the CSF/MRI cohort and the PET/MRI cohort. The CSF/MRI cohort included only ADNI participants and was used to evaluate trajectories of hippocampal volume, CSF A\u242442 level, and CSF total tau level. The PET/MRI cohort included both ADNI and Mayo participants and was used to evaluate trajectories of hippocampal volume, amyloid PET with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), and FDG-PET.

For each biomarker, the model always included terms for baseline age, baseline MMSE score, change in age from baseline, and change in MMSE score from baseline. Using this model parameterization, the baseline MMSE score term allowed us to assess the baseline, or cohort-level, relationship between biomarker and MMSE score while the change in MMSE score term allowed us to assess the withinsubject rates of biomarker change with worsening MMSE score. The age terms were included as a necessary adjustment to impose the correct ordering of a subject's visits over time.\nAs a first step in model fitting, baseline age and baseline MMSE score were fit as a restricted cubic spline with knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles. If the P value from a likelihood ratio test comparing the spline fit with the linear fit was less than P = .10, the nonlinear effects were retained. Otherwise, they were kept as linear terms. We next fit a full model for each biomarker with all 2-way interactions between baseline MMSE score, baseline age, change in MMSE score, and change in age to test for significant interactions but only retained interactions with P \u03fd .10 in the final models. Interactions with baseline age and baseline MMSE score or change in MMSE score allowed us to assess if the biomarker-MMSE score relationship depends on age. An interaction term with baseline MMSE score and change in MMSE score allowed us to assess if the within-subject rates of biomarker change depend on the level of disease severity (ie, are nonconstant over disease severity). Nine possible prototype models based on different baseline shapes and longitudinal change are shown in Figure 1 .\nRandom intercepts and slopes for change in age and change in MMSE score were included when possible. All models were adjusted for sex. Hippocampal volume models were additionally adjusted for total intracranial volume. Because of the known effect of APOE on rates of cognitive change, 50 separate models were fit within APOE \u03b54 noncarriers and carriers for each biomarker.\nFor each participant, all available times where all biomarker tests were performed were used in the models. Because of differences in when each biomarker was collected, this reduced the amount of follow-up used for some biomarkers (MRI and FDG), but it was necessary to use only those visits where all biomarkers were available within a cohort so that all biomarkers would be evaluated on equal footing."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The CSF/MRI cohort (111 cognitively normal, 154 with MCI, and 78 with AD) was composed entirely of ADNI participants; all 343 had baseline data and 262 had longitudinal data ( Table 1) .

Each biomarker value is plotted in its native units, with the vertical axis oriented so that increasing values correspond to worsening. Similarly, the x-axis is oriented so that left to right movement corresponds to worsening cognition.

The middle and right columns illustrate the shape of the curve based on the baseline effects (dotted) and the within-subject rates of biomarker change based on longitudinal data (solid) vs MMSE score for APOE \u03b54 noncarriers (middle column) and carriers (right column) from the model estimates. Within-subject rates of change are shown as an average change in biomarker for a 3-point MMSE score worsening. Nonzero terms indicate biomarker values that change with worsening MMSE score. Nonlinear terms indicate baseline effects that are nonlinear (most often saturating or plateauing) with advancing MMSE score. Interaction terms indicate that the relationship between biomarker and MMSE score depends on baseline age. Nonconstant terms indicate that the within-subject rate of change depends on baseline MMSE score or disease severity. Significant nonlinear, interaction, and nonconstant terms imply a nonzero relationship with biomarker and MMSE score. Significant terms from the models summarized in Figure 2 and Figure 3 are displayed in Table 2 . Figure 2 illustrates biomarkers vs MMSE score in the CSF/ MRI cohort.

A cross-sectional age effect in the CSF A\u2424 model was unexpected in that CSF A\u2424 values decreased/worsened as ages increased from 70 to 78 years and then increased for older ages. The longitudinal effects were that within-subject rates in hippocampal volume worsened (ie, nonzero slope) as MMSE score worsened in both APOE \u03b54-negative and -positive participants (P = .004 and P \u03fd .001) ( Table 2) . Within-subject rates of A\u242442 worsened (ie, nonzero slope) as MMSE score worsened in APOE \u03b54-positive participants only (P = .04). The within-subject total tau rate changed as MMSE score worsened (ie, nonzero slope) for APOE \u03b54-positive participants only (P = .007) but the rate of change depended on baseline age. Figure 3 shows biomarkers vs MMSE score in the PET/ MRI cohort. The baseline effects were that hippocampal volumes in APOE \u03b54-negative participants and FDG in APOE \u03b54-positive participants worsened (ie, nonzero slope) with lower MMSE scores (P \u03fd .001) ( Table 2 ). The relationship with biomarker and baseline MMSE score for both PiB-and FDG-PET in APOE \u03b54-negative participants depended on baseline age (P = .04 and P = .08). Baseline hippocampal volume and amyloid PET values worsened in APOE \u03b54-positive participants with lower MMSE scores but the effect plateaued at lower MMSE values (ie, nonlinear slope) (P = .005 and P = .009). The longitudinal effects were that within-subject rates of change in hippocampal volume worsened (ie, nonzero slope) as MMSE score worsened (P = .03) in APOE \u03b54-negative participants (Table 2) . In APOE \u03b54-positive participants, within-subject rates of change in hippocampal volume also worsened as MMSE score worsened, but this effect depended on baseline age (P = .001). Within-subject rates of change in PiB-PET decreased (ie, nonzero slope) as MMSE score worsened in APOE \u03b54-positive participants (P = .03) but not in APOE \u03b54-negative participants.

We selected PiB more than 1.4 SUVR as the cut point. This reflects a lenient cut point but one that still likely eliminated individuals clearly not on the AD pathophysiological pathway. Using data from an analysis of 41 subjects who had PiB and CSF measured on the same visit, 51 we used linear regression to identify the CSF A\u242442 cut point that corresponded to PiB more than 1.4 SUVR as being 209 pg/mL.

Figure 4 illustrates biomarkers vs MMSE score in the amyloid-positive participants. Because the range of amyloid values was truncated by design in this subgroup analysis, we did not create trajectory plots for PiB-PET or CSF A\u242442 level and limited the plots to MRI, CSF tau level, and FDG. Significant effects in the amyloid-positive cohorts are summarized in Table 4 . While many findings were the same between the amyloid-positive cohorts and the entire sample, there were some differences. In the amyloidpositive CSF/MRI cohort, baseline hippocampal volume increased nonlinearly, ie, plateaued at lower MMSE values in APOE \u03b54 carriers. Within-subject hippocampal volume was nonconstant (rates of atrophy decelerated at higher MMSE scores) in APOE \u03b54 noncarriers. In the amyloid-positive PET/MRI cohort, baseline hippocampal volume and FDG-PET increased nonlinearly, ie, plateaued at lower MMSE values in APOE \u03b54 noncarriers. Within-subject change was nonzero for FDG-PET in APOE \u03b54 noncarriers. There was also an interaction between baseline age and baseline MMSE score in the hippocampal volume model for the APOE \u03b54 noncarriers."}, {"section_title": "COMMENT", "text": "Our major findings were the following: (1) Overall, biomarker trajectory shapes were complex and affected by interactions with age and APOE status.

(6) Trajectories for a given biomarker were often different in APOE \u03b54 carriers vs noncarriers in the overall samples. This was less often so in the amyloid-positive subsamples. (7) While most findings were the same between the amyloid-positive cohorts and the entire sample, there was a slightly greater tendency toward nonlinear baseline effects in amyloidpositive participants. Our hypothetical biomarker model 27 predicts that each biomarker follows a sigmoid-shaped trajectory. The rationale for this prediction starts with the assumption that the rate of change of a biomarker denoting accumulating AD pathophysiology in the brain should be zero from birth through at least early adulthood. At some point, eg, age 50 years to 70 years, AD biomarkers deflect from the normal baseline and begin to become abnormal, which by definition represents acceleration in rate. Based on prior evidence that some biomarker rates of change (ie, amyloid PET, CSF A\u242442 level, and total tau level) do not accelerate in the dementia phase of the disease, 31, 52 we presumed that biomarker rates do not continue to accelerate indefinitely but instead begin to saturate or plateau at some point, which represents deceleration. An initial period of acceleration followed later by deceleration defines a trajectory that is approximately sigmoidal, with the midpoint of the curve defined as the initiation of deceleration. A second reason to suspect that biomarkers should follow a sigmoid-shaped trajectory relates to sensitivity limits of any measurement technique at extremes. Floor and ceiling measurement sensitivity effects impart a sigmoid shape to a data distribution.\nSources outside the field of human biomarker studies suggest that amyloid and neurodegenerative biomarkers might follow a sigmoid-shaped function. Ingelsson et al 28 found in human autopsy studies that amyloid accumulation plateaus with increasing disease duration. Tau fibrillization follows a sigmoid-shaped function with time in vitro. 53, 54 A cumulative damage model of neurodegenerative disease where the risk of cell death in the vulnerable population of cells changes over time predicts a sigmoid-shaped trajectory of neurodegenerative brain atrophy. 55, 56 Reports from analyses of ADNI data draw somewhat inconsistent conclusions about the shapes of biomarker trajectories. Caroli and Frisoni 57 analyzed crosssectional ADNI data and found that mean baseline hippocampal volume, CSF A\u242442, and CSF tau data could be better modeled as a function of worsening cognition with sigmoid-shaped curves compared with linear fits. Lo et al 58 examined rates of change of biomarkers in ADNI participants and illustrated deceleration in CSF A\u242442 levels but acceleration in hippocampal atrophy rates with advancing disease. Schuff et al 59 found acceleration in atrophy rates in ADNI subjects with MCI and AD. Sabuncu et al 60 examined brain atrophy rates in ADNI participants who had an AD-like CSF profile. They found that atrophy rates in a set of AD signature regions of interest exhibit early acceleration followed by deceleration, which was consistent with a sigmoid-shaped curve. Conversely, they found rates of hippocampal volume loss exhibited positive acceleration.\nIn the present study, we fit the models in such a way that would allow us to assess the shape of the biomarker trajectories without imposing a particular structure (ie, a sigmoid shape) on the data. Flexible restricted cubic splines allowed for nonlinearity if there was evidence for it. Interaction terms allowed for biomarker-MMSE score relationships to depend on covariates. This way of modeling let the data \"speak for themselves\" and was preferred in this study because of several important limitations in the nature of the data. (1) The right-and left-hand portions of a sigmoid curve are where the maximum inflection occurs and thus the portions of the function where data are most needed to detect acceleration and deceleration. Unfortunately, our data are sparse in these regions. In participants with abnormal biomarkers at baseline, we have no data that would allow us to characterize the initial deviation of biomarkers from their normal baseline. The righthand tail is equally problematic in that many patients survive a decade or more after the clinical diagnosis of AD dementia is made, but most stop participating in clinical research studies once they develop moderate dementia. Indeed, the subjects with AD in our samples had only mild dementia (median MMSE score of 24 for the CSF/MRI co- Table 4 . Summary of All Baseline and Within-Subject Effects That Were Significant (P\u03fd.10) in the Linear Mixed-Effects Models Among the Amyloid-Positive Subgroup a hort and 23 for the PET/MRI cohort). (2) The median follow-up time in our data was only about 1 year with a maximum of only 4 years. This is a small fraction of the total duration of the disease, which may span 30 years or more. Examining such a small window of time in each subject makes it difficult to detect acceleration or deceleration in within-subject rates. (3) We lacked a linear clinical measure of disease progression. Every cognitive testing instrument has a nonlinear response function with both floor and ceiling effects. 50, 61 Because subjects spanning the cognitive continuum were combined to estimate biomarker trajectories, a single universal cognitive test was needed to index all subjects on a common axis. The MMSE score was the best option that was available in all ADNI and Mayo subjects. However, the limited range of the MMSE score in cognitively normal participants (roughly 30-27) in particular made estimation of trajectory shape early in the disease particularly problematic. In many of our cognitively normal participants, MMSE scores did not change or fluctuated randomly from 1 point to the next.\nOur results do not disagree with sigmoid-shaped biomarker trajectories in that most biomarkers worsened as MMSE score worsened in both baseline and longitudinal analyses, which is consistent with the middle, roughly linear, portion of a sigmoid curve. While crosssectional data may be influenced by cohort effects, we did see some baseline effects that were consistent with a sigmoid-shaped trajectory (ie, baseline effects that plateaued with worsening MMSE scores). However, we found nonconstant within-subject rates in only 1 analysis. Several prior studies (including one of our own) have shown that rates of brain atrophy accelerate prior to incident dementia. [62] [63] [64] [65] However, these earlier MRI studies had considerably more within-subject longitudinal data than we had in the present study. Our failure to detect acceleration or deceleration in within-subject MRI rates may well be due to limited longitudinal data because we only used those times in individual participants where all biomarkers were available.\nAlzheimer disease biomarkers are poised to become an essential component of a comprehensive assessment of the disease. In particular, AD biomarkers constitute a major (some would say only) window into the disease in its long preclinical phase. Designing clinical trials in early symptomatic and preclinical disease will depend on acquiring a thorough understanding of the longitudinal trajectory of AD biomarkers. In addition, the notion of biomarker trajectories is central to the staging proposed in the recent preclinical AD research criteria. 66 However, creating reliable models that accurately describe the full trajectory shapes of AD biomarkers will require significant additional longitudinal data in individual participants beginning prior to deviation of biomarkers from normality through the end stage of the disease and ultimately to autopsy. Ideally, these data would be acquired in well-defined epidemiological cohorts. "}, {"section_title": "Accepted for", "text": ""}]
