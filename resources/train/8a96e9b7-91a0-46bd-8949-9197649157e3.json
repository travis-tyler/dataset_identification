The need for such activities has been driven by two major changes in drug discovery: increased productivity and the focus on novel drug targets not yet pharmacologically proven in man. Availability of the complete genome sequence of humans and the partial ability to deduce probable gene function informatically and experimentally has increased the number of potential drug targets from the 500 or so that underlie our current pharmacopeia 1 to potentially tens of thousands. Only a small minority of these potential targets have been pharmacologically proven in human disease. Combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening ensure that small molecules interacting with a substantial majority of these potential drug targets can be devised in a matter of few years and optimized by increasingly standardized methods. Humanized monoclonal antibodies provide still another source of readily developed therapeutic agents against virtually any cloned protein target, whether or not its function in human disease is understood. As a result, the sheer volume of potential drug candidates is providing a challenge to development organizations that must really on laborintensive, increasingly expensive clinical trials to identify which of these candidates can become drugs, and ultimately products.\nDrug development in humans has always provided special challenges because of inescapable practical, ethical, and regulatory constraints. This was true even when discovery organizations focused on incremental improvements -\"me-too\" drugs directed against targets whose relationship to human disease had already been established. Whereas preclinical validation is conducted in isogenic animals reared under identical conditions, development is conducted on outbred populations with equally heterogeneous lifestyles. Treatment in animal models commences at a precise interval after induction of an identical provocative lesion, whereas developmental testing occurs in naturally occurring disease of variable severity and duration. Treated animals can be sacrificed for examination of pathology and effects of treatment, using endpoints directly related to the induced pathology.\nIn contrast, ethical constraints require noninvasive measurements in humans. Drugs can only be registered if they demonstrate improvement in the less direct measures of clinical improvement and quality of life. The resulting variability requires sample sizes of hundreds or thousands of human subjects, rather than the dozens required for studies in animals. Costs are further in-creased by the regulatory requirements for tamper-proof locked databases. Instead of the multiple small iterative experiments typical in discovery laboratories, traditional development relies on relatively few meticulously preplanned large trials, with few opportunities for midcourse corrections informed by emerging data.\nNevertheless, the traditional paradigm of phase 1-4 studies was adequate to the task of developing the relative trickle of candidates that used to emerge from discovery laboratories, especially because the majority of the drug targets were well understood and development and regulatory strategies were well established. Although translational research may have been useful in this bygone era, it was hardly necessary. Even then, proposals were made to reshape the drug development paradigm into a \"learn and confirm\" paradigm, that encouraged more exploratory studies in early development, 2 a harbinger of what we now refer to as translational research. Such a paradigm was not accepted then because of concerns that it would have resulted in unnecessary expense and delay to market. In the era of \"me-too drugs\" the likelihood of efficacy was relatively high. The paramount concern was speed to market. This is no longer the case given the risks inherent in not being certain that the target is relevant to human disease. In recent years, only 9% of compounds that entered phase 1 survived to launch. Over 50% of this attrition resulted from failure to demonstrate efficacy in phase 2 studies, a 15% increase in phase 2 failures over the last decade. Compounds that worked beautifully on cloned human proteins and in animal models more often than not proved ineffective in human disease.\nExperience demonstrated that behavior of a compound in an patient cannot be predicted perfectly from interactions with isolated human molecules or cells in vitro, nor from animal models.\nSignificant metabolic pathways in laboratory animals may be minor or redundant in humans. Animals models are not identical to human disease. In no other therapeutic area is that more true than for diseases of the CNS, demonstrably the organ system most uniquely distinguishing humans from laboratory animals. Indeed, only 3-5% of CNS candidates ever become marketed therapeutics. Waiting for demonstration of efficacy in a traditional phase 2 study is becoming an increasingly costly proposition. Further risk reduction is necessary before embarking on lengthy and expensive phase 2 trials using registrable endpoints on samples of the broadly defined populations that the target product profile aims for. Developing the tools for as well as execution of this risk reduction is the role of translational research.\nIn the largest sense, translational research could be taken to encompass the entire breadth of medicine: diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Such a definition is not helpful. For industrial translational research to be a practicable, nonduplicative addition to the current activities of integrated pharmaceutical companies, it is critical that the mission is focused sharply and its deliverables be defined clearly. There is no better way of defining the focus than by examining the root causes of failure in drug development in this era of novel, unproven targets. Drug candidates fail for one of four major reasons:\n1) The compound is given to the wrong subjects.\n2) The compound is given at the wrong dose or schedule.\n3) The favorable effects of the compound are not detected.\n4) The compound has a significant effect in laboratory species, but not in humans.\nIt is the mission of translational research to minimize the risk associated with the first three causes of failure and to permit efficient identification of the fourth, to ensure that the resources required for development and registration are allocated optimally."}, {"section_title": "WHAT PATIENTS WILL RESPOND TO THE DRUG? PATIENT IDENTIFICATION/STRATIFICATION BIOMARKERS", "text": "Animal models are imperfect predictors of human efficacy Before a compound is judged suitable for testing in humans, it must first demonstrate safety and efficacy in animal models. The increasingly high failure rates of CNS compounds in human trials has demonstrated that this success in animals is no guarantee. No animal model is a perfect mimic of human disease. Animals can serve as models of disease mechanisms, but not of the disease itself. Arguably, nowhere is the disparity greater than for neuropsychiatric diseases. Failure rates in clinical development attest to the disparity.\nGiven our imperfect understanding of the pathophysiology of most neuropsychiatric diseases, the best guide is past experience with predecessor compounds that impact the same target or metabolic pathway. In psychiatric diseases, pharmacology has driven the science. The serendipitous observation that putative antimalarials calmed inmates of a psychiatric asylum let to the dopamine theory of schizophrenia and the serotonin theory of depression and anxiety. These theories remain the mainstay of the animal models used for preclinical validation. Although predictive for certain classes of compounds, such an approach is inherently circular and limiting. It is likely that there is more to the major psychoses than either direct or indirect failure of these two transmitter systems.\nEven in diseases where there is a greater mechanistic understanding, there are still significant disparities between the animal models used in discovery validation and the human diseases being targeted for treatment.\nTransgenic models of Alzheimer disease show relatively little neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, cognitive, or behavioral impairment. Multiple classes of compounds have proven effective in middle cerebral artery occlusion models of ischemic stroke, but almost all have failed in the clinic. Even in simple pain models, the discovery investigator can only observe the speed of withdrawal from painful stimuli, rather than pain itself.\nThe challenge of finding responsive human subjects is further compounded by the possibilities of disease heterogeneity. In all the aforementioned categories, we know that there are subtypes. Some of these may be pharmacologically relevant.\nIn the absence of previous pharmacological experience, how can translational research guide the choice of patients that may benefit from a novel putative therapeutic?"}, {"section_title": "GENETIC MUTATIONS IN HUMANS CAN HELP GUIDE CHOICE OF HUMAN SUBJECTS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH", "text": "A potential substitute for a pharmacologic challenge to a putative drug target is a mutation that modifies its activity. 3 Thus far, the greatest contribution of genetics to neurological drug discovery has been the support for the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer disease afforded by mutations of amyloid precursor protein or its metabolizing enzymes, presenilin 1 or 2. These mutations are found in affected individuals in rare families segregating an early-onset disorder that is clinically and histologically similar to the sporadic old age disease that is the intended target of these therapies. Transgenic animal models are used widely for preclinical evaluation of putative disease-modifying therapies for treatment of sporadic Alzheimer disease. Certain features of the human disease are mimicked more closely than others. 4, 5 The strong association of apolipoprotein E with propensity to sporadic Alzheimer disease has not influenced drug discovery as strongly despite the availability of animal models. 6, 7 However, interest of the pharmaceutical industry in these models has increased belatedly with the independent epidemiological demonstration of the relationship of cholesterol metabolites and statin treatment on the incidence of sporadic Alzheimer disease. 8, 9 These genetic insights into Alzheimer disease have already been accepted widely by drug discovery organizations. There remains an opportunity for translational research to bring the many other findings of neurogenetics to the pharmaceutical industry. This impact that has been relatively modest to date, especially given the prominent contribution that neuropsychiatric diseases have played in human genetics."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Monogenic disorders", "text": "There are two main reasons for this disparity. First is the rarity of the disorders for which simple Mendelian inheritance has allowed the ready identification of the causative mutation. A disproportionate number of diseases-about 200 neurologic diseases of the 500 in all categories for which the causative mutation has been identified by positional cloning-are neurological. 11 However, most of these diseases are individually rare, and thus not attractive markets for the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertheless, just as in the case of the rare Mendelian cases of early-onset Alzheimer disease, both discovery and translational research of these rare but well characterized disorders will provide insight to a broader category of human diseases. For example, single-gene mutations causing cognitive impairment in multiple mental retardation disorders can provide a molecularly proven insight into the molecular mechanisms of human cognition."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Complex disorders", "text": "The second reason for this disparity between the potential contribution from human genetics and its uptake by the pharmaceutical industry is that the psychiatric disorders that have provided most of the market for CNS drugs are heritable not as simple Mendelian traits, but in complex inheritance patterns. In the previous decade, the pharmaceutical industry spent millions of research dollars sponsoring association and linkage studies of common disorders, perhaps expecting a pay-off as rapid as that in genetic studies of single-gene Mendelian disorders. It was not that simple. The pay-offs are only now beginning to come in, and slowly at that. A combination of multiple genes and environmental influences contribute to susceptibility to schizophrenia, the depressive disorders, attention disorders, autism as well as some neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis. Just as was the case with apolipoprotein E, the lack of a clear cause and effect relationship hindered the development of animal models. More importantly, even though genetic associations have been demonstrated in these complex disorders, the genetic loci identified in genetic studies of complex disorders are too large to permit definitive identification of a specific gene, without corroborating biological evidence."}, {"section_title": "13-15", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Schizophrenia", "text": "Nevertheless, there have been some recent successes, several of them achieved by adding biological information from transcriptional profiling to standard genetic analyses. These combined approaches offer a more promising approach for translational research in pharmaceutical organizations than the more open-ended genehunting genetic studies of the previous decade. 16, 17 Comparison of transcriptional profiles of prefrontal cortices harvested from schizophrenics and matched controls demonstrated a selective decrease of transcripts encoding proteins involved in presynaptic functioning, albeit variable among subjects. These findings were corroborated by in situ hybridization. The most consistently diminished transcripts were those for synapsin 2 and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, 18 a protein involved in the recycling of vesicles. 19 Further support for the role of synapsin 2 in schizophrenia came from both case control and transmission disequilibrium studies demonstrating association of synapsin 2 haplotypes with schizophrenia in population and family studies. 20 Another transcriptional profiling analysis with a limited number of candidate schizophrenia genes demonstrated a 2.6-fold increase in expression of apoproteinL1, 21 a high-density lipoprotein known to be encoded on chromosome 12q12, previously demonstrated to be a high-susceptibility locus for schizophrenia.\nPromising leads have come from other approaches as well. Mutations of proline dehydrogenase contribute to susceptibility to schizophrenia in some individuals. 22, 23 Transmission disequilibrium analysis has demonstrated association of schizophrenia with the PPPeCC gene and the calcineurin \u2425 catalytic subunit. 24 These findings are intriguing given the observation of Miakawa 25 that mice with forebrain-specific conditional knockout of calcineurin had behavioral difficulties similar to those of schizophrenia. Variation in the epsin-4 gene, which encodes the clathrin-associated protein enthroprotin 26 (with a role in the stability of synaptic vesicles) and is in linkage disequilibrium with a locus conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia. The finding of a translocation in a family with mental and behavioral disorder DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1) 27 were followed by linkage with chromosome in schizophrenics. 28, 29 Associations with schizophrenia have also been found with variants in nicotonic acetylcholine receptor 7 and diminution of prepulse inhibition 30 as well as with variants in neuregulin 1."}, {"section_title": "31,32", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Other psychiatric disorders", "text": "Genetic studies of depression have identified multiple susceptibility loci, but many of these have proven difficult to reproduce. Of these, the most promising leads are polymorphisms in the FK binding protein 5 gene that plays a role in the stress hormone-regulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, associated with a faster response to drug treatment and increased recurrence of depressive episodes. 33 Recently, a mutation in the tryptophan hydroxylase gene has been found in individuals with unipolar major depression. 34 Similar promising leads have been found in attention deficit disorder. 35 In summary, although the many pharmaceutical companies have been discouraged by the poor return on investment in their initial genetic studies of neuropsychiatric disorders, a small proportion of these studies have begun to yield specific information that may be directly applicable to drug discovery and to the identification of biomarkers identifying susceptible patients. Identification of mutations allows the production of transgenic mouse models and small interfering RNA knockdowns for preclinical validation by discovery biologists. Clinical and biological investigation of patients with these causative or predisposing mutations is likely to be a fertile area for translational research."}, {"section_title": "Choice of patients/subjects: presymptomatic disease", "text": "Development of disease-modifying therapy for neurodegenerative disorders is hampered by late diagnosis. Many neurodegenerative diseases cannot be diagnosed clinically until after substantial tissue loss has occurred. 36 -38 This provides a severe, possibly insurmountable, hurdle for novel disease modifying therapeutics. A useful endeavor for translational research is the development of reliable presymptomatic diagnosis that would allow institution of disease-modifying therapy prophylactically, before much tissue has been irretrievably lost.\nNeuroimaging provides an opportunity to identify early signs of neuronal dysfunction in a characteristic pattern, before the development of significant irreversible tissue atrophy. This was first demonstrated using resting glucose positron emission tomography (PET) technology in asymptomatic individuals carrying pathogenic mutations in families segregating autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer disease. 39 This finding was later extended to individuals at high risk for the development of typical late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease by virtue of their apolipoprotein E status and an affected first-degree relative. 40 These clinically healthy individuals demonstrated the same characteristic anatomical pattern of decreased glucose uptake as is seen in individuals with symptomatic Alzheimer disease, albeit with decreased severity, even though their age was up to two decades lower than the mean age of onset of dementia. Corroboration of this finding and searches for other methods of presymptomatic diagnosis by translational research would likely improve the chances of achieving efficacy with neuroprotective drugs."}, {"section_title": "Choice of patients/subjects: challenge models", "text": "Another approach to the translational goal of reducing patient heterogeneity in early clinical development of novel therapeutics is based not on the etiologic homogeneity discussed above, but on standardization of the timing and/or severity of the pathological insult that the drug candidate is intended to treat. Ethical considerations clearly preclude the induction of most pathologies in human beings, as is standard practice for animal validation experiments. However, for certain situations either naturally occurring or induced clinical models of disease do permit initial evaluation of novel therapeutics."}, {"section_title": "Challenge models for pain", "text": "A mainstay in the evaluation of analgesics for the initial evaluation of analgesics for inflammatory pain is extraction of third molars. 41 Volunteers are recruited from those individuals scheduled for such a procedure for therapeutic reasons. This model allows intervention at a precisely timed interval with respect to the lesion, typically after induction, but the model is also amenable to evaluation of prophylactic treatments. Other models create no lasting tissue damage and are sufficiently mild as to permit their induction in normal volunteers. Intradermal injection of capsaicin, 42 with or without the additional application of noxious heat, provides a standardized pain stimulus for the initial evaluation of analgesics. Such a lesion provides the additional advantage of producing easily identified and measurable areas of primary and secondary hyperalgesia, each of which is subserved by different neurological mechanisms, pharmacologically distinct. This model can be extended further by the use of occlusion to selectively eliminate input from large myelinated fibers. It is in these mechanistic studies that the capsacin volunteer model offers the greatest advantage for the evaluation of compounds targeting as yet unproven pain targets. A recently introduced variant of such testing involves oral administration of capsaicin. 43 Muscular pain can be modeled by injection of hypertonic saline. 44 Volunteer studies such as these can be extended by application of painful electrical stimuli. 45 The delivery of these stimuli can be graded not only in severity but also in frequency, providing quantifiable measurements of temporal summation and wind-up, important indicators of central sensitization, an important component of chronic neuropathic pain. 64 "}, {"section_title": "Stroke model in humans", "text": "Another potential model system is available for the study of stroke in humans. This is provided by the use of heart-lung bypass procedures necessary to support patients during certain types of cardiac surgery, such as coronary artery bypass. Depending on the center and the type of procedure, there is a 2-5% incidence of ischemic stroke in the first few hours of the procedure and recovery. An even higher risk group can be identified preoperatively by simple clinical criteria. 46 In this group, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning demonstrates a higher incidence of stroke than observed clinically. 47 Translational studies of neuroprotective compounds with this high risk group are likely to provide a useful method of risk reduction for putative neuroprotective drugs. Although very many compounds have proven effective in animal models of stroke, almost none have been successful clinically. In large part, the disparity between animal and human results can be attributed to an exquisite time dependence of such therapy. In traditional human stroke trials, patients are binned in large intervals-typically 3 or 6 h after the onset of stroke symptoms-to achieve enrollment goals. This introduces a great deal of variance in the results, a variance that is difficult to calculate precisely. Animal studies have uniformly shown that the earlier therapy begins, the more effective the treatment. Even a few minutes have a significant effect. Ideally, the drug is on board before the vessel is occluded.\nThe predictable high incidence of stroke in a narrowly defined temporal window in heart-lung bypass patients permits testing of neuroprotective agents either prophylactically or at a carefully predetermined interval after the injury. Translational studies using this model would test novel neuroprotectants in an ideal setting to judge the efficacy of neuroprotective compound in humans.

PHARMACODYNAMIC BIOMARKERS", "text": "Central to the success of any drug development project is ensuring that the drug reaches its target with the appropriate degree of saturation and for the appropriate duration. Because of fixed dosing as well as pharmacokinetic variation between human subjects, direct measurements of receptor occupancy are desirable. This is true in all therapeutic areas. However, development of CNS drugs poses the additional twin challenges of the blood brain barrier (impenetrable to the majority of drugs 68 ) and the inaccessibility of brain targets to direct measurements in vivo. 69 A useful undertaking for translational research for the development of CNS drugs is the development and execution of estimates of drug-receptor occupancy."}, {"section_title": "Receptor occupancy by ligand PET", "text": "Of these, the most direct is the use of PET 70 scanning using site-specific ligands radiolabeled to high specific activity with positron emitting isotopes-usually carbon 11 or fluorine 18. The high specific activity of such labels has the advantage that even miniscule, subpharmacologic doses of such ligands can register a signal detectable by a PET camera, providing a quantifiable three-dimensional image of receptor occupancy in the brain. The receptor occupancy required of the radioligand is so low that there is no physiological perturbation of the system. Radioligand PET can be used to estimate receptor occupancy of an unlabeled drug of interest, administered at pharmacologic doses, by measuring displacement of the radiolabeled tracer. Although expensive and laborious, when a suitable PET tracer is available, this is the procedure of choice for the estimation of drug receptor occupancy in the otherwise inaccessible CNS. Currently, there exist suitable PET radioligands for only a few dozen receptors, 71 limiting the generalizability of this procedure. Of the PET ligands currently available for displacement studies, the most widely used include: raclopride, for assessment of D2 dopamine receptor occupancy 72 ; WAY 100635, for detecting occupancy at the serotonin 1A receptor 71 ; and risperidone for 5HT2A receptors. 73 The utility of direct measurements of receptor occupancy by PET radioligand displacement is demonstrated by the example of F18 SPA-RQ, which labels the neurokinin 1 receptor, in the development of the centrally active antiemetic compound aprepitant. 74 -76 Demonstration of complete occupancy of the central NK1 receptor with an intermediate dosing regimen provided a ceiling above which no further dose escalations were warranted. This accomplished two purposes. It set the maximal dose for use of this compound as an antiemetic for which partial efficacy was demonstrated at the intermediate dose. Furthermore, it blocked further dose escalation in search of a hypothesized antidepressant effect, antidepressant efficacy being absent even when the NK1 receptors were fully occupied by the drug. For other compounds, other values of drug occupancy may be informative, although clearly not as definitive as in the example given above. As a general rule, for receptor antagonists, which represent the largest proportion of drugs targeting seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors, efficacy is achieved only when the majority of receptor sites are occupied by drug. In contrast, the less frequent agonist drugs need only achieve a few percent occupancy to be effective. Further guidance to receptor occupancy may be provided by determining receptor occupancy in the effective dose range of an appropriate animal model.\nWhen no suitable PET ligand is developed, this provides an opportunity for translational research. The development and validation of a novel PET ligand requires several years of effort by a team of specialized chemists, biologists, and additional personnel."}, {"section_title": "CSF sampling", "text": "Some investigators propose a less exact approximation based on sampling of CSF. 77, 78 Although this method is safe, tolerable, and less expensive than radioligand PET displacement, it does not offer a direct estimate of receptor occupancy, the critical variable for drug action."}, {"section_title": "Other pharmacodynamic biomarkers", "text": "A third approach to the estimation of drug-target interactions in the CNS is through the use of other pharmacodynamic biomarkers: measurable downstream consequences of drug-target interactions that may have nothing to do with the intended consequences of the drug but may represent activation of a parallel pathway.

Indeed, phase 2 proof-of-concept studies are currently the major source of failure for CNS drugs, as well as others. Phase 2 registration studies demonstrate efficacy using clinical endpoints, which are often indirect and noisy. This in turn requires large sample sizes and prolonged observation. In contrast, translational studies using efficacy biomarkers and more highly selected test populations could provide a test of efficacy with smaller test groups and shorter observation periods.\nOnly those compounds that demonstrate efficacy in such idealized translational studies, would progress to phase 2 registration studies.

Continued collaboration between these institutions will facilitate translation of advances made at the bench to therapies for neurological and psychiatric diseases, many of them previously thought intractable.\nWhat is needed from translational scientists is careful selection and prioritization from these myriad of data and technical advances, only those refinements that best serve the early developmental needs of the discovery portfolio in a timely manner. Whatever the risks, the industry will not tolerate delay. A few clear successes will far surpass the impact of a more diffuse effort. This is best accomplished by close collaboration of preclinical counterparts as well as the developmental clinicians and scientists who will ultimately perform the registration studies that will bring drugs to registration and to market.\nThe application and interpretation of the output of the new technologies of proteomics, transcriptional profiling, metabolomics, and neuroimaging falls directly into the purview of translational research. As was predicted nearly 10 years ago, 2 the \"learn\" phase of development is becoming more and more critical for the success rate of phase 2 studies and the eventual registration of new drugs. Translational research has become a key factor in the production of new innovative therapies."}]
