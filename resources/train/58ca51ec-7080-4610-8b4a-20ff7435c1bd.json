[{"section_title": "Impact statement", "text": "This report presents the most in-depth analysis of multiple SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes in Africa. The results provide new insights about the level of viral importation, local transmission dynamics, and viral evolution. We have identified that by June 2020, two major clades, 19B/S/B4 and 20B/GR/A2a, were likely responsible for \u223c86% of all COVID-19 cases in Ghana, and that the Accra suburb Ayawaso is a hotbed of transmission. Our results suggest that swift containment measures likely limited the diversity of viruses available to seed the Ghanaian COVID-19 outbreak. Significantly, our data suggest that although spike substitution D614G may enhance transmission, its role in enhancing disease pathogenesis remains unclear. The whole viral genomes reported here were amongst the first generated in Africa and demonstrate the progress made in building local capacity for performing high-quality molecular epidemiology studies. This work establishes a reference framework for future molecular studies of viral transmissions, as African countries gradually reopen their borders."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a growing public health nightmare with over 30 million individuals infected as at 20 September 2020 and over 950,000 deaths worldwide (Table 1).1,2 There is no approved standard treatment, cure, or vaccine against COVID-19 and it is expected that both infections and mortalities will continue to rise globally.3\u20135 The epicenter of the pandemic has moved from Wuhan, China, through Europe and is now in the United States of America where currently the highest number of infections and deaths is being reported (World Health Organization.2 At all the epicenters, an initial slow infection rate was followed by a rapid exponential infection phase possibly associated with factors including socio-demographic profiles, host immune responses, and viral genetics.6 The virus SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Africa on 14 February 2020, in Egypt and has subsequently spread to every country on the continent.7\u20139 As of 20 September 2020, there were 1,145,397 cumulative cases and 24,757 cumulative deaths in Africa.2\nSARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and appears to have a relatively stable genome. However, sites of selective mutations have been identified and strains from specific geographical areas may differ.10\u201312 It is, however, not known whether the selective mutations result in specific strains that are more adapted for high transmission in different populations. Such questions may be answered as more data become available through the ongoing concerted global effort to generate more SARS-CoV-2 genome data which would also inform drug discovery, vaccine design, and COVID-19 transmission dynamics worldwide. Since the first complete genome of the virus from Wuhan was published in late 2019, whole genomes of several strains across the globe have been added to the public databases such as GISAID and GENBANK.13 Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data from COVID-19 cases in sub-Saharan Africa currently constitute less than 2% of sequences in genome repositories.14 It is uncertain whether Africa will become the next epicenter of COVID-19; however, timely high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome data may help inform the dynamics of the disease spread for better control measures. With the relatively higher infectious disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa, it is possible that potentially cross-reactive pre-existing immunity may drive a stronger immune selection that could affect the virus evolution in such populations.15\nCases of COVID-19 in Ghana appeared to be largely asymptomatic with a low reported case fatality ratio (CFR) below 0.64% as at 23 September 2020.16 This pattern of mild clinical presentations of COVID-19 appears consistent across Africa, and therefore a comprehensive genomic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating on the continent is required to determine the role of viral evolution in determining disease severity.14,17 Thus far, SARS-CoV-2 genomic data are available from Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya, and Ghana; however, comprehensive analysis of these data have not been published.14,18,19\nIn this report, we present a comprehensive molecular epidemiological analysis of SARS CoV-2 genomic data from 46 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ghana. These cases included 15 from the beginning of the epidemic in Ghana in March 2020, and 31 additional cases from the subsequent two months as the outbreak spread in Ghana. The data provide both valuable information about the SARS-CoV-2 clades circulating in Ghana and the prevalence of mutations in key viral genes, and thus provide a vital reference framework for monitoring the evolution of the virus as the pandemic spreads in Africa."}, {"section_title": "Study design ::: Materials and methods", "text": "Samples analyzed in this study were selected at two time points from the biorepository at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, which is the designated national reference laboratory for testing suspected COVID-19 cases.

The first batch of samples had mostly been obtained from the Greater Accra Region. The second batch included a few samples from the Western and Central Regions, which only had their first cases after the first batch of sequencing had been done.

Several others (8/31) were phylogenetically related to Ghana/3176_S11/2020 (Figure 2). We utilized three main nomenclature codes for clade analysis based on the evolving expert consensus represented on the GISAID website for SARS-CoV-2; Legacy clade assignment based on phenotypic variation30 and \u2018Nextstrain clade\u2019 assignment based on nucleotide polymorphisms. However, the GISAID clade assignment takes both approaches into account. Clades could be fully assigned in 41/46 genomes regardless of assignment method; others were \u201cunassigned\u201d (Supplementary Table 2).

High rates of mutations usually correlate with high rates of transmission since mutations that persist tend to be important for viral adaptation. All (100%) of Ghanaian SARS-CoV-2 genomes had <13 mutations: 1 sequence had 12 mutations, 4 had 11 mutations, 10 had 10 mutations, and 34 had less than 9 mutations (Figure 4, Supplementary Table 3). Most genomes (86.6%) in the first batch had lower than nine mutations. However, the genome with the highest mutations (12), was Ghana/1622_S2/2020 one of the earliest imported cases in batch 1 (Figure 5). This isolate was from a patient who had arrived in the country from the United States and transited through the United Kingdom (UK) and Dubai. The mutational profile of this case clustered very closely with United States, Europe, and Asian samples (Figure 5). This patient exhibited severe disease at the time of sampling and was under ventilation, though currently, disease outcome is unknown. Another sample from the first batch, Ghana/2828_S6/2020, had 10 mutations. Both of these viruses were expected to be highly transmissible (based on mutational profile); however, these genotypes were not detected in the batch two samples (Supplementary Table 3).\nAs expected, a significant number of non-synonymous mutations (Supplementary Table 3) and synonymous mutations (variants) were detected (Supplementary Table 4).

For this study, we defined a locally evolved mutation as one that had not been previously reported elsewhere, or one which had been reported elsewhere, but was detected after one that had not previously been reported. Though we cannot rule them out, rare mutations that did not appear in more than one sequence were considered as evidence of continuing adaptation, but not as transmissible variants. Novel mutations were deemed to be part of a local transmission cluster if detected in more than one viral sequence. The 19B/S/B4 was common among patients in the first batch that had no recent travel history (4//9), suggesting that they were probably infected by one individual who had returned from a recent travel.\nTwo undetected genotypes (GHA and GHB) appear to have seeded the majority of 19B/S/B4 infections studied. Four genomes (from the Tema and Nungua municipalities of the Greater Accra Region as well as Sekondi-Takoradi in the Western Region) (Figure 7(a)) shared an L681F mutation in ORF1a. This indicates that an undetected transmissible variant (denoted GHA; Figure 6(b)) could be circulating and seeding infections in the coastal belt, i.e. Greater Accra, Central, and Western Regions.\nTwo other undetected variants GHC and GHD, appear to be seeding infections and radiating from the Ayawaso municipality of the Greater Accra Region (Figures 6(a) and 7(b)). In addition to the defining polymorphisms of 19B, GHC has a trifecta of non-synonymous mutations in ORF1a (M3665H), ORF8 (E92K), and ORF14 (A26V). This undetected virus is likely the parent of Ghana/84210_S44/2020; isolated from a resident of Ayawaso, Ghana/84218_S47/2020; isolated from another resident of Ayawaso and Ghana/81216_S36/2020; isolated from a resident of Cape Coast in the Central Region. The Ghana/84218_S47/2020 and Ghana/81216_S36/2020 viruses were likely seeded from an undetected descendant of GHC. GHD, which harbors the polymorphisms of GHC, as well as a novel spike amino acid substitution I805M, shared by both Ghana/84162_S6/2020, Ghana/81216_S36/2020, and Ghana/84162_S47/2020. The remaining 19B/S/B4 sequences appeared to indicate at least four sets of unevolved 19B/S/B4 seeding infections. Samples Ghana/84260_S28/2020 (from Ayawaso) and Ghana/84438_S50/2020 (from Odorkor Market, also in the Greater Accra region) appear to have been seeded by the same virus as sample Ghana/84162_S45/2020 (from Ayawaso). Sample Ghana/2828_S6/2020 (from East Cantonment, another suburb located in the Greater Accra Region) was one of the few highly evolved viruses sequenced in the first batch and showed some variations that have not been previously reported. The 20A, B, C/G, GR, GH/A2a genomes did not show extensive local evolution (Figure 6(a)). Five out of the six imported viruses sequenced clustered to these clades and most of the imported strains had been well evolved prior to introduction. As such, we did not discover evidence of as many transmitted non-synonymous polymorphisms. Importantly, Ghana/84049_S31/2020 (Ayawaso) and Ghana/84279_S42/2020 (Ayawaso) appear to have evolved from an undetected GHG viral genome, which harbors the S232T amino acid substitution in nucleocapsid. A series of 12 20B/GR/A2a genomes appeared to share genomes, multiple silent mutations, and a linkage to Ayawaso and various locations across southern Ghana."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "By most accounts, SARS-CoV-2 mutates slowly, averaging about 2.5 mutations per month. There is evidence that mutations happen in quick succession, following long chronological stretches of genomic stability; this means most strains still resemble the Wuhan strain.10,18 Early on in the Chinese outbreak, there were reports of two possible variants of the virus referred to as the S (also referred to as the East Asian superclade B)31 and L lineages (also referred to as the European superclade A).32 The latter has been linked to greater transmissibility and pathogenicity, and currently the L lineage has diverged into the GISAID L, V, G, GH, and GR clades.33,34\nIn this study, by sequencing and phylogenetically characterizing SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Ghana, we have shown that locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 appears to exhibit a lower evolutionary rate than observed elsewhere.11,31,35 We have identified 17 genotypes with evidence of transmissible variants (\u223c9 variants). Most variants appear to have spread from the Greater Accra Region to the Central and Western regions of Ghana, with Ayawaso in East Legon as a likely epicenter. The locally sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses demonstrated very little variation from the original Wuhan strain, a common characteristic of this virus.36 Ten of the initial 15 viral genomes were closely linked to the European superclade A. Most genomes (8/15) clustered to 20 A, B, C/G, GR, GH/A2a; half of these had no history of travel, while the remaining genomes were from travelers from Hungary, India, USA (via Dubai) and the UK. Notably, all five of the batch 1 genomes that clustered to clade B4 had no evidence of travel or direct contact with a recent traveler, which is evidence of local transmission linked to the Asian superclade B. Though these initial genomes from March-April 2020 suggest ongoing local transmission in Ghana, the relative lack of variation suggested that most locally transmitted viruses were less than one month old, indicating a recent introduction and nascent expansion (late February/early March, 2020) of the virus into Ghana.29\nWe have identified a total of seven potential circulating genotypes of 19B/S/B4 as well as three apparently transmissible locally evolved genotypes GHA (ORF1a- L681F; ORF8- L84S; N- S202N; ORF14- V49I), GHC (ORF1a- M3665H; ORF8- L84S, E92K; N- S202N; ORF14- A26V, V49I), and GHD (ORF1a- M3665H; ORF8- L84S, E92K; N- S202N; ORF14- A26V, V49I; S- I805M). We have identified 12 likely circulating genotypes of Legacy clade A2a viruses. Our data show evidence of multiple importations of A2a viruses intoGhana, and apparent ongoing transmission within essential personnel in Accra (Greater Accra Region), Cape Coast (Central Region), Tarkwa and Sekondi-Takoradi (Western Region). Eleven genomes in our batch 2 sequencing round appeared to be linked; most were isolated from essential personnel in the Greater Accra, Central, and Western Regions. This suggests the patients might have contracted the infection from a single source early in the outbreak; likely during the lockdown. The Accra suburb of Ayawaso appears to feature prominently in linked genomes. This is unsurprising given that Ayawaso had been an infection hotspot early in the local outbreak, and remains so to date.\nThe D614G spike variant has spread across the world, dominating most genomes37 and constituting over 50% of genomes in this study. Although D614G has been implicated in increased transmissivity and higher mortality in other countries,38\u201340 available data from the Ghana Health Service do not appear to support this theory. Further investigations in a larger sample size will be necessary to clearly determine the impact of D614G on SARS-CoV-2 virulence in Ghana.\nThe potential impact of COVID-19 on Africa has long been discussed41 with most reports treating any impact on Africa uniformly. As at now, COVID-19 has impacted Africa in an uneven manner. Nine months after pandemic declaration, most African countries are reporting low numbers of cases, though this may be partly linked to low levels of testing uptake. Importantly even though, in countries with high levels of reliable testing, case fatality ratios (CFR) vary. Cote D'Ivoire (CFR \u2248 0.63%) and Ghana (CFR \u2248 0.65%) highlight countries with low CFR, whereas other countries such as, Kenya (CFR \u2248 1.75%), Nigeria (CFR \u2248 1.92%), and South Africa (CFR \u2248 2.42%) have higher CFRs.2,42 Several factors may contribute to the observed low CFRs in Africa, including younger population, cross-protection from existing immunity to other Coronaviruses, and early institution of safety protocols. In addition, local evolution of the virus as observed in this study, as well as others,43 may be driven by existing immunity to other pathogens and environmental factors that are unique to Africa. It would be interesting to investigate in future studies how these locally generated variants impact on transmissibility and virulence of the virus. In addition, in Ghana, the early border closures, quarantine measures, and lockdown may have limited the initial importation of SARSs-CoV-2 variants into the country leading to more favorable outcomes.\nOne isolate in our study, Ghana/2828_S6/2020, belonging to the legacy clade B4 was especially noteworthy. In that it exhibited four non-synonymous mutations; in ORF1a (A2745), ORF3a (L106F), and two spike mutations (D80Y and L176F). Though their roles are as yet to be elucidated, D80 and L176 are located on the outer edges of the S1 domain within the trimeric spike protein structure (PDB ID: 6VXX).44,45 D80 is located just after \u00df-sheet 4 and L176 is within the same \u00df-sheet domain. Interestingly, in the recently published cryo-EM structures, D80 is resolved in the closed state (PDB ID: 6VXX) but is not resolved in the open state (PDB ID: 6VYB). L176 is not resolved in either, but S172 is within 12 angstroms of D80. Given these observations, it would be interesting to look for these mutational combinations in subsequent sequences.44\nThis study provides some of the most in-depth genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa to date, and provides a framework for monitoring the evolution of the virus as it continues to spread on the continent and globally. Such studies are essential for tracking transmission dynamics and assessing the potential efficacy of any vaccines that become available in the future."}]
