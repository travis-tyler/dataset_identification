[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "[2] On interannual to decadal time scales there are large changes in the frequency, duration, and intensity of Atlantic tropical cyclones (TC) [e.g., Klotzbach, 2006;Klotzbach and Gray, 2008;. Theories for attributing causality to observed changes in TC activity range from anthropogenic [e.g., Holland and Webster, 2007] to natural [e.g., Goldenberg et al., 2001], oftentimes focusing on the direct or indirect role of tropical North Atlantic sea surface temperatures [e.g., Elsner et al., 2008;Emanuel, 2005;Webster et al., 2005]. Although some effort has been made to consider the influence of natural [Evan et al., 2008] and anthropogenic [Mann and Emanuel, 2006] aerosols in modulating Atlantic TC activity, to date no work has quantified the importance of long-lived stratospheric sulfate aerosols from volcanic sources. [3] Major volcanic eruptions liberate below ground sulfur dioxide that reacts with atmospheric water vapor to form long-lived stratospheric sulfate aerosols that are global in extent [Robock, 2003]. The dominant radiative effect of sulfate aerosol loading is to reduce the surface solar insolation and increase absorption of short and longwave radiation in the lower stratosphere. These direct effects cool the surface and warm the air in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, as is observed by satellites with the recent eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n in 1982and Mount Pinatubo in 1991[e.g., Hofmann, 1987Minnis et al., 1993;Stowe et al., 1992;Wielicki et al., 2002]. General circulation models reproduce the observed surface and air temperature response to these and other historical eruptions [Hansen et al., 2005;Santer et al., 2003Santer et al., , 2006. [4] The response of ocean surface [Hansen et al., 2005;Santer et al., 2001] and subsurface [Church et al., 2005] temperatures to recent major volcanic eruptions is a net cooling that persists several years after the eruptions, including in the Atlantic Main Development Region (MDR,(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20) [Goldenberg et al., 2001] and other regions where tropical cyclogenesis occurs [Santer et al., 2006]. However, the extent to which such temperature changes affected seasonal TC activity is unexamined. The goal of this work is to identify the response of Atlantic TCs to major volcanic eruptions and elucidate the mechanisms that govern such a relationship, using a combination of observational and reanalysis data, as well as numerical experiments. Further testing of the theoretical framework for volcano-TC interactions proposed here is warranted since this study is limited by a relatively small sample size and two El Ni\u00f1o events that are coincident with the eruptions."}, {"section_title": "Data and Model", "text": "[5] Historical Atlantic TC intensity and position data is from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship version 2 [Knapp et al., 2010]. Monthly mean potential intensity (PI) [Bister and Emanuel, 1998] and genesis potential index (GPI) [Emanuel and Nolan, 2004] are calculated using 6-hourly atmospheric data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NNRP) Reanalysis 1 [Kalnay et al., 1996] and monthly mean SST from the Hadley Centre HADISST v1.1 data set [Rayner et al., 2003]. Upper tropospheric (70 hPa) air temperatures and vertical wind shear, defined as the vector difference between the 850 and 200 hPa winds, are also from NNRP Reanalysis 1. [6] I estimate the contribution of the eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n (1982) andMount Pinatubo (1991) to historical SST using a combination of satellite data, radiative transfer modeling, and an ocean general circulation model. I calculated the all-sky surface forcing from stratospheric volcanic aerosols in a manner identical to that described by Evan et al. [2009]. The oceanic response to changes in surface radiative fluxes by stratospheric aerosols is estimated using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Ocean General Circulation Model [Marshall et al., 1997a[Marshall et al., , 1997b] run globally with a horizontal resolution of 1\u00b0\u00c2 1\u00b0and 23 vertical layers, with the uppermost layers having a resolution of 10 m and the lower layers becoming coarser with depth to a maximum of 500 m. The model bathymetry extends from 80\u00b0S to 80\u00b0N. The Gent-McWilliams [Gent and McWilliams, 1990] eddy parameterization and K-Profile Parameterization vertical mixing scheme [Large et al., 1994] simulate effects of sub-grid-scale processes. Model tracers and momentum have a time step of 240 s. The model is forced with a long-term monthly mean surface horizontal momentum flux from NNRP Reanalysis I [Kalnay et al., 1996], and a long-term monthly mean surface heat budget that is calculated offline with NNRP Reanalysis 1 surface fluxes of long and shortwave radiation, and sensible and latent heat. [7] Turbulent fluxes of latent and sensible heat are parameterized by relaxing SST to a monthly climatology from the World Ocean Atlas at a two-month time scale [Boyer et al., 2005]. The two-month time scale was shown to reproduce annual mean SST anomalies over the tropical North Atlantic better than shorter relaxation times [Evan et al., 2011, Figure S4]. Although the model experiments are not coupled, recently Miller [2012] demonstrated that this is a reasonable method to estimate the SST response to a stratosphere aerosol layer. However, this method may underestimate the net cooling by the eruption since here I do not account for the drying of the atmosphere that followed the eruptions [Soden et al., 2002]. [8] The physical model is spun up to steady state for 130 years after which the numerical experiments consist of a control run that is integrated forward for 23 years using the long-term monthly mean NNRP fields, and a perturbation run that is integrated forward with changes to the surface radiative fluxes in accordance with the output from the radiative transfer model. Thus, the control run has prescribed seasonally varying surface heat fluxes, while the perturbation run includes these seasonally varying fluxes plus the change in solar insolation from the eruptions of Chich\u00f3n and Pinatubo. I interpret the difference of the control from the perturbation run to be the influence of these eruptions on the state of the global ocean. Using this numerical experiment configuration I am estimating the effect of stratospheric aerosols about the climatological mean state. An animation of the monthly mean volcanically forced change in tropical North Atlantic SST and potential temperature at depth along a transect at 20\u00b0N, over the time period 1977-1999, is found in the auxiliary material. 1 More details of the model setup, including the model climatology, is provided by Evan et al. [2011, Supplement]."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "[9] Between 1979 and 2000 there were two major volcanic eruptions that altered the global stratospheric aerosol loading. The first, El Chich\u00f3n, located at 17\u00b0N and 93\u00b0W, erupted in April of 1982, and the second, Mount Pinatubo, located at 15\u00b0N and 120\u00b0E, erupted in June of 1991. Following each eruption stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) over the tropics was 0.1-0.2, decaying to preeruption levels in three to four years ( Figure 1). The aerosol loading was higher in the northern hemisphere following the eruption of El Chich\u00f3n due to the latitude of the volcano. Direct radiative forcing by the stratospheric sulfate aerosols increased the global albedo [Minnis et al., 1993]. The aerosols also absorbed short and longwave radiation, resulting in warming of the air at the base of the stratosphere and upper troposphere [Ramachandran et al., 2000], and sinking of tropopause heights [Santer et al., 2003]. Variability in monthly mean 70 hPa air temperature from NNRP exhibits two warm anomalies that are coincident with the sudden increase and slow decay of SAOD at this latitude ( Figure 2). Linear regression of the 70 hPa temperature onto the SAOD time series (both averaged over the MDR) provides a first order estimate of the contribution of the aerosol radiative forcing to the air temperatures ( Figure 2, light blue line), which is quantitatively consistent with coupled model experiments [Santer et al., 2003]. The unfiltered monthly mean time series are correlated with an r-value of 0.58, statistically significant at greater than the 99% level (based on the t-score of a 2-tailed t-test) where the time series autocorrelation is accounted for when calculating the degrees of freedom [Bretherton et al., 1999]. [10] The decrease in sunlight absorbed by the upper ocean, due to the volcanic aerosol radiative forcing, resulted in net cooling at the surface, and approximately 50% of the variance in interannual tropical North Atlantic SST anomalies during 1982-2008 is due to volcanic aerosol radiative cooling [Evan et al., 2009]. Monthly mean SST averaged over the MDR exhibits cool anomalies that are coincident in time with the sudden loading of stratospheric aerosols from the eruptions and their subsequent slow decay ( Figure 2b). Estimates of the contribution of stratospheric aerosol forcing to observed SST anomalies from a linear regression of SST onto SAOD (light blue line, Figure 2b) and from the output of the numerical experiments with the MITOGCM (dark blue line, Figure 2b) suggest maximum cooling from the eruptions, averaged over the MDR, to be in the range of 0.3\u00b0to 0.5\u00b0C (based on unfiltered SST anomalies). [11] Having described the changes to the physical environment after the eruptions, I next consider changes in metrics of seasonal Atlantic hurricane activity. The median number of TCs that formed during the three hurricane seasons preceding the eruption of El Chich\u00f3n and Mount Pinatubo is nearly double the numbers of storms that formed in the three seasons immediately following each eruption ( Figure 3a). The change in median storm counts is statistically significant (p-value < 0.01) as determined by a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. In addition, the median storm lifetime during the pre-eruption years is larger than the median for storms forming during the post-eruption periods (Figure 3b, p-value < 0.05), and the median storm accumulated cyclone energy (ACE, the sum of the square of the 6-hourly tropical cyclone maximum wind speed over the lifetime of the storm [Bell, 2002]) is smaller during the posteruption period (Figure 3c, p-value < 0.01). ACE is a measure of storm frequency, duration, and intensity, but lifetime maximum intensity (LMI, the maximum intensity a storm reaches over its lifetime [Elsner et al., 2008]) does not directly reflect frequency and duration, and is thus more reflective of the intensity of the storms that formed. The median LMI of the TCs that formed in the pre-eruption years is larger than the median LMI of the TCs forming in the Figure 3. Distributions of tropical cyclone activity in years affected and not affected by volcanic aerosols. Distributions of (a) seasonal tropical cyclone counts, (b) tropical cyclone duration, (c) seasonal ACE, and (d) LMI are shown for the three \"Clear\" seasons preceding the eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n (1979,1980,1981) and Mount Pinatubo (1988, 1989, 1990, and the three \"Volcano\" seasons following the earlier (1982,1983,1984) and later (1991,1992,1993) eruptions. The difference of the median values in each plot is statistically significant at p-value < 0.05 based on the score from a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. years following the eruptions (Figure 3d, p-value < 0.1). Also relevant is the reduction in the tail of the LMI distribution, consistent with the response of a TC intensity distribution to anomalously cool SST [Elsner et al., 2008]. [12] I also examine the historical TC tracks in order to understand the nature of the systematic change in storm frequency, duration, and intensity following these eruptions ( Figure 4). Sixty six total storms formed during the preeruption period and 44 formed in the post-eruption seasons. Of those genesis occurred in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean region for 29% (27%) of the pre-eruption (posteruption) storms (Table 1). During the pre-eruption seasons 48% of the storms formed in the MDR and 23% formed in the region to the north of the MDR and Gulf of Mexico/ Caribbean regions (here termed Eastern-U.S. for convenience). There is a near reversal of MDR (20%) and Eastern U.S. (52%) genesis frequency in the post-eruption seasons when compared to the pre-eruption seasons (Table 1). [13] Tropical cyclones that form in the MDR tend to have a longer lifetime and a greater intensity than those forming further to the west or to the north [Kossin et al., 2010], although storms forming and tracking through the Caribbean and Gulf can achieve intensities as large as those forming in the MDR. TCs that form further north, like the majority of the post-eruption systems, fall into a class of \"baroclinically enhanced\" storms that spend less time over warmer water and tend to have weaker intensities than the \"Cape-Verde\" type systems that form over the MDR [Kossin et al., 2010], which develop from African easterly wave disturbances [Landsea, 1993]. Thus the difference in the dominant genesis location between the pre and post-eruption TCs help to explain the differences in storm duration, ACE, and LMI ( Figure 3). [14] The reduction in MDR cyclogenesis during the seasons following the eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n and Mount Pinatubo, relative to the preceding years, is likely reflective of environmental conditions that are less conducive to tropical cyclone formation and intensification. To test this hypothesis I examine changes in environmental conditions averaged in space over the MDR and in time spanning the Atlantic hurricane season, defined here as July-November (I note there is no appreciable change in results if I only examine the August-September season). [15] PI theory [Bister and Emanuel, 1998] provides a limit on the intensity of a tropical cyclone based upon the thermodynamic environment, which can be expressed, following where V max is the cyclone maximum wind speed (the PI), C k and C D are the surface enthalpy and momentum exchange coefficients, T s is the surface temperature, T o is the temperature at the tropopause, and h 0 * and h* are the saturation moist static energy at the sea surface and of the troposphere, respectively. As SST cools the PI decreases with T s and h 0 *, but according to (1) given cooler SST PI may not decrease if there is a compensating reduction in T o and h*. Given the inability of the weakly rotating tropical troposphere to support large temperature gradients T o and h* are nearly uniform across the tropics [Emanuel, 2010;Sobel and Bretherton, 2000], thus a pan-tropic uniform reduction in SST may not lead to a decrease in PI due to coupled adjustment that also reduces T o and h* [Vecchi and Soden, 2007]. [16] In addition to the upper tropospheric warming major eruptions cause a non-uniform pattern of surface cooling. The warming at the base of the stratosphere (Figure 2a   Shown are the total number of genesis events and the relative proportion (in parenthesis) for the six hurricane seasons preceding (1979,1980,1981,1988,1989,1990) and following (1982,1983,1984,1991,1992,1993) the eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n and Mount Pinatubo. See text for description of locations. absorption by the sulfate aerosols [Ramachandran et al., 2000] increases T o , thus reducing the PI [Emanuel, 2010]. In the case of the El Chich\u00f3n eruption the stratospheric volcanic aerosols were strongly confined to the northern hemisphere (Figure 1), and from the numerical experiments the northern hemisphere tropical SST cooling was greater in magnitude than in the southern hemisphere (not shown). While h 0 * would decrease with the cool SST anomalies, cooler northern hemisphere tropical SST anomalies relative to the tropical mean would result in a mitigation of any coincident decline h* over the tropical North Atlantic. Both processes would lead to a decrease in PI. In the wake of the Pinatubo eruption stratospheric sulfates were more evenly distributed meridionally across the tropics. However, given a uniform aerosol forcing at the surface, in the tropics the summertime hemisphere will experience the greater reduction in SST because of the shoaling of the mixed layer, by bulk formulae. Therefore, it is expected that during the hurricane season (h 0 -h*) and therefore PI would also decrease. [17] I test the hypothesis that volcanic eruptions caused a reduction in PI by comparing pre-and post-eruption distributions of NNRP PI within the MDR during July-November (note the results were qualitatively unchanged if I only considered the August-September time period). There is a statistically significant (p-value < 0.01) reduction in median PI following the eruptions (Figure 5a), which is related to the reduction in median SST (Figure 5c) and increase in median 70 hPa temperature (Figure 5d), both significant with a p-value less than 0.01. Therefore, in the wake of these two eruptions, the thermodynamic environment became less favorable for TC intensification, due to the aerosol radiatively forced reduction in T s and h 0 * , and increase in T o and h*. [18] To explicitly examine the source of the change in storm frequency I also consider the Genesis Potential Index of Emanuel and Nolan [2004], where h is 850 hPa absolute vorticity, RH is 600 hPa relative humidity, V max is the PI (1), and V z is the 200 to 850 hPa vertical wind shear. The coefficients in (2) are from a statistical fit to observations. By (2) cyclogenesis is kinematically limited by vertical wind shear and low-level vorticity, and thermodynamically limited by PI and mid-level moisture, although recent work suggests that on interannual time scales the GPI most strongly reflects changes in PI and V z (C. Bruyere et al., Investigating the use of a Genesis Potential Index for tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic basin, submitted to Journal of Climate, 2012). In the wake of each eruption there is a statistically significant reduction (p-value < 0.01) in the median MDR GPI relative to the preeruption distribution (Figure 5b), consistent with the reduction of genesis in the MDR (Figure 4) and by association the reduction in tropical cyclone frequency, duration, and intensity ( Figure 3). [19] The statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) shift of the GPI distribution toward lower values from the pre-to post-eruption periods (Figure 5b) is related to the change in PI (Figure 5a). A separate analysis of 600 hPa relative humidity did not suggest a strong influence of the mid-level moisture on the GPI distributions (not shown), consistent with Bruyere et al. (submitted manuscript, 2012). A monthly mean time series of vertical wind shear, averaged over the MDR, shows positive shear anomalies following each eruption (Figure 6b). In the wake of El Chich\u00f3n the positive shear anomalies are as high as 5 m s \u00c01 , while after the Figure 5. July-November (JASON) mean environmental conditions during years affected and not affected by volcanic aerosols. Distributions of (a) potential intensity, (b) the genesis potential index, (c) SST, and (d) 70 hPa temperature are shown for the three \"Clear\" seasons preceding the eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n (1979Chich\u00f3n ( , 1980Chich\u00f3n ( , 1981 and Mount Pinatubo (1988, 1989, 1990, and the three \"Volcano\" seasons following the earlier (1982,1983,1984) and later (1991,1992,1993) eruptions. Data is from the Main Development Region (Figure 4). The difference of the median values in each plot is statistically significant at p-value < 0.05 based on the score from a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Pinatubo eruption the positive shear anomalies are O(1-2 m s \u00c01 ). By (2) the positive shear anomalies contribute to the post-eruption reduction in the GPI (Figure 5b). The finding that PI and vertical shear anomalies dominate the GPI distribution change is consistent with results from a recent study on sources of interannual variability of GPI in the Atlantic (Bruyere et al., submitted manuscript, 2012). [20] Tropical North Atlantic vertical wind shear is anomalously high during periods of El Ni\u00f1o events [Goldenberg and Shapiro, 1996;Gray, 1984], and there were El Ni\u00f1o events during the 1982 and 1992 Atlantic hurricane seasons (Figure 5c). Therefore, it is likely that the changes in TC activity following the eruptions (Figures 3 and 4) resulted from a combination of the direct radiative forcing by the stratospheric aerosols, and the well-known influence of El Ni\u00f1o. [21] Evan et al. [2011] demonstrated that dust radiatively forced Atlantic SST anomalies can excited coupled modes of variability that tend to reinforce the SST anomaly by altering the structure of the atmosphere, principally because the aerosol forcing is meridionally asymmetric. While the relationship between ENSO and Atlantic vertical shear is well-established, here I suggest that the eruptions also contributed to the positive shear anomalies during these seasons, especially for that of 1982, by similarly exciting coupled modes of equatorial variability. [22] Following the eruption of El Chich\u00f3n the northward gradient in aerosol optical depth (Figure 1) resulted in a southward gradient in the surface aerosol direct radiative forcing (i.e., the negative surface forcing was greater in magnitude in the tropical North Atlantic than it was in the tropical South Atlantic), and by bulk formulae established an anomalous southward SST gradient (i.e., a greater reduction in SST to the north). Coupled equatorial theory suggests a kinematic response to an anomalous meridional SST gradient [Chang et al., 1997;Xie and Carton, 2004] that is characterized by a reduction (increase) in the climatological trade winds in the warm (cool) hemisphere that tends to reinforce the warm (cool) anomaly, consistent with the wind-evaporation-SST feedback [Xie and Philander, 1994].  and Vimont and Kossin [2007] demonstrated that associated with a southward meridional SST gradient were increased vertical wind shear over the tropical North Atlantic and a reduction in tropical cyclone frequency, duration, and intensity, along with movement of preferential genesis location outside the MDR, similar to Figure 4. [23] From the numerical experiments the eruption of El Chich\u00f3n and the subsequent meridional gradient of the stratospheric aerosols forced a meridional SST gradient of up to \u00c00.7\u00b0C from 30\u00b0S to 30\u00b0N (Figure 6a). The increased vertical wind shear during the 1982 Atlantic hurricane season ( Figure 6b) follows four to six months from the peak in the volcanically forced SST gradient, which is the typical time scale of the wind-evaporation-SST feedback, and is consistent with the hypothesis that the positive shear anomaly over the MDR results from the volcanic aerosol radiative forcing. Note that there is not a similar meridional SST gradient forced by the eruption of Pinatubo nor a subsequent spike in vertical wind shear. The timing of the aerosol forced SST gradient and the shear anomalies is also consistent with the findings of Evan et al. [2011]."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "[24] Analysis of Atlantic tropical cyclone characteristics in the three years preceding and following the major volcanic eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n in 1982 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991 show statistically significant differences in TC characteristics and regional environmental conditions. In the wake of each eruption there was a reduction in the numbers of TC that formed, the duration of the storms, the TC accumulated cyclone energy, and the lifetime maximum intensity (Figure 3). Analysis of the storm tracks show that in the years following the eruptions tropical cyclogenesis shifted northward out of the Atlantic MDR, helping to explain the simultaneous reduction in storm duration and intensity [Kossin and Camargo, 2009]. [25] To elucidate the factors that govern the change in genesis location and by association TC duration and intensity, I examined the differences in the distributions of MDR PI, SST, 70 hPa temperature, and GPI ( Figure 5). I concluded that, via PI theory, the volcanically forced reduction in SST and increase in upper tropospheric air temperature Figure 6. Time series of the monthly mean volcanically forced meridional SST gradient, MDR vertical wind shear, ENSO, and the AMM. (a) The SST gradient is the zonally averaged monthly mean linear SST trend from 30\u00b0S-30\u00b0N, multiplied by 60\u00b0. The SST data used is the modeled change in SST from the eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n and Mount Pinatubo, and represents the volcanically forced meritional SST gradient. (b) The monthly mean vertical wind shear anomaly is the anomalous (with respect to the long-term mean and the seasonal cycle) vector difference of the 200 and 850 hPa winds from reanalysis averaged over the MDR (Figure 4). (c) The Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index is the monthly mean SST anomaly (with respect to the long-term mean and the seasonal cycle) of the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region, and AE1\u00b0C anomalies are indicated by the dashed red lines. (d) The AMM index has been normalized to a mean of zero and standard deviation of one for the period 1979-1999. All time series have been smoothed with a 3-month running mean filter. (Figure 2) contributed to the reduction of MDR PI and GPI in the post-eruption seasons. I note that the results in Figures 2 and 4 were very similar when considering the three hurricane seasons following each eruption in comparison to all other hurricane seasons in the 1979-1999 time period. [26] The 1982 and 1991 Atlantic hurricane seasons were coincident with El Ni\u00f1o events, and the reduction in storm activity is also ascribed to the state of ENSO. During the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season there was a strong La Ni\u00f1a event, which is associated with a preference for tropical cyclone genesis in the MDR [Camargo et al., 2007]. Therefore there may be a La Ni\u00f1a bias in the genesis locations (Figure 4). Additionally, the ENSO events may contribute to the MDR PI anomalies via tropospheric warming [Tang and Neelin, 2004]. [27] Another way in which the 1982 and 1991 El Ni\u00f1o events bias these results is via an associated increase in vertical wind shear. However, here I present evidence that the hemispheric asymmetry in stratospheric volcanic aerosols from the eruption of El Chich\u00f3n (Figure 1) and the southward gradient in the radiatively forced SST anomalies contributed to the positive shear anomaly during the 1982 hurricane season. This hypothesis is consistent with other studies demonstrating that such an externally forced meridional SST gradient will induce a coupled response that, via the wind-evaporation-SST feedback, reinforces the hemispheric SST anomalies and causes the atmospheric circulation to adjust in a manner as to increase vertical wind shear in the cool (northern) hemisphere during the hurricane season [Evan et al., 2011]. [28] In the 20th century there were two other major eruptions from tropical volcanos, Agung in Indonesia (1964), and Santa Maria in Guatemala (1902). However, all the 20th century eruptions were dwarfed by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia. It is unlikely that the 1964 eruption of Agung had a negative effect on Atlantic tropical cyclone activity since the aerosols were mostly confined to the southern hemisphere, opposite to the distribution of aerosols from the El Chich\u00f3n eruption. It is plausible that the eruption of Agung actually increased Atlantic tropical cyclone activity in the three hurricane seasons following the eruption via inducing a northward SST gradient (i.e., more aerosols in the southern hemisphere and a greater reduction of SST in the tropical South Atlantic relative to the tropical North Atlantic). Consistent with this hypothesis, observations of TC counts, storm lifetime, and ACE all increase from the three pre to the three post-eruption hurricane seasons (Table 2). [29] The 1902 eruption of Santa Maria, although very large, had aerosol optical depths approximately half those of Pinatubo [Sato et al., 1993]. However, the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa was larger than the Pinatubo event, and it is probable that a similar reduction in Atlantic hurricane activity followed. A comparison of TC characteristics for the three hurricane seasons prior to and following the Krakatoa eruption support this hypothesis; TC counts, duration, and ACE all decrease in the wake of this eruption (Table 2), which is consistent with the findings presented here. Although the quality of the Atlantic storm record back to this period is suspect, these results are encouraging as there should be consistency when examining variability around six-year subsets of the record. [30] The current analysis has shown that the major eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n and Mount Pinatubo augmented the influences of El Ni\u00f1o to produce a marked, short-term reduction in tropical cyclone activity. It is interesting to note that previous work has suggested that eruptions like Pinatubo may have caused the 1991 El Ni\u00f1o via the so-called thermostat mechanism [Mann et al., 2005;Clement et al., 1996;Emile-Geay et al., 2008]. As such, a fully coupled modeling study, designed to isolate the effects of the stratospheric volcanic aerosols on the tropical environment, and on tropical cyclone genesis, tracks, and intensity, is warranted. Last, the buildup of aerosols from major eruptions can be forecast based on the location and intensity of the eruption, and thus in the wake of the next eruption there is an opportunity to predict the short-term change in Atlantic tropical cyclone genesis, duration, and intensity.
