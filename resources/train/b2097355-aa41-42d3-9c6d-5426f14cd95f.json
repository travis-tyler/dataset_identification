Variation in these data is often described in the context of established haplotype groups (haplogroups), which represent branch points in the mtDNA phylogeny, with higher-order branch points representing major macro-haplogroups.\nHowever, microarrays used for typing mtDNA single nucleotide variants (mtSNVs) may not include sufficient mtSNVs to accurately define mtDNA haplogroups. A more complete approach is required.\nWe present MitoImpute, a pipeline to infer mtDNA haplotypes from globally-representative reference panels of mtDNA sequences. The performance of MitoImpute is validated using in silico microarrays (ISMs) derived from 1,000 Genomes Project (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2015 whole genome sequence (WGS) data, and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Saykin et al., 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Reference Alignment", "text": "We used publicly available PhyloTree (van Oven and Kayser, 2009) sequences to create a large (n=7,747) reference alignment with the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) (Andrews et al., 1999) site numbering convention. We aligned sequences in batches of 50 using the L-INS-i version of MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) , then combined the batches, resolving inconsistent gap placements manually. rCRS site numbers were preserved by removing sites at which gaps were introduced in the rCRS during the alignment process."}, {"section_title": "Reference Panel", "text": "Whole human mtDNA sequences were downloaded from GenBank on 2018-07-18 by adapting the MitoMap (Lott et al., 2013) search term (Supplement A). This returned 44,299 complete human mtDNA sequences and excluded archaic and ancient sequences. These sequences were aligned to the reference alignment in batches of 2,500 using the MAFFT algorithm (Katoh and Standley, 2013) Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Validation Panel", "text": "In silico microarrays (ISMs) were created by subsetting mtSNVs present in 1000 Genomes\nProject Phase 3 WGS data (n=2,535) to those included on existing commercially available microarrays. Microarray information was obtained from strand orientation files available from the Wellcome Centre (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/strand/), with 101 strand files containing mtSNVs (Supplementary Table 2 ). Haplogroup assignment for the WGS data and the ISMs was performed using Hi-MC (Smieszek et al., 2018) ."}, {"section_title": "Imputation", "text": "We used the IMPUTE2 chromosome X protocol for imputation (Howie et al., 2009; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2018) . No recombination was assumed; therefore we applied a uniform recombination rate of r=0 across all sites. The Markov chain Monte Carlo step in IMPUTE2 is used to account for phase uncertainty in recombining diploid data (Howie et al., 2009 ) but we did not perform this step as our data is non-recombining and haploid.\nThe effect of varying the number of sequences in the reference alignment was estimated by setting the k _ h a p option to 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000. We tested the ability of our pipeline to impute rare variants by filtering the Reference Panel to minor allele frequencies (MAF) of 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%, resulting 409, 682 and 1874 mtSNVs, respectively (Supplementary Tables 3). Imputation accuracy was assessed as haplogroup concordance and genotype concordance using Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) (Matthews, 1975) , with the WGS data used as the truth set. Linear mixed-model ANOVA was used to assess the meaningful difference in haplogroup assignment and MCC (mean of mtSNVs per ISM) for different parameters tested for k _ h a p and MAF. Pipelines for implementing our imputation protocol and reproducing our results were created in SnakeMake (K\u00f6ster and Rahmann, 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "In silico Microarrays", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Parameter Tuning", "text": "When compared to un-imputed data, haplogroup concordance improved by 42.7%, 44.6%, and 43.3% for MAF = 1%, 0.5%, and 0.1%, respectively (Supplementary Table 4 Table 7 ). The bestperforming ISM (Illumina HumanHap 240S) correctly assigned 99.8% of haplogroups after haplotype imputation, a small improvement of 0.8%. The worst performing group of ISMs (HumanOmni1-Quads) correctly assigned 52.3% of haplogroups after imputation compared to 12.9% before imputation. Correct assignment for the worst performing individual ISM (HumanOmni 2.5) increased from 4.9% to 64.0% after imputation. The greatest improvement was 64.8% for the HumanCore ISMs. In terms of genotype concordance, the mean MCC = 0.64 (95% CI = 0.60, 0.68, Supplementary Table 7) , to MCC = 0.97 for the best performing ISM (Infinium Global Screening Array-24v2) and to MCC = 0.10 for the worst performing ISM (HumanOmni 2.5)."}, {"section_title": "Overall Haplogroup Concordance", "text": "Concordance of individual haplogroups was estimated at the macro-haplogroup level. Prior to imputation, less than 49% of sequences from haplogroups M, HV, D, L, A, H, J, W, I, V were assigned to their correct haplogroup (Supplementary Table 8 ). Imputation improved haplogroup assignment by between 30% and 83%. Microarray assignment was relatively good ( >74%) for haplogroups R, B, U, N, C, T, K, so improvement from imputation was, correspondingly, minor to moderate (0.1%-18%). Haplogroups JT and X showed no improvement."}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "To illustrate the utility of MitoImpute, we tested our pipeline on 258 participants from the ADNI dataset who had both WGS (Ridge et al., 2018) and genotyping data (Saykin et al., 2010) (Supplementary Table 9 ). The ADNI genotype data were mapped to the rCRS. Hi-MC (Smieszek et al., 2018) was used to assign haplogroups to the WGS, genotyped, and imputed data. Genotype data assigned the correct haplogroup to 31.4% of samples, which improved to 91.9% (Supplementary Table 10 ) after imputation. The corresponding improvement for macrohaplogroups was 37.2% to 95%. Eight of nineteen macro-haplogroups showed no improvement as the genotype data provided perfect or near-perfect haplogroup assignment. Haplogroups J, L2, frequently observed and showed an improvement of 5.8% to 100%. Haplogroups N & R were the worst performing post-imputation at 25% and 36.4%, respectively (Supplementary Table 11 ).\nFollowing imputation the mean genotype concordance per mtSNV was MCC = 0.71 (95% CI = 0.66, 0.75)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The MitoImpute pipeline improves haplogroup assignment in many commonly used microarrays, as demonstrated in the IMS analysis. By applying MitoImpute to the ADNI dataset, we further demonstrated that MitoImpute can be utilised by long-term studies whose older datasets have limited mtSNV genotypes, thus making them comparable with newer resequenced datasets.\nAdditionally, by incorporating a globally-diverse mitochondrial sequence Reference Panel, we demonstrate MitoImpute's utility in non-European populations. MitoImpute provides an opportunity for datasets with limited mitochondrial genetic variation to be analyzed with a more complete set of genetic variants and a more accurate assignment of haplogroups."}]
