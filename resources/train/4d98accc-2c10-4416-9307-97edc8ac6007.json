[{"section_title": "The Economic Well-Being of Farm and Nonfarm Households: Evidence from Two", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "National Surveys", "text": "The economic well-being of farm households and the parity of well-being between farm and nonfarm households have been of enormous interest to agricultural policymakers since the 1930s. Common goals of agricultural policy have been to provide financial support for agricultural production, increase farm income and well-being, and provide safety net for farmers. For example, one of the provisions of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (also referred as the 2002 Farm Bill) gives income support to farmers who grow any of the eight program crops. Another provision of the 2002 Farm Bill offers further help to young and beginning farmers and ranchers to establish their farm businesses by increasing access to credit and conservation opportunities. The presumption has been that providing support to farm households would increase their economic well-being so that it becomes comparable to that of their nonfarm peers. Comparing the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households is complicated because of their diversity. Many farm households today have complex organization and structure and engage in both farm and off-farm activities. While farming is a major source of business income for some households, it is a lifestyle choice for others who derive most of their income off the farm. Nonfarm households also differ along several important dimensions, one of which is whether they engage in entrepreneurial/business activities. Because households are heterogeneous with respect to their degree of involvement in business activities, these differences need to be accounted for when farm and nonfarm households are compared. Economic well-being may also depend on the life-cycle stage of the households. It is expected that both farm and nonfarm households will have a hump-shaped distribution, with lower income and wealth for younger and older households than that for middle aged households. However, it is not clear whether young farm households have significantly lower well-being and/or more unequally distributed income and wealth compared to their older farm peers and their young nonfarm peers. Examining these trends has important implications for farm policy that currently provides special assistance for young farmers. The objective of this study is to undertake a comprehensive comparison of the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households using two national, representative surveys. The major contribution of this study is the consideration of two important dimensions of heterogeneity: the degree of involvement in business activities and differences across life-cycle stages for the households. Households' economic well-being will be examined and compared in terms of average levels and distribution among households using three methods: Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests, regression analysis, and inequality distributions. The results from this analysis will reveal important insights into the parity of well-being between farm and nonfarm families."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Issues and Previous Studies", "text": "Economists and policymakers have long been interested in measuring the economic well-being of the population both within the U.S. and across countries. Several measures have been proposed to quantify the economic well-being of families such as income, earnings, wealth, and consumption expenditures (Rodriguez et al. 2002). In the agricultural sector, income and wealth have been frequently used to measure economic well-being (Carlin and Reinsel 1973;El-Osta and Morehart 2004;Mishra et al. 2002). An analysis of economic well-being includes considerations of both the average levels and the distribution of income and wealth across families. Previous studies have examined either the well-being of all households in the U.S. or the well-being of farm families. Only a few studies have compared farm and nonfarm households using national, representative data sets, and their analyses were limited in scope (Hopkins and Morehart 2004;Mishra et al. 2002). This study provides a more comprehensive analysis of the comparative economic well-being between farm and nonfarm households, based on both the degree of involvement in business activities and the life-cycle stages of the households, in addition to testing for significant differences in well-being among different groups of households. An important dimension of heterogeneity among households is their involvement in entrepreneurial/business activities. Entrepreneurs are usually defined as people who are selfemployed or who own a business (Gentry and Hubbard 2004). The difference between the two groups is that households that own businesses have made capital investments similar to farm households, whereas self-employed individuals may have only invested their human capital in their entrepreneurial activities. Because the goal is to compare farm and nonfarm households, nonfarm entrepreneurs are considered as those households that own a business rather than those who are self-employed. Previous research has shown that the income and wealth of nonfarm households differ significantly based on their involvement with business activities. Several reasons have been offered for these differences, such as liquidity constraints associated with investing in a business and/or different savings behavior for business owners and wage earners (Gentry and Hubbard 2004;Hurst and Lusardi 2004;Quadrini 2000). Farm households also differ based on their degree of involvement with farming. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has developed three farm typology groups: rural residence farms (limited-resource, retirement, and residential/lifestyle), intermediate farms (those with sales less than $250,000 and whose operators report farming as their major business) and commercial farms (those with sales greater than $250,000). Although rural residence farms by definition own a farm business, the average rural residence farm household reports a negative farm income, where the farm business detracts from the total household income. Because rural residence farm households derive their income from off-farm sources, the hypothesis tested in this study is that their well-being (and in particular income) will not be significantly different from that of wageearning nonfarm households who do not own a business. On the other hand, since commercial farms derive the majority of their income from their farm businesses, it is hypothesized that their well-being will be comparable to that of nonfarm households operating businesses in different sectors of the economy. Another important dimension of heterogeneity among households is based on their lifecycle stages. The life-cycle hypothesis predicts that both income and wealth exhibit a humpshaped form, where income and wealth increase until retirement and then decline after retirement. The life-cycle hypothesis cannot be tested with cross-sectional data, as is the case in this study, because age and cohort effects cannot be disentangled from a single cross section of data (Alessie, Lusardi, and Aldershof 1997;Jappelli 1999). However, while cross-sectional data cannot measure changes in households' well-being as they age over time, these data can be used to document differences in well-being across households at various stages in the life cycle in a given year. Several studies have found that even in a cross-sectional context, households at various stages of the life cycle differ with respect to their well-being, consumer debt choices, and portfolio allocation of wealth (Baek and Hong 2004;Milligan 2005;Poterba and Samwick 1997). Thus, another hypothesis tested in this study is whether economic well-being differs across young, middle-aged, and old households in a cross-sectional context. Such cross-sectional differences in well-being have important implications for farm policy because some government support is particularly targeted for young and beginning farmers."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "Comparisons of the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households are conducted in terms of income and net worth. Because of household heterogeneity, analyses are also conducted for subgroups of households based on their involvement in business activities and their life-cycle stages. Three methods are used to compare the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households: Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests, regression analysis, and inequality distributions."}, {"section_title": "Mean Separation Tests", "text": "Tukey-Kramer tests are used to test for the equality of mean income and net worth for farm and nonfarm household groups based on their business activities and life-cycle stages. A t-test is normally used to compare means when two groups are present. However, comparing the means of more than two groups requires the use of multiple comparison tests. When  where i y and j y are the means, s i and s j are the standard errors, and n i and n j are the number of observations for group i and j, respectively, and ( ; , ) q k v \u03b1 is the critical value for k normally distributed variables with v degrees of freedom at the \u03b1 significance level. In this study, Tukey-Kramer tests are used to test for significant differences in well-being among households with different involvement in business activities and at different stages of the life cycle.\nTukey-Kramer mean separation tests are conducted for the three typologies of farm households and the two types of nonfarm households to test whether there are significant differences between farm and nonfarm households based on their involvement with business activities. The life-cycle stages of the households also affect the inequality in income and wealth, but both farm and nonfarm households exhibit similar trends. Except for the nonentrepreneurial households, the oldest groups of households typically have the highest income inequality. Wealth inequalities are generally highest for the youngest groups of households, with the exception of entrepreneurial nonfarm households. Overall, these findings indicate that income inequality is similar for farm and nonfarm households, while wealth is less equally distributed among nonfarm households. Income inequality differs based on the level of entrepreneurship, with higher income inequalities for both farm and nonfarm households who are more involved with business activities. However, wealth inequality is not affected by the level of entrepreneurship. The life-cycle patterns of inequalities are similar across households, with income inequality being highest for the oldest households while wealth inequality is highest for the youngest households."}, {"section_title": "Regression Analysis", "text": "Regression analysis is often used to test for differences across life-cycles stages where these lifecycle stages are represented with indicator variables. In this study, regression analysis is used to test whether the youngest households have a significantly lower well-being than their older peers. In comparison to the Tukey-Kramer tests, the advantage of regression analysis is that other control variables that are assumed to influence economic well-being may also be included. Education and family size are assumed to affect income and wealth, and are therefore included as control variables. The regression models are estimated for all farm and nonfarm households and also for subgroups of households based on their business activities."}, {"section_title": "Inequality Distributions", "text": "Farm and nonfarm households may have similar average well-being but the distribution of income and wealth among households may be different. The degrees of inequality in the income and wealth distributions are measured using Gini coefficients. A Gini coefficient of 0 shows a perfectly equal distribution of income and wealth among households. On the other hand, a Gini coefficient of 1 shows extreme inequality where one household holds all income or net worth. A difference of 0.01 in Gini coefficients is generally considered statistically significant (Rodriquez et al. 2002). The Gini coefficient is calculated using the following formula: where the households are ranked in ascending order of y i , and i y and n i are the mean and the number of observations of group i, respectively. Gini coefficients are calculated for groups of households based on their involvement with business activities and their life-cycle stages, and the results are compared for farm and nonfarm households."}, {"section_title": "Data and Results", "text": "This study uses data from two national surveys: the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), which is conducted annually by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Survey of  Mishra et al. 2002). Reports summarizing the SCF data usually use an additional group with household heads older than 75 years, but for consistency the last two SCF age categories are combined to match the definitions of the farm households' age groups (Aizcorbe, Kennickell, and Moore 2003;Bucks, Kennickell, and Moore 2006). The classification of households by their life-cycle stages produces reasonable sample sizes in each group. Economic well-being is represented by the total household income and net worth (wealth) of the farm and nonfarm households. In the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, total household income was recorded for 2003, whereas net worth was recorded as of the time of the interview (June to December 2004). In order to match the time periods between the two surveys as well as possible, the 2004 ARMS data are used, which include total household income for 2003 (as well as 2004) and net worth estimated as of December 31, 2004. 2,3 Net worth is estimated differently in the two data sets. In the SCF, the net worth of the business is reported as the value at which the respondent estimated that he/she could sell his/her business. In the ARMS data, the farm business's net worth is estimated as the difference between total farm assets and total farm liabilities. Therefore, the results from the wealth comparisons must be interpreted with caution because of the different valuation methods used. Tables 1 and 2 "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "This paper compares the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households using national, Income and wealth comparisons between farm and nonfarm households reveal several interesting results. While on average farm and nonfarm households have similar economic wellbeing, they also differ in their level of involvement in business activities. The Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests show that the well-being of rural residence and intermediate farms is generally similar to that of wage-earning nonfarm households, while commercial farms have similar economic well-being to that of business-owning nonfarm households. The economic well-being of households also differs based on their life-cycle stages. The Tukey-Kramer tests and regression analysis show that young farm households have significantly lower wealth but not significantly lower incomes compared to their older peers. On the other hand, young nonfarm households have both lower income and lower wealth than their peers. Income for the oldest rural residence and nonentrepreneurial households is significantly lower than that of their younger counterparts. Overall, farm households do not exhibit strong life-cycle trends in income while nonfarm households do. Farm and nonfarm households have similar lifecycle patterns for wealth. Income and wealth inequalities among households are examined using Gini coefficients. Results show that income and wealth exhibit similar degrees of inequality for farm households whereas income is more equally distributed than wealth for nonfarm households. Income inequality among households is larger for both farm and nonfarm households that are more involved with business activities. However, wealth inequality does not seem to differ based on the business activities of the households. Generally, income inequality is higher for older households while wealth inequality is higher among households headed by younger individuals. The insights from this study have important implications for the new Farm Bill discussions that focus on the economic well-being of farm households and the parity of wellbeing between farm and nonfarm households. As of 2004, farm households do not seem disadvantaged compared to nonfarm households in terms of both the average income and wealth levels and the distribution of income and wealth among households. These findings suggest that previous and current assistance to agriculture has been successful in raising the well-being of farm households to levels comparable to those of nonfarm households. The well-being of young and beginning farmers is of particular interest to policymakers. Further studies may explore the effectiveness of government assistance in increasing the economic well-being of farm households. The contribution of government payments to total household income is relatively easy to separate from other sources of income. However, the accumulation of previous government subsidies into farm wealth through savings would be more difficult to determine. In addition, other studies have shown that previous government payments have lead to increased farm land values and thus an increase in farm wealth. The findings of this study are based on cross-sectional data from two national surveys for 2004. 5 Conclusions based on cross-sectional data have to be interpreted with caution. One of the goals of the Farm Bill is to provide a safety net for farmers when they experience loss of income. While the results in this study show that farm and nonfarm households had similar economic well-being in 2004, income for farm households may be more volatile over time, which may necessitate government support to establish a safety net for farm households.
