[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated clinical disease, COVID-19, led to a global pandemic in early 2020, with more than 3 million cases and more than 200,000 deaths as of April 2020.1 The initial published reports of COVID-19 describe the most common presenting symptoms as fever, cough, and dyspnea.2\u20136 While many people recovered, reports from China, Italy, and the United States showed that approximately 5% of patients required intensive care, and 1.7 to 7.2% died.1,7,8 The majority of clinical and outcomes data on COVID-19 have been from Asia and Europe,4,6,7,9\u201314 although data are now emerging from the United States. In particular, studies have reported the clinical features and outcomes of hospitalized patients in Seattle, New York City, and Northern California.15\u201319 However, reports have predominantly focused on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and have not described in detail the presentation of patients with acute respiratory illness who did not have COVID-19. Without control patients, it is uncertain whether COVID-19 presents differently from other respiratory infections.\nThe prevalence of viral co-infections in patients with COVID-19 appears to be low in most but not all studies.15\u201318,20\u201323 However, these studies used conventional microbiological techniques to evaluate for co-infections that are limited in their ability to diagnose respiratory infections.24 Understanding the true scope of co-infections in patients with COVID-19 is critical to pursue appropriate diagnostics and management. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers a powerful alternative to test for viruses in a respiratory sample in an unbiased manner.25\nHere we report the clinical characteristics, diagnostics, and outcomes of all patients presenting with respiratory illness to a tertiary academic medical center in San Francisco at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We compare patients with COVID-19 disease to patients presenting during the same time period with an acute respiratory illness and report the prevalence of viral respiratory infections using both conventional microbiology and mNGS."}, {"section_title": "Setting and design ::: Methods", "text": "We conducted a retrospective cohort study to describe the characteristics, diagnostics, and outcomes of patients with respiratory illness presenting to the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Health Emergency Department (ED) during the COVID-19 outbreak, comparing patients with and without COVID-19 disease. We identified all patients 18 years or older who underwent testing for COVID-19 within 24 hours of presentation to the ED between February 3 and March 31, 2020.\nTwo physicians blinded to patients\u2019 COVID-19 status, independently reviewed the documented clinical presentation of all patients and included only those who presented with acute respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnea) or influenza-like illness symptoms (e.g., fever, myalgias). Discordant results were re-reviewed together and a consensus decision was reached on all cases (Appendix Figure 1). If patients had multiple encounters during the time period, the first encounter was examined. Patients who were discharged and readmitted within 48 hours were considered a single clinical encounter and outcomes ascertained throughout the encounter."}, {"section_title": "Patient characteristics ::: Methods", "text": "Patient medical records were reviewed by trained physician chart reviewers and relevant data on initial presentation, radiology findings, and outcomes were abstracted using standardized case review forms. Additional information on patient demographics, vital signs, and laboratory results were obtained from the Epic-based electronic health record. We characterized patients\u2019 comorbidities and their presenting signs and symptoms based on the admission History & Physical and Emergency Department documentation. If a specific comorbidity was not mentioned in the admission documentation, it was considered not present. Records were also reviewed to obtain results of laboratory tests and chest imaging reports within the first 24 hours after admission."}, {"section_title": "Clinical microbiological testing ::: Methods", "text": "Clinician-ordered testing for COVID-19 was carried out at the UCSF Clinical Microbiology Laboratory by performing reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on RNA extracted from oropharyngeal and/or nasopharyngeal swab specimens using primers targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. At the time of the study, PCR results were available at the earliest within 3 hours, and the median time to result was 16 hours. Twenty-six (8%) of the patients had SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing performed at other institutions using their clinically validated assays. Conventional testing for other respiratory viruses was carried out on 270/316 (85%) of patients. This was performed using a 12-target respiratory viral PCR assay (adenovirus, influenza AH1/AH3/B, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, respiratory syncytial viruses A/B) or a 3-target (influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus PCR) at the discretion of treating clinicians. Bacterial and fungal respiratory pathogens were assessed by semi-quantitative cultures. Patient blood cultures were performed via inoculation into BD Bactec Plus Aerobic and Lytic Anaerobic media (Becton Dickinson)."}, {"section_title": "Respiratory virus detection by metagenomic sequencing ::: Methods", "text": "To further screen for the presence of other respiratory viral pathogens, metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of RNA was performed on available residual RNA extracted for COVID-19 clinical PCR testing on 107 randomly selected patients. After DNase treatment, human ribosomal RNA depletion was carried out using FastSelect (Qiagen). To control for background contamination, we included negative controls (water and HeLa cell RNA) as well as positive controls (spike-in dilution series of RNA standards from the External RNA Controls Consortium [ERCC]).26 The latter enabled subsequent bioinformatic assessment of the total RNA mass input in each sample.27\nRNA was then fragmented and subjected to a modified metagenomic spiked sequencing primer enrichment (MSSPE) library preparation method.28 Briefly, a 1:1 mixture of the NEBNext Ultra II RNAseq Library Prep (New England Biolabs) random primer stock and a pool of SARS-CoV-2 primers at 100 \u03bcM was used at the first strand synthesis step of the standard RNAseq library preparation protocol to enrich for the recovery of reads spanning the length of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence in the context of mNGS analysis.29 RNA-seq libraries underwent 146 nucleotide paired-end Illumina sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000."}, {"section_title": "mNGS bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis ::: Methods", "text": "Following demultiplexing, reads were host- and quality-filtered and then subjected to viral reference based alignment at both the nucleotide and amino acid level against sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide (NT) and non-redundant (NR) databases, followed by assembly using previously validated bioinformatics pipelines.30,31 Samples (n=10) with insufficient input RNA for accurate viral assessment (< 25 pg, calculated based on alignments to positive control ERCC RNA standards) were considered invalid, leaving 97 subjects available for analysis.\nNegative control (water and HeLa cell RNA) samples enabled estimating the number of background reads to each virus, which were normalized by input mass determined based on the ratio of sample reads to spike-in positive control ERCC RNA standards.27 Viruses with sequencing reads significantly greater compared to negative controls (adjusted p value < 0.05 using a Holm-Bonferroni correction within each sample) were identified by modeling the number of background reads as a negative binomial distribution with mean and dispersion fitted on the negative controls. For phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, we constructed genomes using minimap232 to align reads to the reference MN908947.3 and iVar33 to trim primers and call variants, then restricted to samples with at least 10-fold coverage of at least 97% (29 kilobases) of the genome (n=10), and utilized the Nextstrain34 pipeline to build a phylogenetic tree using iqtree.35 Viral genomic data is publicly accessible via gisaid.org (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data)36 and Genbank (MT385414 - MT385497)."}, {"section_title": "Treatment and Outcomes ::: Methods", "text": "Clinical treatment and outcomes were ascertained through a combination of chart review and extraction of structured fields from the electronic health record.

Patients were considered to have new-onset cardiomyopathy if a treating physician documented the diagnosis. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined according to the Berlin definition by two physicians.37 Acute kidney injury was defined using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition.38 Outcome ascertainment was censored on April 25, 2020."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis ::: Methods", "text": "We used descriptive statistics to characterize the features of patients grouped by COVID infection.

Respiratory support was provided in similar proportions of patients and, when respiratory support was needed, the level of support did not differ by COVID-19 status.\nNumerically, more patients with COVID-19 required ICU care compared to non-COVID-19 patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (42% vs. 26%, p=0.092) (Table 5). When transferred to the ICU, there was no observed difference in the use of ICU interventions; however, patients with COVID-19 had a longer ICU length of stay (median 8.8 vs. 2.9 days, p=0.005).

In our study comparing acutely ill patients with and without COVID-19 presenting for emergency care, we found that patients with COVID-19 had a longer duration of symptoms, were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, had longer hospitalizations and were more likely to develop ARDS. Using standard laboratory PCR testing, and mNGS, we found a 16% prevalence of other respiratory viruses in the COVID-19 negative patients, and a lack of detectable viral co-infections in the COVID-19 positive patients.\nPatients diagnosed with COVID-19 were more likely to be Asian (44%), which may reflect differences in the dynamics of infection early in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the high proportion of people in San Francisco who self-identify as Asian (36%).44 COVID-19 patients were more likely to be never smokers, in line with other studies showing no link between tobacco use and increased COVID-19 risk.445,46 Largely similar comorbidity profiles were observed between COVID-19 positive and negative patients, aside from a higher proportion of chronic kidney disease and history of solid organ transplantation in COVID-19 patients.\nPatients diagnosed with COVID-19 had a longer duration of symptoms prior to presentation and were more likely than control patients to report fever, fatigue and myalgias. It is notable, however, that 44% of COVID-19 negative patients reported fevers and systemic symptoms were common. In contrast to other reports,4,6,7 COVID-19 positive patients in this cohort had relatively high rates of upper respiratory symptoms (21% with headache, 27% with sore throat, and 30% with congestion/rhinorrhea) and gastrointestinal symptoms. In terms of laboratory values, patients with COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have lymphopenia and no patient with COVID-19 had leukocytosis.\nDetermining rates of co-infection in patients with COVID-19 has significance given that SARS-CoV-2 testing may be deferred if an alternative respiratory pathogen is identified, especially in settings with limited test availability. In this cohort, no patients with COVID-19 had evidence of viral co-infection, by either clinical PCR testing or by mNGS analysis. Only one COVID-19 positive patient had evidence of co-infection with a bacterial respiratory pathogen, and no difference in the prevalence of bacterial co-infection was identified based on COVID-19 status. These results are distinct from those reported in a recent study of COVID-positive patients that found a 21% rate of viral co-infections23 but consistent with data from several other institutions demonstrating very low rates (\u22646%) of viral or bacterial co-infection in hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients, including two recent large studies from New York City.15\u201318,20\u201323 Further investigation of co-infections in COVID-19 positive patients, and assessment of their potential impact on disease severity and outcomes is needed, especially if SARS-CoV-2 circulation extends to overlap with other highly prevalent seasonal respiratory pathogens.\nAlthough patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be diagnosed with ARDS, there were no differences in their need for ICU care or mechanical ventilation. We also did not find significant differences in terms of acquired cardiomyopathy or troponin elevation during the hospitalization. Despite concerns for cardiac complications in COVID-19 positive patients, our findings highlight the importance of comparisons to control groups of hospitalized patients.16,47,48 Large proportions of patients in both groups received broad-spectrum antibiotics, despite all of the COVID-19 positive patients having a confirmed viral etiology. This has important implications for antibiotic stewardship in the COVID-19 era and likely reflects clinical uncertainty about the true rate of bacterial co-infection early in the pandemic. COVID-19 was associated with longer hospital lengths of stay. While the duration of hospitalization may reflect the severity of illness, it could also be a marker of concern for late decompensation in these patients49 or difficulties with hospital discharge due to requirements for isolation and infection control.\nPrior studies describing the clinical presentation of patients with COVID-19 have for the most part identified non-specific features that characterize respiratory infections in general. To our knowledge this is the first U.S. study to identify characteristics distinguishing patients with COVID-19 from patients who underwent investigation for COVID-19 but were ultimately found to have an alternate diagnosis. Previous publications on this topic are primarily smaller in scope and are all outside of the US.39,40,42 The clinical, laboratory, and imaging data we highlight have important implications for front line providers making decisions in real-time regarding the pre-test probability of COVID-19, especially in settings with limited access to rapid COVID-19 diagnostics.\nIn contrast to other areas in the United States, the Bay Area has not yet experienced a large surge in cases of COVID-19. The fact that resources were not strained may have affected the clinical course and outcomes observed. For example, while sample size is not sufficient to evaluate differences in mortality, only one of the 33 with COVID-19 died (3%), which is lower than in other studies of hospitalized U.S. patients.17,18 There is speculation that variations in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains may affect pathogenicity and contribute to geographic differences in case fatality rates.50,51 Exploratory phylogenetic analysis presented here demonstrated a diversity of strains among the COVID-19 patients requiring ICU care without a predominant clade; larger studies are needed to assess any potential relationship.\nThere are several limitations inherent to the study design and data available that should be considered when interpreting the results of this study. As a retrospective study based in a single academic medical center and focusing on patients presenting for emergency care, it may not generalize to other institutions with different patient populations or patients with milder forms of disease. Variation in clinician assessment and documentation may lead to misclassification of some variables. Although all patients in the COVID-19 negative group presented with respiratory complaints and/or influenza-like illness, only 56% of patients were given a final diagnosis of respiratory infection, which may affect the generalizability of our outcomes data. Finally, this study was undertaken at the end of the influenza season and during a period of social distancing, both of which likely impacted the prevalence of circulating viruses and the rate of co-infections.\nIn summary, while many clinical features of COVID-19 overlap with those of other acute respiratory illnesses, several unique characteristics were identified. Patients with COVID-19 had a longer duration of symptoms, particularly fatigue, fever, and myalgias, were more likely to be admitted to the hospital and for a longer duration, were unlikely to have co-existent viral infections, and were more likely to develop ARDS. Though this health system has not experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases, these key clinical characteristics may, in part, explain the observed differences in propensity of COVID-19 to strain health systems. While we did find meaningful differences that may inform one\u2019s clinical suspicion for COVID-19, we did not find significant differences in cardiopulmonary comorbidities, ACE inhibitor/ARB use, or mortality rate. These findings enhance understanding of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison to other acute respiratory illnesses."}]
