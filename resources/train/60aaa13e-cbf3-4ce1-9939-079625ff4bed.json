[{"section_title": "M", "text": "ultiple biomarkers have proved sensitive to AD and MCI, a potential prodromal stage of AD. These include patterns of regional cerebral atrophy and hypometabolism detected by MR imaging and FDG-PET 1 and quantification of specific proteins in the CSF, including the tau protein and A\u242442. 2 Tau is associated with axonal microtubules and is the main structural element of neurofibrils in AD. High CSF tau levels probably reflect axonal degeneration.\n3 A\u242442 is derived from cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, and CSF A\u242442 levels are lowered early in AD, possibly due to sequestering of A\u242442 in neuritic plaques. 4 A full spectrum of imaging and CSF analysis methods is seldom used; thus, knowledge is limited on how they may best be combined. The ADNI, a large multisite study, was launched to enable analyses of combinations of different candidate biomarkers for AD.\nRecent findings indicate that MR imaging can be used to quantify regional atrophy in MCI, distinguishing early and later preclinical stages of AD, 5 and such measures are predictive of clinical decline across 1 year. [6] [7] [8] A pattern of parietotemporal metabolic reductions in MCI and AD and frontal metabolic reductions later in the disease has been established through the last decades of research 1, 9, 10 and has recently been confirmed in ADNI PET data. 11 The relative sensitivity of FDG-PET and MR imaging morphometry to AD-related changes is, however, not well established. It has been assumed that metabolic changes associated with neocortical dysfunction may be detectable by FDG-PET before atrophy appears. Consistent with this assumption, De Santi et al 12 reported that metabolism reductions exceeded volume losses in MCI, and Mosconi et al 13 found the same in presymptomatic early-onset familial AD. However, Jagust et al 14 found that cingulate hypometabolism was a significant risk factor in addition to MR imaging measures of hippocampal atrophy, but the latter was a more statistically robust risk factor in a group of cognitively impaired but not demented elderly. 15 Different brain characteristics relevant for the understanding of MCI and AD may be captured by FDG-PET and MR imaging morphometry. For instance, a report based on ADNI data has indicated that FDG-PET and MR imaging measures may be complementary and differentially sensitive to memory in health and disease, with metabolism being the stronger predictor in healthy controls and morphometry most related to memory function in AD. 16 As for CSF\u03eaMR imaging relations, recent reports [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] indicate that cerebral anatomic differences are related to tau and A\u242442 and behavioral cognitive measures in AD and MCI. However, MR imaging and CSF biomarkers have not simultaneously been related and compared with information obtained by FDG-PET. It is important to test the specific sensitivity of all biomarkers simultaneously to be able to optimize the combination of measures in diagnosis and prognosis. We investigated the following: 1) which methods are the most sensitive to established AD-related pathology, 2) to what extent the methods provide unique-versus-overlapping information, and 3) which methods are the most predictive of clinical decline across 2 years."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "The raw data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI data base (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI).

Table 2 shows the results of the separate logistic stepwise regressions predicting NC-versus-AD classification on the basis of MR imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF measures. Hippocampal volume and entorhinal and retrosplenial thickness, for MR imaging, were included in the final model, yielding an overall classification accuracy of 85.0%, and approximately 71% explained variance (Nagelkerke R 2 ). Entorhinal, retrosplenial, and lateral orbitofrontal metabolism, for FDG-PET, were included in the final model, yielding an overall classification accuracy of 82.5% and approximately 62% explained variance. For CSF, the ratio of t-tau/A\u242442 was the single unique predictor, yielding an overall classification accuracy of 81.2%, and approximately 52% explained variance. Thus, hippocampal volume; entorhinal and retrosplenial thickness; entorhinal, retrosplenial, and lateral orbitofrontal metabolism; and t-tau/A\u242442 ratio were entered in a logistic regression analysis to classify NC versus AD, and the results are shown in Table 3 .\nIn the final model, hippocampal volume, retrosplenial thickness, and t-tau/A\u242442-ratio were included as predictors, yielding an overall classification accuracy of 88.8% and approximately 78% explained variance.

Predicted values from logistic regressions were used for calculation of the ROC curves. Statistical comparisons of the AUCs of these classifiers were performed by using the method of Hanley and McNeil. 49 This approach yielded a significant difference (P \u03fd. 05) between the AUCs using hippocampal volume alone versus using hippocampal volume and t-tau/A\u242442 ratio in combination and hippocampal volume, t-tau/A\u242442 ratio, and retrosplenial thickness in combination. The difference of the AUCs using hippocampal volume and t-tau/A\u242442 ratio versus hippocampal volume, t-tau/A\u242442 ratio, and retrosplenial thickness in combination was clearly smaller and not significant (P \u03fe .05). Note however, that all meaningful differences in AUCs (eg, in terms of sensitivity versus specificity causing the curves to cross) may not necessarily be captured as statistically significant. The same set of predictor variables was entered in an analysis to predict diagnostic classification for NC and MCI, which revealed that hippocampal volume and t-tau/ A\u242442 ratio were unique predictors, yielding an overall classi- fication accuracy of 79.1% and approximately 40% explained variance. Table 4 shows correlations for each variable included in the regression models and the cognitive change scores (CDR-SB, MMSE, delayed logical memory). In MCI, baseline retrosplenial thickness correlated with a 2-year change in CDR-SB and MMSE, where a thicker cortex was associated with less CDR-SB elevation and less MMSE reduction. Retrosplenial and entorhinal metabolism correlated negatively with MMSE change. Hippocampal volume correlated positively with delayed logical memory. There were no significant correlations with clinical change measures for t-tau/A\u242442 in MCI. T tests of the Fisher z-transformed correlation coefficients showed that the t-tau/A\u242442 ratio correlated significantly lower (P \u03fd .05) with CDR-SB and MMSE change than did retrosplenial thickness and it correlated significantly lower with MMSE change than did entorhinal and retrosplenial metabolism. Lateral orbitofrontal metabolism also correlated significantly lower with change in CDR-SB and delayed logical memory than did retrosplenial thickness and hippocampal volume.\nIn the stepwise regression analysis predicting CDR-SB change, only retrosplenial cortical thickness was included as a unique predictor (y \u03ed 1.231 \u03ea0.731x, P \u03ed .002), explaining 18% of the variance. In predicting MMSE change, retrosplenial metabolism was included in the first step (y \u03ed \u03ea1.193 \u03e9 1.534 x 1 , P \u03ed .002 for x 1 , R 2 \u03ed 0.22), and retrosplenial thickness was added in the second (y \u03ed \u03ea1.197 \u03e9 1.177x 1 \u03e9 0.776 x 2 , P \u03ed .009 for x 1 and .042 for x 2 , R 2 \u03ed 0.29).

The regression plots for CDR-SB and MMSE change predicted from retrosplenial thickness and metabolism and delayed logical memory predicted from hippocampal volume are shown in Fig 3.

The best classification accuracy of NC versus AD was obtained by MR imaging morphometry measures (hippocampal volume, entorhinal and retrosplenial cortical thickness). However, classification accuracies close to those obtained by MR imaging were also obtained by FDG-PET (entorhinal, retrosplenial, and lateral orbitofrontal metabolism) and CSF measures (t-tau/A\u242442-ratio). In the multimodal analysis, FDG-PET measures appeared to provide largely redundant information, whereas hippocampal volume, retrosplenial thickness, and the t-tau/A\u242442 ratio were unique predictors of diagnostic status. In particular, the inclusion of the CSF biomarker in addition to MR imaging hippocampal volume did result in a significant improvement in classification in terms of AUC. Thus, the combination of MR imaging morphometry and CSF biomarkers yielded the highest diagnostic classification accuracy. Contrary to this finding, in the prediction of clinical change during 2 years, FDG-PET and MR imaging morphometry were the best predictors. However, with the exception of retrosplenial metabolism and thickness in the prediction of change in MMSE scores, the 2 measures were largely redundant. Thus, it seems that the benefits of including both MR imaging morphometry and FDG-PET are modest in predicting clinical decline in MCI. Whereas CSF biomarkers added to the diagnostic accuracy at baseline, they did not predict 2-year clinical decline in the current MCI group. This finding may be somewhat surprising because previous studies have found decreased CSF A\u242442 and/or tau or tau/A\u242442 levels to be predictive of future dementia in patients with MCI. 2 Several factors may have contributed to the discrepancies. First, the ongoing ADNI study may have a more heterogeneous MCI group than some of the previously published CSF studies. As pointed out by Hansson et al, 50 participants included in CSF studies have generally been highly selected, for example, by inclusion of only patients with MCI who progress to AD. In ADNI, the ultimate end point is not known for many patients with MCI. Further, studies have often used dichotomized variables for CSF values and prognosis. 50, 51 A stable/conversion dichotomization involves clinical judgment, which may vary from physician to physician and demands long follow-up intervals impractical for clinical trials. It may be advantageous to identify other preselection criteria, biomarkers, or clinical measures of decline than conversion. Therefore, it is important to relate the biomarkers to easily administered continuous behavioral measures. Most interesting, another study investigating continuous variables 52 did not find any association between MMSE change and change in CSF levels of either A\u242442, tau, or p-tau (r \u03ed 0.18, \u03ea.03, and \u03ea.07, respectively). This does not mean that CSF measures are not related to clinical change. CSF tau/ A\u242442 ratio did correlate in the expected negative direction with change in logical delayed memory in the present sample, but the effect size was too modest to reach significance. Select MR imaging morphometry and FDG-PET measures at baseline were significantly more sensitive to 2-year change in CDR-SB and MMSE than were CSF measures. Both cortical thickness and metabolism of parietal regions of interest served as unique predictors of clinical decline, indicating that even though FDG-PET did not contribute uniquely to diagnostic classification when MR imaging morphometric variance was accounted for, some additional prognostic information can be obtained by combining the 2 imaging modalities.\nWhile the present findings show that the different biomarkers all were sensitive to diagnostic group, a question of great interest is whether the findings regarding specific measures can be applied on an individual subject basis. McEvoy et al 7 recently reported that semiautomated individually specific quantitative MR imaging methods identical to those used here can be used to identify a pattern of atrophy in MCI that is predictive of conversion to AD after 1 year. Hence, in light of the present findings also indicating somewhat superior sensitivity of such MR imaging morphometry measures compared with other biomarkers, it does seem that these measures are prime candidates to be used on an individual basis (eg, to enrich clinical trials). However, as seen from Fig 3, while the MR imaging morphometry measures evaluated here do predict 2-year change in screening and memory parameters among patients with MCI, the regression plots also show considerable scatter. Hence, while these measures can yield individual prognostic information, this will be associated with considerable uncertainty, and at present, any such estimate must be made with great caution.\nThe present results are limited by a number of factors: Participants were selected on the basis of willingness and ability to undergo MR imaging and PET scanning and lumbar puncture and may thus not be fully comparable with other samples. However, imaging is an integral part of the ADNI protocol, so participants did enter with the intention of having brain scans performed, and approximately half of the ADNI participants have also agreed to have CSF samples drawn. 53 In terms of age, MMSE score, A\u242442, t-tau, p-tau, and ratios of t-tau/A\u242442 and p-tau/A\u242442, the subgroups studied in the present article do appear to be representative of the larger ADNI sample. The mean values for these indices in the present sample appear very similar to those reported by Shaw et al 53 for 410 participants with CSF measures, and all the present mean values for age, MMSE, and CSF measures for NC, MCI, and AD deviate less than one-fifth of the SDs from the means reported by Shaw et al for the larger groups. Still, the present sample may, of course, not be fully representative of the general population. Furthermore, the multisite design of the ADNI is likely to add some noise in data collection. Finally, the ADNI study is still ongoing, and the ultimate status of the current MCI group is unknown. That being said, the present study involving multiple sites and 2 years of follow-up likely represents a more realistic model for current clinical trial designs than longer interval single-site studies."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Each of the biomarkers demonstrated potential to inform diagnosis and/or prognosis and enrich clinical trials. As a single classifier, MR imaging morphometry (hippocampal volume) was the most sensitive to diagnostic group, but the inclusion of CSF biomarkers (t-tau/A\u242442) did result in significant improvement of classification (NC/AD). Still, both quantitative MR imaging morphometry and regional metabolism as assessed by coregistered FDG-PET data provided better prediction of clinical decline than did CSF biomarkers. MR imaging morphometry showed somewhat superior diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and is the least invasive, least expensive, and most widely available method. MR images are often routinely required as part of the diagnostic work-up, so a broader application of MR imaging morphometry may be feasible and useful."}]
