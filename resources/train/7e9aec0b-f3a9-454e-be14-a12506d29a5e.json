The association between WMH volume and APOE \u03b54 status with cerebral Ab (standardized b 5 1.12 and 0.26, P 5 .048 and .045) was confirmed in the PPMI cohort.

Preclinical AD is defined based on the presence of cerebral amyloidosis, detected by either amyloid PET or measurement of cerebrospinal Ab [3] . We focus here on preclinical AD, which is simply defined as presence of cerebral Ab [3] . Presence of preclinical AD does not necessarily imply that clinical AD will result but does appear to come with a higher risk of developing clinical AD [4] . Because of the importance of preclinical AD, an accurate and thorough understanding of the cognitive and brain changes at this stage is critical. Furthermore, predictors of preclinical AD are potentially valuable in the context of clinical trials to enrich populations before the use of more expensive or invasive amyloid measurement.\nWithin cognitively normal older adults, two predictors of amyloid status have already been relatively well established: age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status [5, 6] . Beyond these risks, it is possible that other neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognitive changes that presumptively represent the downstream effect of the presence of cerebral Ab, such as hippocampal atrophy, hypometabolism, and subjective cognitive impairment, may also be sensitive to preclinical AD [7] [8] [9] . Although these markers clearly predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to probable AD [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] and the presence of cerebral amyloid in MCI to varying degrees [15] , their value in preclinical disease is less well established.\nOne neuroimaging measure that has received less, but growing, attention in relationship to AD is the presence of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. WMH volume has been associated with clinical AD [16, 17] , cognitive ability [18] , cortical atrophy [19] , and AD pathology in cognitively normal populations [20] , but no study has examined the association of WMH volume with preclinical AD in the context of more established imaging and cognitive AD biomarkers. Here, we compare the association of a variety of biomarkers, including neurodegenerative, genetic, functional, and cognitive biomarkers, as well as WMH volume, with preclinical AD. This comparison sheds light on the pathogenesis of AD and can inform subsequent studies on longitudinal trajectories of AD biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Clinical data 2.2.

Given the importance of memory in prodromal AD, we examined several of the AVLT measures, which depend on differential aspects of episodic and working memory [28] . For the present study, we analyzed performance on the fifth immediate memory trial (AVLT Trial 5 Recall), 5-minute and 30-minute delayed recall (AVLT 5-min Recall, AVLT 30-min Recall), and recognition memory discrimination (AVLT recognition discrimination). To account for false alarms to nonstudied items, we calculated a measure of discriminability, d-prime (d'), in a standard fashion [29] .\nIn addition to psychometric measures, we also examined a measure of cognitive complaints via the Everyday Cognition (ECog) questionnaire [30, 31] , using both informantreport and self-report data. Informants and participants are separately queried as to the degree to which particular everyday functioning has changed compared to 10 years earlier.

Mean florbetapir uptake in lateral and medial frontal, anterior and posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, and lateral temporal regions was normalized to uptake in the cerebellum to obtain a mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr).

Briefly, FLAIR MR images were corrected for inhomogeneity and warped to T1 images to provide a segmentation. WMHs are seeded at points that are .3.5 standard deviations from the mean signal in white matter, and final segmentation is based on a Bayesian approach, combining spatial priors and tissue class constraints.

A multiatlas skull-stripping algorithm was applied using studyspecific atlases for the extraction of the brain tissue [39] . Images with quality issues, such as low T1 resolution, were excluded from the analysis and brain masks with errors were manually corrected. A multi-atlas label-fusion method, which uses nonlinear registration for transferring atlas labels to subject space, was applied to form the basis of the white and gray matter segmentations [40, 41] . Regions of WMH were segmented using a multimodal segmentation method, white matter lesion segmentation (WMLS), using T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images [42] . WMLS is a supervised learning method that trains on lesions manually delineated by an expert radiologist. The lesion segmentation involves data preprocessing via histogram standardization and co-registration, feature extraction, training a voxelwise discriminative model, voxelwise label assignment, and false-positive elimination. Quality control was performed on final volumetric data by overlaying each subject's lesion map on the FLAIR image. None of the lesion masks had errors that would require exclusion. There were minor errors, particularly in the determination of the boundaries of large lesions.

In particular, the surprising finding that WMHs are more highly correlated with AD pathology than any of the standard AD imaging biomarkers or cognitive tests suggests that in the earliest stages of AD, vascular disease, as reflected by WMH, may play a significant role in the development of cerebral amyloidosis or be an early downstream effect of this molecular pathology. The replication of this result in an independent data set, using different image processing techniques, points to the robustness of the finding. The salient association of WMH with preclinical AD supports earlier studies [44] [45] [46] that have demonstrated a link between WMH and cognitive decline at this stage [44] . The strength of this association is in contrast to conventional thinking about this disease stage which assumes that biomarkers and, perhaps, subtle cognitive symptoms traditionally used to characterize MCI due to AD and probable AD are the same ones that would characterize preclinical AD [3, 47] . Indeed, AD biomarker cascade models do not generally include a measure of white matter integrity."}, {"section_title": "White matter hyperintensities and amyloid", "text": "The degree of association between WMH volume and amyloid deposition in nondemented control subjects is controversial. Some studies have not found a link between WMH volume or other vascular disease markers and amyloid [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] , whereas other studies, including a large (n 5 337) Amsterdam study [20, 53, 54] , have reported such a correlation. It is possible that differences in WMH calculation, such as WM histogram normalization, thresholds for defining WMH, and the incorporation of priors for segmenting WMHs, may at least partially account for these discrepancies. Standardization and rigorous comparison of competing methods for evaluating WMH volume may help to reduce the variation in results. Differential involvement of periventricular and subcortical WMH may also contribute to differing study results [55] , although the relative importance of WMH anatomic distribution as compared to total WMH volume is still a matter of debate [36] .\nThe relationship of cerebrovascular disease to clinical AD and amyloid pathology is likely complex, and an evolving understanding is emerging [56, 57] , but there are clear links between the severity of cerebrovascular disease and the risk of clinical dementia associated with AD pathology [58] . There are a number of overlapping risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and WMH with AD, Age, gender, and education level (in years) were included as covariates.

For example, poorly controlled hypertension has been found to correlate with amyloid plaque pathology [59] , and circle of Willis atherosclerosis is more highly related to AD pathology than other common proteinopathies [60, 61] . Other work has related blood pressure and systemic arterial stiffness, also associated with WMH, to amyloid burden measured by amyloid imaging [62, 63] . We did not observe statistically significant differences between mean arterial pressure, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, or history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or smoking between Ab1 and Ab2 subjects in the ADNI cohort. Although we did not have complete medical histories of all subjects in the PPMI cohort, we did not observe differences in blood pressure between Ab1 and Ab2 subjects in the PPMI cohort either. Whether these are common risk factors with dissociable associations or are more directly mechanistically related is unclear. WMH volume may be a marker of cerebral amyloid due to the increased likelihood of deposition of amyloid in vessel walls leading to development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy [64] . Alternatively, there are a number of potential mechanisms by which cerebrovascular changes may directly relate to deposition of cerebral amyloid. For example, Ab clearance may depend of the perivascular \"glymphatic\" system which is diminished by reduced arterial pulsatility or stiffness [65] . Furthermore, a number of factors associated with cerebrovascular alterations, including hypoperfusion, may accelerate Ab production [66] . An enhanced understanding of these linkages may provide vascular specific therapeutic options at presymptomatic stages."}, {"section_title": "Independent association of white matter hyperintensities and APOE status with cerebral amyloid", "text": "The finding that WMH and APOE \u03b54 carrier status are both independently associated with amyloid, and that WMH volume is not associated with APOE implies that vascular burden increases the risk for cerebral amyloid over and above this highly significant genetic risk. This finding is in consonance with other studies that have shown that WMH volume is an independent risk factor for incident dementia [67] , although not all studies have supported this result [52] . The independence of these factors is particularly interesting given the relationship of APOE with cardiovascular risk [68, 69] . Nonetheless, it is worth noting that we did not observe the same dissociation in the PPMI data set, although this could be due in part to an issue of power."}, {"section_title": "Lack of relationship with traditional AD neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognitive measures", "text": "The current findings did not support the role of neuroimaging biomarkers that have more traditionally been associated with AD in the prodromal and dementia stages of disease, including hippocampal volumes, cortical thickness, and FDG-PET. Although some prior studies have found associations between cortical thinning or volume changes and amyloid status in cognitively normal individuals [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] , this has not been a consistent finding [75] . The differences in results may be due to methodologic differences, with some studies using rate of atrophy and others cross-sectional measures. The observed inconsistency may also be due to the heterogeneity among the proposed \"stages\" of preclinical AD, which include a spectrum of neurodegeneration and cognitive Boxplots comparing log white matter hyperintensity volumes for the PPMI cohort, normalized to intracranial volume and log transformed.

This also may explain why in some instances cognitive measures have also been reported to be associated with preclinical AD [8, 76, 77] . It is worth pointing out that while not significant, hippocampal volume was smaller and 5-minute delayed recall on the AVLT was poorer in the group with evidence of cerebral amyloid. Finally, despite work suggesting a link between subjective complaints and amyloid status [7] , we did not find either the patient or informantbased ECog of value for predicting preclinical AD; this finding resonates with results from a recent meta-analysis of amyloid status in cognitively normal adults with and without subjective symptoms [5] . Although small vessel disease is typically associated with executive dysfunction, we did not observe an association between executive function and WMH volume. This lack of association may be because we studied only cognitively normal subjects, so the variance in cognitive ability is relatively limited. It also may be the case that white matter findings associated with cerebral amyloid do not have the same impact on executive function as those unassociated with amyloid and instead accompanied by more pervasive cerebrovascular disease."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Our study is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data, and a longitudinal study looking at the relative timing of the development of WMH and cerebral amyloid would be informative of the direction of causality in this relationship. The characteristics of the ADNI cohort may impact the generalizability of the findings. The ADNI cohort is racially and socioeconomically homogeneous and is relatively free of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities. It is uncertain whether the relationship between WMH and Ab would be strengthened or weakened in a more heterogeneous cohort with more prevalent cardiovascular pathology. In addition, the lack of standardization both of FLAIR imaging methods, including resolution and WMH quantification techniques makes comparisons of different populations difficult. The clinical applicability of WMH quantification would be greatly enhanced by a standardized measurement method. Additional replication in other cohorts would bolster confidence in the observed association. Although manual quality control was performed on all hippocampal and WMH segmentations to avoid major failures, it is possible that minor errors affected the results. Finally, although cerebral Ab has been adopted as the defining feature of preclinical AD, the lack of complete longitudinal data on ADNI 2/GO precludes any definitive conclusion on the impact of WMH on developing clinical AD in the future."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In our samples of cognitively normal controls, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are more highly associated with biomarker evidence of cerebral Ab than any other recognized biomarker or cognitive test. This finding challenges the assumption that biomarkers of neurodegeneration, which are well established in later stages of disease, are reliably sensitive at the preclinical stage. As the preclinical stage of AD is increasingly recognized as a period of primary importance for preventing and ameliorating incipient neurodegeneration, the importance of accurately understanding correlates of AD pathology at this stage similarly increases. At the same time, the biological mechanism of the correlation between Ab and WMH is not clear. A more thorough understanding of the nature of the relationship between Ab and WMH is necessary to establish potential targets for disease-modifying interventions. Nevertheless, it is clear that WMH should be considered as a potential biomarker for preclinical AD in addition to more widely used cognitive tests and imaging biomarkers. "}]
