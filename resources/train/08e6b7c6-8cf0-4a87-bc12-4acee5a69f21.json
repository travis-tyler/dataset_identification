[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This paper describes basic facts regarding the black-white test score gap over the first four years of school. Black children enter school substantially behind their white counterparts in reading and math, but including a small number of covariates erases the gap. Over the first four years of school, however, blacks lose substantial ground relative to other races; averaging .10 standard deviations per school year. By the end of third grade there is a large Black-White test score gap that cannot be explained by observable characteristics. Blacks are falling behind in virtually all categories of skills tested, except the most basic. None of the explanations we examine, including systematic differences in school quality across races, convincingly explain the divergent academic trajectory of Black students. racial gaps in educational achievement remain substantial. Prior research shows black children enter kindergarten lagging their white counterparts, and these differences grow throughout the school years (Campbell, Hombo, and Mazzeo 2000, Carneiro and Heckman 2002, Coleman et. al 1966, Neal 2004, Phillips, Crouse, and Ralph 1998. On every subject at each grade level there are substantial differences between Blacks and Whites (Campbell, Hombo, and Mazzeo 2000, Neal 2004). The typical Black seventeen year-old reads at the proficiency level of the typical White thirteen year-old (Campbell, Hombo, and Mazzeo 2000). Black college bound students score, on average, more than one standard deviation below white college goers; Blacks are the lowest performing minority group (Roach 2001). Even in affluent neighborhoods, achievement gaps are large (Ferguson 2001, 2002 and Ogbu 2003. Including a myriad controls, the test score gap remains essentially unchanged (Jencks and Phillips 1998). While the Brown decision provided unprecedented hope for a future of educational equality, that hope has yet to be realized.\nDespite these disturbing differences, a recent analysis of a newly available data set, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS), provides two reasons for optimism (Fryer and Levitt 2004). First, the raw test score differences for the recent cohort covered by ECLS are substantially below those found in earlier studies, suggesting the possibility of real gains by Blacks in recent cohorts. Second, in stark contrast to previous studies, Fryer and Levitt (2004) are able to eliminate the black-white test score gap for incoming kindergartners with the inclusion of just a parsimonious set of controls. Any optimism, however, is tempered by the fact that by the end of first grade (the last data used in Fryer and Levitt 2004) Black students have 3 already lost substantial ground (the equivalent of almost three months of schooling) relative to Whites. If this trend were to continue, by the tenth grade blacks would be one standard deviation behind whites -a number consistent with prior research (Jones, Burton, and Davenport 1982, Phillips et al. 1998b; Phillips 2000). Fryer and Levitt (2004) were largely unsuccessful in pinpointing the mechanisms driving the divergent trajectories of blacks and whites. A number of leading hypotheses (the importance of parental and environmental contributions grow over time, black students suffer worse summer setbacks, standardized tests are poor measures, interactions between black students and schools interferes with learning) fail to explain why Blacks lost ground. The only hypothesis that received any empirical support was systematically lower quality schools for Blacks relative to Whites. The primary evidence in favor of this hypothesis emerged from comparisons of test score trajectories within versus across schools. Including school fixed effects eliminates twothirds of the difference in the learning trajectory of blacks and whites over the first two years of school. In other words, a White student attending the same school as a Black student loses twothirds as much ground against the typical White student as does the Black student. Nonetheless, the evidence on school quality as the driving force in the racial gaps in Fryer and Levitt (2004) was largely circumstantial and subject to numerous important caveats. 1 1 There are at least three limitations to the argument that school quality is the mechanism behind black underachievement in Fryer and Levitt (2004). First, Hispanics also attend worse schools than whites, yet their test scores converge to those of whites. Second, because the assignment of children to schools depends in large part on residential location, school fixed effects is in many ways equivalent to neighborhood fixed effects. Third, controlling for a wide range of school inputs (which should capture important aspects of school quality) does little to lessen the gap.\nIn this paper, we extend the analysis offered in Fryer and Levitt (2004) A number of stylized facts emerge in this paper. We find that Blacks continue to lose ground relative to Whites in second and third grade at a pace consistent with the losses observed between kindergarten and first grade. On average, blacks are losing .10 standard deviations per year relative to whites in the first four years of school. In contrast to Fryer and Levitt (2004), however, systematic differences in school quality appear much less important in explaining the differences in test-score trajectories by race once the data are extended through third grade; Blacks lose substantial ground relative to whites within the same school and even in the same classrooms. That is, including school or teacher fixed effects do little to explain the divergent trajectories of black and white students between kindergarten and third grade. Hispanics continue to make up their inferior initial conditions relative to whites, while Asians continue to make gains. Explanations other than school quality that we have explored also fail to convincingly account for the growing gap between Blacks and students of other races.\nBy the end of third grade, even after controlling for observables, the black-white test score gap is evident in every skill tested in reading and math except for the most basic tasks such as counting and letter recognition which virtually all students have mastered. The largest racial 5 gaps in third grade are in the skills most crucial to future academic and labor market success: multiplication and division in math, and inference, extrapolation, and evaluation in reading.

The Data", "text": "The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) is a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 children entering kindergarten in 1998.

Students who are missing data on test-scores, race, or age are dropped from our sample.\nSummary statistics for the variables we use in our core specifications are displayed by race in Table 1 "}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "The estimates in Table 2 suggest that, controlling for other factors, black students score only slightly worse in math than whites upon kindergarten entry, but their trajectories after entry into school are very different. 12 After controlling for our parsimonious specification, blacks score .099 standard deviations below whites in the fall of kindergarten. This deficit increases to 10 The marginal benefit associated with one additional book decreases as more books are added. Beyond roughly 150 books, the marginal impact turns negative. Only 16 percent of the sample lies above this cutoff point.\n11 As an additional robustness check, we have also entered the components of the SES measure, parental education, parental occupation, and income, individually. In all cases, the components enter with the expected sign. Income is the biggest contributor to test scores. The black coefficient is unchanged. 12 The specifications in Table 2 Whites on these background characteristics, the impact of these variables on test scores is remarkably stable over time. Whatever factor is causing Blacks to lose ground is operating through a different channel.\nIn contrast to Blacks, Hispanics gain substantial ground relative to whites, despite the fact that they are plagued with many of the social problems that exist among blacks -low socioeconomic status, inferior schools, and so on. One explanation for Hispanic convergence is increases in English proficiency, though we have little direct evidence on this question. 13 Calling into question that hypothesis is the fact, discussed below, that after controlling for other factors Hispanics do not test particularly poorly on reading, even upon school entry. Controlling for whether or not English is spoken in the home does little to affect the initial gap or the trajectory of Hispanics. 14 The large advantage enjoyed by Asians in the first two years of school is maintained. We also observe striking losses by girls relative to boys on math -over two-tenths of a standard deviation over the four year period. While not the subject of this analysis, this is a finding deserving of further study.\n13 Hispanics seem to increase their position relative to whites in states where English proficiency is known to be a problem (Arizona, California, and Texas). 14 Hispanics are also less likely to be participate in pre-school, which could explain their poor initial scores and positive trajectory. However, including controls for the type of program/care children have prior to entering kindergarten -does nothing to explain why Hispanics gain ground. In an effort to uncover the factors that are associated with the divergent trajectory of blacks, Table 4 explores the sensitivity of these losing ground estimates across a wide variety of sub-samples of the data. We report only the race coefficients and associated standard errors in the is that Blacks in the West are losing the great majority of this ground relative to Whites in the same classrooms, so differential school quality across races does not appear to be the answer.\nThe results presented in Tables 2 -4 maintain the assumption that children of different races are equally responsive to changes in covariates. Cross-race differences in coefficients are potentially important because they affect the interpretation of the racial test score gap estimates in the preceding tables. Black children experience worse environments on average. If Black children do not derive as much benefit from improvements in socio-economic status, number of children's books, higher birth weight, etc., then our earlier results suggesting that including covariates lessens the racial gaps may be exaggerated. Further, within-race analysis allows one to see how the relationship between particular covariates (number of children's books, e.g.) and achievement varies over time within race. 16 We have also experimented with limiting the sample to the set of children for whom there is substantial overlap across races in background characteristics. More specifically, we ran probits with an indicator variable for Black as the dependent variable and the full set of covariates as predictors. When we drop from the sample the roughly 30 percent of students whose predicted probability of being Black is less than 10 percent or greater than 90 percent, the Black-White gap on math rises slightly and the reading gap becomes closer to zero.\n14 Tables 5a and 5b present within-race estimates of our basic specifications in math and reading, respectively. Columns 1 and 6 replicate the coefficient estimates from the full sample.\nThe remaining columns present results within a specific race category. For the most part,\nresponsiveness to covariates appears similar across races. One difference is that the Black children in our sample may be somewhat less responsive to changes in socio-economic status than Whites: a one-standard deviation improvement in socio-economic status for a Black child is associated with a .192 standard deviation increase in math scores, compared to .343 for a White child, but the results are more similar on reading scores.\nIV. Why are Black students losing ground?\nUnderstanding why Black students fare worse in the first four years of school is a question of paramount importance for two reasons. First, knowing the source of the divergence may aid in developing public policies to alleviate the problem. Second, determining the explanation for the widening gap will help to determine whether the simple linear extrapolation over the academic career is a plausible conjecture.\nThere are a number of plausible explanations as to why the racial gap in test scores grows as children age: (1) Black children attend lower quality schools on average, (2) the importance of parental/environmental contributions may grow over time. Since Black children are on average disadvantaged in this regard, they fall behind, (3) Black-White differences in earlier test scores were masked because of the type of material asked or the difficulties in testing skills among the youngest school-age children. Differences may only manifest themselves in more involved, higher order problems. 17 We address each of these hypotheses in turn."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "Are Black students losing ground because they attend worse schools?\nFryer and Levitt (2004) 20 The additional data on third graders leads us to believe that school quality is less important than we had initially conjectured. A comparison of Columns 5 and 10 make this clear. After including school fixed effects, two-thirds of the difference between blacks and whites remain. Indeed, all of the ground lost between first grade and third grade by Blacks is within rather than across schools.\nOne explanation is that, due to tracking within schools, the educational experiences of Blacks and Whites might nonetheless be different even at the same school. The results presented in the table, however, are essentially unchanged when we include teacher fixed effects, so that the differences are identified off of children in the very same classroom. We conclude that neither school quality nor tracking within schools is the primary explanation for black digression."}, {"section_title": "Does the importance of parental/environmental inputs grow as children age?", "text": "Black children may tend to grow up in environments less conducive to high educational attainment. If the importance of parental/environmental inputs grows as children age, one would expect to observe the raw gaps widening between Blacks and Whites, but to the extent our control variables adequately capture a child's environment, the residual gap after including all the covariates would remain constant. In fact, however, the residual gap increases more than the raw gap contradicting this explanation. Indeed, from a theoretical perspective, one might expect that the importance of parental inputs declines with age. Prior to reaching school age, the relative share of educational inputs provided by parents is very large. Once school starts, much of the burden for educating is shifted to the schools. Our empirical evidence does not, however, provide much support for this conjecture either."}, {"section_title": "21", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Did the type of material tested change to the detriment of blacks?", "text": "One possible explanation for the divergent trajectories of blacks and whites relates to the nature of the material tested. Rock and Stenner (2004) , for instance, hypothesize that the skills 21 In a recent paper, Todd and Wolpin (2003) have argued a slightly different point, which is that current test scores may reflect both current home and environmental inputs, as well as lagged values of these inputs. To the extent that current and lagged environments are highly correlated, controlling for current inputs is likely to yield similar estimates on average of the racial test score gap, and indeed that is the case. Controlling for our parsimonious specification yields a coefficient on black of -.382 in the third grade math regression and -.249 in reading. Adding lagged socioeconomic and home environment variables changes these coefficients to -.373 and -.273 respectively. tested at kindergarten entry are less correlated with general intelligence then the later tests, and Blacks typically score better on achievement tests than on tests of aptitude. When starting school, kids know very little -irrespective of their environment. As children age, their ability and social environment might matter more as they start to learn increasingly abstract concepts. It is in this regard that racial differences in home environment, parenting, peer group norms, and economic status could play a major role.\n22 Arguing against such a hypothesis, as Rock and\nStenner (2004) To further explore whether \"higher order\" thinking could potentially explain the puzzle of black underachievement, we investigate black-white learning trajectories by specific types of skills. Table 7 reports the unadjusted means, by race, of children in fall kindergarten, spring first grade, and spring third grade on questions assessing specific sets of skills. In the raw data, Blacks lag Whites somewhat on virtually all types of questions, except those which are mastered by virtually all students of a given grade level. That is true both at entry to school, and even more so by the end of third grade. Note that the only skills with much variance by the end of third grade are those that are associated with concepts virtually no kindergartner had mastered:\nmultiplication and division, rates and measurement, extrapolation, and so on. Table 8 reports the results of probits, controlling for other covariates, of Black-White differences in mastery rates for particular skills. The dependent variable in the analysis is set equal to one if a student is assessed as having a ninety percent plus probability of having 22 This theory, if true, also re-introduces the possibility that genetics could play a role. Because we have little evidence on this either way, we choose to exclude it while noting that it is a possibility. 23 Nor does the answer appear to be that the kindergarten test is especially noisy. As Rock and Stenner (2004) note, the reliability of the kindergarten test is high. mastered a subject, and is equal to zero otherwise. The same set of covariates used earlier in the paper is also included here, although the coefficients on these variables are not reported in the the gaps between Whites and Blacks tend to be small. This is true on both math and reading skills, and regardless of whether the skill is mastered by many of the students or relatively few of the students. Over time, Black students lose ground in virtually every skill area, except the most basic skills that are mastered by virtually all students in the grade. In addition and subtraction, which is challenging for many first graders regardless of race, the Black students lag significantly in first grade, but both Blacks and Whites achieve almost complete mastery by third grade. In that subject, as well as some of the basic reading skills like \"words in context,\" a few percent of Blacks fail to master the material even though almost all Whites do. Multiplication and division, as well as \"literal inference,\" display a pattern which is far more disturbing. By the spring of third grade, over 85 percent of White students have mastered these subjects, but mastery rates are 15-20 percent lower for Blacks, even after controlling for other factors.\nIt is difficult to know precisely what conclusion to draw from these results. To the extent that the pattern of Black skill acquisition as students age follows the path of the basic skills, i.e.\nBlack students master the material, but at a somewhat later age than White students, the patterns maybe construed as encouraging. The implication would be that Black students, although lagging Whites at any particular point in time, are on parallel trajectories. Much more troubling, it would seem, is the possibility that as the skills become more difficult, e.g. division, a nontrivial fraction of the Black students may never master the skills. If these skills are inputs into future subject matter, then the racial gap may be further magnified. While the data available thus far cannot speak definitively in determining which of these scenarios is more likely, the patterns in differential school quality across races. When the data are extended to cover an additional two years of schooling, however, the support for even this hypothesis weakens. We also explore whether the growing racial test score gap could be attributed to the inherent difficulties in testing achievement at especially young ages, or the possibility of increasing importance of home inputs for the development of higher-order thinking, but can provide no compelling evidence confirming these hypotheses either."}, {"section_title": "Data Appendix", "text": "The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) is a nationally representative sample of 21,260 children entering kindergarten in 1998.
