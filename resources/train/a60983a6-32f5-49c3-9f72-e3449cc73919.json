[{"section_title": "", "text": "C hlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are the most commonly reported curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States (US), 1,2 costing over $750 million (2015 US dollars) in annual lifetime cost altogether. 3 One of the effective ways to break transmission of these bacterial STIs is early detection and treatment. Early detection and treatment require the availability of (and access to) STI services. Traditionally, sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics have played a major role in the control and prevention of STIs through the provision of diagnostic and treatment services. 4, 5 However, recent studies have reported substantial decline in the number of categorical STD clinics in the last decade due primarily to budget reductions at both the federal and state levels. 6, 7 This decline in the number of STD clinics has contributed--in part--to the declining proportion of the overall number of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis cases reported by STD clinics to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 8 The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, under current law, 9% to 10% of the nonelderly population will remain uninsured through 2025. 9 Thus, it is important to consider availability of safety net STI services in the US. Additionally, from 2002 to 2006 to 2010, receipt of STI services among US women increased among most subpopulations with the exception of uninsured women (and adolescents). 10 Given the number of uninsured persons and fewer STD clinics providing needed safety net STI services, it is especially important to assess the role of potential providers of safety net STI services in various jurisdictions who can aid in the control and prevention of STIs.\nFederally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are nonprofit private or public entities that provide comprehensive primary care services to designated medically underserved populations or geographic areas. The FQHCs are required by statute to provide primary care and preventive services, including screening for communicable diseases. 11 Additionally, FQHCs offer a sliding fee scale and qualify for enhanced reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. 11 Given their geographic coverage across the US and the services they offer, it has been suggested that FQHCs might have the potential to expand access to STI services (testing and treatment) to complement existing categorical STI service providers, particularly in underserved areas. However, studies on the spatial distribution of FQHCs in relation to the burden of STIs are lacking. In this study, we sought to describe the spatial distribution of FQHCs and to determine if reported county-level nonviral STI morbidity (chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis) were associated with having FQHC(s) using spatial regression techniques.\nWe chose county-level geographic units for two major reasons. First, STI morbidity data are not publicly available below county geographic units (such as census blocks, census tracts and cities). Thus, using county-level data makes our study/analyses replicable. Second, the number and spatial distribution of FQHCs (\u22489000) compared with the number of counties (\u22483000) permitted using a simpler easily operationalizable measure of spatial relationship (ie, point features [FQHCs] within polygon features [counties]), especially, given that we were doing this from a national perspective."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "We designed a multiyear cross-sectional study that examined the spatial association between reported county-level nonviral STI morbidity and the existence of FQHC(s) using spatial regression techniques."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "For the purpose of this study, we focused on only the counties in the 48 contiguous states in the US. To obtain complete spatial data on the FQHCs (ie, geocoded health care service delivery [HCSD] sites), we connected to the Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) map service server using their ArcCatalog configuration specifications. 12 This process allowed us to identify all the FQHCs in the database in 2014 (hereafter referred to as HCSD sites) found in each county in the 48 contiguous states. Because we were interested in service delivery sites that could potentially expand access to STI services, we dropped HCSD site types that were \"administrative\" only (ie, we focused on those that were \"administrative/service delivery\" or \"service delivery\"). We also dropped HCSD sites with location setting descriptions that were categorized as \"domestic violence\" or \"nursing home.\" Our final analyses included 8798 unique HCSDs in the contiguous 48 states (out of a grand total of 9730 extracted from the HSRA data warehouse 12 ). Next we determined two variables of interest--(1) the number of unique HCSD sites found in each county and (2) the number of unique HCSD sites per 100,000 county residents. We created a choropleth map of the number of unique HCSD sites found in each county (Fig. 1A) .\nNext, we obtained county-level annual reported chlamydia, gonorrhea, and primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis rates (all ages and sexes) from the surveillance data for 2008 to 2012 and computed temporally smoothed rates for each county. The temporally smoothed rates were calculated as the sum of cases for each disease over the 5-year period analyzed divided by the sum of the resident population across the same time frame, and then multiplied by 100,000. [13] [14] [15] Figures 1B-D represent choropleth maps of the temporally smoothed chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis rates, respectively. We used temporally smoothed rates for the years selected for 3 reasons. First, population estimates for years close to the decennial census population counts (ie, 2010 in this case) are more accurate. Second, they reduced the small population problem that might be associated with small counties and provide a more representative measure of the burden of the disease over time. 14, 16 Finally, the demographic and socioeconomic variables that are available for all the counties in the US for the years we analyzed--which has increased statistical reliability for small areas/populations 17 --were the 5-year estimates provided by the American Community Surveys from Census.gov. 18 Based on previously published studies, 5, [13] [14] [15] [16] 19, 20 we extracted select county-level demographic and socioeconomic variables from Census.gov. The control variables included percent black, percent white (referent race category), percent Hispanic, percent American Indian, percent American Asian, percent unemployed, percent aged 18 to 24 years, percent aged 25 to 44 years, percent completing high school, percent with a bachelor's degree, per capita and median household incomes, birth rate, population density, male-female population ratio, and a commute index (ie, percent with > 1 hour commute time; this was included to differentiate counties with a larger proportion of workers who traveled a relatively large distance for work from counties where workers' places of employment were close to where they lived). 5, 13, 16 We included the 2013 rural-urban continuum codes developed by the United States Department of Agriculture--Economic Research Services as a categorical variable to differentiate rural-urban counties according to their degree of urbanicity and proximity to metropolitan areas. 21 We also examined metro/nonmetro as a dichotomous variable (designating the USDA codes 1-3 as metro with the others designated as nonmetro). We compared the means of all the continuous variables in counties with and without HCSD sites and assessed statistical significance using t tests and large-sample tests for equality of proportions."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Regression Analysis", "text": "We also conducted a multivariate analysis of the potential association between county-level STI morbidity and HCSD sites. We used a mixed log-log/semi-log spatial regression technique (specifically, the spatial error model [SEM] ) to account for spatial autocorrelation/dependence in a state-specific fixed-effect specification (after a Hausman test confirmed that the fixed-effect models were superior to the random effects model 22 ). However, because some counties had no reported cases of the STIs analyzed (especially for syphilis), and some counties had no HCSD sites, we added 1 to the calculated smoothed case rates for each STI and the number of HCSD sites. 14, 23 The resulting smoothed case rates and number of HCSD sites were then transformed into natural logs. 14, 16, 23 We also transformed the median household income, birth rate, population density, and male-female population ratio into natural logs. Based on these transformations, the resulting coefficients were converted as (coefficient \u00c2 100) and interpreted as the percentage change in the smoothed rates for a percent change in the continuous independent variables and as (exp coefficient \u2212 1) \u00c2 100 for the categorical rural-urban variable. 24 The number of HCSD sites was also adjusted by county population as follows: number of HCSD sites per 100,000 population + 1 and transformed into natural logs. Due to high multicollinearity, we dropped per capita income, percent below the poverty line, proportion uninsured, and proportion with bachelor's degree in the spatial regressions.\n14 Also, because of unavailable data from 2 large states (Illinois and Florida), we did not include the crime rate in the spatial regressions. Our final model was informed--for the most part--by several previously published STI ecological analyses studies that used spatial regression techniques. 5, [13] [14] [15] [16] 25 We also used the variance inflation factor as a guide to reduce multicollinearity among the numerous control variables. 26 Because the 3 nonviral STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis) are closely related, our final regression analyses involved a 3-equation seemingly unrelated regression estimation (SURE) procedure. 16, 27 The SURE procedure estimated all 3 equations simultaneously accounting for the correlated errors at the same time and provided more efficient estimates of the coefficients and standard errors. GeoDa version 0.9.5-I 28 was used to create spatial lags for preliminary spatial regression analyses. Because we were examining infectious/ contagious processes, we used first-order Queen Contiguity weights. 29 We"}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Based on the spatial data on HCSD sites that we extracted from the HRSA data warehouse, we found no HCSD sites in 43% (n = 1329) of the counties in the 48 contiguous states. Most of the counties without any HCSD sites were found in the Midwestern (North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas) and Southern (Oklahoma and Texas) regions (Fig. 1A) . (n = 81). However, when we sorted the counties by the number of HCSD sites per 100,000 residents, none of the top 10 with the largest number of HCSD sites described above was in the first 50. In bivariate analysis, counties with HCSD sites had higher STI, poverty, unemployment, and violent crime rates, as well as lower per capita income and median household income than counties with no HCSD sites (differences significant at P < 0.05 or lower, Table 1 ). The population density of counties with HCSD sites and the proportion of the population that was other than white non-Hispanic were higher than that in counties with no HCSD sites (P < 0.01). Many of these differences between counties with HCSD sites and with no HCSD sites persisted and were statistically significant when considering metro and nonmetro counties separately (not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Spatial regression", "text": "The summary results from our 3-equation SURE spatial regression analyses are presented in Table 2 . The multicollinearity check was within the recommended limit of 10--the highest variance inflation factor was 5.69 (mean = 2.42) for all disease models. The spatial error lag was also significant (P < 0.01) for each disease model, implying that spatial dependence was fairly accounted for in the regression. [14] [15] [16] 28, 30 The estimated r-squares were at least 60%. This implies that at least 60% of the variations in the transformed total incidence rates for all 3 diseases were explained by the variations in the control variables included in the regression. Additionally, the signs of the coefficients were consistent with previous studies (Table 2) . [13] [14] [15] [16] 20, 25, 31 When we included the log of the number of HCSD sites, the resulting coefficients showed that the transformed temporally smoothed rates were significantly (and positively) associated with county-level STI morbidity. The results show that--on average--a 1% increase in the number of HCSD sites was associated with a 3% (P < 0.01) increase in the temporally smoothed rate of chlamydia, 6% (P < 0.01) increase in the temporally smoothed rate of gonorrhea and 8% (P < 0.01) increase in the temporally smoothed rate of P&S syphilis. However, when we replaced the log of the number of HCSD sites with the log of number of HCSD sites per 100,000 residents, the resulting coefficients were not statistically significant in any of the disease models (results not shown)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this study, we described the spatial distribution of HCSD sites in relation to the morbidity of 3 nonviral STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis) and determined the association between HCSD sites and STI morbidity at the county level while controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors. Our results indicate significant association between county-level reported chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis morbidity rates, and the number of HCSD sites. Although this could indicate a higher diagnosis rate due to improved access to screening and other STD services, when we replaced the number of HCSD sites with the number of HCSD sites per 100,000 population, there was no association. This suggests that in terms of the number of HCSD sites per capita, the number (and potentially the availability) of HCSD sites was not higher in high-morbidity areas. An increase in the number of sites in highmorbidity areas (and thus an increase in the number of sites per 100,000 population) could improve access for patients, but more data would be needed to determine the relationship between the number of HCSD sites per 100,000 population and access. As previously highlighted, the need for safety net STI services is expected to remain because of lack of insurance, the desire for confidential services, and other reasons. 32 One study estimated that over 4.5 million persons will require safety net STI clinical services in 2023 at a cost of over US $150 million. 33 Across jurisdictions, providers of safety net STI services include STD clinics, public clinics, family planning clinics, and FQHCs. 33 With the closure of several STD clinics, public health officials and practitioners are tasked with identifying appropriate safety net STI services to reduce further transmission of STIs.\nOur study has several limitations that are noteworthy. Notable among them is the usual limitation associated with STI surveillance data: reported cases do not necessarily match true morbidity because of the asymptomatic nature of STIs, relatively low screening coverage, and incomplete reporting.\n1,2 Also, we found some cases that were assigned to missing or unknown counties.\n2 Reporting practices may vary between states and between jurisdictions within states; therefore, there may be varying levels of underreporting for some jurisdictions, and the degree of underreporting might vary by jurisdiction and/or race. Screening rates may vary across states, which would also impact reported STI rates. 34 Another factor is that STI rates may be impacted by the number of HCSD sites in the county, which would impact the coefficients in the regression equations.\nAlthough it would be too strong to say that we assumed all HCSD sites have the same capacity in terms of the number of patient visits that can be accommodated, these analyses did implicitly assume that increasing numbers of sites implied increasing capacity (on either a raw number or per capita basis). That is not necessarily true because HCSD sites may vary. Our analyses also assumed that the presence of a HCSD site implies physical access (close proximity) by all (safety net) STI patients within the county. This is not realistic given that some counties are very large and the available HCSD sites might be several miles away. Also, we did not explicitly account for cross-county service access/availability--there are several HCSD sites that might be physically accessible to residents in contiguous/ adjoining counties. 5 This limitation is primarily the result of the scale at which this study was done--county-level for all 48 contiguous states. Finer/smaller scale analysis (census block or city-level) would provide more detailed information and help to minimize the limitation due to the scale of the analyses. However, because we corrected for spatial dependence, this problem was reduced somewhat. Finally, our study did not account for spatial heterogeneity (ie, parameter coefficients were not allowed to vary by region or state 14, 28, 30 ) in our spatial regression analyses. Nonetheless, we used a state-specific fixed-effect estimation procedure, which--to some extent--reduced the impact of this limitation on our results."}, {"section_title": "14,15", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Even with all the limitations outlined above, our study provides essential information on the geographic distribution of the HCSD sites in all the 48 contiguous states and their association with chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis rates. The association between STI morbidity and HCSD sites disappeared when we adjusted for population-this suggests that the existing FQHC infrastructure may not be sufficient to provide all STD safety net services needed in some jurisdictions. The results from this study can provide useful information for local public health officials considering alternative safety net STI service providers within their jurisdictions. Given that the scale at which we conducted this study might have resulted in the loss of important physical accessibility information, future studies may improve upon these estimates by examining the association between STI morbidity and the availability of HCSD sites at smaller subcounty levels. Determining the magnitude of the unmet need for safety net STI services and the ability of the existing HCSD sites to meet that need is an important area for further work."}]
