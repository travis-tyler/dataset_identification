[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was formerly known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and is often referred to as Human coronavirus 2019 (hCoV-19), responsible for a sudden rise in pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, late December 2019, was preventively deemed a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO as early as 30th January, 2020 with only as few as 7836 cases confirmed worldwide back then. With rapidly growing number of confirmed positive cases throughout the world, SARS-CoV-2 quickly became arguably the most sequenced virus in history with nearly 55 thousands viral isolate near complete genome sequences of high quality available publicly at the time of writing at GISAID repository thanks to the unprecedented rate of collaborations between researchers and unpublished data sharing with the goal of effectively tackling the novel disease [1, 2] ."}, {"section_title": "Genome of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "First reported genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was deduced from a metagenomic RNA of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen sampled from a patient who worked at Wuhan seafood market, where the epidemiological onset of human-to-human transmission of a novel zoonotic coronavirus is thought to have taken place [3] , although evidence of an earlier contraction of the disease that was not associated with the seafood market has been documented, leading to the conclusion that the primary spill-over event has taken place elsewhere [4, 5] . The sequence of a 29903 base long non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule representing complete genome of the aforementioned isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 was deposited in GenBank [6] on 5 th of January, 2020 and is now known as a SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence available under accession numbers NC_045512.2 or MN908947.3.\nWhile viral family Coronaviridae, that comprises \u03b1/\u03b2/\u0394/\u03b3 coronavirus genera, representatives are somewhat unique in comparison with most other RNA viruses in regards to their large genome size of ~30 kb, genomic organization of individual species does not differ much among other lower taxa within the family, while boasting variable number of open reading frames. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 begins with a 265 base long 5' UTR region starting with a leader sequence followed by a 21 290 base long ORF1ab, comprising about 70% of the genome length, that translates into two polyproteins via -1 ribosomal frameshift and encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16). The remaining part of the genome comprises ORFs coding for structural and accessory proteins of unknown function, sequentially: Spike glycoprotein (S), ORF3a, envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), ORF10, followed by 3' UTR ending in poly(A) tail. However, no evidence that would support the expression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 encoded protein of unknown function is yet found in the literature [7] . compared to other, milder symptoms causing, community-acquired human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) [8] .\nStudies on the origin of novel coronavirus have revealed that complete genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 suggests a more close, although not a direct parental, ancestral relationship with bat (~96% overall nucleotide homology with RaTG13[9]) and pangolin coronaviruses (up to ~92% homology, with S protein ACE2 receptor binding domain amino acid sequence being 97.4% identical to SARS-CoV-2 [10]), than to those of humans(~79% and ~50% identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively [11] , and, while bats are already a long-time acknowledged reservoir of SARS-CoV-like \u03b2-coronaviruses [12, 13] , the assumption that pangolins can serve as a natural host for CoVs has been made only recently before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 [14, 15] . Although the current risk of animal-human transmission of COVID-19 is considered low, a number of felines [16] , canines [17] and minks [18] worldwide have been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 isolate classification", "text": "With a steadily growing number of complete hCoV-19 genome sequences, early efforts to classify novel isolates based on their genetic make-up have resulted in numerous proposals of different SARS-CoV-2 isolate classification systems [19] [20] [21] , some of which (e.g. PANGOLIN lineages) are complementary. However, with more than 84 000 of hCoV-19 genome sequences being available publicly as of now, ongoing efforts to aid in the classification of newly sequenced viral isolates have resulted in the general acceptance of GISAID's team developed SARS-CoV-2 major clade and lineage nomenclature system based on the specific combinations of 9 hCoV-19 genetic markers [1] . In accordance with this system, hCoV-19 isolates can be classified in at least six distinct major clades, namely: S, L (containing reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1), V, G, GH, GR and O (other) isolate clades (Table 1) . Mid-August, 2020, the most represented clades Worldwide are GR, G and GH, roughly corresponding to 31.72%, 23.54% and 22.03% of total hCoV-19 isolates, respectively. All three of these clades are characterized by C241T base substitution in 5' UTR region, C3037T silent mutation in ORF1a and missense A23403G mutation that causes Aspartic acid at position 614 of spike glycoprotein (S) to change to Glycine (S-D614G), that is associated with higher viral loads and, in turn, is hypothesized to increase the infectivity of these genotypes, with isolates bearing this mutation quickly becoming dominant ones in various regions throughout the world [22] [23] [24] . More recent clades GR and GH are further distinguished from the ancestral G genotype by G25563T mutation resulting in position 57 of ORF3a protein to change from glutamine to histidine for clade GH, and G28882A that changes glycine at nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) aa position 204 to arginine for clade GR. While the exact effect of GH clade-defining G25563T change in apoptosis-inducing transmembrane ORF3a protein (Q57R) remains unknown, it does not seem to affect any of the conserved functional domains distinguishable within the protein [25, 26] . Whereas, G28882A mutation associated with GR genotype is almost always a trinucleotide mutation of neighboring loci resulting in GGG to AAC change at positions 28881, 28882 and 28883, respectively. This trinucleotide mutation results in two (R203K and G204R) consecutive amino acid changes in N protein, which, in turn, might have potential implications on nucleocapsid phosphoprotein structure and/or function via reduction of conformational entropy and changes in inter-residue interactions in the proximity of the mutated amino acid positions (elaborated on in [27] ). The currently estimated mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is around 9.86 x 10 \u22124 to 1.85 x 10 \u22124 substitutions per position per year [28] , and, based on the isolates sequenced worldwide up to date, there is evidence that mutations in nearly every position in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 have already been documented [29] .\nIn this study, we are reporting the first results of an ongoing massive sequencing campaign that allows us to elaborate on the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Latvian patients."}, {"section_title": "Sample management and detection of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "For viral genome analysis either oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from COVID-19 patients or already extracted RNA samples were provided to Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre by the three accredited diagnostic laboratories (E.

RNA extraction from oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs and the following SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed by multiple different methods according to standard procedures of each laboratory.

However, the extent of similarity between the isolates circulating in different Baltic states currently cannot be reliably established due to SARS-CoV-2 isolate undersequencing in neigboring Estonia and Lithuania, and the founder effect of multiple independent (re-)introductions of different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, as well as containment effectivity of respective COVID19 cases, in each of the countries should not be overlooked."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of sequenced virus isolates by SARS-CoV-2 clades", "text": "Major isolate clade distributions across distinct geographical regions show clear spatial differences of the epidemic ( Figure 2 ) and a trend of \"older\" isolate clades L and S losing their initial prevalence to the dominance of the more recently-emerged G-associated clades (G, GH, GR) that seem to be accountable for the majority of the cases worldwide since the middle of March 2020. GR, which is the most common isolate clade in Latvia (54.13% of cases), is also a dominant clade in Europe and South America. Currently, GH still seems to be the most common isolate clade circulating throughout North America, but a rise in the number of GR isolates can be observed since the middle of May 2020. The prevalence of GR and, in particular, G clade isolates is also currently on the rise in Africa, and, to a very moderate amount in Oceania and Asia. The relatively high number of isolates not corresponding to any of the currently recognized major SARS-CoV-2 clades (dubbed \"Other\" or belonging to the \"O\" clade as of now) in Asia and Oceania makes it possible to speculate about it being indicative of either (but not mutually exclusive), poor quality of the sequences obtained or the possibility of novel clade emergence originating from these regions in the future, should their spread not be effectively contained. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted September 9, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190504 doi: medRxiv preprint Figure 2 .

Identical sequences sampled within a short date range ( Figure 5 .) might be strongly indicative of epidemiologically linked transmission, given the relatively small daily amount of positive COVID-19 cases in Latvia even during the peaks of the disease spread. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted September 9, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190504 doi: medRxiv preprint While providing interesting insights on the COVID-19 situation in Latvia, which might be representative of Baltics region to an extent, given the scarce amount of isolate genomes available from neighboring countries, it, however, should be noted, that the main drawback for each of the presented analyses is stemming from the available dataset -discrete early sampling with some of the dates since first positive case not being sampled at all (Figure 1 ). Another major drawback is the unavailability of patient/isolate epidemiological data that could be linked to the respective cases sequenced (e.g. sequence epidemiological linkage, patient travel history etc.) in the frame of this study. Inclusion of additional data and retrospective sequencing of a larger number of cases that would allow for a more in-depth analysis of epidemiological situation will be performed and published elsewhere.\nIn conclusion, the high-throughput framework for SARS-CoV-2 isolate sequencing and data analysis in Latvia has been built by Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre early on during the start of the pandemic, tested with the help of both, governmental and local private laboratory sample providers, and proposed as a pivotal tool to monitor the local outbreaks and aid in decision making. This framework allowed us to ensure the sequencing of viral isolates from almost all new cases starting from the beginning of July, 2020 with fast date delivery to the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Latvia allowing to link the epidemiological data to the isolates being sequenced. We believe that this framework is of vital importance for rapid implementation of the most suitable public health measures, possible transmission history deduction and viral evolution monitoring for the prevention of future epidemiological outbreaks."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "This research is funded by the Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Latvia, project \"Establishment of COVID-19 related biobank and integrated platform for research data in Latvia\", project No. VPP-COVID-2020/1-0016, project \"Multidisciplinary approach to monitor, mitigate and contain COVID19 and other future epidemics in Latvia\", project No. VPP-COVID-2020/1-0008 and 04.06.2020. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint"}, {"section_title": "Ethics statement", "text": "The copyright holder for this this version posted September 9, 2020. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted September 9, 2020. .
