INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a highly prevalent and irreversible neurological degeneration, is a major health concern. According to an estimation from the Alzheimer's Association [1] , 5.5 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's dementia and that number may reach more than 13 million by the year of 2050. Although the precise mechanism of AD development is not fully understood, AD progression is reflected in brain atrophy. It is hoped that treatment could have great benefit if started during the earliest stages of AD [2] . Because brain shape analysis techniques may identify subtle shape alterations, they may have great potential for early detection of AD [3] , as well as tracking AD progression [4] , and the impact of therapeutic interventions [5] . With the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we can easily extract several brain shape features that measure AD's influence on brains structure, including the features of whole brain [6] , temporal lobe volumes [7] , hippocampus [8] , cortical thickness [9] .\nAlthough various brain volume-based feature approaches [10] , [11] were developed for brain volume image analysis, prior research [12] , [13] has demonstrated that surface-based brain mapping may offer advantages over volume-based brain mapping work. Indeed, prominent surface-based analysis approaches, such as surface conformal mapping [14] , isometry invariance analysis (e.g., surface spectral distances [15] , and spherical harmonic analysis [16] ), have been developed and demonstrated their greater success.\nAmong the surface approaches, isometry analysis studies, are of great interest as the results are invariant under isometric transformation of cortical surfaces. Unfortunately, due to the complicated geometry of cortical surfaces, currently available isometry analysis studies [17] , [18] often fail to reach one of the desired requirements: sensitive in morphometry quantification, robust in abnormality detection, and intuitive in feature visualization.\nHere we propose a novel shape descriptor, based on the area-preserving mapping [19] and Beltrami coefficients, to complement current isometric invariant methods. The areapreserving mapping, which preserves the local area of the surface, provides a globally optimal diffeomorphic mapping from cortical surface to the unit sphere. The mapping result is invariant under isometric transformation, i.e. rotate, scale, and transform. The Beltrami coefficients depict the anisotropicity of the elastic deformation of the mapping and can potentially be used as a shape signature to measure brain morphometry changes.\nIn our experiments, we apply our shape descriptors to 135 amyloid-positive AD (A\u03b2 +) patients and 248 healthy control (A\u03b2 \u2212) subjects. The group difference results are consistent with some prior AD research [12] . We further apply a novel patch-based spherical sparse coding algorithm for feature dimension reduction. After that, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify these two groups. We see the 5-folder cross-validation accuracy rate for distinguishing AD and CTL subjects is about 81.82%, outperforming some traditional brain surface features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our shape descriptors may then be applied as potential imaging biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease research. II. METHOD"}, {"section_title": "A. Basic Ideas", "text": "Let S be a genus zero cortical surface, represented by the triangular mesh M = (V, E, T ). Our goal is to find a discrete map to the unit sphere f : M \u2192 S 2 | R=1 , such that the area adjacent to each vertex v i \u2208 V is conserved. It makes the problem tractable that f can be decomposed as three discrete mapping functions, conformal map to a planar domain c, area-preserving adjustment a on the planar domain, and the inverse stereo-graphic projection s \u22121 (see Fig. 1 ). Mathematical details for each of these mapping function appear in the next sections."}, {"section_title": "B. Conformal map to planar domain", "text": "We first find a c : M \u2192 C which maps the brain surface M onto a planar domain. Such c can be found in two steps.\nFirst, conformally map cortical surface to the unit sphere via Spherical Harmonic Mapping. We refer the reader to the paper [20] for a full description of this approach.\nSecond, punch a tiny hole around the north-pole of sphere and stereo-graphically project the unit sphere mapping to complex plane C. Let point v = (x, y, z) on the sphere and (u, v) on the complex plane, the stereographic projection is given by, (u, v) = ( "}, {"section_title": "C. Area-Preserving Mapping", "text": "The area-preserving mapping, a further strategy of adjusting conformal result D, is based on Brenier's Approach to solving optimal mass transport (OMT) problem.\nSuppose two metric spaces (X, \u00b5) and (Y, \u03bd) have a same total measure, X \u00b5 = Y \u03bd. A transport plan T : X \u2192 Y is called a measure preserving transport plan if for any subset\nWe are interested in finding a measure preserving transport plan T opt such that the total transport cost is minimal, i.e. The following theorem, has been proven using a variational principle in [19] , plays a fundamental role in finding the optimal discrete transport plan.\nTheorem II.1. Assume \u00b5 has a compact support \u2126 = {x \u2208 X|\u00b5(x) > 0}. For any given measure \u03bd, with total measure preserved, i.e. \u2211 n j=1 \u03bd j = \u2126 \u00b5, \u03bd j > 0, define a vector h = (h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h n ) \u2208 R n , where h i is a real number assigned to y i \u2208 Y . For each point y i , constructs a hyperplane < x, y i > +h i = 0 in X, all these hyperplanes form a convex polyhedron u(x). There must exist a height vector h unique up to adding a constant (c, . . . , c), such that the gradient map \u2207u(x) optimizes the following transportation cost,\nMeanwhile, the following measure-preservation constrains are satisfied for all cells, that is\nWe explain the theorem in the context of our spherical area-preserving mapping. Our goal is to find a : X \u2192 Y , such that once we do the inverse stereo-graphic mapping back to the unit sphere, the vertex area on the unit sphere, is same as vertex area on cortical surface M.\nLet the mapping target of x i \u2208 X be y i \u2208 Y . For each point y i , a real value h i is assigned (initially can be 0). With the assigned value h i , we construct a hyperplane defined on X: \u03c0 i :< x, y i > +h i = 0, where <, > is the inner product. Fig. 2 demonstrates the hyperplane \u03c0 i of point p i on the compact support \u2126. These hyperplanes intersect each other and eventually form a convex polyhedron u(x), which have the condition, u(x) = max i {< x, y i > +h i }.\nDenote G(h) as the polyhedron graph of u(x). Then the vertical projection of G(h) induces a polygonal partition of \u2126. We call \u2207u, the gradient of u, a gradient map which maps each cell W i to a single point y i , i.e., \u2207u(x) : W i \u2192 y i , i = 1, 2, . . . , n. One can see that the height vector h controls the hyperplanes, the shape of u, the induced cell decomposition W i , and eventually the cell center.\nIt has been proven in [21] that the minimal solution of the following E(h) also optimizes the cost defined in Equ. 1,\nIf we find the h such that the energy is minimized, we are able to construct the area-preserving mapping according to the discussion. The benefits of taking the Eq. 2 is that the gradient and Hessian matrix can be given, respectively, \nA threshold \u03b5, and a step \u03b1 length.\nAs the energy E is convex when the domain of Y is convex, the global minimum can be obtained efficiently by Newton's method. This procedure is described in Alg. 1. [21] In our setting, the vertex area of v i , on surface S, is defined as,\nwhere\nis a triangle face adjacent to v i . As our goal is the area-preserving respect to unit sphere, when we set the target measure on the planar domain, additional area distortion induced by stereo-graphic projection is taken into consideration,\nAfter solving the optimal mass transport problem on planar domain by Alg. 1, we do inverse stereo-graphic projection and yield the spherical area-preserving mapping of M. The inverse stereo-graphic projection is given by,\nThe area-preserving mapping carries precious information about the surface local area deformation. To quantify such deformation, we adopt the Beltrami coefficient [22] as our shape descriptor. Beltrami coefficient of surface, when given metric tensor g(x, y) = E F F G , can be defined as,\nBeltrami coefficient \u00b5 relates both magnitude and angle of the dilation of surface. Fig. 3 shows the relation between Beltrami coefficient \u00b5 and shape dilation. Mathematically, if an infinity small circle is transformed to an ellipse, the distortion of the translation is K = In the discrete setting, Beltrami coefficient can be estimated on each triangular face, based on the fact elements in the metric tensor g(x, y) can be defined on each triangular face. For the purpose of simplicity, we further define the Beltrami coefficient \u00b5 i on each vertex v i as the area weighted average of neighboring faces,"}, {"section_title": "E. Descriptor Re-sampling and Patch-Based Sparse Coding", "text": "Although the Beltrami coefficient can be extracted for each vertex or face, unfortunately, there are two obstacles to prevent the shape descriptor applying directly. The number of shape descriptor is not consistent across subjects, and the dimension of the descriptor is too high leading the scenario of curse of dimensionality where the generalization of classifier is poor.\nTo tackle the first obstacle, we align the unit spheres via a rotation on sphere and re-sample consistently on sphere. Denote the target unit sphere as S t . Given a unit sphere mapping result S q , we find a rotation (\u03b8 , \u03c6 ) applied to S q , such that the mean curvature difference is minimal. Although this process is not globally optimal, a good initial guess, e.g. from Freesurfer [13] , leads the result quite stable. Later we re-sample the aligned unit sphere with a template triangular mesh on sphere. while the template can be arbitrary, for the favor of well sampling and simplicity, some restriction should be applied. Here, we take the attractive spherical geodesic grids scheme, where each triangle on sphere is of same area and each vertex share a consistent adjacent information, to generate a template. Geodesic grids schemes have been successfully applied to many of the problems associated with fluid-flow simulations in a spherical geometry [23] . Now, we got the template and we can re-sample the feature values of each template point.\nTo walk around the second obstacle, the patch-based sparse coding [24] is taken to reduce dimensions. Patchbased sparse coding has been successfully applied to cortical surface classification [25] , [26] .\nHere, we first collect vertexes around a vertex such that these vertexes can be reached within visiting k connected edges. We call all vertexes, with certain order, as k\u2212ring patch of the center vertex. Fig. 4 (f) shows a 4\u2212ring patch of the center (green) vertex, in a count-clock-wise order. Since we adopt spherical geodesic grids as template, the k\u2212ring patch can share a common graph structure. Denote P i as the patch formed by center vertex v i , then each patch feature P i can be expressed by a vector p i . We randomly take sufficient center vertexes and form a patch for vertex, denoted as X = (p 1 , p 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , p n ) \u2208 R |p|\u00d7n , where each patch p i \u2208 R |p| is a vector with |p| elements, and the total number of patches is n For each patch p i , the sparse feature extraction can be incorporated with following problem,\nwhere \u03bb is the regularization parameter. In this way, the patch vector p i is represented by an m\u2212dimensional vector z i , with m |p|. Later, the max-pooling is adopted for all the patches,\n, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , |p| to reduce the dimensions. We take F \u2208 R |p| as the subject's feature for classification."}, {"section_title": "III. PROCESS PIPELINE", "text": "We summarize the whole the pipeline in Fig. 4 . First, the MRI images are acquired from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project [27] . Fig. 4 (a) shows several image slices of same subject.\nWith the given MRI images, we adopt FreeSurfer [13] to obtain the cortex pial surfaces, as shown in Fig. 4 (b) . Then we follow the method introduced in Alg. 1, to obtain the unique spherical area-preserving mapping, as shown in Fig. 4 (c) . Later, we extract Beltrami coefficient for each vertex. After a rough registration, we re-sample the Beltrami coefficient on unit sphere. Fig. 4 (e) shows the resampling points on sphere. Finally, surface patches are generated and the feature vector for classification is formed."}, {"section_title": "IV.

Group Difference", "text": "Our area-preserving mapping preserves the global connectivity and local area of each vertex, so it reflects the local structure of cortical surface with great fidelity.\nFor each re-sampled point, we simply add its vertex's coordinate across all subjects. This yields the average shape as shown in Fig. 5 . We see the major gyri/sulci structures are well preserved in the average brain surface. It demonstrates that our mapping is quite easy for future registration work, given the fact that a simple alignment keeps major structure in the average surface.\nWith the average brain surface, we can further visualize the difference of shape descriptors between two study groups. We take the average shape descriptor on each group (simply add the feature descriptor on each re-sampled vertex among the subjects in the same group). Fig. 5 color shows the feature value difference. We notice stronger shape difference in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) area. It agrees with prior AD studies [12] which have shown that the MTL is one of the most vulnerable regions and earliest affected due to AD progression."}, {"section_title": "B. Classification", "text": "We further test shape descriptor performance on classifying cortical surfaces from different clinical groups. We use 80% of the left hemisphere of the pial surfaces to train a SVM classifier and use the remaining 20% to validate. This process is repeated by 500 times, and the results of average classification rate and sensitive rate are shown in Table  II . The proposed method is compared with popular brain measures, the spherical harmonic mapping [20] , weighted spherical harmonic mapping [28] , and the thickness as a feature patch-based sparse coding [24] .\nWhile we refer the readers to the paper [28] for details of weighted spherical harmonic mapping, we briefly introduce the idea to introduce necessary notations. A function, defined on sphere, can be represented as, p(\u03b8 , \u03c6 ) = \u2211 spherical harmonic decomposition [20] . In the experiment of Weighted Spherical Harmonic classification, we apply the decomposition for each coordinate channel one by one, namely X, Y and Z, with L = 100, and optimized w [28] . Then collect coefficients {c lm } of each channel and combine all the coefficients as a vector. The same issue is that the dimension of coefficients is too high, thus we apply sparse coding scheme as discussed in Eq. 9 (regard the coefficients as a single patch) to prune the representative features. The performance SVM classifier with Weighted Spherical Harmonic as the feature is illustrated in the second row of Tab. II. The same process is repeated for w = 0, that is the classifier with Spherical Harmonic coefficient as the feature (first-row method in Tab. II). Another method we compared is the thickness based surface sparse coding (third-row method in Tab. II). It shares a similar approach to our method, the differences are, the alignments comes from the result of Freesurfer, and the feature is cortical thickness instead of Beltrami coefficient. Our method can out-perform the (weighted) Spherical Harmonic method. Compare to spherical harmonic coefficient sparse coding, our scheme takes a patch-based sparse coding scheme, it greatly empowered the method. On the other hand, we compare our method with the thickness based patch sparse coding approach. Our method still outweighs, indicating that the improvement is not only contributed by patch-based sparse coding, but also the good selection of shape descriptor."}, {"section_title": "VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this paper, we incorporated several state of the art methods to map the cortical surface onto a unit sphere, extract shape descriptor on the unit sphere, re-sample the shape descriptor, generate patches on sphere, and classify the normal controls and AD patients with SVM. The results show that the proposed shape descriptor is sensitive for surface deformation and thus can detect AD's influence on the brain surface. We also discussed the shape descriptor for the two groups. The results explain the reason why our shape descriptor can detect the shape abnormality affected by AD.\nThere are some opportunities to refine our current work. For instance, during the surface reregistration, we could slightly adjust each vertex position to minimize the curvature difference."}]
