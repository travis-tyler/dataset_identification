[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Motion-related artifacts are one of the major challenges associated with pediatric neuroimaging.\nRecent studies have shown a relationship between visual quality ratings of T 1 images and cortical reconstruction measures. Automated algorithms offer more precision in quantifying movementrelated artifacts compared to visual inspection. Thus, the goal of this study was to test three different automated quality assessment algorithms for structural MRI scans. The three algorithms included a Fourier-, integral-, and a gradient-based approach which were run on raw T 1 -weighted imaging data collected from four different scanners. The four cohorts included a total of 6,662 MRI scans from two waves of the Generation R Study, the NIH NHGRI Study, and the GUSTO Study. Using receiver operating characteristics with visually inspected quality ratings of the T 1 images, the area under the curve (AUC) for the gradient algorithm, which performed better than either the integral or Fourier approaches, was 0.95, 0.88, and 0.82 for the Generation R, NHGRI, and GUSTO studies, respectively. For scans of poor initial quality, repeating the scan often resulted in a better quality second image. Finally, we found that even minor differences in automated quality measurements were associated with FreeSurfer derived measures of cortical thickness and surface area, even in scans that were rated as good quality.

While artifacts in some sequences have the advantage of becoming a contrast medium in other sequences (i.e., diffusion or flow), other artifacts, such as motion artifacts, remain problematic in image analyses. In fact, motion related artifacts are one of the major challenges associated with imaging pediatric populations (Blumenthal, Zijdenbos, Molloy, & Giedd, 2002 , Backhausen et al., 2016 and has received considerable attention due to the influence of motion on connectivity-based analyses of resting-state fMRI (Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, & Petersen, 2012 , Satterthwaite et al., 2012 , Van Dijk, Sabuncu, & Buckner, 2012 . However, motion-related issues also impact structural MRI with evidence that movement related artifacts can influence measures such as volumes of cortical and deeper structures (Blumenthal et al., 2002 , Alexander-Bloch et al., 2016 and cortical thickness and surface area (Reuter et al., 2015 , Backhausen et al., 2016 , Ducharme et al., 2016 . Thus, metrics that can accurately quantify movement and other artifacts are important to not only select images that should be excluded, but also to potentially statistically correct for minor movements that can influence the morphologic variables. This is supported by a recent study finding that movement related artifacts affect cortical thickness, even after removal of scans that failed a stringent visual quality control procedure (Reuter et al., 2015) .\nQuality control is especially important as the neuroimaging field moves to increasingly larger sample sizes, with an exponentially increasing number of scans that require ratings. Structural scans typically undergo multiple visual assessment steps, such as an initial inspection for incidental findings, inspection to determine raw T 1 -weighted image quality, and following image processing with tools such as FreeSurfer to assure optimum segmentation and surface reconstruction (El Marroun et al., 2014 , Backhausen et al., 2016 . Multiple levels of visual inspection is not only time consuming, but errors can occur due to rater drift and difference in raters, resulting in a decrease of intra-and interrater reliability, respectively. Additional errors can occur in multi-site studies resulting from differences in raters and rating algorithms across multiple sites, since sites have an \"institutional history\" associated with how Q/A is performed. While visual inspection should always be performed, the development of automated algorithms to quantify image quality can be complementary to visual inspection. Automated algorithms have the advantage of not being prone to rater drift or performance differences between raters and also can provide more precise quality measurements. For example, Gardner et al. (1995) used images that were manipulated in such a way as to systematically alter cortical thickness to test the sensitivity of human raters. They found that visual raters were able to accurately detect changes of cortical thickness of about 40%, thus automated approaches should be able to detect more subtle differences compared to visual-inspection.\nThere are several different approaches in the literature to automatically derive quality assessment metrics from structural MRI scans (Atkinson, Hill, Stoyle, Summers, & Keevil, 1997 , Mortamet et al., 2009 , Pizarro et al., 2016 , and available software to generate quality assessment metrics (http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/quality-assessmentprotocol/index.html). Mortamet et al. (2009) measured voxel intensities in the background noise with the hypothesis that artifacts cause a rightskew in the distribution of voxel intensities. This approach was tested on a group of 188 elderly subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Jack et al., 2008) with good results. Pizarro et al. (2016) challenged this approach stating that one metric alone is not sufficient to capture the number of artifacts present in structural neuroimaging data. They presented findings from a machine learning approach where different features were extracted from structural imaging data.\nThey reported a sensitivity and specificity of their support vector machine (SVM) approach of 70.1% and 88.2%, respectively. However, it is unclear to what extent different MR platforms affected the accuracy.\nGiven the importance to obtain automated metrics for the quality of structural MRIs, the goal of this study was to develop and compare three different approaches (two novel and one variation of the approach by Mortamet et al., 2009) to measure the quality of structural MRI scans using four large cohorts that, while focusing on pediatric populations, cover the lifespan. Two of the metrics tested were based on the properties that voxels collected in k-space will contribute to the entire field-of-view following a Fourier transform from k-space to image space. Thus, movement of a subject during scanning results in \"waves,\"\nor banding, on the image seen in the spatial domain. The first two algorithms evaluate the noise characteristics outside the head, in the air, starting several voxels outside the head and extending laterally. The first approach utilizes a Fourier transform to capture the frequency characteristics of the noise ripples away from the edge of the head (ringing).\nThe second metric calculates the integral of the voxel intensities characterized as vectors radiating away from the head, an approach similar to the method used by Mortamet et al. (2009) . The third algorithm uses properties of the line spread function along the edge of the head, since movement is most prominent at the head/air interface (Barish and Jara, 1999) . These three automated approaches were compared to systematic visual inspections in each of the four cohorts, of which intra-and inter-rater reliabilities of the visual inspections are reported.\nFinally, we tested whether the automated quality assessment algorithm could predict the visually inspected quality of postprocessing reconstructions using FreeSurfer. Based on recent studies showing a relationship between automated derived measures cortical thickness and quality based on visual inspection, we also tested for the relationship between FreeSurfer-derived measures of cortical thickness and measures from the automated quality assessment. We hypothesized that automated algorithms will provide invaluable complementary information for visual inspection, with higher resolution metrics of quality that will provide a more accurate and reproducible threshold to exclude poor quality images from structural analyses.

The scripting and programming were performed in MATLAB (Version R2016a, Mathworks, Natick, MA); however, there is currently a beta Python version of the gradient approach available on Github (https://github.com/tjhwhite/auto_quality_assur-ace). The images were first converted from dicom to nifti using Dcm2Nii (http://lcni.uoregon.edu/downloads/mriconvert/mriconvertand-mcverter). Next, a brain mask was created using FSL's brain extraction tool (BET2) (https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) to identify the location and orientation of the brain in 3D space. The third step was to apply AFNI's 3dEdge3 (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/) to the raw T 1 image. AFNI's 3dEdge3 function is a three-dimensional edge detection\nalgorithm that returns an image with a clear outline of the interface between the outer border of the head and the air. However, we noted that in children with considerable movement, the edge detection failed to identify the edge of the head in a small number of regions. In these cases, the brain mask was used to find the missing borders of the head that were not detected via 3dEdge3. This step was performed automatically in the situation where the brain masked is reached before the edge when approaching the head from lateral to medial.\nWithin the 3D image field of view, the Euclidean distance was automatically calculated between the anterior, posterior, superior, right and left lateral borders of the head (defined by 3dEdge3) with each side of the field of view (FOV), respectively. This was performed to double-check that the whole head was captured within the image space (i.e., the child did not move part way out of the scanner's FOV).\nThese Euclidean distance parameters were used to select a volume of the image outside of the head that was used to evaluate image quality. Thus, our first approach was to assess the spatial frequency characteristics of voxels outside the head. For the Fourier transform algorithm, each k line of data underwent a Fourier transform starting 5 voxels outside the head. The 5 voxels provided a buffer from the rapid decline in voxel intensity that occurred along the air/head interface. Next, after removing the baseline component, the maximum to mean frequency was calculated by dividing the highest peak signal of the magnitude vector of the Fourier transform by the mean frequency across the spectrum.

Considering that the optimal high-quality image would show a strong edge effect resembling a step function, as the intensity of the image moves from the edge of the head to the air outside the head. No movement could be considered a delta function, such that the convolution of the step function with the delta function would return a step function, or a sharp contrast between the head/air interface. Movement, however, means that the step function at the edge of the head is convolved with a blurred, Gaussian-like waveform that has greater blurring dependent on movement. One way to measure is to deconvolve the step function with the actual image, to determine the waveform associated with smoothing.\nHowever, smoothing has a dual effect along the air/head interface. The peak MR signal resulting from the skin surrounding the skull will decrease in intensity and second, there is blurring radiating outward from the air/head border. Thus, the third approach measures the consequence of smoothing by measuring the gradient from the edge of the head to five voxels outside the head. This approach provides an estimate of the point-spread function as a result of blurring from poor image quality.

Of these three approaches, we found that the optimal approach was measuring the gradient between the edge of the head and the noise outside the head. However, the algorithm that calculated the integral of the noise outside the head was nearly equivalent. The\nFourier algorithm, which evaluated spectral patterns of noise radiating away from the head was the least predictive. We tested the gradient approach using two separate cohorts and found relatively high predictive values with the manual ratings. Furthermore, we found that not only can automated Q/A algorithms provide accurate ratings of raw T 1 images, but these measures can also provide some prediction of the quality of postprocessed images. In addition, we found that when scanning school age children, if the initial scan is of poor quality, repeating the scan is worthwhile as there is a good chance that the second scan will be of better quality than the first. Finally, we found that even after excluding large numbers of children due to movement, and even within the best rated scans, a small to moderate correlation remained between raw image quality and FreeSurfer derived measures of cortical thickness and surface area, although with some mixed results in the four different cohorts.\nNoise characteristics that can influence scan quality largely fall into two different categories: machine-related and subject-related noise.\nThe rapid advancement in MR technologies has dramatically reduced machine-related noise, although the regular use of phantoms is important to monitor scanner stability and geometric distortions over time (Bourel, Gibon, Coste, Daanen, & Rousseau, 1999 , Friedman and Glover, 2006 , Maikusa et al., 2013 ). In addition, major upgrades to MR hardware or software, while not considered noise, can influence image quality, and is especially important to consider in longitudinal studies.\nWhile major sources of subject-related noise include ghosting, aliasing, chemical shifts, and flow artifacts (Hahn et al., 1988 , Mirowitz, 1999 , Mortamet et al., 2009 , the major challenges associated with pediatric neuroimaging involve motion related artifacts (Raschle et al., 2009 , Dean et al., 2014 .\nMotion that occurs with data acquisition in the frequency domain can have two major effects in the spatial domain. First, movement that is periodic in nature (i.e., respiratory or cardiac related) occurs over the entire imaging sequence, and thus is observed as ghosting artifacts present in the spatial domain along the phase encoding direction (Saloner, 1999) . Second, aperiodic movement of the participants, such as \"wiggly\" children, typically occurs between the pulse excitation and the echo, resulting in spin incoherence of the phase at the time of the echo (Barish and Jara, 1999) . This incoherence, following a Fourier transform, results in increased noise and blurring in the spatial domain.\nGiven these patterns of subject-related noise, our use of three specific algorithms (Fourier, integral, and edge gradient) were applied and tested so as to capture the primary aspects of each of these specific movement-related artifacts.\nWhile visual inspection of images remains crucial, especially for the identification of incidental findings , automated measures can provide important quantitative information. In fact, comparing an automated versus visual ratings with images that were manipulated, Gardner et al. (1995) found that visual raters were unable FIG URE 3 Receiver operator characteristics for the NHGRI and GUSTO cohorts to detect slice thickness increases of 40%, whereas the automated approach was able to quantify even minor changes. Furthermore, for large population-based studies where multiple scans need to be rated, visual inspection of data can be prone to rater-differences (inter-rater reliability) and rater-drift (intra-rater reliability), which is not a problem with automated approaches. There have been several algorithms developed to automatically assess the quality of structural images (Mortamet et al., 2009 , Pizarro et al., 2016 . Mortamet et al. (2009) measured voxel intensities outside of the head with the hypothesis that artifacts enlarge the noise intensity and causes a right-skew (greater intensity) in the distribution. The authors applied the algorithm to a group of 188 elderly subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Jack et al., 2008) and found ROC characteristics similar to our gradient and integral approaches (AUC 5 0.94). Pizarro et al. (2016) argued that multiple metrics, rather than one global metric, would provide better measures of Q/A and presented findings from an automated structural QA algorithm that extracted multiple features from the brain and surrounding noise and entered these features into a support vector machine (SVM) to classify data quality. They reported an 80% accuracy with their SVM approach, where the lower accuracy could reflect the multisite nature of their study or alternatively, increased noise due to using multiple brain features. To date, there have been no studies evaluating automated Q/A in children and assessing these metrics directly with outcome measures such as cortical thickness.\nRecent functional MRI studies have demonstrated that even small amounts of subject motion in children can affect the quantification of connectivity metrics (Power et al., 2012) . To reduce head motion and also to get children acclimatized to the scanner and the environment, many research studies train subjects with a mock scanning session. In samples not only when the poorest quality images are included, but when many scans that passed Q/A were included. This finding supports using automated algorithms to assess for relationships with reconstruction metrics, and when such relationship exist, metrics from an automated Q/A algorithm should be used as a covariate to adjust for small differences in movement.\nThe strengths of the study include the large sample in four different groups of children and four different scanners, with the samples drawn from the general population. We tested and compared three different algorithms for quality assessment of structural images within the Generation R Study and tested the best performing metric in two independent samples. Finally, it is a strength that we also compared these findings to postprocessing streams, to assess for downstream effects.\nThere are also several weaknesses of the study. First, we did not measure heart rate, respiratory rate, eye tracking, and external fiduciary markers to more precisely quantify the different forms of artifacts.\nSuch an approach would be beneficial to assess which types of subject-dependent noise have the greatest influence. In addition, the cutoff that we used for useable versus not usable scans was different at each of the three sites. However, these differences provide a greater \"real-world\" application for our findings. Since the algorithm was first optimized and tested within the Generation R Study, it is possible that it was more \"tuned\" for the gradient sequences used for the Rotterdam site. Thus, it may be possible to tweak the algorithm to show improvement within each site. Finally, although we performed the automated Q/A algorithm on four different scanners, three of them were GE scanners (one was a wide-bore scanner) and it is possible other different vendors and models may have internal software, such as edge sharpening algorithms, that would make the gradient approach less accurate.\nThus, it is important to test the algorithm in a wide variety of MR In conclusion, we designed and tested three different automated approaches to measure the quality of structural MR images. We found that a simple gradient approach, which tapped into the principle of the line-spread function and measured the gradient between the edge of the head and noise outside the head performed slightly better in both waves of pediatric neuroimaging data in the Generation R Study. This | 1229 algorithm was then tested in two separate cohorts (NHGRI and GUSTO) and demonstrated that the predictive value for automated Q/A rating was, while less than in the Generation R Study, quite good. In addition, we demonstrated that in school age children, there is utility in repeating the structural scan if the first scan has poor quality, as the chances are high that the second scan is better than the first. During the scanning session, if we saw that the scan quality was poor, we explained to the children that the scan was blurry because of movement and would need to be repeated. We then kindly encouraged the children to remain as still as possible. This may have had a positive effect, as the second scan was on average considerably better.
