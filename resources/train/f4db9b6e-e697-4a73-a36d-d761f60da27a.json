[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The average length of time water remains within the boundaries of an aquatic system is one of the key parameters controlling the system's biogeochemical behavior. This time scale, which is generally referred to as the hydraulic residence time, provides a first order description of multiple and complex processes that create transport. This manuscript reviews the procedures to estimate these transport time scales and explores, through the analysis of numerical simulations, the links between these time scales and the underlying hydrodynamic processes in a canonical freshwater embayment, Little Sodus Bay (LSB, 43 o 20' N -76 o 42'30\" W). LSB has negligible through-flow and is connected permanently to Lake Ontario through a narrow and shallow channel. Exchange in the channel is the result of a multiple balance where spatial thermal variations (baroclinic forcing), oscillations in the water level (barotropic forcing), friction mixing, wind and the effects of the unsteadiness in the forcing are all important. Baroclinic processes are shown here to be the dominant transport mechanism in embayments like LSB. The largest density gradients across the channel are caused by episodic upwelling events in Lake Ontario during the stratified season, when exchange rates increase by at least an order of magnitude. The mean residence time scales undergo dramatic variations in time and space and in general, are comparable to the time scales of the systems' variability itself, such as those associated with seasonal changes in stratification, allowing complex patterns of intermittent exchange events to determine residence time scales. We demonstrate that the temporal variations of mean residence times occur at inter-annual, seasonal and down to synoptic time scales, and are closely related to the occurrence and frequency of upwelling events."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The average length of time water remains within the boundaries of an aquatic system (hydraulic residence time) has been proposed in the literature to explain a range of water quality phenomena such as the variability in lake eutrophication processes, thermal stratification, isotopic composition, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon concentration, elemental ratios of heavy metals and nutrients, mineralization rates of organic matter and primary production (see Monsen et al. 2002, for a list of references). The experiments of Fussman et al. 2000 go further, suggesting that the hydraulic residence time is a key parameter controlling the structure of aquatic ecosystems and the extent that these systems are self-organized or dominated by exogenous influences. In spite of the biological and chemical implications of the hydraulic residence time, there exists widely spread misconceptions and confusion among aquatic scientists on suitable methods for its determination (e.g. Monsen et al. 2002). The basic concepts on transport time scales and their application to coastal environments are laid out in the works of Zimmerman 1976 and Dronkers and Zimmerman 1982. There, the most commonly used terms to measure the retention of water or scalar quantities transported in the water are carefully defined, and suitable experiments are presented to calculate the defined time scales, with examples for coastal environments. More recently, Monsen et al. (2002) describe the procedures used to calculate these time scales in idealized systems and show the pitfalls of such procedures when applied to natural systems. These issues are illustrated using depth-averaged numerical simulations in a tidal shallow lake in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. While Monsen et al. (2002) raise very interesting issues regarding the influences of (1) unsteady flow; (2) spatial variability of bathymetry, circulation and transport time scales; and (3) tidal oscillations in the calculation of time scales, their objective is limited to a particular case in a coastal environment that they use to stimulate critical thinking. The literature on hydraulic residence time scales (e.g. Zimmerman 1976, Dronkers and Zimmerman 1982, Sanford et al. 1992, Hilton et al. 1998, Monsen et al. 2002 has focused on environments forced by energetic tidal oscillations, and hence, with relatively short transport time scales. In this work we explore the links between hydrodynamic processes and the transport time scales in Little Sodus Bay (LSB, 43 o 20' N -76 o 42'30\" W, Fig. 1) a weakly forced lacustrine system. LSB is a freshwater embayment with negligible through-flow but permanent connection to Lake Ontario through a narrow (75m) and long (550m) shallow channel, which acts as a sill. It represents a common class of freshwater embayments existing along the boundaries of the Great Lakes and many other large lakes of the world. The mean residence time scales in these weakly forced environments are comparable to the time scales of the systems' variability itself, such as those associated with seasonal changes in stratification, allowing complex patterns of intermittent exchange events to determine residence time scales. Therefore the analysis of residence times needs to be done across seasonal and interannual time scales. Given the inherent spatial and temporal limitations of observational programs and the complexities that result from multiple forcing mechanisms, we approach the problem of determining basin scale circulation, exchange, and hydraulic residence time scales by combining the analysis of field observations (see Rueda and Cowen 2004 for details) with time resolved unsteady three dimensional numerical simulations (details below). This manuscript is organized as follows. Basic concepts from reservoir theory and chemical engineering are first introduced, as they apply to lake embayments, in section 2, pointing to the stochastic nature of residence time and establishing the central role of its probability density function (the residence time distribution or RTD) in the analysis of biological-chemical reactors (chemostats). In section 3 the numerical model used in this work is described. Section 4 contains validation results and the analysis of the numerical simulations for a 48-day period starting on day 200, 2002. The numerical model is used in section 5: to determine the residence time distributions in LSB at different points throughout the basin, to establish their temporal dependence on seasonal time scales, to establish the influence of upwelling events on their shape, and finally, to explore the existence of inter-annual variability in the RTD of this and similar freshwater bodies."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Transport time scales: definitions -Any particle entering a lake embayment for the first time at time t 0 and at a location \u03b1 will describe a trajectory x(\u03b1, t, t 0 ), ultimately leaving the embayment at time t n . The time interval that a particle requires to cover its path from inlet to outlet (from time t 0 to t n ) is defined to be its transit time. The portion of the transit time between the time a particle arrives at a point within the embayment, x 0 (strictly speaking after arriving for the first time at x 0 , since a parcel may pass through x 0 more than once), and time t n is defined to be its residence time. The portion of the transit time between time t 0 and the time of first arrival at x 0 is defined as the particle's age (see Fig. 2). A second particle released at the same time t 0 and location \u03b1 will most probably describe a completely different trajectory x\u2032(\u03b1, t, t 0 ), due to turbulence and chaotic advection, and will have a different transit time, which points to the stochastic nature of transport time scales. Given the potential for temporal unsteadiness of the system, along with chaotic advection, a particle's trajectory, and hence its transit time, residence time and age, are strong functions of its exact starting time t 0 and its exact starting location \u03b1. As a stochastic variable the residence time for a starting time t 0 and starting location \u03b1 is characterized by its probability density function, or pdf. This pdf is termed the residence time distribution, or RTD. The RTD provides a first order description of transport in the aquatic system, and, as just argued, it will depend on \u03b1 and, in the case of unsteady systems (i.e., all natural systems), on t 0 . A bulk or integrative description (with no spatial dependence) of the transport characteristics of a water body is also definable if instead of tracking particles occupying a singular location at t 0 , one tracks the ensemble of particles existing in the whole water body at t 0 . The probability density function of the residence time for the ensemble of particles is the flushing time distribution (FTD). In unsteady systems, this bulk time scale is also a function of t 0 . To estimate the RTD conservative   tracers are injected, either instantaneously -known as the pulse method-, or continuously -known as the step method (Levenspiel 1999, Dronkers and Zimmerman 1982, Hilton et al. 1998. The pulse method is preferred over the step method, since the latter produces smooth results that tend to hide higher-frequency effects (see p.304 in Levenspiel 1999) and is more appropriate for the analysis of steady-state systems. In the pulse method a mass, m 0 , of tracer is injected at time t 0 and at location \u03b1, and the time varying tracer mass, m(t), remaining in the water body is monitored. The quantity m(t) is found from the spatial integration of the measured concentration field within the water body, and its decline over time reflects the net rate at which tracer leaves the water body. If none of the tracer that leaves the system ever returns, the residence time of a tracer particle is the time it takes that particle to leave the water body, and the rate of mass loss as a function of time, r(t), provides the RTD, which we will denote \u03c6(t),"}, {"section_title": "Characterization of the RTD and the FTD -", "text": "(1) Equation 1 shows that the RTD has units of [T] -1 . The mean residence time, based on the first moment of r(t), can then be calculated as If there is return of tracer from the outlet, or even potentially tracer leaving and returning through the inlet in flow reversing systems, m(t) does not reflect a unique composition of tracer particles and r(t) will not reflect the actual distribution of residence times, \u03c6(t). However, the calculation of mean residence time based on r(t) is still valid (Hilton et al. 1998). To estimate the FTD at time t 0, tracer is initially distributed uniformly throughout the system rather than being released at one single spatial location. The FTD is then calculated as in Eq. 1 and the mean flushing time as in Eq. 2. (3)"}, {"section_title": "Biogeochemical behavior of aquatic systems and the RTD -", "text": "where [A] 0 is the initial concentration of species A and k, the reaction rate, has units of [T] -1 . For a given molecule of A, the probability that it will react during time t (the cumulative distribution function of reaction time) is given by In a single continuous-flow reactor, molecules that have been in the system for a long-time will have a high-reaction probability, while those that have been in the system for a short time will have a low reaction probability. The probability that any given molecule reacts while it is in the system can be calculated by weighting the simple (batch) reaction probability, derived above, with the RTD, where the bar represents the reaction probability in the whole system. Combining Eqs. 4 and 5, the ratio of the concentration of species A at the outlet to the concentration at the inlet (an index of performance) is which shows that to predict the course of any irreversible first-order reaction in a flow system, we only need to know the RTD and the reaction rate constant. It is clear from Eq. 6 that the influence of the physical time scales of transport in the performance of the reactor will depend on the magnitude of the reaction time scale \u03c4 reac =1/k. A long tail in the RTD will not effect a fast reaction while a slow reaction will be strongly effected by the details of the RTD. The biogeochemical performance, defined as the ratio of species concentration at the outlet to the concentration at the inlet, only depends on the first moment of the RTD for idealized flow reactors (e.g. Clark 1996). However, to characterize the biogeochemical behavior of more general types of reactors, including environmental systems, one needs to fully determine the shape of the RTD/FTD."}, {"section_title": "Transport processes and the RTD -", "text": "The processes involved in the transport of particles from any point in the embayment until they reach the lake are classified here, for the sake of clarity in this presentation, into \"exchange\" processes, acting in the channel, and \"internal mixing\" processes, acting within the embayment. The difference between internal mixing and exchange time scales can be better understood using two idealized flow reactor models: the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and the plug-flow reactor (PFR \u2212 see Levenspiel 1999 for example). In the CSTR internal mixing is considered infinitely fast and the mean residence time is set by the rate at which exchange takes place. At the other extreme, in the PFR the mean residence time is controlled by the rate particles move within the reactor (internal mixing in our semantics), and the exchange processes do not set the RTD. Even though exchange and mixing processes are considered separately, they need to be jointly considered in the examination of basin water residence times since they are inextricably linked in the determination of mass fluxes across the channel (see Rueda and Cowen 2004). The baroclinic forcing, for example, in the channel is determined by the density in the respective basins, which is influenced by the dynamics within the basins themselves. Aquatic scientists have focused considerable attention on exchange processes, assuming that water bodies function as CSTRs, with instantaneous internal mixing. Under this assumption, and considering the system to be at steady state, the mean residence time is uniform throughout the basin and is easily calculated as the ratio of the volume of the body, \u2200 , to through-flow, Q, i.e."}, {"section_title": "Q \u03c4 r", "text": "The mean residence time in this case is identical to the mean flushing time. For tidal systems with negligible through-flow (as in LSB), Eq. 7 can also be applied at inter-tidal time scales, i.e., considering Q as the mean outflow 1 during a tidal cycle. This is the classical \"tidal prism\" method (Sanford et al. 1992). While the assumption of instantaneous internal mixing is better in \"highly\" energetic environments (such as coastal lagoons), it is rarely good and in weakly forced systems, such as LSB, it is completely errant. In such \"low energy\" environments, internal mixing processes determine to a large degree the rate at which lake water exchanges with the system, and hence the residence time. The importance of the internal mixing processes can be better understood using Stommel and Farmer's 1952 visualization of flood and ebb flows at LSB inlet, shown in Fig. 3. Although the assumption underlying Fig. 3, that water level changes are the dominant mechanism of exchange, is not strictly true, the conclusions remain the same. Figure 3 suggests that the same fluid mass is not transferred in and out of the basin on each tidal (event) cycle, the difference being a net mass transfer. The volume of water involved in the exchange, a jet during flood (filling of LSB) or the potential flow region during ebb (draining of LSB), will be, in general, much smaller than the total volume of the embayment. To determine net exchange rates the question that needs to be answered is, how rapidly the net water mass introduced during a tidal (event) cycle is mixed with the rest of the embayment water? In other words, at what rate is water at points in the embayment able to reach the area of active exchange? If this rate is low (low internal mixing) a phenomenon known as short-circuiting occurs, in which only water from the immediate vicinity of the inlet is involved in the exchange, and the RTD curves show long tails. If the rate water at all points in the embayment reaches the active exchange zone is high (high internal mixing) then the system approaches the idealized case of the CSTR. By comparing the exchange rates calculated using a 3-D model with the CSTR exchange rates one can have an idea of the efficiency of internal mixing."}, {"section_title": "Little Sodus Bay: the physical environment", "text": "Little Sodus Bay is a relatively small embayment on the south shore of Lake Ontario (Fig. 1). It has a small contributing watershed, from which it receives an annual mean daily discharge of approximately 0.15 m 3 s -1 . The embayment has a surface area of 2.96 km 2 , a maximum depth of about 12 m and a total volume of 2 x 10 7 m 3 . It is approximately 4 km long and 1 km wide, and it is connected to LO through a man-made channel with design length, width and depth of 550 m, 75 m and 3 m, respectively. At the mean level of LO, the water depth in the channel is approximately 2.4 m. LO water level undergoes oscillations on a wide range of time scales, including seasonal, synoptic (caused by weather phenomena, specifically wind) and sub-diurnal. Oscillations with periods shorter than diurnal include the semi-diurnal tides and seiches. The four lowest mode surface seiches have periods of 5.06, 3.21, 2.32 and 1.75 hours (Hamblin 1982 and Rueda and Cowen, 2004). The strongest wind events affecting LSB are in general from the west-northwest (synoptic), while the embayment is subject most frequently to relatively weak northerly or southerly winds, most probably of local nature (lake breezes). Westerly synoptic wind events drive increases in water levels along the southeastern shore of Lake Ontario (wind setup) while locally offshore winds (out of the south) drive more ephemeral drops in LO water level at LSB."}, {"section_title": "The Computational Model and its Forcing", "text": "Numerical simulations of water circulation and exchange in LSB were conducted with a three-dimensional (3-D) free surface hydrodynamic model (see Smith 1997, Rueda 2001and Rueda and Schladow 2002. The model is based on the continuity equation for incompressible fluids, the Reynolds-averaged form of the Navier-Stokes equations for momentum, the transport equation for temperature, and an equation of state relating temperature to fluid density. The governing hydrodynamic equations are solved in layeraveraged form using a semi-implicit, three-level, leapfrog-trapezoidal finite difference scheme on a staggered Cartesian grid. The scalar transport equation is solved using a two-level semi-implicit scheme that uses operator splitting. Only the vertical components of transport are treated implicitly, using the Crank-Nicholson or trapezoidal method for diffusion and the beta method (Gross 1997)  The computations were conducted on a domain that includes a small portion of Lake Ontario using 75 x 75 x 0.5 m grid cells (the computational domain is the same as shown in Fig. 1). A small portion of the lake was included so as to provide a reasonable representation of the temperature adjustment between the channel water and the lake water, and hence of the exchange processes through the channel. Assuming that Stommel and Farmer's (1952) visualization of tidal exchanges (Fig. 3) provides a first-order representation of the exchange processes when applied to Lake Ontario, one can estimate the area from which water will be drawn during a The discretization parameters were selected based on practicality and stability considerations. The spatial resolution was dictated by the need to adequately represent, to first order, the physics in the narrow (~ 75 m) and shallow (~ 3 m) connection between the embayment and the lake. With this level of spatial resolution, the time step, \u2206t, was set to 60 seconds to comply with the CFL condition (U\u2206t\u2206x -1 <1, U being the velocity scale) that guarantees numerical stability. The velocities in the channel, depending on the magnitude of water level oscillations, can be as high as 50-60 cm s -1 . The Courant number (U\u2206t\u2206x -1 ) is close to 1, which gives a sense of the restrictions that the need to represent exchange processes across small channels imposes on the numerical algorithms. To make sure that the model provides a valid representation of the circulation and exchange processes taking place in LSB, a 48-day period starting on day 200, 2002 was simulated with the model and the simulated time series of temperature profiles at two points (S3 and S4 in Fig. 1) were compared with the temperature observations collected at those same points and during that same period (see Fig. 4). The model was forced using observed temperatures in Lake Ontario (S1 in Fig. 1), heat and momentum fluxes calculated from local atmospheric variables (measured at the meteorological station shown in Fig. 1), and observed water levels changes in LSB (measured in S2, Fig.1). By using the observed water levels as boundary condition of the model, the water velocity in the channel is correctly represented both in phase and magnitude. Using the velocity field from the 48-day simulation a series of tracer release experiments were conducted, aimed at evaluating the role played by baroclinic and barotropic processes in replacing the embayment water by lake water. With the model already validated, and in order to examine the spatio-temporal changes in transport time scales, long-term numerical simulations of up to 9 months were conducted. In these simulations, the hydrodynamic and transport model was forced with hourly atmospheric records (wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and cloud cover) generated with the Northeast Regional Climate Center NRCC model (DeGaetano et al. 1993, DeGaetano et al. 1994 for Rochester, NY. To drive the model at the Lake Ontario boundary we used 1h historical records of lake levels at Rochester, NY from the CO-OPS National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) databases, and daily water temperatures collected at Shoremont intake (800 m off-shore at 8-10 m below the surface, also near Rochester, NY -the authorities are not allowed to reveal its exact location) and provided by the Monroe County Water Authority. Even though water level and temperature observed in Rochester do not exactly match the conditions at LSB, the frequency, magnitude and phase are close enough so that the exchange and transport driven by barotropic oscillations is well represented by the model. Using the velocity field generated in the long-term model runs, tracer release experiments of the type described in section 2 were simulated to obtain residence time distributions and flushing time distributions and their first moments. Those simulated RTD and FTD were used to examine the linkages between hydrodynamic processes and the transport time scales."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Validation", "text": "Temperature data collected at stations S3 and S4 (Fig. 1) were used for model validation. The data was collected between day 193 and day 250, 2002 with Seabird SBE 39 thermistors, sampling once per minute. Theremistors were spaced every meter in the vertical beginning 0.5 m below the free surface. Figures 4c and 4d, showing the simulated time evolution of isotherms at stations S3 and S4, respectively, reveal, when compared with their observed counterparts in Figs. 4a and 4b, that the long-term evolution of stratification in the water column is well captured by the model. By correctly representing the surface temperatures in the vicinity of the lake-embayment connection (Fig. 4e), the model is able to represent correctly the baroclinic forcing across the channel, and hence the residual transport. By correctly representing the temperature gradients in the water column (indicative of an appropriate parameterization of winddriven mixing processes), the model is able to capture the competition between the overturning wind forcing and the stabilizing effect of stratification, and hence the internal dynamics within the basin (see Fig. 4f). Also, both observations and simulations show experiments is similar to that proposed by Zimmerman 1976 to characterize the flushing time of a given water body, with the difference that here we mark water from the lake with a tracer 2 . To determine the flushing time one needs to conduct a long-term simulation until the mass in the embayment reaches a given fraction of its initial concentration. Here, the tracer is only followed as it enters the embayment during 4 days. The reason for doing a succession of short experiments, rather than a unique release at the beginning of the 48-day simulation, is that the mass flux in/out of the embayment is not constant along the 48-day simulation, even if we consider the volumetric flux constant in the channel and assume perfectly mixed conditions. In fact, under those conditions the embayment would behave as a CSTR, and the mass flux into the embayment would decrease exponentially. By using a series of short release experiments, the initial exchange rate and its evolution is characterized, and the conditions that control the exchange and mixing processes are revealed. The results of the experiments are summarized in Fig.6. The volumetric exchange rate \u2206V is obtained by dividing the change in tracer mass within the embayment during the 4-day by the initial concentration C 0 (= 100 units). This value is given in non-dimensional form (Fig. 6c), as a percentage of the volume of water in the embayment at the start of the simulation V 0 . From these experiments a measure of the internal mixing of lake water within the embayment is estimated. Such a measure is defined as the distance from the north end of the embayment to the point where, in a 1-D longitudinal projection of the 3-D results, the concentration is 10% of the concentration in Lake Ontario (i.e., 10 units). We refer to this length as the penetration length and it is non-dimensionalized using the maximum length of the LSB (3400 m). Exchange rates calculated from the day-240 release, with along-channel temperature differences, \u2206T c , of up to 16 o C, were two orders of magnitude larger than the rates for the day-216 release and one order of magnitude larger than the rates for the day-228 release (Fig. 6c). Almost 12% of LSB volume entered the embayment in the four-day simulation starting on day 240, a rate that, if maintained, would have renewed the embayment within 30 days. From day 216 to 220 \u2206T c is negligible (Fig. 6a), the amplitude of the velocity oscillations U 0 is low (Fig. 6b) and 0.1% of the embayment volume is exchanged (Fig. 6c). During the tracer experiment of day 228, \u2206T c is also small but U 0 is larger (the standard deviation of the velocity oscillations is twice that observed on day 216 or 240). The volume of water exchanged is only 1% of the embayment volume. The numerical simulations, hence, show that major exchange events coincide with large temperature differences across the lake-embayment connection, which are driven by Lake Ontario upwelling events. The penetration length follows a similar pattern, with larger values for larger temperature gradients, an indication that baroclinic processes are an effective mechanism for internal mixing. During the upwelling event of day 240 the internal dynamics of the embayment changes dramatically and the whole basin is actively involved in the exchange process. The barotropic processes are not as effective at driving exchange: the excursion of an individual particle during a typical 2 h seiche cycle is less than 500 m (recall this is the lake-embayment channel length scale), and considerably smaller than the length of the basin (4km). Using simulated velocity and concentration time series at the center of the channel, and following Fischer et al. 1979 (p. 255), the transport was decomposed into: (1) mean advection, (2) time-correlation of cross-sectional averages, (3) residual bidirectional exchange or residual circulation and (4) a residual that accounts for the effects of oscillatory shear flow and any other random motions. The averaging period used for the analysis is 12 hours. At this time scale, only the net effects of semi-diurnal tides and seiche-induced lake-level oscillations on transport are captured. Term 2 represents the contribution of barotropic processes to transport through the mechanism of exchange illustrated in Fig. 3. Its magnitude will critically depend on mixing rates on either end of the channel. By including part of Lake Ontario in the simulations of LSB we presume that these mixing rates are reasonably well represented. The contribution of density-and wind-driven processes is contained in the residual circulation transport. On average, the residual circulation is the dominant transport process during the 48 days of simulation. The relative contribution of the different terms depends, however, on the magnitude of the longitudinal velocity oscillations and the temperature gradients across the channel. Three cases are shown in Fig. 7. For the day-220 release (low \u2206T c and U 0 ), both terms 2 and 3 contribute equally to the flow into LSB, working against the mean advection (term 1) that pumps water out of the embayment during a period characterized by a continuous and steady decrease of water level in the lake (see Fig. 6a). For the experiment of day 228 (low \u2206T c and large U 0 ), term 2 is primarily responsible for the exchange, while for the day-240 experiment baroclinic transport is by far the dominant process."}, {"section_title": "Exchange rates: theoretical models and simulation results", "text": "Given that residual circulation is the major contributor to the exchange of water masses through the channel, it is natural to ask what drives this process and whether it is possible to estimate the exchange rates based on simplified models. Most of the literature (mainly in physical oceanography) has assumed that bi-directional exchange through topographic constrictions (either over a sill or through a contraction) is density-driven. It is further presumed that plan view changes in channel geometry are smooth and gradual (hence, the problem can be studied in a vertical plane) and that bathymetric variations are also smooth and gradual. Two different analytical models have been proposed to predict the flux under these conditions: (1) the internal hydraulic (IH) model (e.g.  and 2  Here B and H are the width and the depth of the channel at the contraction, respectively. Maximal exchange requires that two controls exist, where the internal Froude number is critical, and the hydraulic conditions in the channel are independent of the reservoir conditions on either side (i.e., supercritical flow must occur on the channel end sides of the controls). In the VAD model, the volumetric exchange rate through the channel can be calculated as (Hogg et al. 2001) where L is the length of the channel and K v is the vertical turbulent eddy viscosity/diffusivity. The exchange rate in the VAD model depends linearly on g\u00b4 (and roughly linearly on \u2206T c ), while in the hydraulic model it depends on the square root of g\u00b4 (and roughly on the square root of \u2206T c ) . where it has been assumed that the Prandtl number is one. The nondimensional mass flux across a contraction predicted by FIM is given by The net transport of mass into LSB, calculated from all the 3-D tracer experiments on a diurnal basis, is plotted in Fig. 8 as a function of the temperature difference across the channel. The 3-D results will be considered here as \"observations\". The \"predicted\" mass fluxes will be those calculated using the IH , VAD and FIM models, and they are also shown on the same plot. None of the theoretical models provide a satisfactory representation of the \"observed\" results in all cases. This is, in part, explained by the changing nature of the exchange processes in the LSB-LO channel, as shown in Rueda and Cowen (2004). Rueda and Cowen (2004) show that F i , the internal Froude number defined as where i is the layer number, could be either greater or less than 1, depending not only on \u2206T c but also on the strength of water surface oscillations and wind, which cause increases in the rate of mixing in the water column. For high \u2206T c , the \"observations\" get closer to the maximal hydraulic prediction, but the internal hydraulic model (Eq. 8) over-predicts, in most cases, the \"observed\" fluxes, suggesting that reservoir conditions indeed do influence the exchange flow across the channel (i.e., the fluxes across the channel are sub-maximal). For weak along-channel temperature gradients the scatter in the data is noticeable, which again suggests that (1) the conditions both in the lake and the embayment need to be considered, and/or (2) residual flow in the channel is not driven solely by temperature differences. In fact, wind can also force the residual circulation in the channel. A simple scaling analysis indicates that the relative magnitude of the wind and the baroclinic forcing in generating residual circulation can be expressed with a Wedderburn number- For We g >> 1 baroclinic forcing dominates while if We g << 1 wind forcing is dominant.

A visual inspection of the 18-year daily time series of lake water temperatures used to drive this section's simulations reveals a considerable interannual variability in the number and duration of upwelling events and the temperature changes induced by them. This fact, together with the large exchange and mixing rates associated with individual upwelling events observed in the simulations of section 4.3, suggests that there must be inter-annual changes in the mean flushing time scales of LSB with more active transport rates during years with more and/or stronger upwelling events. To test this hypothesis several flushing numerical experiments (see Background section -Characterization of FTD) were conducted for the years 1995 and 1999. The number of upwelling hours \u2206t u multiplied by the mean induced temperature changes \u2206T c provides a measure of the volume exchanged during upwelling events in a given period of time. In 1995 and 1999 this measure was, respectively, above and below the average of the 18year time series. Seven releases were performed each year, 30 days apart and starting on day 100. The tracer content in LSB was tracked for 270 days in each experiment. Thereafter, the tail of the FTD is calculated assuming internal complete mixing (i.e., an exponential decay). The rate of decay for the tail is calculated by fitting an exponential model to the tracer mass within the embayment vs. time curve for the last 120 days of the simulation. Figure 9a shows the first moment of the FTD curves for each of the seven simulations and for each of the two years. During summer releases the determined mean flushing times are approximately 35-40% shorter than during the spring and fall experiments, indicative of more active transport during the stratified season. More importantly, the mean flushing times in 1995 (with larger \u2206t u x \u2206T c ) are between 25 and 40% shorter than in 1999, suggesting that a considerable part of the inter-annual variability in transport rates is due to changes in frequency and duration of upwelling events in Lake Ontario. Figure 9b shows the FTD for a tracer released on day 150, 1995, which has been smoothed with a 7-day moving average filter. The peaks in the FTD indicate periods with active exchange, and they correspond to upwelling events (peaks in the reduced gravity time series, Fig. 9c). The flushing time distribution curves, and hence the value of their moments, are shaped by the occurrence of episodic events of large baroclinic gradients across the lake-embayment connection."}, {"section_title": "Residence times", "text": "In the construction of residence time curves, the currents in Lake Ontario are presumed to be strong enough that all water leaving the channel is immediately carried away from the LSB channel and replaced by lake water. By adopting this assumption, (1) one only needs to include LSB and the channel in the computational domain, simplifying the problem considerably and reducing the execution time, (2) the rate of mass loss versus time r(t) in these calculations becomes a true representation of the RTD, \u03c6(t), (3) one does not represent the behavior of biogeochemical constituents that can return to LSB without being modified in Lake Ontario, and (4) the barotropic processes become very efficient as exchange mechanisms (all mass leaving the channel during a seiche cycle is lost), in contrast with the case when part of the water exiting the embayment during ebb returns during flood (this case was considered in sections 4.3 and 4.4.1). Although, it can be argued that this is a strong simplification of the nature of the exchange phenomena, the focus of the experiments in this section is to reveal (1) the magnitude of the spatial variability of residence times within the embayment, and (2) the effects of the relative position (in time) between upwelling events and release times on their mean residence time. In addition, the RTD calculated in these experiments is a true representation of the RTD of a biogeochemical component for which exposure to the lake environment implies instantaneous degradation or death. An individual or particle of this component would immediately disappear upon exiting LSB into LO. A total of eight tracer experiments were simulated using data from year 1995 to drive the model. A fixed amount of tracer was released in LSB on days 90, 150, and every 20 days thereafter, at five different horizontal locations ( Fig. 9c and 9d). At each horizontal location two tracer slugs were released: at the surface (1.5 m deep) and at the bottom of the water column. Hence, a total of 10 tracer slugs were released in every experiment, and they are identified with a number (1 to 5) according to their horizontal location and with a letter that indicates whether the release point is surfacial (S) or deep (D). Each experiment lasts 270 days, and again in this case, the tail of the RTD is calculated presuming internal complete mixing after this 9-month period. The seasonal changes in mean residence times can be better understood by considering the canonical form of a residence time distribution for a purely diffusive system. The diffusive model has been proposed by Dronkers and Zimmerman 1982 to represent semi-enclosed tidal embayments at inter-tidal time scales. Figure 10 shows RTDs of such a system for a uniform diffusion coefficient, with an increase shortly after the release and a slow decay thereafter. This is also the shape of the RTD for LSB at monthly or bimonthly time scales. By using a diffusion coefficient D with a sinusoidal variation around an average value D 0 , one can mimic the seasonal effects of stratification. The characteristic time scales for the changes in the diffusion coefficients are chosen to be of the same order as the mean residence time for a system with D = D 0 , as is the case of LSB. These simple experiments show that the value of the diffusion coefficient at the release time and shortly after is critical as it determines changes in the shape of the RTD and hence its mean value. For D > D 0 shortly after the release, the RTD has a more pronounced increase and a faster decay, and the mean residence time decreases. For D < D 0 , the RTD has a less pronounced increase, a slower decay and its first moment increases. This effect appears in the RTD calculated with the 3-D model. The transport rates immediately after the fall releases (day 270), during the winter months, is low; the initial increase in the RTD curve is reduced and the fluxes as one moves away from the release time become larger. At the seasonal time scale the transport rate at the time of release has a considerable effect on the mean residence time. On much shorter time scales (order several days to weeks), this sensitivity to exchange rates at release time also occurs. Two major upwelling events occur shortly after days 170 and 210, 1995. In non-linear systems these events have profound consequences that cannot be ignored nor captured by simply assuming \"average\" physical conditions. The tracer slugs at 1S released on days 170 and 210 encounter a very active transport system (especially close to the connection) and hence the length of time that, on average, water at this location remains in the system is only 15 days. This is almost one-half the mean residence time determined at that same location two weeks before or after the major upwelling event, and 20-30% lower than the mean residence time away from the lake-embayment connection."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Observations and numerical simulations have been used in this work to study the transport time scales (residence and flushing times) in a small freshwater embayment (Little Sodus Bay) with negligible through-flow but permanent connection to a large lake (Lake Ontario) through a narrow and long channel, which acts as a sill. Given that the assumptions underlying simplistic approaches to calculating transport time scales do not apply to these systems, the residence and flushing time scales have been evaluated using tracer releases with a 3-D hydrodynamic model. The mean residence time in LSB was demonstrated to vary from 15 to 80 days, in space and time, and is of the same order as the time scale of seasonal changes in stratification. Transport is forced by variable and weak winds, oscillations in the water level -which, even in extreme cases, are at most on the order of several centimeters -, and spatial thermal variations. Horizontal density gradient driven processes are shown here to be the dominant transport mechanism. Temperature gradients across the lake-embayment connection are the result of (1) differences in thermal inertia, at the seasonal time scales, and (2), at shorter time scales (of one to several days), differences in the internal dynamics of the two water bodies connected through the channel. As shown by Rueda and Cowen (2004), the largest density gradients across the channel are caused by episodic upwelling events in Lake Ontario during the stratified season, driven by strong easterly and southeasterly wind events. The exchange rates during these events are shown here to be an order of magnitude larger than the exchange rates associated with barotropic processes (changes in lake levels), and thermal inertia driven baroclinic processes. Our results, hence, indicate that the renewal rates in freshwater embayments like LSB depend on the occurrence of upwelling events, the thermal gradients induced across the connections, their duration and frequency. The number of upwelling events in Lake Ontario varies from year to year, and is shown to explain inter-annual variations in the magnitude of the transport time scales in LSB. The control by upwelling frequency of the transport rates has strong implications for the study of spatial patterns of transport in embayments along Lake Ontario's shoreline. Given that the winds in the lake are predominantly from the west (Phillips and Almazan 1981), one would expect faster renewal rates in embayments located along the west and north shores relative to embayments along the lake's southern and eastern shores. Upwelling frequency also has implications on the spatio-temporal patterns of primary productivity in freshwater embayments that, like LSB, have small watersheds Lake Ontario, is very suggestive in this regard. Upwelling events occur if the longshore easterly wind impulse is larger than a threshold value, determined by stratification conditions in the water column and the magnitude of offshore (southerly) winds. Stratification in Lake Ontario is presumed constant and characterized by a 14 m deep thermocline and g\u2032 = 1.5x10 -3 m s -2 , typical of summer conditions (Schwab 1977). The Secchi depth time series shows cyclic changes, which are typical of lake environments (see for example Fig. 7 in Thomann et al. 1981). Each of the three upwelling events that occurred in the three summer months of 2001 precede periods of decreases in water transparency, as indicated by negative trends in the Secchi depths. We hypothesize that these decreases in transparency are the result of increased biological activity. While suggestive, it remains to be proven whether fluctuations in biological activity reflect an endogenous response of the system or are driven by exogenous (upwelling) influences. This research has focused on understanding water movement in a freshwater embayment, without considering the \"environmental conditions\" (pH, light, dissolved oxygen) that any given water parcel encounters on its trajectory as it leaves the system. The impact of varying these conditions could be of extraordinary importance to determine the outcome of a reactive transport process. A Lagrangian approach to water quality, which incorporates \"along the path\" variations, will be required to understand in detail the true role of water residence times in determining or influencing the biogeochemical behavior of any aquatic system. Water residence time, per se, is likely to be the determining factor for reactive transport if the system has homogenous environmental conditions, which is not the case in a natural freshwater system, even one with small dimensions. If water residence times are not the key parameters in the characterization of natural reactors, a question that future research will need to address is whether there exists a unique time scale that characterizes the ecosystem considered as an entity?
