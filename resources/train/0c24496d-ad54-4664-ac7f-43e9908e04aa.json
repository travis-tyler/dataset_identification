There were no significant differences in MMSE-DS, GDS-K, DEX-K, and DCAP-IADL. But, there were significant improvements in NPI-K(pre-test=6.3 \u00b1 6.9, post-test=1.6 \u00b1 2.7, p=0.017, Wilcoxon signed ranks test) and caregiver burden(pre-test=21.1 \u00b1 16.0, post-test=10.8 \u00b1 12.0, p=0.033, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). Conclusions: Group therapy based on traditional play for dementia patients might be effective on reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver burden. Further research will be required to confirm the effects of group therapy.

Cognitive function, activities of daily living, behavioral disturbances, global function, stage of dementia, drug discontinuation rate, and individual side effects were compared between memantine monotherapy and placebo groups. The primary outcomes were cognitive function and behavioral disturbances; the others were secondary outcomes. Results: Nine studies including 2433 patients that met the study's inclusion criteria were identified. Memantine monotherapy significantly improved cognitive function [standardized mean difference (SMD)=\u22120.27, 95% confidence interval (CI)=\u22120.39 to \u22120.14, p=0.0001], behavioral disturbances (SMD=\u22120.12, 95% CI=\u22120.22 to \u22120.01, p=0.03), activities of daily living (SMD=\u22120.09, 95% CI=\u22120.19 to \u22120.00, p=0.05), global function assessment (SMD=\u22120.18, 95% CI=\u22120.27 to \u22120.09, p=0.0001), and stage of dementia (SMD=\u22120.23, 95% CI=\u22120.33 to \u22120.12, p=0.0001) scores. Memantine was superior to placebo in terms of discontinuation because of inefficacy [risk ratio (RR)=0.36, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.74, p=0.006, number needed to harm (NNH)=non significant]. Moreover, memantine was associated with less agitation compared with placebo (RR=0.68, 95% CI=0.49 to 0.94, p=0.02, NNH=non significant). There were no significant differences in the rate of discontinuation because of all causes, all adverse events, and individual side effects other than agitation between the memantine monotherapy and placebo groups. Conclusions: Memantine monotherapy improved cognition, behavior, activities of daily living, global function, and stage of dementia and was well-tolerated by AD patients. However, the effect size in terms of efficacy outcomes was small and thus there is limited evidence of clinical benefit.\nCSF Beta-Amyloid and APOE E4 Related Decline in Episodic Memory over 12 months measured using the CANTAB in individuals with amnestic MCI: Results from the European-ADNI study Abstract Background: Accumulation of beta amyloid (A\u03b2) in the brain and carriage of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u025b4 allele have both been reported to independently and interactively linked with greater neurodegeneration, cognitive decline and incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, as most studies have observed these effects over 18-months or more, the effect of A\u03b2 and \u025b4 on cognitive decline over 12-months remains unknown. Detecting rapid cognitive decline is critical for monitoring efficacy over shorter periods. In this study we examined the effects of A\u03b2 and \u025b4 on rates of cognitive change assessed using the CANTAB over 12-months in aMCI patients. Methods: 145 participants with aMCI were recruited from the European-ADNI study. They were aged between 55-90, had a \u22651SD deficit in episodic memory and fulfilled a clinical diagnosis of aMCI. Participants underwent cognitive assessment using the CANTAB at baseline, 6 and 12 months and lumbar punctures for CSF measurement of Abeta42. Individuals were divided into A\u03b2+ (CSF-POS) (<550pg/ml)(n=55) and A\u03b2-(CSF-NEG)(>550pg/ml) (n=90)."}, {"section_title": "PT593", "text": "CSF Beta-Amyloid and APOE E4 Related Decline in Episodic Memory over 12 months measured using the CANTAB in individuals with amnestic MCI: Results from the European-ADNI study "}]
