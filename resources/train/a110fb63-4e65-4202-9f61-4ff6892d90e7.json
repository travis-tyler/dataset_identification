[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "An improvement in the forecasting and understanding of tropical cyclones (TCs) is very important because it can help reduce loss and damage caused by TCs. The causes of TC track and intensity changes are two issues that have been focused on by the scientific community during the past decades. Significant improvements have been made in the forecasting of TC tracks over the past decades (Rappaport et al. 2009;Elsberry 2014). However, the forecasting of TC intensity change has not improved as rapidly, especially the forecasting of TC rapid intensification (RI) (e.g., Elsberry et al. 2007;Rappaport et al. 2009;Chen et al. 2011;Elsberry 2014). RI is usually defined as a maximum sustained surface wind speed increase of at least 15.4 m/s (30 knots) over a 24-h period. The relatively low skill of intensity forecasts is primarily due to the complexity of TC RI processes, which involves small-and large-scale changes, TC internal processes, and multi-scale interactions between TCs and the atmospheric and oceanic environment. There is no doubt that a hurricane undergoing an unanticipated RI immediately prior to landfall will generate very large losses. Therefore, the accurate forecasting of TC RI is very important from societal and economic as well as scientific points of view. A better understanding of RI will help improve the forecasting of TC intensity. Lee et al. (2016) recently found a bimodality of the global TC lifetime maximum intensity distribution, emphasizing that RI plays an important role in the TC climatology. Many studies have focused on TC intensification; however, fewer studies have examined TC RI. In the North Atlantic, Kaplan and DeMaria (2003) and Kaplan et al. (2010) showed large-scale atmospheric and oceanic characteristics associated with TC RI. Klotzbach (2012) attempted to show potential impacts of interannual tropical Pacific ENSO events and intraseasonal variations of the Madden-Julian oscillation on TC RI in the North Atlantic basin. However, the long-term variation of TC RI in the North Atlantic and its detailed relationships with climate phenomena and large-scale oceanic and atmospheric variables are largely unknown. We do not know whether the large-scale environment modulates the RI frequency and location on longer time scales. The purpose of the present paper is to document and address these issues. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the data sets and methods used in this study. Section 3 briefly summarizes and examines seasonal and spatial distributions of RI events in the North Atlantic basin. Section 4 shows the variability of RI in the North Atlantic and its relationships with climate indices. In Section 5, we examine large-scale environmental variables related to RI variations. We then show contributions of climate phenomena to largescale environmental variables responsible for TC RI in Section 6. Finally, we give a summary and discussion."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "The TC data set is from the HURDAT2 database archived by the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) from 1950 to 2014 in the North Atlantic, which consists of the 6-hour estimates of position, maximum sustained surface wind speed and central pressure. This TC data set is used to identify the occurrence of RI. Following Kaplan and DeMaria (2003) and Kaplan et al. (2010), we define an RI event as an intensity increase of at least 15.4 m/s (30 knots) over a 24-h period. This is equivalent to the 95th percentile of overwater 24-h intensity changes of Atlantic basin TCs (Kaplan and DeMaria 2003;Kaplan et al. 2010Kaplan et al. , 2015. Oceanic variables, which can determine TC intensity, include sea surface temperature (SST) (e.g.,  and tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP) (e.g., Shay et al. 2000;Lin et al. 2005Lin et al. , 2009aLin et al. , 2009b. The monthly data set of the extended reconstructed SST version 3 is used and obtained from the NOAA National Climatic Data Center, with a horizontal resolution of 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 (Smith et al. 2008). TCHP represents ocean heat content contained in the waters warmer than 26 \u00b0C (e.g., Leipper 1967;Leipper and Volgenau 1972): where c p is specific heat at constant pressure (3.9 kJ/kg K), D 26 is the depth of the 26 \u00b0C isotherm, \u03c1(z) is the in-situ density, and T(z) is the in-situ temperature. TCHP is calculated by using the monthly mean temperature-salinity data from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) with a horizontal resolution of 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.5\u00b0 and 40 vertical levels (Carton and Giese 2008). The calculation of TCHP in this paper is from 1950 to 2010 because of SODA availability, but all of the other variables and analyses are from 1950 to 2014. Large-scale atmospheric environmental factors such as vertical wind shear (VWS) between 200 and 850 hPa (e.g., Merrill 1988;Kaplan and DeMaria 2003) and relative humidity (RHUM) at 500 hPa (Shu et al. 2012) also play a role in the RI process. VWS and RHUM are obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis fields (Kalnay et al. 1996). As in other studies, VWS is calculated as the magnitude of the vector difference between winds at 200 and 850 hPa. We also used the Twentieth Century Reanalysis version 2 (Compo et al. 2011) and obtained similar results (not shown). Climate indices used in this study include the NINO3.4 SST anomalies in the region of 5\u00b0S-5\u00b0N, 170\u00b0W-120\u00b0W, the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) index, the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) index, the SST anomalies in the hurricane main development region (MDR) [The MDR is defined as the region from 10\u00b0N-20\u00b0N, 85\u00b0W-15\u00b0W which is similar to that by Goldenberg and Shapiro (1996)], and the Atlantic warm pool (AWP) index. The AMO index is calculated as the detrended SST anomalies of the North Atlantic from the equator to 70\u00b0N (Enfield et al. 2001). The AWP index is calculated as the anomaly of the area of SST warmer than 28.5 \u00b0C divided by the climatological mean AWP area (Wang et al. 2008), which is comprised of the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea and the western tropical North Atlantic (TNA). The NAO index is defined as the principal component time series of the first leading mode of rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis of monthly mean 500-mb height over the Northern Hemisphere. All of these climate indices are calculated during the Atlantic hurricane season of June to November (JJASON), except for the NAO index which is also computed during the winter months of January to March (JFM). All of these climate indices are linearly detrended and standardized. The simple methods of linear correlation and linear regression are used in this study. For the significance test, we calculate the effective degrees of freedom (e.g., Quenouille 1952;Medhaug and Furevik 2011;Wang et al. 2012) as: where N is the number of data points for the time series of X and Y; R X1 or R Y1 is the autocorrelation at lag one; and R X2 or R Y2 is the autocorrelation at lag two. For some cases, we separate a variation into interannual and decadal-multidecadal variability. The decadal-multidecadal variability is obtained by performing a 7-year low-pass filter to the detrended oceanic and atmospheric variables. The interannual variability is calculated by subtracting the decadal-multidecadal variability from the detrended time series."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal and Spatial Distributions of RI Events", "text": "Before we examine the longer term variations of RI events in the North Atlantic, we first briefly summarize and examine the seasonal and spatial distributions of RI events. Figure 1 compares the seasonal distribution of the RI number with that of the TC number in the North  (Shieh and Colucci 2010) in association with the Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) (Wang 2007). Wang (2007) showed that the strong easterly CLLJ at 925 hPa results in the lower-tropospheric divergence east of the CLLJ core because of the acceleration of winds upstream of the CLLJ. Wang (2007) also suggested that the easterly CLLJ increases the moisture flux divergence in the Caribbean and thus suppresses the convection, decreasing rainfall and suppressing TC activity. These are consistent with the results of Shieh and Colucci (2010) who showed that lower-tropospheric divergence and subsidence are unfavorable for TC genesis and development. For years, hurricane forecasters have called the eastern Caribbean Sea a hurricane graveyard. The minimum of RI events in the eastern Caribbean shown in Fig. 3b supports these previous results."}, {"section_title": "Variability of RI and Climate Indices", "text": "The time series of the annual RI number from 1950 to 2014 is shown in Fig. 4. The RI time series does not show an obvious trend from 1950 to 2014, suggesting that the variation of RI in the North Atlantic does not yet show a trend due to global warming. However, the RI time series displays both interannual and decadal-multidecadal variability. The decadal-multidecadal variability resembles the AMO variation, with low values of RI during the 1980s and early 1990s and high values of RI before the 1980s and after the middle 1990s. Because of the RI multidecadal feature, we hereafter refer to this variation as multidecadal variability. To quantify the relationships of RI with climate indices, we calculate the correlations between the RI time series and climate indices of ENSO, the NAO, the AMO, MDR SST, and the AWP (Table 1). RI is significantly (above the 95% significance level) correlated with the June-November (JJASON) ENSO, MDR SST and AWP indices, but insignificantly correlated with the JJASON AMO and NAO indices. The insignificant correlation with the JJASON AMO is not surprising since the center of maximum SST anomalies associated with the AMO is in the high latitudes rather than in the tropics (e.g., Enfield et al. 2001). With regards to the NAO, RI is significantly and negatively related to the January-March (JFM) NAO index. This is because the mid-latitude atmosphere is most energetic during the winter NAO (Hurrel 1996). Thus, the winter NAO anomalies are more likely a better representation of the mid-latitude atmosphere than the summer and fall anomalies. The NAO linkage may be through the processes that the zonal wind forcing associated with a negative (positive) phase of the NAO results in weaker (stronger) trade winds which induce a warming (cooling) subtropical and tropical Atlantic Ocean (e.g., Enfield et al. 2006). During the winter months, when intrinsic mid-latitude atmospheric variability is most energetic, the atmosphere imparts an SST \"footprint\" onto the ocean via changes in the surface heat flux (Vimont et al. 2001). Vimont et al. (2003) further pointed out that the general feature of the footprint mechanism is not necessarily confined to the North Pacific. In fact, a similar mechanism also exists in the Atlantic. Using a simple and theoretical coupled ocean-atmosphere model, Xie (1999) showed that extratropical anomalies in the North Atlantic can extend into the tropics and provide the forcing for the tropics, under which the wind-evaporation-SST feedback acts to produce tropical variability. Physically, the NAO in the winter induces an SST change through the heat flux change and then the NAO-induced SST anomalies are maintained and developed by local positive feedback processes to the summer and fall. The local positive oceanatmosphere feedbacks can be the wind-evaporation-SST feedback proposed by Xie and Philander (1994) and/or the longwave radiation feedback associated with cloudiness by Wang and Enfield (2003). During the summer and fall, the SST footprint in the tropics forces atmospheric circulation anomalies that in turn affect TC RI during the Atlantic hurricane season of JJASON. Table 1 shows that the top three climate indices with high RI correlations are the JJASON NINO 3.4 and AWP indices, and the JFM NAO index. Thus, we examine and compare these three climate indices with the RI time series (Figs. 5, 6, 7). To better compare the RI time series with the climate indices, we standardize the RI time series and superimpose it on the climate indices. Multidecadal variability is obtained by performing a 7-year low-pass filter to the total index, and interannual variability is calculated by subtracting the multidecadal variability from the total index. The total NINO3.4 and NAO indices are negatively related to the RI time series, whereas the total AWP index is positively associated with the RI number. These indicate that the positive phases of ENSO and the NAO are unfavorable for RI of TCs, whereas the local ocean temperature increase in the TNA tends to rapidly intensify Atlantic TCs. On interannual time scales, it seems from Figs. 5b, 6b and 7b that all climate indices except for NINO3.4 are not highly related to the RI time series. Indeed, the correlation calculations in Table 2 do show that the NINO3.4 SST anomaly index is the only one that shows a significant (above the 95% confidence level) correlation with the RI time series on interannual time scales. This indicates that ENSO is a dominant climate factor for controlling RI of TCs on interannual time scales due to ENSO's impacts on Atlantic basin vertical wind shear (e.g., Gray 1984; Goldenberg and Shapiro 1996). A La Ni\u00f1a condition in the tropical Pacific is favorable for a TC to rapidly intensify in the Atlantic, whereas an El Ni\u00f1o is unfavorable. On multidecadal time scales, Figs. 5c, 6c and 7c seem to show that the indices of the AWP and NAO indices are highly related to the RI time series, but the NINO3.4 index is not. The correlations in Table 3 indeed show that all climate indices except ENSO and the AMO are significantly (above the 95% confidence level) correlated with the RI time series on multidecadal time scales. It seems surprising that the AMO does not significantly correlate with RI on multidecadal time scales. However, this may be understandable given that the center of maximum SST anomalies of the AMO is in the high latitudes rather than in the tropics (Delworth and Mann 2000;Enfield et al. 2001) and the effect of the AMO on TC activity operates via the AWP-induced atmospheric changes (Wang et al. 2008). Table 3 also shows that the highest RI correlation is the AWP index, which is consistent with the previous study of Wang et al. (2008) that the AWP acts as a link between climate and Atlantic TC activity on multidecadal time scales. In the last section, we showed that the seasonal RI distribution follows the seasonal TC distribution, with the peak of RI events in September. Are the variations of RI on longer time scales similar to those of the TC number in the North Atlantic? To answer this question, we plot the numbers of TC, TS, H and MH in Fig. 8. The variations of these numbers, to some degrees, are similar to those of RI events (Figs. 5. 8). However, a close examination reveals that the similarity is mostly on interannual time scales. The correlation calculations in "}, {"section_title": "Large-Scale Environmental Factors related to RI", "text": "In this section, we attempt to examine the spatial distributions of possible environmental factors responsible for the RI variations. In order for a TC to rapidly intensify, several oceanic and atmospheric conditions likely need to be satisfied. SSTs need to be very warm. Water temperatures need to be sufficiently warm through a relatively large depth of the ocean, which is represented and measured by TCHP. Atmospheric vertical wind shear needs to be low. When wind shear is high, the convection and circulation of the cyclone will be disrupted (e.g., Gray 1979; Kaplan and DeMaria 2003;Shu et al. 2012). Additionally, high relative humidity values in the mid-troposphere are necessary for TC development (e.g., Gray 1979Gray , 1988. Thus, here we focus on the spatial distributions of large-scale oceanic and atmospheric variables such as SST, TCHP, VWS and RHUM associated with RI (Fig. 9). In these regression calculations, we do not separate them into interannual and multidecadal variations because the interannual and multidecadal regressed patterns are similar to the total regressions shown in Fig. 9. The SST regressed patterns show a significant (above the 95% significance level) positive regression in the eastern Caribbean Sea just north of South America. However, this region shows a minimum of RI events (Fig. 3), suggesting that the SST in the TNA may not be a major factor for the RI variations. TCHP of the upper layer ocean shows a positive regression in the Caribbean Sea and the western TNA. The negative VWS regression values cover almost the entire MDR. These suggest that TCHP and VWS are important for TC RI in the MDR. The regressed pattern of 500-hPa RHUM displays a significant positive regression east of 50\u00b0W in the TNA. This indicates that if a TC forms in the eastern TNA, RHUM is a factor responsible for the TC to rapidly intensify. The climatological mean RI number in Fig. 3 shows We also examine the spatial distributions of SST, TCHP, VWS and RHUM associated with the numbers of TC, TS, H and MH. Figure 10 shows regressions of the TC number onto the SST, TCHP, VWS and RHUM during JJASON. The number of TCs does not show a significant relationship with these large-scale oceanic and atmospheric variables. However, when a tropical depression is further developed, the large-scale oceanic and atmospheric variables become more and more important. In particular, when a TC reaches a strength above the intensity of a hurricane, the distribution patterns of SST, TCHP, VWS and RHUM are similar to those associated with RI events (Fig. 11 versus Fig. 9). This is not a surprising result since about 52% of hurricanes experienced at least one time of RI in the North Atlantic. Additionally, we also perform the analyses of environmental composite differences between active and inactive years of TC, TS, H and MH (not shown). We find that SST difference in the MDR is not statistically significant for the TC case, whereas the SST differences are significant for those of TS, H and MH. The composite results are similar to those in Figs. 10 and 11. This further supports the argument that the large-scale environment is not critical to TC genesis and formation, but it is important to TC intensification. The above regression analyses show that the variations of TCHP, VWS and RHUM are important for TC RI in the MDR region. The time series of TCHP, VWS and RHUM in the MDR during JJASON are shown in Fig. 12 and their correlations with RI, TC, TS, H and MH are displayed in Table 5. Statistically, TCHP, VWS and RHUM in the MDR are significantly correlated with RI. The time series of VWS shows both interannual and multidecadal variations, whereas those of TCHP and RHUM vary mainly on interannual time scales without an obvious multidecadal signal. A comparison of Fig. 12b with Fig. 4 shows that the RI multidecadal variation is consistent with that of VWS, suggesting that the large-scale VWS multidecadal variation plays an important role in the RI multidecadal variation. However, TCHP and RHUM are significantly related to RI mainly on interannual time scales. Again, Table 5 shows that the numbers of TC are not correlated with TCHP, VWS and RHUM. However, when a tropical depression reaches at least TS intensity, the correlations with TCHP, VWS and RHUM start to become significant."}, {"section_title": "Influences of Climate Phenomena on Large-Scale Environmental Factors", "text": "The last section has shown the spatial patterns of large-scale environmental variables of SST, TCHP, VWS and RHUM associated with RI variations in the North Atlantic. In this section, we examine and show what causes the variations of SST, TCHP, VWS and RHUM, i.e., the contributions of climate phenomena to these large-scale oceanic and atmospheric variables.  (Fig. 13). Significant (above the 95% significance level) correlations between ENSO and VWS exist in the MDR and Caribbean Sea. This is consistent with previous studies that ENSO affects Atlantic TC activity through the change of VWS (e.g., Gray 1984;Goldenberg et al. 2001;Vecchi and Soden 2007). On the other hand, the AWP can significantly affect variations of SST, TCHP, VWS and RHUM in the TNA (Fig. 14). A comparison of Fig. 14 with Fig. 9 shows that AWP-related changes of SST, TCHP, VWS and RHUM can explain those associated with the RI variation. The significant influences of the wintertime NAO are on the SST and TCHP changes in the western MDR (Fig. 15a, 15b). Figure 15c shows that the NAO positively increases VWS in the TNA between 10\u00b0N-20\u00b0N, but the influence is not statistically significant. As shown in Fig. 15d, the NAO can significantly reduce RHUM in the western portion of the MDR. We also calculate the regressions of the JJASON AMO and MDR SST anomalies and JJASON NAO index onto SST, TCHP, VWS and RHUM during JJASON (not shown). As expected, the regressed patterns for the AMO and MDR SST anomalies are similar to those for the AWP index in Fig. 14. This is because when the AMO is in its warm (cold) phase, the AWP is large (small) (Wang et al. 2006(Wang et al. , 2008 although the largest SST anomalies of the AMO are located in the high latitudes of the North Atlantic. The same is true for the MDR SST anomalies. The regressed patterns for the JJASON NAO index are also similar to those for the JFM NAO index in Fig. 15, except for RHUM. The JJASON NAO index does not show a significant RHUM regression in the MDR. These regression calculations seem to suggest that the AWP variations can explain or account for most of the SST, TCHP, VWS and RHUM changes associated with the RI variations. However, we must keep in mind that climate phenomena are not independent. In other words, the AWP variations are indirectly related to other climate variations (e.g., Wang et al. 2006;Enfield et al. 2006;Zhang and Wang 2012). For example, Zhang and Wang 2012 "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Discussion", "text": "As stated in the Introduction, significant improvement has been made in the forecasting of TC tracks during the past decades. However, the forecasting of TC intensity change has not been improved much, especially for the forecasting of TC rapid intensification (RI) defined as a  18\u00b0N and 60\u00b0W-45\u00b0W, (2) the Gulf of Mexico and the western Caribbean Sea, and 3the open ocean southeast and east of Florida. We also find an RI minimum region in the eastern Caribbean Sea north of South America, consistent with the previous studies by Wang (2007) and Shieh and Colucci (2010) who showed local lower-tropospheric divergence and subsidence in association with the Caribbean low-level jet. The RI minimum region supports that the eastern Caribbean Sea is a hurricane graveyard. The time series of the annual RI number shows both interannual and multidecadal variability, but it does not display a long-term trend. The lack of the long-term trend suggests that global warming may not contribute to TC RI in the North Atlantic. On interannual time scales, the RI variation is significantly correlated with the numbers of TCs, tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes. However, on multidecadal time scales, RI is significantly correlated with the numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes. This is because the number of tropical depressions in the North Atlantic basin does not show a multidecadal variation. The RI multidecadal variability resembles the AMO variation, with low values of RI during the 1980s and early 1990s and high values of RI before the 1980s and after the middle 1990s. The RI multidecadal variability is consistent with the VWS multidecadal variation in the Atlantic hurricane MDR. The top three climate indices, which show high correlations with RI, are the JJASON ENSO and AWP indices, and the JFM NAO index. The ENSO impact is mainly on interannual time scales because of the dominant effect of the interannual ENSO climate phenomenon, whereas the others are on multidecadal time scales. It seems surprising that the AMO is not significantly correlated with RI on any time scales. This may be explained from the following points of view. First, although the AMO represents a basin-wide SST variation in the North Atlantic, its center of maximum SST anomalies is in the high latitudes rather than in the tropics (e.g., Delworth and Mann 2000;Enfield et al. 2001). Second, the periods for large and small AWPs coincide with the warm and cool phases of the AMO (Wang et al. 2008). As a result, the influences of the AMO on TC activity and climate may operate through the atmospheric changes induced by the AWP. Third, the AWP is in the path of or the birthplace of TCs in the Atlantic basin. Fourth, warm pool size (SST \u226528.5 \u00b0C) is an expression of SST anomalies, but is an index weighted toward regions of maximum SST where deep convective heating occurs. Therefore, the impacts of the ocean temperatures on RI multidecadal variability do not necessarily need a high correlation with the AMO index as long as the atmospheric convective condition is satisfied and conditions induced by tropical ocean temperature changes are favorable for a TC to rapidly intensify. The NAO represents a mid-or high-latitude atmospheric variation in the North Atlantic. The mid-latitude atmosphere of the NAO is most energetic in the winter and relatively quiet in the summer (e.g., Hurrel 1996), so the winter anomalies are more likely a better representation of mid-latitude atmospheric variability than the annually averaged anomalies. The winter NAO variation in the mid-latitudes influences tropical variability during the following summer and fall via the footprint mechanism (e.g., Vimont et al. 2001Vimont et al. , 2003 or the extension of extratropical anomalies maintained by ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropics (Xie 1999). During the winter months of energetic mid-latitude atmospheric variability, the atmosphere imparts an SST footprint onto the ocean via change in the surface heat flux. The SST footprint persists into the summer and fall seasons, when the mid-latitude atmosphere is more quiescent. The SST footprint forces an atmospheric circulation anomaly in the subtropical and tropical regions. This explains why the JFM NAO index is highly related to RI, but the JJASON NAO index is not. upwelling and vertical mixing of the cool underlying ocean by the TC vortex can produce a negative feedback between the atmosphere and ocean (e.g., Sutyrin and Khain 1984;Bender and Ginis 2000). However, Shay et al. (2000) and Hong et al. (2000) suggest that ocean warm eddies may reduce the magnitude of the mixing of subsurface water, thereby decreasing the magnitude of this negative feedback and thus increasing TC intensity in the Gulf of Mexico. Another example is the effect of ocean salinity. The upper ocean salinity distribution largely affects the stratification and stability which in turn influence the vertical mixing of the upper layer ocean and upwelling of cooler subsurface ocean water. A recent study by Balaguru et al. (2012) shows that the salinity-induced barrier layer can intensify a TC, suggesting the importance of salinity in TC activity. It seems to be obvious that salinity variability will change the energy of a TC supplied by the underlying ocean. We also compare the spatial distributions of large  Fig. 5 shows that in the North Atlantic basin rapidly intensifying events occurred in environment with weaker vertical wind shear than other regular-intensifying events, which is consistent with our result that low VWS is favorable for RI occurrence in the hurricane MDR. Our analyses in this paper are through linear correlations and regressions. It is thus important to discuss nonlinearities between hurricane occurrence and large scale climate variables. Emanuel and Nolan (2004) proposed an empirical index of the Genesis Potential Index (GPI) for considering the influence of atmospheric and oceanic variables on TC genesis. The GPI nonlinearly depends on the four large-scale environmental factors of the absolute vorticity at 850 hPa, relative humidity at 700 hPa, potential intensity, and vertical wind shear between 200 and 850 hPa. Recently, Jiang et al. (2012) linearized this GPI equation into four linear terms plus 11 nonlinear terms. The four linear terms are the contributions by the vorticity anomalies, the humidity anomalies, the PI anomalies and the wind shear anomalies. They calculated all terms and showed that the nonlinear terms are relatively small over eight phases of intraseasonal variability. This is also consistent with that of Camargo et al. (2009) who concluded that \"the nonlinearity is weak and thus the effectively linear analysis we have done in this section is valid\". Finally, the results and conclusions in this paper are under the assumption that observational data are reliable. However, some data issues exist in the data sets used in this study. For example, the TC data may have artificial increases in the number (especially for weak TCs such as tropical depressions) due to observational improvements in the recent decades (e.g., Vecchi and Knutson 2008;Landsea et al. 2010;Klotzbach and Landsea 2015). These data issues may affect the correlations and regressions shown in this paper.
