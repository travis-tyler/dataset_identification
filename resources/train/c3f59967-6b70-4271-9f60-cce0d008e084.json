[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This paper provides the first population-based evidence on how much standardized test scores vary among public school districts within each state and how segregation explains that variation. Using estimates based on roughly 300 million test score records in math and English Language Arts (ELA) for Grades 3 through 8 from every U.S. public school district during the 2008-09 to 2014-15 school years, we estimate intraclass correlations (ICCs) as a measure of between-district variation. We characterize the variation in the ICCs across states as well as the patterns in the ICCs over subjects, grades, and cohorts. Further, we investigate the relationship between the ICCs and measures of racial and socioeconomic segregation. We find that between-district variation is greatest, on average, in states with high levels of both White-Black and economic segregation."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "A verage student academic performance varies substantially among school districts in the United States. This is obvious from even the most cursory glance at publicly available test score data. But what factors shape this variation? To what extent is this variation due to differences in school quality, and to what extent is it due to the myriad of out-of-school factors that shape children's opportunities, including their family resources, neighborhood conditions, preschool programs, and afterschool activities?\nAnswering these questions requires, first, a comprehensive description of the degree and patterns of variation in academic performance among school districts in the United States. We do not currently have such a description, however. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests provide information on variation in academic performance among states but not among schools or districts. State accountability tests can provide school-or district-level information, but a comprehensive analysis is complicated by the fact that most states use different standardized tests and that publicly available data often do not include detailed information on each school or district's test score distribution. Other nationally representative studies conducted periodically by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) provide estimates of the variation in test scores among schools (e.g., Hedges & Hedberg, 2007) but cannot-because of their sampling designs-describe variation among districts, within individual states, or across a range of grades and student cohorts.\nIn this paper, we provide a comprehensive description of the patterns of between-district test score variation in the United States. We apply newly developed methods to estimate the proportion of total test score variance that lies between districts in each state, using summary-level data that represent roughly 300 million standardized math and English Language Arts (ELA) student test scores from every public school district in the United States during the 2008-09 through 2014-15 school years. As we demonstrate below, there is considerable variation among states in the degree to which test scores vary between school districts, and most of this variation is associated with factors outside of school districts' control: Between-district variation is greatest, on average, in states with high levels of between-district racial and economic segregation."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Why might test scores vary among school districts? At the district (rather than individual) level, students' average test scores are a function of their accumulated educational opportunities in and out of school to learn the tested material. To the extent that these opportunities vary systematically among school districts, district-average test scores will reflect this variation.\nEducational opportunity is closely tied to students' socioeconomic status, and differences among districts in the socioeconomic composition of their student populations is likely a key source of between-district variation in test scores. A large body of literature shows that family socioeconomic status is a strong predictor of academic performance-students from poorer families perform less well on tests relative to their affluent peers (e.g., Reardon, 2011; Sirin, 2005) . Even absent any contextual effects on academic achievement, the student-level correlation between family socioeconomic status and achievement will yield a corresponding district-level correlation. And greater economic segregation-more variation among districts in socioeconomic background-will exacerbate the variation among districts in average test scores.\nThere are many other factors that might similarly shape differences in average achievement across districts through economic or racial segregation-some of which are correlated with local median family income. These include differences in neighborhood conditions and resources (e.g., Sampson, Sharkey, & Raudenbush, 2008; Wodtke, Elwert, & Harding, 2016) ; differences in the availability and quality of child care, preschool, and afterschool programs (e.g., Chetty et al., 2011; Magnuson, Meyers, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2004) ; and-of course-differences in the resources, curricula, instructional practices, and other dimensions of the quality of local schools (e.g., Card & Krueger, 1992; Deming, Hastings, Kane, & Staiger, 2014) . Each of these family, school, and neighborhood factors may independently affect academic performance, but their effects may interact as well. For example, low-income communities may have lower average achievement than high-income communities not only because poor families can afford to provide their children with fewer educational resources at home but also because concentrated poverty may lead to lower quality preschool options (Valentino, 2017 ) and lower quality public K-12 schools. Highincome communities, where parents can afford to pay for highquality childcare and preschool, may also be able to attract more skilled K-12 teachers (Lankford, Loeb, & Wykoff, 2002) .\nThere is clear evidence that test scores vary among schools from national studies. For example, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, the Longitudinal Study of American Youth, and the National Educational Longitudinal Study, Hedges and Hedberg (2007) find unconditional betweenschool intraclass correlations (ICCs) of approximately 0.17 to 0.27, depending on the grade-level and subject. In other words, they find that one-fifth to one-quarter of the total variance in test scores on these national assessments is between-schools. Similarly, using the National Assessment of Education Progress data, Konstantopoulos (2009) finds ICCs ranging from 0.10 to 0.25. There have also been a subset of studies looking at betweenschool variance in particular states. Westine, Spybrook, and Taylor (2013) estimate ICCs using student-level data from Texas in Grades 5, 8, 10, and 11. They find that ICCs range from .10 to .20 depending on the subject (science, reading, or math) and grade. Using data from 11 states, Hedges and Hedberg (2014) show that between-school ICCs vary among states from 0.05 to 0.20 across subjects and grades. And notably, for some states (e.g., West Virginia), they find that these estimates differ significantly from the national between-school ICC estimates in their prior work (Hedges & Hedberg, 2007) . 1 There is little work, however, exploring how much betweendistrict test score variation exists and what factors explain this variation. Only one paper to our knowledge uses population data from a set of states to estimate between-district variation. Hedges and Hedberg (2014) estimate both between-school and between-district ICCs for multiple grades in both math and ELA for 11 states each in a single year. The authors show that between-district ICCs are generally much smaller than betweenschool ICCs-more of the total variation in test scores is between schools than between districts within a state. For example, in Grade 3 math, they find an average between-district ICC of 0.049, compared to a between-school ICC of 0.112. However, their study demonstrates that there is significant variation among states in between-district ICCs. In some states, average student performance was quite similar across districts; in others, performance varied considerably among districts. Hedges and Hedberg find two further patterns in the ICCs: that ICCs are generally larger in math than in reading and that between-district ICCs are, on average, larger in later grades than earlier ones. The authors, however, do not systematically explore factors that explain these patterns of variation and would be limited in their ability to do so given their sample of only a single year of data from each of only 11 states."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions and Hypotheses", "text": "In this paper, we seek to answer two central research questions:\n(1) How systematically does the amount of between-district variation in test scores vary across states, subjects, grades, and time? And (2) to what extent is this variation explained by the structure of school districts and the amount of racial and economic segregation between districts?\nIn line with prior work, we pose two hypotheses about why a relationship between segregation and between-district test score variance would exist. First, as prior work shows, family background and neighborhood conditions exert a strong influence on academic performance-particularly on the development of academic skills in early childhood and elementary school. This would lead to higher average performance in affluent school districts compared to poorer ones and therefore to more test score variation between districts when the between-district socioeconomic dispersion is wider. Second, school quality may be correlated with local socioeconomic and racial composition. If the schools in poor and predominantly Black and Hispanic school districts are inferior, on average, to those in affluent and predominantly White districts, this would also lead to the correlation between segregation and between-district test score variation. Together, these suggest that between-district variation will be higher in more economically and racially segregated states-states with larger disparities among districts in total resources both in and out and school.\nWe further hypothesize that the effects of exposure to differential educational resources may compound over time. If so, between-district test score variation should be larger in later grades relative to earlier grades. The logic is that local resources (whether in the home, the neighborhood, or the schools) affect academic achievement growth. As a result, not only do resourcepoor students start school behind their higher resource peers, but their academic performance grows more slowly. Therefore, differences in academic achievement related to differences in resources will be smaller when students are younger and grow as they age. This hypothesis suggests that. If true, between-district disparities in test performance should widen faster, on average, as children progress through school in more segregated states than in less segregated states.\nWe explore these hypotheses using population-level test score and covariate data collected across the United States."}, {"section_title": "Data and Measures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Test Score Data", "text": "The test score data in this study come from the federal EDFacts data collection system. The data were provided to us by NCES under a restricted data use license. The EDFacts data include counts of students in each of several ordered proficiency categories (labeled, for example, as \"below basic,\" \"basic,\" \"proficient,\" and \"advanced\"), by school, year, grade, and test subject for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Complete data, including math and ELA scores, are available for all tested students in third through eighth grade from the 2008-09 school year through 2014-15, with a small number of exceptions due to nonreport, pilot testing, or other extenuating circumstances (e.g., hacking). The full dataset contains information on the distribution of test scores in every subject-grade-year combination from nearly every school in the county, representing summary information from roughly 300 million standardized tests administered during this 7-year period.\nWe aggregate the data to produce counts of students in each proficiency category within each school district-year-grade-subject cell. For each grade, we define a school district as the set of public (including both charter and noncharter) schools that serve students in that grade which are located within the geographic boundaries of a traditional (noncharter) public school district. Operationally, this means we assign charter schools to the traditional (noncharter) local education authority (LEA) in which they are geographically located. By this definition, a district's test score distribution describes the distribution of academic performance of all public school students attending school in a geographically defined community. The average student test score in a district can therefore be thought of as the result of the total set of educational opportunities and constraints available to students in the community from birth through middle school-including opportunities in their homes, neighborhoods, child care and preschool programs, as well as their local public schools. 2 We exclude a small subset of the data. First, we exclude Hawai'i and the District of Columbia in all grades and years because each has only a single school district, making the estimation of between-district variation irrelevant. Second, we exclude schools administered by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) due to data comparability issues. Third, in some cases not all students in a state took the same grade-level subject test in a given year. In such cases, between-district variation in test scores will be conflated with between-district differences in the proportions of students taking each test. Based on this requirement, we exclude all data from Nebraska in the 2008-09 school year and math data from Nebraska in the 2009-10 school year, as districts were allowed to select their own assessments in these years and subjects. Additionally, we exclude math data for seventh and eighth grades from California and Virginia in all years, and from Texas in the 2011-12 through 2014-15 school years, as students take end-of-course math assessments. Finally, we exclude data with known reporting issues or data from states where less than 95% of enrolled students, as documented by NCES, were tested."}, {"section_title": "Measure of Between-District Variation in Test Scores", "text": "There are two approaches to measuring between-district variation in test scores. One approach estimates the variance of the means of districts' test score distributions relative to the population variance. This variance of means (denoted \u03c4 ) and the average within-district variance (denoted \u03c3 2 ) are typically estimated via maximum likelihood; the ICC is then defined as \u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c3 / + ( ) 2 ; if test scores are standardized to have a total variance of 1 (i.e., so that \u03c4 \u03c3 + = 2 1), then the ICC is simply \u03c4 (or, equivalently, 1 2 \u2212\u03c3 ). This is the approach used by Hedges and Hedberg (2014) . The ICC defined this way is useful in designing studies that sample participants from multiple school districts, because the sampling variance of parameter estimates (and therefore the statistical power of a study) depends on this ICC (e.g., Hedges & Hedberg, 2007; Jacob, Zhu, & Bloom, 2010; Raudenbush, Martinez, & Spybrook, 2007; Schochet, 2008) .\nThe other approach is a simple analysis-of-variance decomposition that partitions the total variance of test scores into between-and within-district components. The ICC defined this way describes the proportion of test score variance that lies between, rather than within, districts. If we knew the variance ( \u03c3 d 2 ) of test scores in each school district d in a metric in which test scores are standardized within each state-grade-year-subject, the analysis of variance ICC is defined as 1\nis the proportion of students in a state-grade-year-subject who are in district d. This parameter is useful for describing the patterns of academic performance in the population, since it takes into account the size of each school district.\nWhile both definitions of the ICC describe between-district variation in test scores, they are not identical. First, the analysis of variance approach weights districts by their enrollment, while the variance of means approach does not. Second, the variance of means approach is typically estimated by assuming a common within-district variance; the analysis of variance approach requires no such assumption. If all districts are the same size and the within-district variance is the same everywhere, the two approaches estimate the same parameter. When districts are of different sizes, the two approaches do not estimate the same ICC, because the unweighted variance of district means (\u03c4 ) is not generally equal to the proportion of test score variance that lies between districts.\nWe use the analysis-of-variance approach because it directly estimates the parameter we are interested in: the proportion of test score variance in a state that lies between districts. The variance in district means identifies this parameter only if all districts are the same size or have the same within-district test score variance. In most states, school districts vary widely in size; the analysis of variance approach implicitly gives little weight to small districts and more weight to the larger districts. Moreover, the analysis of variance approach does not require the unrealistic assumption that all districts have equal test score variance; our methods (described below) allow for the estimation of unique within-district variances.\nWe use the proficiency category counts in the EDFacts data to construct estimates of the between-district proportion of test score variance in each state-grade-year-subject. In order to estimate \u03c3 d 2 from the raw EDFacts proficiency data, we use a new adaptation of the heteroskedastic ordered probit model described by Reardon, Shear, Castellano, and Ho (2016) . Using this model, we estimate \u03c3 d 2 in each school district and then calculate the ICC using Equation (12) from that paper, shown below:\nwhere \u03c9 g 2 \uf0b6 is the estimated average sampling variance of the natural log of the standard deviations. The term 1 2 2 + \u03c9 g \uf0b6 in the denominator corrects the estimated ICC for the fact that the within-district standard deviations are estimated with error; without this correction, the estimated ICCs would be too small. Using both simulations and analyses of real test score data, Reardon et al. (2016) demonstrate that this approach provides nearly unbiased estimates of district-specific test score distributions and between-district ICCs under a wide range of conditions. Although the Reardon et al. ICC estimator is slightly positively biased, the authors show that the bias is generally very small-less than 0.005-unless all groups are very small (fewer than 100 students per grade), a condition not present in any state when using school districts as the target groups. 3 We perform all estimations using the -hetop-(\"heteroskedastic ordered probit\") command in Stata (StataCorp, 2013) . We estimate the between-district ICC in each state-grade-year-subject using the partially heteroskedastic ordered probit model described by Reardon et al. (2016) . This model estimates a common variance for all districts with fewer than 50 students per grade but allows the variances to vary among larger districts. The estimated ICC from this model has a smaller sampling variance and mean squared error than that from a fully heteroskedastic model. In a few states where only two proficiency categories are reported, we fit homoscedastic ordered probit models (constraining the variances in all districts to be the same), since the heteroskedastic model requires data with at least three ordered proficiency categories. 4\nIn total, we estimate 3,795 between-district ICCs from the 49 states in our sample. On average, we produce 77 ICC estimates per state of maximum possible 84 estimates = (2 subjects \u00d7 6 grades \u00d7 7 years). Appendix Table 1 shows the number of grade-year-subject estimates in our data by state. To all estimates, we apply a standard measurement error correction of 1 r , where r is the reported test reliability for the test used in that state-grade-year-subject. 5"}, {"section_title": "State-Level Covariates", "text": "Because small school districts tend to be more socioeconomically homogeneous than larger districts, we might expect lower low within-district variance in test scores in states with many small districts relative to states where most students are concentrated in a few large school districts. We therefore include in our regression models the number of school districts, the average district enrollment, and the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI) (Herfindahl, 1950; Hirschman, 1964; Hirschman & Albert, 1945) of school district enrollments. The HHI measures the extent to which students are concentrated in few large districts or many small ones. In the education literature, this is often referred to as a measure of school district fragmentation (Bischoff, 2008; Owens, 2016) . 6 We compute these three statistics using data from the Common Core of Data (CCD) 7 separately for each grade (3 through 8) in every year (2008-09 through 2014-15). We then average over grades and years within states to construct three state-level measures. 8 To measure segregation among school districts, we compute the between-district White-Black, White-Hispanic, and poornonpoor (using free lunch receipt as an indicator of poverty) information theory index (H) (Massey & Denton, 1988; Theil & Finezza, 1971) using CCD data. 9 Again, we compute the segregation measures separately by grade and year and then average each within states.\nIn our regression models, we use the natural logarithm of the number of districts and mean district enrollment. Additionally, we use a transformation of the fragmentation measure:\n. All variables are transformed after averaging over grades and years. These transformations improve model fit by linearizing the associations between each of the structural covariates and the ICC. Nonetheless, our substantive results are unchanged if we use the untransformed measures (results not shown). Summary statistics for all of the state-average covariates and transformed state-average covariates used on the models to improve fit are shown in Table 1 . There is significant variation in the structure of school districts across states. Specifically, states range from having approximately 15 school districts (Delaware) to over 1,000 school districts (Texas), with an average of approximately 265 school districts. Correspondingly, the mean gradelevel enrollment and standard deviation of grade-level enrollment vary quite significantly across states with some states having all small districts, others having all large districts, and the rest having a mix of both. The HHI ranges from approximately 0.43 (in \u02c6 Nevada) to 0.99 (in a number of states); however, most states have a value above 0.90, reflecting that for almost all states the probability that two randomly selected students are enrolled in different school districts is very high. For the segregation measures, the ranges indicate that in some states there is very little between-district racial and economic segregation (minimum values of each statistic \u2264 0.06), whereas in others there is quite dramatic between-district White-Black segregation (maximum value = 0.52), White-Hispanic segregation (maximum value = 0.45), and economic segregation (maximum values = 0.31). Values near 0.5 indicate that, on average, each district has only half the diversity of the population as a whole, whereas values less than 0.05 indicate that, on average, districts are at least 95% as diverse as the population as a whole. Generally, states with more racial segregation have more economic segregation (pairwise correlations of 0.72-0.85) and states with more White-Black segregation have more White-Hispanic segregation (correlation of 0.72). A more detailed table of these covariates by state can be found in Appendix Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Models", "text": "The data consist of 3,795 estimated ICCs, nested in 49 states and varying across grades, years, and test subjects. To accommodate the nested data structure and to take into account the varying sampling variance in the estimated ICCs, we fit precision-weighted random coefficients models to estimate the parameters of interest. The models include an intercept (denoted \u03b3 00 ), a vector of 11 cohort dummy variables each corresponding to the year a cohort of students was in fall of kindergarten (denoted C; we include dummies for the 2001 to 2011 cohorts and omit the dummy for the 2000 cohort) and a continuous variable denoting grade, and a set of state random effects that allow the ICCs and the linear component of their grade and cohort trends to vary among states. Specifically, the models have this form (one model for each test subject): ,\nwhere ICC sgy subject \uf0b7 is the ICC estimate for a state-grade-year case in a given subject; g sgy * is the grade (centered at 5.5); and c sgy * is the student cohort (centered at 2005.5). Note that we can include both a complete set of cohort dummy variables in the model and a random linear cohort term because the linear cohort term has no fixed component; the cohort dummy variables allow the average pattern across cohort to be estimated nonparametrically, while the random linear cohort term allows this nonparametric trend to differ by a linear component among states.\nWe assume that the estimation error r sgy is normally distributed with zero mean and known variance equal to v sgy , the estimated sampling variance of ICC sgy \uf0b7 ; the within-state residual error e sgy is normally distributed with mean zero and variance \u03c3 2 to be estimated; and the state-level errors u u \u2208[ ] 1 3 . We include the random linear terms on g * and c * because we reject the null hypotheses ( p < 0 001\n. ) that the grade and cohort trends do not vary among states (that is, that \u03c4 22 0 = and \u03c4 33 0 = ). Equation 1 describes our baseline model (Model 1), which includes no state-level covariates. In additional models, we add covariates as predictors of the intercept in Model 1 to assess their association with the ICCs. Model 2 includes the structural variables describing the size and number of school districts in a state (transformations of the number of districts, mean grade-level enrollment, and district fragmentation). Model 3 includes the three segregation measures: White-Black segregation, White-Hispanic segregation, and free lunch segregation. Model 4 includes both the structural variables and segregation measures.\nOur final model assesses whether these two sets of covariates are associated with growth in ICCs from third through eighth grade. Using Model 4 as our baseline, we add the structural covariates and the segregation measures as predictors of the grade slope (Model 5). The coefficients on the interactions of the segregation variables and the grade variable indicate the association of segregation with changes in ICCs as cohorts progress through school."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "On average, between-district ICCs vary significantly across the United States. Figure 1 maps the estimated average betweendistrict ICC in each subject. These are the Empirical Bayes estimates from Model 1 (shown in Table 2 ); though because the reliability of the estimates is over 0.99, there is virtually no shrinkage in these estimates. The ICCs range from near zero (0.009 in ELA, 0.013 in math) to 0.232 in ELA and 0.237 in math. An ICC of 0 implies that all test score variation is within districts (all districts have the same average test score), whereas an ICC of 0.2 means that one fifth of the total within-state variance in test scores is due to between-district differences. This is a relatively large ICC. In such a case, the population-weighted average between-district variance is one-quarter the populationweighted within-district variance (put differently, the district means have a population-weighted standard deviation that is half as large as the average within-district standard deviation of scores). The ICCs are generally larger in math than in ELA by approximately 12%-as shown by the darker coloring in the math map and intercepts in Table 2 . 10 However, despite this difference in magnitude, the correlation between the math and ELA ICCs is 0.943, which means that states with higher between-district variability in math also have higher betweendistrict variability in ELA. This high correlation suggests that the factors that generate more between-district variability within a state are not subject-specific.\nModel 1 provides clear evidence that the ICC increases over grades. The positive growth over grades in both subjects suggests that the factors leading to between-district variation in test scores compound over time. Moreover, the rate of increase varies across states. Some states exhibit negative subject-specific growth rates over grades and others large positive grade slopes. The average increase per grade is approximately 0.0063 in math and 0.0038 in ELA, so from third to eighth grade the average ICC increases by about 0.032 in math and 0.019 in ELA. This is approximately one third of the size of average ICC in math for the 2000 cohort (0.032 / 0.0992 = 0.32 or 32%) and one fifth of the average ICC in ELA for the 2000 cohort (0.019 / 0.0882 = 0.22 or 22%).\nFor both math and ELA, Model 1 also indicates that ICCs have increased among recent cohorts. Between the 2000 and 2011 cohorts, the average state's ICC increased substantiallyby 0.030 (or 31%) in math and 0.031 (or 35%) in ELA. Over the 12 cohorts included in our sample, the trend is nearly linear; in the interest of parsimony, we do not report all of the coefficients on the cohort dummies in Table 2 (though they are available in Appendix Table 2 ).\nIn both subjects, Model 2 shows that structural differences in district size and enrollment across states explain approximately one third of the variation in the ICCs across states (27%-36% depending on the subject). The three structural measures are not, however, jointly statistically significant in Model 2 (p = 0.16 in math; p = 0.047 in ELA). Model 3 shows that the three segregation measures are jointly statistically significant predictors of both math and ELA ICCs and together explain 84%-86% of the between-state variance (p < .01 in both math and ELA). Notably, adding structural covariates to the model (Model 4) explains only slightly more than the segregation measures alone (87%-88%), suggesting that segregation is the key factor in explaining variance in the ICCs among states. Across all models, free lunch segregation and White-Black segregation are both significant predictors of the ICCs; White-Hispanic segregation is not. The coefficient on free lunch segregation is much larger than the coefficient on White-Black segregation, particular in ELA (0.51 vs. 0.13 in math; 0.61 vs. 0.05 in ELA), indicating that between-district economic segregation may be a much more important driver of between-district test score variation than is racial segregation. Figure 2 plots the Empirical Bayes ICC estimates against the state-average White-Black and free lunch segregation to visually demonstrate their bivariate relationships. The correlations of White-Black segregation with math and ELA ICCs are 0.77 and 0.69, respectively, while the correlations of free lunch segregation and ICCS are even higher: 0.89 and 0.92, respectively. These strong correlations make clear that segregation is closely associated with the amount of between-district variation in the average student test scores among states.\nOur last analysis investigates the association between segregation and the rate at which the ICC changes across grades. Table  3 shows that the rate of change of the ICC from Grades 3 to 8 is positive on average but varies significantly among states. We hypothesized that in states with more segregation the compounding effects of differential exposure to resources may be larger than in less segregated states because the contrast in resources among districts is likely starker. The regression estimates in Table 3 provide some support for this hypothesis. Although none of the three segregation measures is individually significant as a predictor of the growth of ICCs across grades, the three measures jointly predict ICCs (p < .05), and the signs of the coefficients on the segregation variables are generally positive, indicating that in states with higher levels of racial and socioeconomic segregation, ICCs grow slightly faster from Grades 3 to 8, on average. Nonetheless, only a modest fraction (18%-24%) of the variance in the grade slope is explained by the segregation and structural variables in Model 5, indicating that factors other than segregation play an important role in shaping changes over grades in between-district academic performance."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our population-based analyses show that test scores vary substantially among states, ranging from an ICC near zero-no difference in average test scores among districts-to an ICC of 0.237-average performance differs considerably among districts. It further confirms two patterns suggested by prior research: that between-district variation is larger in math than in ELA and that between-district variance grows over grades. And it uncovers a new one, showing that between-district variation has grown over time. Specifically, we find that on average ICCs are 12% larger in math compared to ELA (although they are highly correlated), grow by up to 30% as students move from third through eighth grade, and have increased by more than 30% over the 12 cohorts in our sample. Almost 90% of the test score variation among states can be accounted for by patterns of between-district White-Black and economic segregation in addition to structural characteristics of school districts. In particular, states with high levels of White-Black and economic segregation have, on average, more betweendistrict variation. Further, this relationship is particularly strong for economic segregation. This is consistent with our hypothesis that segregation leads to large between-district differences in total family, neighborhood, and school socioeconomic conditions and resources, which, in turn, generates betweendistrict test score variation.\nAlthough our analyses show that the relationship between segregation and between-district variation is similar in math and ELA, the larger ICCs and higher growth rates in math suggest that mathematics test scores may be more sensitive than ELA scores to context. Evidence from prior research finds that educational interventions more often yield larger effects on test scores in mathematics than in ELA (e.g., Decker, Mayer, & Glaserman, 2004; Dobbie Intercept 0.0994*** 0.0994*** 0.0993*** 0.0992*** 0.0882*** 0.0882*** 0.0881*** 0.0882*** (0.0072) (0.0157) (0.0036) (0.0034) (0.0066) (0.0201) (0.0031) (0.0033) 2011 cohort 0.0298*** 0.0298*** 0.0300*** 0.0300*** 0.0309*** 0.0310*** 0.0310*** 0.0310*** (0.0060) (0.0065) (0.0062) (0.0062) (0.0055) (0.0085) (0.0061) (0.0054) Grade 0.0063*** 0.0063*** 0.0063*** 0.0063*** 0.0038*** 0.0038** 0.0038*** 0.0038*** (0.0008) (0.0010) (0.0008) (0.0008) (0 Fryer, 2011; Jacob, 2005) . Therefore, it may be that exposure to differential resources, particularly in the school context, may generate larger variability in mathematics test scores relative to ELA, and this difference may compound more over time."}, {"section_title": "&", "text": "About one fifth of the variance in the grade slopes among states is explained by segregation. ICCs grow slightly faster in more segregated states compared with others, suggesting that the effects of differences in exposure to resources may accumulate over time. However, most of the variation in the grade slopes among states is unexplained by segregation and structural factors.\nICCs have grown substantially-by 30%-over the 12 cohorts we examine here. Roughly speaking, that means the between-district standard deviation of test scores has grown by 15%, a sizeable change over a decade. Given the strong association we find between segregation and ICCs, the increase in ICCs may be driven by the trend of rising income segregation between school districts documented by Owens (2016) . Owens, however, finds that between-district income segregation among families with children grew by about 10% from 2000 to 2010, substantially less than the 30% increase in ICCs we observe between the cohorts of children starting kindergarten from 2000 to 2011. This suggests that increasing income segregation alone may not explain the increasing ICCs. Future research should investigate the rapid growth in between-district variation in test scores.\nBecause we have no direct measures of school district quality or measures of the between-district test score variation at the start of formal schooling, our analyses here cannot distinguish the relative importance of family, neighborhood, and school factors in shaping patterns of between-district test score variation. Moreover, we believe that they are likely not fully separable in practice. If local socioeconomic conditions shape school quality-because affluent districts are able to marshal more economic, social, and political resources and to attract and retain more skilled teachers and staff-then a key channel through which local socioeconomic conditions shape educational outcomes is through their effects on school quality.\nWhat is clear from this analysis, however, is the strong association between context-particularly socioeconomic contextand educational opportunity. We need to break this association in order to reduce educational inequality; however, that is not a simple task. There are multiple aspects of local context that contribute to variation in students' outcomes, including family background, neighborhood conditions, and school quality. Disentangling how each contributes (to the extent possible) will help identify the types of policies or programs that can improve students' educational opportunities. In particular, it will help us isolate what, if any, aspects of school quality drive betweendistrict variation in academic success and how we can use schools to improve students' educational opportunities in lower income, higher minority communities."}, {"section_title": "NoTES", "text": "This research was supported by grants from the Institute of Education Sciences (R305D110018 and R305B090016), the Spencer Foundation (Award 201500058), and the William T.

We thank Demetra Kalogrides for excellent research assistance. Some of the data used in this paper were provided by NCES. The opinions expressed here are ours and do not ICCs are a common measure of between-group variance. A substantial body of literature has investigated how to improve the estimation of between-school ICCs to inform experimental design using data from individual districts, state data, or national representative samples (e.g., Bloom, Richburg-Hayes, & Black, 2007; Hedges & Hedberg, 2007 Jacob et al., 2010; Konstantopoulos, 2011 Konstantopoulos, , 2012 Schochet, 2008; Westine et al., 2013; Zhu, Jacob, Bloom, & Xu, 2012) . These studies generally focus on using covariates to explain variance and thereby improve the minimal detectable effect size (MDES). We have not included a detailed review of this literature as it is beyond the scope of our paper. However, these studies underscore the relevance of using the ICC as a measure of between-district variation.\n2 Of course, not every public school student attends a school located in the geographic district in which he or she resides, but the overwhelming majority do. 3 Note that if we had computed the between-school ICCs, this would have been the case and the ICC estimates would be biased. Therefore, we do not report school-level ICCs. 4 Specifically, we fit the homoscedastic model in 82 of the 3,795 state-grade-year-subject cases. These cases include Colorado (36 cases; all subjects and grades in the 2008-09, 2009-10, and 2010-11 school years), Florida (12 cases; all subjects and grades in the 2008-09 school year), New Mexico (12; all subjects and grades in the 2014-15 school year), South Carolina (12 cases; all subjects and grades in the 2010-11 school year), and Texas (10 cases; all subjects, third through sixth grades in the 2011-12 school year). 5 The reliability data for each state's subject-grade-year tests were provided by Reardon and Ho (2015) and supplemented with additional publicly available information from state technical reports. For cases where no information was available, test reliabilities were imputed using data from other grades and years in the same state. The district fragmentation can be interpreted as the probability that two randomly chosen students in a state are enrolled in different school districts. For state s, grade g, and year y, it is defined as: , where T dgy and T sgy are number of students in a given grade (g) and year (y) enrolled in district d or state s, respectively. 7 Data files can be found on the CCD data page of the CCD website: http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/ccddata.asp. 8 We considered other measures including the standard deviation of district enrollment and the coefficient of variation of district enrollment but excluded these from our final models for parsimony, as they added no additional explanatory power. 9 Because there is missing free lunch data in the CCD, we use multiple imputation at the school level. We impute missing data using free lunch and racial composition data from other grades and years in the same school. We then collapse the imputed school-level data to the district-level and estimate the between-district poor-nonpoor segregation.\n10 Note that the larger math ICCs are not a function of greater reliability of math tests, since the reliability of state math tests and ELA tests do not differ appreciably and we adjust for reliability.
