[{"section_title": "Introduction Introduction Introduction Introduction", "text": "For many years, the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) has maintained a Directory of Linguistics Departments and Programs, which has included primarily academic institutions located in the United States and Canada. The print directory was a well-regarded resource for tracking basic information such as language and subfield specializations, student enrollment, number and type of degrees conferred, number and rank of faculty positions, and related demographic data for students and faculty. As the Directory evolved into an online resource, it became more difficult to produce an Annual Report with comprehensive information for all the North American institutions because fewer departments and programs provided data to the LSA. A primary objective of the 2012 LSA website redesign was to develop a much more robust Directory of Linguistics Departments and Programs. This redesigned directory would serve multiple potential audiences: prospective graduate students, prospective faculty, and administrators seeking benchmarking data. With this overhaul complete, the LSA then embarked on extensive outreach efforts to enlist the participation of \"departmental contacts\" in order to update the listings for individual institutions. For the 2018 Report, there was a very small increase in the number of reporting institutions from 2017 from 101 to 102. The list of participating institutions for the 2018 report is located in the Appendix. The LSA has also monitored and/or participated in a number of national (U.S.) surveys that track the status of linguistics in higher education. The National Science Foundation (NSF) reports data from two relevant surveys: The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). The federal Department of Education conducts and reports data from an annual survey, which is called the Integrated Postsecondary Data System (IPEDS), from over 7,500 post-secondary institutions. The most recent available data from all three of these surveys, towards the end of 2018 as well as at the beginning of 2019, are included in this report. In addition to these federal data initiatives, the American Academy of Arts & Sciences conducted a Humanities Departmental Survey (HDS), with financial and inkind support from the LSA, in 2007-8 (HDS) and 2012-13 (HDS-2). The 2012-13 HDS-2 was published in 2014, and select elements of data covering the field of linguistics in higher education appear in this report. The 2017-2018 HDS-3 is forthcoming. The report also contains 2014 data from the 2017 NSF report on Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering. In addition to the data collection and monitoring activities outlined above, the LSA maintains a member database with individual profiles that include demographic information, professional affiliations, and linguistic sub-specialties. Although most LSA members do not choose to provide demographic information, most do choose to provide professional and/or scholarly affiliations. Charts summarizing statistically relevant data from the LSA membership profiles are included in this report. The long-term goal of the LSA has been to compile data from all the relevant sources mentioned above and incorporate them into longitudinal charts showing change over time in the academic linguistics community. This year, the LSA is proud to present longitudinal charts for the first six years of the Annual Report, 2013-2017, alongside the 2018 statistics. The LSA also welcomes the opportunity to report on trends affecting linguists beyond academia, including those working in industry and government. Obtaining data for these populations is much more difficult, given the lack of systems in place for tracking these individuals and the lack of financial resources for creating such complex systems. LSA data on the number of degrees awarded by reporting institutions ( Figure 15B) shows an increase in all three types of degrees between 2013 and 2017, but the increase is more prominent in number of awarded Bachelor's degrees than in Master's degrees and PhDs, for which the rate is more stable. The assumption is that many linguists begin working in industries or areas of government after receiving their Bachelor's degree."}, {"section_title": "Overv Overv Overv Overview of Trends in Linguistics iew of Trends in Linguistics iew of Trends in Linguistics iew of Trends in Linguistics", "text": "The most common career outcome for linguistics PhDs is a position at an institution for higher education. There are, however, a significant number of linguists who work in industry or business careers. A small proportion of linguists pursue a career with the government after they graduate with their PhD. Within higher education, departments report that 42% of their faculty are full professors, but the nonprofessorial category is growing, particularly for women in other part-time positions. Additionally, women are almost on parity with men for tenure-track 1 jobs, but still fall below men in the number of full professor positions, with reporting departments showing an average of 2.9 male full professors to an average of 2.39 female full professors. The field of linguistics is growing rapidly for doctoral students. Between 2011 and 2015, 1377 doctoral degrees in linguistics were awarded, and in the first year alone of the next 5-year span between 2016 and 2020, nearly half of that number of doctorates have already been conferred with 635 linguistics students receiving PhDs from 2016-2017. Most linguistics doctoral degrees are awarded to women, who represent over half of graduate students in linguistics. This trend has remained consistent over the past six years. Overall, the number of linguistics PhDs dropped in 2017 for both men and women according to the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates (see Figure 17). The decrease in conferral of doctoral degrees is in direct contrast with the trend showing an increase in Bachelor's degrees awarded. More linguistics degrees, including Bachelor's, Master's, and PhDs, are awarded to White or Caucasian recipients than any other ethnicity. White degree awardees are followed by 1) Hispanic or Latino, 2) Asian, 3) Other or unknown race or ethnicity, 4) Two or more races, 5) Black or African American, 6) American Indian or Alaska Native, and 7) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (see Figure 18A)."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources Data Sources Data Sources Data Sources", "text": "LSA Directory LSA Directory LSA Directory LSA Directory Data found in this report come from a variety of sources. Information about departments and programs is self-reported in the LSA's online Directory, found at www.linguisticsociety.org/programs. Since the upgraded directory was redesigned in 2013, 205 out of 250 departments/programs provided updates to their profiles. The Directory was also updated in 2016 to include new fields with postal addresses so users may search programs by state or country. Calculations of numbers of job titles, students, degrees awarded, and average salaries are only from departments that have registered and submitted data about their students or faculty to the online directory in 2017 (102 departments, or under half of all registered departments). Less than half of those responding offer the PhD as their highest degree (82 of the 178 registered departments that reported that information). Since not all departments submitted data in every area, each graph in the following report is a representation of the departments that have reported data in that realm (91 departments for job type, 88 for current students, 43 for degrees awarded, and 10 for salaries). The graph on graduate specializations was compiled from only those programs who reported their specializations on their departmental page. Data on ethnicity of faculty and student populations is collected via the Directory, but only 11 institutions provided such data. Given the paucity of data, this report does not include any charts on ethnicity of faculty or students using data derived from the Directory; however, ethnicity information is included from the 2017 report Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering from the NSF. The data reported in several non-LSA tables detailing trends in linguistics over time come from three sources that survey samples of respondents. Data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) is collected annually from questionnaires submitted from individuals receiving doctorates in the past year. Respondents represent approximately 420 institutions. Information from the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) is collected biennially from a sample of doctoral recipients over a career-long time span. Reported data are weighted using the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) sample. The Linguistics data from the SDR is aggregated into the minor category of Other Social Sciences. The data from the SED reflect the survey results from the year 2017, which were released in December 2018.

This data set was compared with the responses from other humanities disciplines as well as data reported by departments and programs in the LSA Directory. In cases where the data diverged significantly, the discrepancies are noted in this report. For salary data, the American Association of University Professors Annual Report provides some general information about academic salaries, mostly in the context of looking at the contribution of salaries to the overall cost of higher education. The information is not specific to Linguistics, however. The report can be accessed at https://www.aaup.org/report/annual-report-economic-status-profession-2017-18."}, {"section_title": "Employment Employment Employment Employment", "text": "Although the LSA does not keep counts of non-member career outcomes for PhD linguists in the U.S., the NSF, through its Survey of Doctorate Recipients and its Survey of Earned Doctorates, can estimate the career outcomes of various disciplines. In the most recent reported survey, conducted in 2015, the most common career outcome for Linguistics PhDs is a position in an Educational Institution, followed by Business/Industry and Government. Note that these estimates are from survey data that approximate these totals based upon a small subsample of all respondents with PhDs in science, engineering and health fields.  Figure 1A. The data reported in Figure 1A are assumed to be approximately representative for doctorate degree holders in Linguistics (n=5100). The data in Figure 1B shows that a small percentage of Linguistics PhDs work in government, that less than one fourth work in business/industry and that the majority work in an educational institution as of 2015. For unexpired LSA members completing a profile in the membership database, the dominance of careers in Higher Education is more pronounced. The figures (2A and 2B) detail members' self-reporting of their employment sector in the LSA Members Database as of February 2019. Figure 3A shows nonstudent employment data between 2013 and early 2019, and Figure 3B compares the number of nonstudent members employed by a four-year college or university during that same time. It is important note that for the years of 2014 and 2015, the data shown in Figure 3B reflects all members and does not exclude student members. For all departments that reported employees by academic job title, more employees fell into the tenuretrack categories (1164, 86.2%) than the other categories. This shows a 5.7% increase from 2017, most likely generated by the more detailed reporting on job type from participating departments. The raw numbers below in Figure 4A show data from all reported departments. Figure 4B shows longitudinal changes in job titles from 2013-2018. For the total number of tenure track positions for data reported in The Linguistic Society of America 2018 (N=1164), there was a 206.3% increase in number from data reported in 2013 (N=380). However, this likely represents an increase in reporting institutions. Other positions, including adjunct faculty, postdoctoral fellows, self-employed members and lecturers, represented only 14% of the job titles. The average number for each category type in data from reporting institutions (see figure 5A)  for reporting departments is presented in Figure 5B, below. The large dip in averages by department in and 2016 is due to changes in the total number of reporting departments and data collection.   Figure 6A showcases the LSA Members who have listed their job title in the membership database, so the pattern cannot directly be compared. However, the pattern in tenure-track positions from Figure 4A is observed in Figure 6A, with Full Professors having the highest number of job titles. Adjunct Faculty, Lecturer/Instructor, and Not Applicable positions show a sizeable quantity, comparable to Other fulltime and part-time faculty.  Grand Total 2224 Figure 6B, below, shows LSA members by job title according to data collected between 2013 and 2018. Most numbers for 2018 remain relatively consistent with prior data. This is reflective of the total number of positions per category as reported in departmental data. The number of non-student members with tenure currently or prior to retirement has grown steadily over the years, with a 20.55% increase since 2013 (see figure 6C). Figure 6C also shows an anomalous rise in the number of nontenured, non-student members in 2015. There might have been an error in the way the data was exported in 2015. Furthermore, the fact that the number of LSA members with tenure is increasing may not reflect the number of tenured linguistics professors outside of the LSA member directory. It is possible that the tenured faculty who contribute to the LSA are more involved in the organization than non-tenured faculty and therefore represent a larger percentage of the membership. For registered LSA departments in the online Directory, the gender breakdown for job types is charted below in Figure 8.  Note that Figure 8 shows nearly twice as many women in the \"Other Full Time\" position than men in those categories; however, men still outnumber women, on average, in the \"Full Professor\" category. There are also on average more women in \"Other Part-Time\" and \"Associate Professor\" positions for 2018. However, women have never in the past five years averaged more \"Full Professor\" positions than men in the Directory data (see figure 10). This is true even though from 2013 to 2018 women have always averaged higher than men in total number of positions (see Figure 11). The Linguistic Society of America The two pie charts in Figure 9 below show the comparison of job titles in percentage by gender. There were, overall, 205 departments that reported on employment this year. Of those reporting, there were 209 male full professors and 179 female full professors for a total of 388 full professors at 72 departments. This was a decrease of 3 full professors from last year's data, which may be due to the drop in reporting departments. By percentage, 21% of women at reporting departments hold the position of full professor, while 28% of men at reporting departments do. Although both groups saw a decline from data reported in 2017 (29% for women and 40% from men), this disparity has remained consistent over the past five years, as seen in Figure 10, below.  Since the LSA began collecting data in 2013, men have averaged a higher number of full professor positions per department each year. Data from 2015-2017 suggests that the difference in number of female full professors per department remains stable at about 2.4, but the number of male full professors during that same time shows a decline. Figure 11 shows a breakdown of the average types of position per department by gender from 2013-2018. Overall, for each year, most departmental employees are women, but the average number of tenure-track positions for women is lower than for men. "}, {"section_title": "Salaries Salaries Salaries Salaries", "text": "Although there is not much data available about salaries for different professorial appointments, data for the programs that reported salaries to the LSA in 2018 was compared to the salaries reported by universities included in the 2017-2018 AAUP Survey (see figure 12A). The data collected from participating departments was also compared in a five-year span: 2014 (5 reported programs), 2015 (9 reported programs), 2016 (7 reported programs), 2017 (7 reported departments), and 2018 (10 reported departments).   Figure 12a shows an average of salary information per job title in the LSA directory for 2018 compared to the AAUP average. The data reported in the LSA directory in 2018 averages somewhat lower than reported averages from the AAUP survey. Generally, linguists' salaries as reported in the LSA Directory are representative of salaries for all professorial appointments as in the AAUP survey, but the small amount of data reported in the directory does not allow for any reliable generalizations. The difference between the LSA directory data and the AAUP survey is less pronounced in comparison with data from last year (see figure 12B).   Figure 12B shows the change in salary data over the past three years from departmental reported information. The reported salaries for full professor and lecturer show a positive change in 2018, and they show a decrease for both associate and assistant professors. Nonetheless, there are few participating departments reporting information, and for the 2018 data, there were only 10 reporting departments."}, {"section_title": "Degre Degre Degre Degree Production in Linguistics e Production in Linguistics e Production in Linguistics e Production in Linguistics", "text": "More students are pursuing and completing degrees in linguistics. In the last decade or so, this has been particularly true for undergraduate degree production, but the rate of production among those degrees has slowed down in recent years, as shown below in Figure 13. Bachelor's degrees, starting at the turn of the century show a steady increase. However, in recent years, this trend has begun to plateau. Bachelor's degree are the most common type of degree awarded for linguistics students according to the IPEDS data. Similar to Figure 13, Figure 14A shows that the trend in doctorate awardees in Linguistics in the last ten years has slowed quite a bit but is still positive overall. The graph shows an increase in Linguistics Doctorates from 2011-2015, and the trend stabilized through 2017. In Figure 14B, the number of institutions awarding doctorates in Linguistics shows a steady increase from the 1960s, a flattening in the late 1970s, and then a steady increase beginning in the late 90's. However, the graph itself shows a lot of fluctuation over approximately five-year periods. In 2015, there was a steep drop-off rate in the number of institutions that granted doctorates. The data for 2016-2017 shows that so far 635 linguistics doctorates were awarded, which hints that the number of awarded linguistics doctorates is on the rise.  Figure 15A shows the average number of degrees awarded, sorted by the highest degree offered at registered Directory departments and programs. In 2017, there were twice as many awarded Bachelor's on average from Bachelor's-granting institutions as in 2016, and in 2018, the average continued to grow by 11.75% from 2017, which shows that the conferral of Bachelor's degrees in linguistics is on the rise. However, this may be attributed to the reporting rates of participating programs. Out of 43 institutions that listed Bachelor's as the highest degree offered by their program, seven reported on how many degrees they awarded in 2018. The number of degrees awarded by institutions that listed Master's and PhD as their highest degrees is comparable to years past, except in the case of Bachelor's degrees awarded in programs whose highest degree is the Master's, which showed a 74.52% increase from 2017. Bachelor's degrees are the most awarded among the three categorizations of degree-awarding institutions.    Figure 16A shows LSA members' self-reported education status. For LSA regular non-student members who reported their highest degree earned, 74% hold PhDs. Eighty-three percent of all LSA student members who reported their education status are currently pursuing a graduate degree (MA or PhD). Among graduate student members of the LSA, more are in their first two years of graduate-level education than in later years in their educational trajectory. Figure 16B shows that although there was an increase in reported PhDs in 2014, the percentage of LSA members in each education group has remained consistent over the past five years.   Beginning in the mid-1980s, women began to outpace men in earned doctorates. While in the past, women were earning doctorates at a ratio of 6 to 4 to men, data from 2017 suggests that the number of doctorates earned by women has decreased (n=119, down 41 from 2015), and doctorates earned by men are also decreasing (n = 89, down 39 from 2015), as shown in Figure 17. While men still comprise the highest number of doctorate awardees, linguistics seems to remain a female-dominated field. Interestingly, there was a sharp decline in earned linguistics doctorates by women in 2009. It is possible that the financial crisis, which was recent at the time, influenced female doctoral candidates' decision to stay in their PhD programs. After the sharp decrease in 2009, the number of female doctoral students returned to its former rate of growth.   Figure 18A below shows the average number of current undergraduate and graduate students per program reported in the LSA Directory. The average for undergraduate women by program saw a decrease in 2018 from 51.34 in 2017, but average number of graduate women stayed the same. The average for undergraduate men showed a slight decrease from 28.48 in 2017, and the average for graduate mean did not change. Figure 18B shows consistent averages for men and women in undergraduate and graduate programs from 2013 to 2018. Figure 18B also shows that there are consistently more female than male students of linguistics in both graduate and undergraduate programs  1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 Figure 19A shows the averages for number of total graduate students per department compared against the total number of supported graduate students per department. The average number of graduate students saw a 7.43% decrease from an average of 36.99 in 2017, and the average number of supported graduate students fell by 28.07% from 21.98 in 2017. Figure 19B suggests a developing downward trend in the number of supported graduate students for the past six years of data collection. It is important to note that of the 68 institutions that reported the number of graduate students and/or the number of supported graduate students, only 33 reported both data points. For this reason, Figure 19A is based only on those 33 reporting departments.  The population of ethnic minorities with advanced degrees in linguistics is so low in the U.S. that few federal agencies report data for these groups. For this report, 2015 data from the 2017 Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering from the NSF was included in Figure  20A.  Figure 20A showcases Awardees in degree production in Linguistics in 2015. More degree awardees listed their ethnicity as White than any other ethnicity, regardless of type of degree, followed by Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Other or unknown race or ethnicity, Two or more races, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. For LSA members in Figure 20B, about 50% chose not to report their ethnicity (slightly down from 55% being unreported in 2017). The self-reported member data reflects similar counts of White/Caucasians as the most prominent self-identified ethnicity, with Asian American being the second largest selfidentified ethnicity. In comparison, the NSF data features more Mixed/Other, Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander awardees than the ethnic selfidentification reflected in the LSA member database. One possible explanation for the difference in ethnicity statistics between LSA membership and NSF survey data is that there is a possibility that the 50% of members who do not report their ethnicity might reflect the diversity of the NSF report.  In Figure 21, the ethnic self-identification of LSA members is reported for the last five years. It is not entirely possible to faithfully represent trends however because the LSA's data collection for ethnicity has changed over time. A few notable changes to data collection are that the LSA did not collect selfidentified ethnicity data for \"Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander\" members prior to 2014. Also in 2014, the LSA stopped collecting self-identified ethnicity data on members who identified as multiple ethnicities. In conjunction with the increase in number of reporting members beginning in 2015, this possibly explains the sudden jump in the \"Mixed/Other\" category: from 11 in 2013 to 72 in 2015. Furthermore, the jump in all categories between 2013 and 2014 is likely due to an increase in reporting members overall. As of February 2018, the LSA now also collects data on members who self-identify as \"Asian American.\" Data from this category will be included in future Annual Reports.  The HDS-2 asked a number of questions to the institutions surveyed, dividing the responses by academic field. Although the data for linguistics fell within the range of other fields in most areas, linguistics undergraduates are more likely than undergraduates in other fields to be taught by graduate students. In fact, this is almost twice as likely as the next field, Languages and Literature. The newest data from HDS-3 is forthcoming.  Although most departments did not report data on students, faculty, or salary, the majority entered graduate specializations offered by their department. Data was collected from the 187 departments who reported their highest degree offered. Note that the possible specializations were determined without the ability to edit, so departments could not report a number of other specializations, such as Romance or Hispanic Linguistics. Additionally, in the departmental directory update in 2016, General Linguistics was removed as a specialization. It appears that programs that offer a PhD as the highest degree have the most variety in their possible program specializations. The most popular program specializations are in syntax, semantics, phonology, phonetics and sociolinguistics. "}]
