Global economic leadership is tied very closely with the nation's strength in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). In the last half of the 20 th century, America's economic leadership stemmed in part from technological advances and discoveries made by its STEM workforce. While the STEM workforce comprises 5% of the total American workforce, it has been responsible for more than half of the sustained economic growth in the last fifty years (Babco, 2007). Our nation's long-term economic health will depend in part on the enhancement of the supply and quality of the STEM workforce. The Department of Commerce estimates that the STEM workforce will grow 1.7 times faster than the non-STEM workforce between 2008 and 2018 (The Department of Commerce, 2012). To meet the projected workforce needs, the current Obama administration has put forth a goal of increasing the number of students receiving undergraduate STEM degrees by one million over the next decade (President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2012; White House, 2012). As part of an integrated approach to achieve these one million graduates, community colleges are highlighted as potential pathways for students to achieve STEM degrees (White House, 2012). The role of 2-year postsecondary institutions commonly referred to as community colleges in the education of STEM majors is increasingly becoming an important pathway to STEM degrees (Horn, Neville, & Griffith, 2006). The influence of these institutions on the nation's STEM education pipeline is highlighted in a report based on the National Science Foundation (NSF) 2001 National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG), which found on average that 44% of science and engineering graduates attended a community college. While the NSRCG survey data does not distinguish between intensity and timing of attendance by students, it clearly substantiates the assertion that community colleges will have considerable future influence on the landscape of STEM education. The importance of community colleges in the STEM education pipeline is further supported by a study using 1996/01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study as the data source. Of those students who initially declare STEM majors in this study, 39.8 % attended community colleges. Important trends noted in this study include the predominance of Bachelor degree level students (> 50%) and mathematics, engineering, and computer/information science majors (50%) among students attending these institutions. To a lesser extent, students at higher degree levels and other types of STEM majors begin their postsecondary education at community colleges. One third of master degree and 8% of doctorate degree recipients, and approximately 25% of natural sciences, biological sciences, and physical sciences majors attended a 2-year institution as their first institution (Chen & Weko, 2009;Tsapogas, 2004). These trends aid in positioning community colleges as an important pathway for students to prepare to enter the STEM workforce. The composition of the STEM workforce is influenced by two key demographic parameters: gender and changing racial/ethnic demographics. The current retirement of the baby boomer generation from the STEM workforce, which has been traditionally dominated by white males, is creating a void in the STEM workforce. In order to fill this void, our future STEM workforce will need to mirror and embrace the changing population demographics. Participation of racial/ethnic minority groups as well as women who have long been underrepresented in certain sectors of the STEM workforce will be critical to create a competitive future STEM workforce (Babco, 2007;IBM Corporation, 2008;Science and Engineering Indicators 2006;United States Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, 2007). Of the minority groups increasing in numbers in the US, Hispanic citizens are predicted to experience the largest increase (33%) of all groups by 2018 (United States Department of Labor, 2010). African Americans are expected to double their population by the middle of the 21 st century while the white non-Hispanic part of population which has been the traditional source of the majority of STEM professionals will continue to decline steadily from 73% of the population in 1995 to 53% of the population in 2050, a decrease of almost 30% (Day, 1996). Currently, African Americans, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives combined are proportionally underrepresented in science and engineering occupations compared to their presence in the general population in the United States. These racial/ethnic minority groups constitute 24% of the general population and 10% of the science and engineering workforce. In contrast, Asian/Pacific Islanders minorities, which represent 5% of the population, hold 14% of science and engineering jobs. The presence of African Americans and Hispanics in the science and engineering workforce has doubled in the past three decades. Despite these modest improvements, the presence of African American and Hispanics in the STEM workforce is still unacceptable at 5% and 4% respectively in (National Science Board, 2010). Likewise, women have increased their presence in the science and engineering workforce from 12% in 1980 to 27% in 2007. Despite this positive trend for women, they are still opting out of joining the STEM workforce. Explanations for underrepresentation of women in the workforce include a lack of female role models and less family friendly flexible work conditions (Beede et al., 2011). These demographic trends highlight the importance of access of ethnic and racial minorities to the highest quality STEM education so they will be present in the STEM talent reservoir. The convergence of adequate numbers of qualified students traveling through the STEM education pipeline and the projected demographic trends of the American population over the next 50 years are singled out as influential parameters, which will affect the reservoir of potential STEM professionals (Business-higher education forum, 2010; Museus et al., 2011;United States Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, 2007). The challenge of increasing the presence of underrepresented minorities and women in STEM careers opens the doors for community colleges to play an important role in the education of racial/ethnic minorities and women as they enter postsecondary education. As of 2008, more than half of Hispanics, 44% of African Americans and 58% of women attended community colleges as their first postsecondary institution. STEM degree recipients mirror the same community college attendance trends reported. Over 60% of Hispanic STEM majors reported attending community colleges at some point during their postsecondary education. Similar trends are noted among other minorities with 45% of African American and 40% of Asian/Pacific Islanders having attended community college before receiving their baccalaureate or Master's degree (Tsapogas, 2004;Malcolm, 2010). One avenue to address the gaps in the STEM workforce resulting from demographic parameters can be accomplished by refocusing efforts on the STEM education pipeline (National Science Foundation, 2007). These demographic trends highlight the importance of access of ethnic and racial minorities to the highest quality STEM education so they will be present in the STEM talent reservoir. Increasing the presence of academically prepared racial/ethnic minorities and women in the STEM education pipeline with the necessary support systems will be one part of an integrated approach to meet the nation's future STEM workforce demands (National Academy of Science, 2010). The STEM education pipeline refers to the education pathway students follow through primary, secondary, postsecondary, and graduate levels to eventual STEM careers. In order to proceed successfully through the pipeline, students must maintain interest and motivation in the STEM fields, develop necessary academic skills, and find sufficient support systems to facilitate movement to the next level (Clotfelter, 2010;Museus, Palmer, Davis& Maramba, 2011). While there are many points where students pass in or out of the STEM education pipeline, one important decision-making milestone for postsecondary students is the choice of academic major. The choice of academic major has important implications for future careers and merits more study to expand the current theoretical models (Lackland & De Lisi, 2001). Understanding why students enter STEM fields will help educators and education policymakers facilitate and support students' entrance and movement through the STEM education pipeline. Much research efforts have concentrated to this point on (a) K-12 STEM preparation; (b) persistence/ retention in STEM programs; (c) degree completion by STEM majors. On the other hand, fewer efforts have concentrated on understanding why students enter the STEM fields (Anderson & Dongbin, 2006). Further, the majority of research effort focusing on college major choice either involves students who attend 4year colleges and universities or have merged 2-year and 4-year college students into one group. Currently, there is a gap in the literature concerning STEM majors, who begin their postsecondary education at 2-year institutions. Research on choice of STEM college major has emphasized the study of parameters such as student demographic characteristics and experiences in middle school, high school, and the first year of postsecondary education as important determinants in the choice of STEM major. Middle school, high school, and early college years are major points in the STEM education circuit where students can transfer in or out of STEM education. The term STEM education circuit is used instead of the more commonly term STEM pipeline to represent the multiple and varying pathways students employ in their journey toward completion of terminal STEM degrees (Museus et al., 2011). Researchers have found high school parameters such as interest in STEM, mathematic proficiency, math self-efficacy (Betz & Hackett, 1983), academic performance and STEM course taking patterns (Trusty, 2002) influence the choice of STEM major in postsecondary education. Racial differences in mathematics proficiency are evident early on with fewer African American and Hispanic students performing at a proficient or higher level than their white and Asian counterparts (National Center for Education Statistics, 2009). A steady decline in interest in STEM fields as students pass from middle school to high school into college affects the number of potential STEM majors in college. As students leave their middle school years, according to American College Testing (ACT) data, only one-third of 8 th graders are interested in STEM as they transition into high school (Business-Higher Education Forum, 2010). The pool of potential STEM college majors narrows further by the end of high school. By the time students reach 12 th grade, only 17.3% of 12 th graders are both proficient in mathematics and interested in STEM fields based on ACT data (Business-Higher Education Forum, 2010). While most research studies on college major choice have emphasized demographic characteristics and high school experiences, the first two years of college are also influential in the decision-making process as students often begin exploring different majors during their first years of college. In general, 30% of students change their majors during the first year (Clotfelter, 2010). As the students who are academically prepared and interested in STEM enter 4-year institutions, there is a substantial number who transition out of the STEM circuit into non-STEM majors. From a study (Clotfelter, 2010) using a sample restricted to full-time, traditional age students attending a 4-year institution with an expressed interest in STEM major upon entering college, 43% actually declared a STEM major. When restricting the sample further to students who have an interest in STEM and are academically prepared with ACT scores of 25 or greater in math and science, and a high school math grade point average (GPA) of 3.5 or greater, only 50-54 percent of students remained as STEM majors. In response to when the defections from STEM majors are most likely to occur, the very first semester at college is important in determining how committed a student is to staying in the STEM education circuit (Clotfelter, 2010). When students enter college with an interest in majoring in STEM fields, it is important that support systems are in place to facilitate student progress in the college major decision-making process. External supports which assist in successful transitioning into college can come in the form of academic integration which may be facilitated by positive interactions with faculty and advisors (Adelman, 1999;Kim, 2010;. With increasing college costs and time to STEM degree completion, students are struggling to finance their way through the STEM education circuit. Current changes in the type of financial aid available can affect their decision to major in STEM fields and hinder their progress to a terminal degree (Slater, 2011). The emergence of community colleges as an accessible pathway for students who pursue STEM degrees necessitates increased research effort to better develop effective education policy and practice. Since the majority of empirical research in college major choice research has focused on 4-year colleges and universities, studies that target community colleges will increase understanding of the parameters influencing this segment of students who enter postsecondary education for the first time. Further, given the important role community colleges play in the education of racial and ethnic minorities and women, more effort is needed to increase the success of these students as they pursue STEM degrees (Freedman, 2011;Malcolm, 2010;Museus et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Overview of This Study", "text": "This study will develop a model of STEM major choice to help educators, administrators, and education policymakers understand how high school and college experiences influence the choice of STEM major by community college students. This model will incorporate student demographics and high school and college experiences, which are documented in the literature as important factors in determining the choice of STEM college major. In choosing to focus on students who begin their postsecondary education at community colleges, this study hopes to examine a population of students who are missing from college major choice literature and are underutilized as a source of potential STEM majors. This study also seeks to highlight the differences in experiences of women/men and racial/ethnic minorities attending community colleges and their impact on choice of STEM college major. With these objectives in mind, the following research questions will guide the inquiry: 1) How do high school experiences such as math self-efficacy, math achievement, interest in STEM, and exposure to math and science influence the choice of STEM major by community college students? 2) How do college experiences such as interactions with faculty/advisor, receipt of financial aid, degree aspiration, and perceived college readiness in math and science influence the choice of STEM major by community college students? 3) Do these effects of high school and college experiences on STEM major choice vary by gender and race/ethnicity among community college students? This study will develop a model of STEM major choice using the social cognitive career theory (SCCT) as the conceptual framework (Lent et al., 1994;Lent, et al., 2003;McInerney, Didonato, Giagnacova, & O'Donnell, 2006;Nauta & Epperson, 2003). SCCT as a conceptual framework is particularly relevant to this study since the theoretical constructs included are self-efficacy, learning experiences, interest, outcome expectations, and environmental supports. Further, the sample for this study will be derived from Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS: 2002 which is one of the most recent national studies following a cohort of students from their sophomore year in 2002 through their first two years of postsecondary education in 2006. This study will focus on the period from senior year in high school through the second year of postsecondary education. The sample used in this study will include students who were high school seniors in spring 2004, participated in the second follow-up survey while attending a 2-year institution as their first postsecondary institution and declaring a major by 2006."}, {"section_title": "Significance of the Research", "text": "By focusing on students who begin their postsecondary education at community colleges, this study will provide insights into an important population of postsecondary students who contribute to the reservoir of STEM students in today's higher education system. There is a void in the STEM college major literature regarding community college students and their path to success in the STEM education pipeline. This study will examine the college major decision point in the STEM education pipeline. According to the conference report \"Community Colleges in the Evolving STEM Education Landscape\", some of the greatest challenges identified by leaders from community colleges and researchers with expertise in community colleges were: (a) overcoming inadequate preparation in mathematics, sciences and critical thinking of students entering postsecondary education; (b) recruiting students into the STEM education pipeline; (c) supporting them on their academic journey (Olson & Labov, 2012). These concerns were especially linked to women and minorities interested in STEM careers. This study will develop a college major choice model, which will include parameters of math self-efficacy, academic preparation, interest in STEM, education aspiration and environmental supports during community college attendance. Insights gained from the development of this model will assist high school administrators and teachers to design and implement better curriculum and policy that will inspire and academically prepare these students to successfully traverse the STEM education pipeline. By inclusion of college parameters such as student/faculty experiences and financial aid which might support potential STEM majors, insights into the role of faculty/advisors and financial support may prove helpful to STEM departments and campus financial aid officers. Parameters such degree aspiration and perceived college readiness in the proposed model will address the role of motivational issues and perception of the degree of alignment of math and science high school coursework with college level course requirements in the choice of STEM major. In order to further research college major choice literature, this study will test the usefulness of social cognitive career theory (SCCT) as a theoretical framework (Ma, 2009;Turner & Bowen, 1999;Nutting, 2008). The SCCT theory has been used as the theoretical basis for career choices but has been underutilized specifically in the study of STEM fields (Brown, 2002;Lent et al., 1994;Lent, et al., 2003). The addition of postsecondary support systems, which are available in SCCT, will enable the researcher to connect high school and college experiences into one cohesive model. This will enable policymakers to begin to view the STEM education pipeline from a K-16 perspective. Development of a model to understand why students enter the STEM fields will help educators and education policymakers better meet the needs of potential STEM students. Finally, this study also addresses recommendations made by the National Academy of Science, National Academy of Engineers, and Institute of Medicine to enhance America's ability to compete in today's global economy. Improving math/science education quality and accessibility of minority students to STEM education are two recommendations related to the STEM education important in ensuring a productive and viable STEM workforce in the United States (National Academy of Science, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Dissertation", "text": "After the introduction in Chapter One, a comprehensive review of the current literature in Chapter Two discusses theories utilized as conceptual frameworks and relevant parameters that influence STEM college major choice, followed by a summary and critique of the literature.

Although extensive research has been conducted on retention, persistence, and degree completion in the STEM fields (Brainard & Carlin, 1998;Daempfle, 2003Daempfle, /2004Seymour & Hewitt, 1997;Scott, Tolson, & Huang, 2009), research on selection of college major by students who are entering the STEM fields is not as well developed. Studies on students entering college often use the choice of college major as a source of measurable educational outcome. The education pathway leading up to the commitment to a STEM major begins early in the STEM education circuit with critical junctures beginning as early as middle and secondary school. The transition between secondary and postsecondary education is one point where there is a greatest loss of potential STEM majors. Even academically qualified students are choosing not to major in the STEM fields before they enter or when they enroll in college (Clotfelter, 2010;Lee, 2002). Attrition rates from science and engineering majors are similar for men and women during postsecondary education; however, real differences are seen in the rates of matriculation for men, women, and minorities into the STEM fields (Leslie, McClure, & Oaxaca, 1998). Before the actual choice of STEM major occurs, many factors such as gender, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, interest in STEM, pre-college academic preparation (Crisp, Nora, & Taggart, 2009) and college experiences, such as financial aid, academic integration and education aspiration affect a student's decision to major in the STEM fields (Slater, 2011;. Often these factors vary in impact along gender and racial/ethnic lines which make the understanding of how these factors affect the choice of STEM majors so critical (Anderson & Dongbin, 2006;Cole & Espinoza, 2008;Simpson, 2001). This literature review presents a critical analysis of the current state of research and theory in the area of choice of STEM college majors. The purposes of this literature review are (a) to critically review theoretical frameworks used to guide research in college major choice research; (b) to identify factors which have been reported in existing literature to influence the choice of academic major with particular emphasis on STEM majors; (c) to examine weaknesses and strengths of research on college major research studies; (d) to discuss data sources used in published studies; (e) to propose a model which uses an appropriate theoretical frame to predict choice of STEM major in second year community college students. I will include empirical studies dealing with the influence of student demographics (gender, race, and socioeconomic status), high school academic preparation, STEM interest, interactions with faculty/advisors, receipt of financial aid, education aspiration, and perceived college readiness in math and science on the choice of STEM as an academic college major in this review. Scholarly books and peerreviewed journal articles were found through electronic searches using educational databases (ERIC, Proquest, and Dissertation Abstracts) and web-based search engine, Google Scholar."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Framework for Choice of College Major Research", "text": "The theoretical frameworks guiding research in college major choice studies draw on career choice theories as a result of the connection between college majors and eventual career choice. The Holland's career development theory (Holland, 1997), Krumboltz's social learning theory of career decision making (Krumboltz, 1979), and Lent, Brown, and Hackett's social cognitive career theory (Lent & Brown, 1996) are important career development theories emphasized in college major choice studies. Career development theories are often used in studies on college major since the choice of major is an important step students take on their path to a future career. The choice of major is particularly important in the STEM fields given that there are very specific education requirements for many of the STEM careers. I will review and analyze each of these theories in details as follows."}, {"section_title": "Career development theories", "text": "Holland's career development theory. Holland's career development theory (Holland, 1959), which was first proposed in 1959, has focused on the relationship of an individual's personality or behavior style and choice of vocation. Holland's theory has stimulated substantial research activity since its development and remains one of the most popular career development theories (Patton & McMahon, 2006). The basic premise of the theory is that individuals seek congruence between their personality and work environment. This action is one of the driving forces in determining their choice of career or vocation. In Holland's theory the environment can refer to the work or career environment or college major as is the case in the studies in this review. Personalities and environments are characterized using Holland's categories of realistic (R), investigative (I), artistic (A), social (S), enterprising (E), and conventional (C) (Brown, 2002;Porter & Umbach, 2006 survey questions instead of using personality assessment instruments proved to be a limitation in the case of the investigative personality scale due to low reliability (Porter & Umbach, 2006). Several other studies used the Holland characterization of different college majors as realistic (R), investigative (I), artistic (A), social (S), enterprising (E), and conventional (C) in combination with Krumbolz's social learning theory to study the effect of learning environments on college major choice (Brown, 2002;Porter & Umbach, 2006;Trusty, 2002;. Krumbolz's social learning theory. Krumbolz's social learning theory of career decision (Krumboltz, 1979) is related to Holland's theory in that it also places importance on the fit of the individual with their environment. Interaction of individuals and their environment influence educational and occupational choices. An individual's environment includes learning experiences, which can occur informally at any time or formally in the classroom. These learning experiences bring about self-observation (perception of performance in specific areas) and task approach skills (coping, interpreting, adapting to environment), which in turn influence educational choice actions like choice of college major (Krumboltz, 1979). Although Krumboltz's social learning theory has not stimulated the same level of research activity recently as Holland's theory and the social cognitive career theory (Brown, 2002), studies of high school and middle school academic experience have utilized this theory as its conceptual framework when examining the learning environment of students and its impact on choice of college major (Trusty, 2002;Trusty, Robinson, Plata, & Ng, 2000 derives its theoretical basis from the social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1989, Lent & Brown, 1996. SCCT, which is utilized in the study of both academic and career behavior, borrows the three social cognitive constructs of self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and goals parameters from Bandura's social cognitive theory (Lent et al., 1994;Bandura & Adams, 1977;Lent, et al., 2003.) The SCCT model has been further refined and expanded to include learning experiences, interest, and environmental supports and barriers. All of these parameters can potentially influence career or academic related choices like academic major in college (Lent et al., 2003). Many studies examining the relationship between STEM major choice and academic or mathematics self-efficacy, interest, and math/science ability have generated research in support of the utility of this theory (Betz & Hackett, 1983;Leslie et al., 1998;McInerney et al., 2006;Nauta & Epperson, 2003). A recent study concerning STEM major choice, which links high school and college experiences has also taken advantage of the expansion of the CCST to include environmental supports, which are represented by the availability of financial aid, academic integration, and attendance of remediation courses in college .  (Song & Glick, 2004) and women ."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Framework", "text": "Although Krumboltz's social learning theory of career decision has been used as conceptual framework for studies dealing with STEM course patterns, the theory does not address the mathematics self-efficacy, interest, and contextual support outside the classroom environment which may support the college major decision process. In contrast, social cognitive career theory (SCCT) has, as its key constructs, self-efficacy beliefs, learning experiences, outcome expectations, interest, environmental supports and barriers, and choice action. Further, this theory provides the basis to connect individual, environmental, and behavioral variables over time (Bandura & Adams, 1977;Lent et al., 1994;Lent, et al., 2003). SCCT is a more comprehensive theory, which lends itself to the study of the complex nature of the college major choice decision. Of the three career development theories highlighted in this review, the social cognitive career theory possesses the theoretical constructs, which are expansive enough to include most important parameters cited in the literature to be influential in choice of STEM major. This theory allows for a more comprehensive perspective of STEM major choice by bridging the high school and college years and providing a context for environmental, social, and individual parameters to be examined."}, {"section_title": "Factors Influencing the Choice of College Major", "text": "Empirical studies, which are based in part on the theories discussed, have identified important factors that influence students choice of STEM major in college. These influential factors are organized into three sections: student background characteristics, high school experiences, and college experiences."}, {"section_title": "Student background characteristics", "text": "Gender. Despite the participation of women in higher education having reached an all-time high, the gender gap still remains in certain academic majors. Every study included in this review examines the influence of gender in combination with other important characteristics of students and their environments on the choice of college majors. One approach of tracking the gender gap over the past three decades involves following the distribution of women and men majoring in specific fields. Changes in the gender gap are captured by comparison in the dissimilarity index in specific fields. Decreasing dissimilarity indices indicate a move toward parity or complete integration for both women and men, whereas movement toward 100% indicates complete gender segregation of a field of study. The dissimilarity index of all-fields from 1965 to 1995 has shown a drop from 40% to 19%, which indicates there was movement toward equality of men and women across all college majors. The largest drop for all categories occurred between 1965 and the mid-1970s, followed by a drop of 10% between 1973 and 1983 for all fields of study except for arts/science/engineering fields. In contrast, the dissimilarity index for the arts/science/engineering fields increased after 1975 until the early 1980s. This movement toward separation of genders was followed by a leveling off and a moderate decline into the 1990s. While other career choices for men and women were merging and approaching parity, the dissimilarity index for arts/science/engineering fields stalled in the mid-1980s (Turner & Bowen, 1999). Attention to this slowdown in the movement toward gender parity in engineeringscience majors in the 1980s is exemplified by a small study focusing on a homogeneous sample of potential science majors from a selective liberal arts college (Ware, Steckler, & Leserman, 1985). The subjects shared similar characteristics of a strong interest in science major prior to college, a similar academic math/science background, and a high level of academic aptitude. Despite the similarities between these students, by the end of their freshmen year only 50% of women declared a major in a scientific area compared with 69% of men. The basic findings of this study will be supported and expanded further by more recent findings, which are included in this review. For women, the factors, which significantly predicted the choice of scientific fields, included outstanding academic preparation in mathematics, parental support, a need for a lucrative career or influential careers, and positive interactions with others. For this particular group of men only high school grades and certainty about major before entering college was of significance in their choice of major (Ware et al., 1985). In most cases the gender of the student is a robust predictor of academic major. For example, in Simpson's study across all racial/ethnic categories, female students were five times more likely to pursue a health-related degree than a technical degree program such as computer science, engineering, mathematics, or physics (Simpson, 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Race and Ethnicity.", "text": "In the interest of improving the STEM education pipeline, more attention is focused on increasing the presence of underrepresented minorities. In an early study by Maple and Stage in 1991, a model was developed using the high school experiences of students attending either 4-year or 2-year institutions in 1984 to explain math/science major choices for black and white students. The racial/gender subgroups were examined in the model which included type and number of academic courses planned and completed, future field of study declared in high school, high school grades, and parental influences as predictors (Maple & Stage, 1991). There is some evidence from another study of impact of expected labor returns on college major choice that women regardless of race/ethnicity backgrounds are less likely to choose STEM majors because they have lower economic expectations than men. Black students also appear to be unaffected by the potential expected economic returns from their choice of major (Staniec Ordovensky, 2004). Gender and Race/ethnicity Interactions. Numerous studies disaggregate their data into subgroups by gender and race/ethnicity (Hispanic males and females, white males and females etc.) in an effort to understand how gender and race/ethnicity intersect in the choice of STEM majors. With a few exceptions (Frehill, 1997;Ware et al., 1985) most recent studies into STEM major choice disaggregate their data into gender and racial/ethnic subgroups. The much-publicized changes in population demographics in the United States make the study of minority students important as their presence in the STEM fields needs improvement. Differences in the initial choice of natural and physical sciences majors for racial/ethnicity and gender subgroups are reported in a recent study (Dickson, 2010) involving three large universities in Texas. Although the focus of the study is the dynamic process of major choice starting with the initial choice through to the final choice of major, the study does provide some useful insights into the racial/ethnic difference of initial choice of major while controlling for academic preparation (Dickson, 2010). All women are more significantly likely to major in natural and physical sciences than white men even with similar test scores and class rank (Dickson, 2010). This gender gap holds across all the race/ethnic groups studied. The highest probability of majoring in the natural and physical sciences is for Asian females (.069), followed by Hispanic females (.050) and then white females (.017). Hispanic (.013) and Asian (.057) males are more likely to choose natural and physical sciences compared to their white counterparts (Dickson, 2010). Although females regardless of race are less likely to declare a physical science major when controlling for academic preparation and math attitudes, black females are the only group, which is moving parity with white males in physical science and  (Song & Glick, 2004). When Asian Americans are disaggregated into Chinese, Filipinos, Korean, and Southeast Asian, some interesting trends are noted when average starting salaries of certain college majors are examined. Since STEM majors have a higher earning potential than, for example, social science and humanities majors, the motivation of future earnings is an interesting perspective for choice of academic major. With the exception of Korean women, women from the other three Asian groups chose college majors that have higher earning potential than white females. Southeast Asian females chose the most lucrative major of the Asian American females. This is very consistent with the tendency of Asian American women to enter non-traditional female occupations at a higher rate than white females (Leung, Ivey, & Suzuki, 1994). In contrast, there was very little difference between ethnic groups for men with the exception of men from Southeast Asia, who tend to choose the most lucrative majors. Socioeconomic Status. Family socioeconomic status (SES) is an integral part of the explanation of how women and minority students view educational opportunities and decide on education choices (Oakes, 1990). The composite SES variables including family income, parental education level, and parental occupation prestige are used in the majority of studies in this review. One exception is Song's study of Asian American's college major choices. SES is defined in terms of the family income and the mother's educational level (Song & Glick, 2004).  found in the examination the influence of 8 th grade academic performance, gender, and SES on educational choice and while SES was the weakest predictor of the three, it was still a moderately strong predictor of major choice for both genders. Both  and Leppel, Williams, and Waldauer (2001) reported that women are more influenced by SES level in their major choices than men. As SES level increases, women are more likely to choose science/engineering or humanities/social sciences than business. This trend was also supported when college majors were classified using Holland's categories to classify college major types. The higher the SES level of women, the more likely they would choose non-traditional majors like science, medicine and engineering (I / investigative majors) . Men, on the other hand, were more likely to choose a business major as SES increases (Leppel et al., 2001). Some contradictory findings on the role of SES in choice of major are reported when majors are more broadly categorized into Arts & Sciences majors (math, science, humanities, and social sciences) and vocational majors (engineering, business, preprofessional programs like medicine, law, and architecture) (Goyette & Mullen, 2006). In general, the Art & Sciences majors reported higher SES levels than vocational majors. Within the A&S major category, there were variations in SES level. Science and math majors reported slightly lower SES than humanities and social science majors. There were significant differences between the SES of engineers, pre-professional majors, and other occupationally oriented majors. Engineering majors had the highest SES among vocational majors. Gender differences along SES levels were also apparent in major choice. Male engineering majors tended to have higher SES than males choosing Arts & Sciences majors (Goyette & Mullen, 2006). The women at the highest SES levels tended to study humanities, whereas men at similar SES levels pursued the social sciences. At the lowest SES levels, both men and women tended to choose a pre-professional program. This appears to contradict the findings from . The finding that students from lower SES levels are more likely to be technical majors is supported by other studies (Ma, 2009). Further, students of lower SES levels tend to select not only technical fields but prefer to choose life/health related majors over humanities and social sciences. Women of lower SES levels tend to seek lucrative technical or life/health related majors. Regardless of SES, men are equally as likely to choose a lucrative major (Ma, 2009). However, the higher the SES level, the less likely African American males would choose S (social) majors. At the highest SES levels, African American males were more likely to choose I (investigative) majors. White males with high SES levels were least likely to choose I (investigative) majors among all racial groups. Hispanic students at lower to middle SES levels choose E or enterprising majors (such as business) more often than expected. Following similar trends of African American and white at higher SES levels, Hispanic students are more likely to choose I (investigative) majors . Contrary to the results reported by Trusty et al., Ma (2009) reported no difference between racial minorities of varying SES levels."}, {"section_title": "Interactions of Socioeconomic Status and", "text": "Lack of significance of SES on racial/ethnic minorities is also supported by another study investigating racial difference in academic majors (Simpson, 2001;Ma, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "High School Experiences", "text": "Although many factors are relevant in the decision-making process, which students undertake in choosing a STEM major, academic preparation and achievement is of particular importance for students desiring a STEM career. Unlike many majors, advanced courses are often required for admission into many STEM undergraduate programs. Not only must the academic groundwork be accomplished during the middle school and high school years, success in these courses contributes to students' selfconfidence in their quantitative skills (Oakes, 1990). Academic preparation means more than just taking the right courses. The types of learning experiences in the classroom and outside the classroom are also relevant to the decision-making process. Interest in STEM. Interest in STEM fields often begins very early in the education pipeline. Focus groups of underrepresented minorities who were pursuing a career in scientific research revealed that their interest in science often started early in childhood with a fascination of things in nature like stars, butterflies, an early interest science and math or just wanting to know how things work (Hurtado, Cabrera, Lin, Arellano, & Espinosa, 2009). Other studies confirm that interest in science began well before entering middle school (Maltese & Tai, 2010). Similar findings were noted from engineering students who chose engineering majors based on interest in and aptitude for science/math in high school (Suresh, 2006(Suresh, -2007. Science efficacy and science interest of high school girls who attended a science/mathematics/engineering career conference was found to predict choice of a science major (Nauta & Epperson, 2003). Same interest trends hold for technology majors like information technology (IT), computer science (CS), or management information systems (MIS). Interest in computers before college was a common characteristic of the majors. CS majors made their decision about choice of major during high school, whereas MIS majors made their decision about choice of major during college (McInerney et al., 2006;Downey, McGaughey, & Roach, 2009). In general, interest in majoring in STEM fields upon entering college is a powerful predictor of the choice of STEM major after two years of college for students beginning at 4-year and 2-year institutions ."}, {"section_title": "STEM Course Taking.", "text": "The study of mathematics is of particular importance for potential STEM majors. The quantity and level of mathematics and science courses are a critical part of the educational pathway leading to a STEM college major. A number of studies have explored the effect of the science and math curriculum on choice of the STEM fields (Trusty, 2002;Stanton, 2010;Maple & Stage, 1991). Science/math curriculum influences STEM choice major for all racial/gender subgroups (Maple & Stage, 1991). Research studies have found women taking the most challenging math courses in high school like trigonometry, pre-calculus, and calculus were more likely to choose a STEM major. For potential engineering students, high school mathematics was particularly important for women, with each additional year of high school math women were 2.5 times more likely to choose an engineering major (Frehill, 1997). Calculus was an especially influential course for potential female STEM majors. The effect of advanced math courses was independent of background variables (SES, race/ethnicity), early science/math performance, and education attitudes and behaviors (math selfperception, homework habits, computer use) (Trusty, 2002). Math cognitions of females are weaker, relative to math related coursework, than male students. This is particularly important since math-related cognitions are related to educational choices like academic majors (Betz & Hackett, 1983) Course-taking patterns had a weaker effect on men; only taking high school physics had a positive effect on choice of SME major (Trusty, 2002). Students who were required to complete at least three math state mandated high school credits or higher were more likely to pursue a STEM major than those who had fewer math credits required for high school graduation (Stanton, 2010). The number of science courses taken in high school also influences the choice of academic major. Except for health-related majors, the more science courses taken the more likely students will choose technical programs over business, public service, and liberal arts degrees. For every science class taken students are up to 40% less likely to choose business, public service or liberal arts areas of study compared to technical programs. This trend holds over all racial/ethnic categories (Simpson, 2001;Trusty, 2002). Focus groups of traditional age computer science, computer engineering and information technology majors emphasized that experience and experimentation with computers during middle and high school years was very influential in their choice of field of study. Some students in the focus groups cited that taking advanced placement (AP) high school programming classes and technology classes influenced their choice of computer science and technology majors in college. Where experimentation was important for male students, female students who are currently underrepresented in IT fields are more likely to view technology majors more favorably if they can make a connection between the technology and realistic problems that affect people (McInerney et al., 2006). Math self-efficacy. Mathematics self-efficacy and ability are particularly important for women and minorities. Without the solid foundation provided by higher level mathematics and science courses, the probability of even having the confidence to pursue a STEM major is significantly decreased (Betz & Hackett, 1983;Trusty, 2002;Stanton, 2010). Positive perceptions of mathematics achievement stemming from learning experiences in high school led both men and women toward Holland I (investigative) majors such as engineering and the sciences . Men are more likely than women to believe their math and science preparation is better than most of their peers (Leslie et al., 1998). Math self-efficacy was reported to exert a positive albeit indirect effect on STEM major choice of students attending 4-year institutions by positively influencing their interest in STEM in high school. The effect of math self-efficacy on interest was weaker for community college students . Academic Performance. Academic performance in high school influences the choice of STEM college major. Indicators of academic performance, which are most valuable in the identification of potential STEM students are 8 th grade cognitive text, SAT mathematics scores, high school grade point average, and to a lesser extent SAT verbal scores (Nicholls, Wolfe, Besterfield-Sacre, Shuman, & Larpkiattaworn, 2007). For example, in the case of SAT scores, a study using students from twelve academically selective colleges found high verbal SAT scores with low math SAT scores indicated a strong likelihood that students will major in humanities compared to other majors (Turner & Bowen, 1999). An increase in verbal SAT with constant math scores increased the probability of choosing biology major over economics in both men and women. As math SAT scores for men and women increase, the likelihood of majoring in engineering or physical sciences also increased (Turner & Bowen, 1999). Math SAT scores are also important for women in choice of science majors (Ware et al., 1985). These findings concerning SAT scores further support the importance of mathematics for students in the STEM fields. Similar findings were reported concerning math achievement, which was measured by the standardized 12 th grade math exam scores. Math achievement has a positive impact on entrance into the STEM fields for both students beginning at 2-and 4year institutions ."}, {"section_title": "College experiences", "text": "Financial Aid. Rising tuition costs and difficulty finding ways to fund the costs of postsecondary education is another hurdle facing today's students. Examination of the effects of college costs (tuition minus aid) in three large public institutions found that higher net college costs increased the probability of students choosing professional majors (business, law, and architecture) and decreasing the probability of choosing science majors (Slater, 2011). Types of aid also have some effect on choice of major. When students received loans and merit aid they were more likely to choose science as their major. Students receiving grants were less like to choose professional majors. Overall higher aid promotes the choice of technically difficult majors that require additional time in college (Slater, 2011). While financial aid at 4-year institutions positively impacts the entrance of students into the STEM fields, one study found receipt of financial aid had no effect on community college students . Faculty and student interactions. Faculties fulfill multiple roles on campus for students as instructors, advisors, and source of guidance, support, and information. The impact of faculty/advisors and student interactions has received little attention so far in the college major choice literature even though these type of interactions have been well documented as having positive influences on educational outcomes like academic achievement, educational aspirations, self-concept, academic performance, racial tolerance and persistence (Kim, 2010;Kim & Sax, 2011;McArthur, 2005;Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005;Rask & Bailey, 2002;Thompson, 2001). Recently, faculty/advisors interactions with students have been included in a STEM major choice model tested on students attending 4 year institutions. These faculty/advisor interactions with students produced a positive effect on choice of STEM major for all students . Faculty-student interactions are different for community college students since the classroom is often the main contact for these students on a community college campus (Chan, 2005;Hagedorn, Maxwell, Rodriguez, Hocevar, & Fillpot, 2000). Their social involvement on campus is often low in view of the fact that they are commuters and often have family and employment demands competing for their time. A recent study found faculty-student interaction negatively affected entrance community college students into STEM fields . However, this finding for community college students may be more the result of the complexity of faculty-student interactions and limitations of the data used in the study, which focused on faculty/student interactions outside of the classroom . Education Aspiration. Degree aspiration and perceived college readiness in math and science have been reported in a recent STEM major choice study to positively influence the decision to pursue STEM majors of students attending 4-year institutions . Science and math majors tend to have a high degree of aspiration than other disciplines (Ware et al., 1985). Inclusion of degree expectations into STEM major choice model development may provide insight into a student's commitment to their major; thus providing further understanding into the entrance of students to the STEM fields. Aspiring to a graduate degree for 4-year college students is seen as a motivational issue, which indicates a student's level of commitment to educational goals and works to sustain interest as they pursue their educational goals. The same effects were not observed for community college students . College Readiness. Studies suggest college readiness may influence choice of college major (Rosenbaum, 2001). Perceived college readiness in math and science by students is thought to give students the needed support and confidence to choose STEM majors. College readiness in these two critical academic disciplines for STEM fields suggests alignment between high school academics and college expectation is critical for the success of STEM majors . Perceived science readiness had a positive impact on 4-year college students but not community college students. Perceived math readiness was insignificant for students at both types of institutions ."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Critique of Previous Literature", "text": "Previous empirical studies have identified important factors, which influence the selection of a college major during the early years of college. These factors fall into the The majority of research effort in college major choice has emphasized precollege experiences. Few studies attempt to bridge the secondary and post-secondary experiences into a comprehensive college major choice model. With the exception of financial aid and tuition issues (Slater, 2011) and faculty/student interactions , college major choice models in the research literature do not include the first years of postsecondary education, which can be an important transition period for students thinking about committing to their chosen college major. As already noted in some studies, even interested, highly academically qualified students drop out of the STEM education circuit upon entering post-secondary (Bettinger, 2010). Studies involving parameters, which might prevent this leakage during the first years of college by providing the support system students require, will help educators and policymakers understand the college major choice process and maintain the needed reservoir of STEM majors. Only one of the studies cited in this review concentrated solely on students who attend community colleges as their first postsecondary institution. All the other college major choice studies focus on 4-year college students exclusively or combine 2-and 4year student populations. Many students who attend community colleges differ from their cohorts attending 4-year institutions in terms of academic goals and expectations, academic preparation, and family background and support. Community colleges attract a diverse population of students to its doorsteps with their open access policies, low tuition cost, flexible scheduling, and geographic accessibility (National Research Council, 2012). With growing importance placed on community colleges as a pathway to STEM degrees, more research effort should be directed toward investigating the parameters involved in the choice of college major by these cohorts of students."}, {"section_title": "Data Used in Previous Research", "text": "The data sources for studies examining college major choice are evenly distributed between institutional data and national longitudinal data. and Asian students were sampled at a higher rate in order to have sufficient sample sizes for group comparison.

This type of analysis is particularly useful when dealing with categorical outcome variables. Binary logistic regression is the appropriate type of inferential analysis to develop a model for prediction of a STEM major since the dependent variable, a binary categorical variable, is the choice of STEM major or not. The binary logistic regression model is based on the following equation with the dependent outcome represented as choice of STEM major or not: Where the log side of the equation is the log of the odds that a student will choose STEM major, represents the constant of the equation whose value yields P when X is zero, through represents the coefficient of predictor variables (Gay et al., 2009).\nIn order to determine the impact of student demographics, high school experiences, community college experiences, and interactional effect of gender and race/ethnicity with predictor variables on the choice of STEM major, the STEM major choice is run using binary logistic regression. Table 7 presents the findings of estimated odds ratio, standard error, and significance of each variable used in the analysis. Odds ratios larger than one indicate a positive relationship of variable with choice of STEM major, while odds ratios smaller than one indicates a negative relationship (Osborne, 2008  education aspiration proved to be statistically insignificant. Finally, both variables measuring students perceived preparedness by high school science and math courses for their college studies are also not statistically significant in this model. In the logistic regression model, interaction variables are tested in the model to reveal whether one variable has a differential effect in response to a change with another variable. In this study interaction terms were incorporated into the STEM major choice model in response to the research question concerning whether high school and college experiences varied by gender and race/ethnicity. A series of over 35 interactions terms were generated from predictor variables and gender or race/ethnicity variables and separately included in the STEM major choice model. As shown in Table 8, the interaction terms resulted from combining gender, African American, Asian, Hispanic, and white variables with variables such as intended major, socioeconomic status, science units and math units, math self-efficacy, and Bachelor degree expectation. None of these variables is statistically significant predictors of choice of STEM major for community college students.  recipients attending a community college at some point in their education (Tsapogas, 2004). Understanding the needs and challenges of community college students as they traverse the STEM education pipeline is important for education policymakers, administrators, K-12 teachers, and college faculty to ensure the success of students in these institutions. To-date much educational research concerning STEM students is focused on students attending 4-year institutions. Further, the majority of STEM research is focused on K-12 preparation or retention/ persistence of students in the STEM pipeline. Less attention in the literature is devoted to the entrance of students to the STEM fields and very limited attention is focused exclusively on STEM students who begin their postsecondary education at community colleges. This study attempted to develop a STEM major choice model that encompasses high school and college experiences of students starting at community college. This study aspires to enhance the understanding of parameters that influence the choice of STEM major, which will assist education policymakers, school administrators, K-12 teachers, and college administrators and faculty information, and improvement of policy, programs, and practices. Incorporation of these experiences in the model is based on constructs from the social cognitive career theory (Lent & Brown, 1996;Lent et al., 2003) and parameters found important in the college major choice literature. The model also examined any potential effect by interactions between gender and race on choice of STEM major. The following questions guided the study: 1) How do high school experiences such as math self-efficacy, math achievement, interest in STEM, and exposure to math and science influence the choice of STEM major by community college students? 2) How do college experiences such as interactions with faculty/advisor, receipt of financial aid, degree aspiration, and perceived college readiness in math and science influence the choice of STEM major by community college students? 3) Do these effects of high school and college experiences on STEM major choice vary by gender and race/ethnicity among community college students? The data for this study came from Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS: 2002), a national longitudinal study that tracked 10 th grade high school students over the next four years from 2002 to 2006 with first follow-up data collection during the spring of 12 th grade and second follow-up data two years after high school graduation. The final sample used in this study was made up of 1604 students who enrolled in community colleges as their first postsecondary institution and declared a major by 2006. Based on the proposed research strategy, the predictor variables were first tested for multicollinearity problem by comparison of VIF values. The second step was to report descriptive statistics on all predictor and dependent variables in the model. In the third step, the data was analyzed using cross tabulations to compare and identify patterns and trends of STEM and non-STEM majors. Next, given the categorical nature of the outcome variable in this model, analysis of independent variables was performed using binary logistic regression to study the effect of high school and college experiences on the choice of STEM major. Finally, interactions of race/ethnicity and gender with independent variables were added to the model to determine if results from the model differed according to these demographic parameters.

This indicates that a serious multicollinearity problem does not exist for this model.     Finally, the average number of science units taken by high students is presented in Table 5 by gender and race/ethnicity. There are no differences in number of science units taken by male and female students. However, race/ethnicity subgroups report differences in the number of science units taken in high school. White and other minorities (3.00) take the highest number of science units of all race/ethnicity subgroups followed closely by Asian/Pacific Islander students (2.91). African American (2.80) and Hispanic (2.69) students take the fewest number of science credits in high school. The number of science units is presented in the descriptive section because of its significance in the STEM major choice model as reported in Table 6. 3.00 1.04 0 7.00"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Using the social cognitive career theory and insights from the research literature, this study investigates factors affecting the choice of STEM major by students beginning their postsecondary education at community colleges. The proposed model in this study encompasses three areas (a) students demographic; (b) high school experiences; (c) college experiences. The descriptive analysis in this study provides a snapshot of students attending community college as their first postsecondary institution and trends for STEM and non-STEM majors. The largest minority group attending community colleges are Hispanic students. This is consistent with reports that 56% of Hispanic undergraduates attend community colleges, the highest percentage of any of the minority groups (NGA Center for Best Practices, 2011). The predicted growth of the Hispanic population is from 14% in 2005 to 29% in 2050, thus highlighting the importance of this demographic group in community colleges and ultimately in the STEM professions (NGA Center for Best Practices, 2011). Almost 60% of the students in the study were women, which additionally points to community colleges as a pathway for many women pursuing higher education. Other trends of note among community college students reveal around 11% of students entered college interested in STEM fields, which is comparable with the percentages of students who actually declared a STEM major (12%) two years after high school. With regards to academic preparation, the students in the study sample took on average more math courses than science courses in high school and, interestingly, a higher percentage of college students believed their high school math courses better prepared them for success in college compared with their high school sciences courses. Further, while there were no gender differences in the number of high school science courses taken, some differences were observed between racial/ethnic groups in high school academic preparation. The absolute number of science units was not homogenous across racial/ethnic groups. Asian and white students took on average more science units than African American or Hispanic students with Hispanic students taking the fewest number of science units. Student demographic characteristics such as racial and gender distribution for STEM majors agreed with published trends that showed Asian students as the dominant racial/ethnic group and men maintain their dominance among STEM majors in comparison to non-STEM majors. STEM majors are on average from higher socioeconomic levels than non-STEM majors in this study. One of the most striking differences between STEM and non-STEM majors concerns the intended major of students who are just entering community college. The majority of STEM majors planned to major in a STEM field at the beginning of their postsecondary education. Interestingly, of those interested in majoring in STEM fields when entering college, over one-third ended up in non-STEM majors and two-thirds followed through with their interests and declared a STEM major as of 2006. A very low percentage of students planning a non-STEM major in their first year of college actually declared a STEM major in 2006. In general, STEM majors were better academically prepared than their non-STEM major counterparts when average 12 th grade math exam results and average numbers of science and math units are used as a gauge. Measures of math test taking self-efficacy found a higher percentage of STEM majors in the high level compared to non-STEM majors. Similar trends were observed for math skill selfefficacy measures with a higher percentage of STEM majors with students of mid to high levels of self-efficacy than non-STEM majors. Concerning perceived college readiness, neither STEM nor did non-STEM majors report any differences in perceived readiness for college based on science or math high school preparation. The findings from the binary logistic regression revealed significant results for some student demographic characteristics and high school experiences. The gender of the students revealed a significant finding that being female negatively impacted the choice of STEM major. This finding is not surprising as similar results have been consistently reported in numerous studies of college major choice (Simpson, 2001;Xie & Shauman, 2003). Of the racial/ethnicity subgroups in the model only being Asian was found significant and to positively influence the choice of STEM major compared white students. While this is consistent with other findings, some studies have also reported belonging to other minority groups was a significant predictor of choosing a STEM major (Simpson, 2001. In Simpson's study, socioeconomic level was not found to be a significant predictor, although other studies have found it significant (Goyette & Mullen, 2006;Ma, 2009;. Intended choice of STEM major upon entering community college was used as a proxy to measure interest in STEM in high school. This parameter was the most powerful predictor of choice of STEM major in this study. Some studies have supported the importance of maintaining interest in STEM during secondary education through their college years (Nauta & Epperson, 2003;Suresh, 2006Suresh, -2007 while others found that interest begins well before middle school (Maltese & Tai, 2010). Many prior studies report the positive influences of both math/science learning and achievement and math self-efficacy on choice of STEM major in college (Crisp et al., 2009;Porter & Umbach, 2006;. Although math course taking and achievement has been found to influence the choice of STEM major in other studies (Frehill, 1997;Trusty, 2002), this study has reported only the number of science courses, which students take during their high school years, is influential in the STEM major decision process. Increasing the number of science courses in high school may increase the likelihood students choose STEM majors in college. Both math achievement and math self-efficacy represented in this study were not found significant, which is inconsistent with published studies that have found positive a relationship among students attending 4-year colleges. (Betz & Hackett, 1983;Trusty, 2002;Stanton, 2010). This may be explained by the finding in a recent study , which reported that the positive effect of math self-efficacy on STEM major choice is indirectly mediated through variables like STEM interest and not directly linked to the major choice decision. Within the college experiences section of the STEM major choice model, none of the parameters included were found statistically significant in this study. The postsecondary environment supports of the social cognitive career theory are represented as academic integration and receipt of financial aid. The results for financial aid receipt are consistent with the results reported in Wang's recent study of STEM major choice by community college students . While receipt of financial aid is important for 4-year college students, community college students may have different views of financial aid. Lower tuition cost, more working students who pay their own tuition, and reluctance of students to take on debt are possible explanations for the lack of impact of financial aid on their college major choice. Given that community college students are most likely to work full time or attend part-time or a combination of both, very few take out student loans (Horn et al., 2006). In addition to financial aid receipt, academic integration was included as an environment support in the study model. Academic integration is reported to positively affect STEM choice for 4-year college students . However, the same results are not observed for community college students. Given that the majority of interactions with the faculty occur in the classroom setting in community colleges, the variables representing academic integration in ELS: 2002 are not the optimal measure of the type of academic integration, which is important for community college students. Both perceived college readiness in math and science were also found insignificant in this study for community college students. The results concerning college readiness in math and science of this study are in agreement with Wang's findings for community college students. Wang's study found only perceived college readiness science positively influenced choice of STEM majors for 4-year college students . Education aspiration defined in this study as expecting to receive a Bachelor's degree or higher is not a significant predictor of STEM major. This finding is consistent with results reported in the literature concerning community college students. Four-year college students are reported to be positively influenced by graduate degree aspiration . Finally, no significant interaction effects of gender and race/ethnicity with independent variables were observed when the interaction terms were included in the STEM major choice model (Table 7). Therefore, the relationships between high school/college experiences and STEM major choice did not appear to vary by gender and racial/ethnicity categories. In regards to the third research question guiding this study, the only high school experiences reported by this study to vary by gender and race/ethnicity were the number of science units. As mentioned earlier, women and men took over average the same number of science units, whereas Hispanic and African American students took fewer science units than their Asian and white counterparts."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Contribution of STEM Major Choice Model", "text": "The design of the STEM major choice model in this study successfully incorporated student inputs and high school variables that are influential in choice of STEM major. These parameters indicate points in the STEM education circuit where intervention in terms of policy or practice may be introduced to attract students to the STEM fields. While high school preparation, which is represented in this model as number of science units taken, impacts the choice of major, none of the variables representing math preparation, math self-efficacy or math performance proved statistically significant in this model. Given that success in math is often cited as the backbone of success in the STEM fields, variables representing math beliefs and experiences need refining to better represent high school experiences of community college students. For example, absolute number of math credits does not reflect the academic rigor or level of math taken. Often minority students are placed in lower tracks of math in high school, which may fulfill graduation requirements. Unfortunately, these courses may not prepare these students to meet the demands of math in STEM courses in college. The postsecondary experiences included in the STEM major choice were not as successful in prediction of STEM major choice. This leads one to reconsider how community college students differ from students at 4-year institutions and what variables would best capture the college experiences that influence their entrance to the STEM fields. Although variables such as graduate degree aspiration are reported to have a positive effect on 4-year college students, the same effect is not seen for community college students. Perhaps refining education aspiration for community college students will better capture this parameter for the study model. For example, a student's education aspiration can be defined in terms of their goals upon entering college. A more relevant measure of education aspiration might be intention to transfer to a 4-year institution or complete an Associate's Degree. Intensity of attendance (full time or part-time) may also indicate commitment to educational goals (Horn et al., 2006). The environment support variable of academic integration and financial aid as defined in this study were not significant factors for choice of STEM major. The measure representing academic integration did not reflect well the experiences of community college students on campus with faculty, advisors, and peers. An accurate measure of academic integration to community college needs to include variables, which better represent the types of interactions more common among commuter students. Studies report that academic integration occurs predominantly during in-class activities with peers and faculty (Karp, Hughes, & O'Gara, 2008). The variable of receipt of financial aid is perhaps too simplistic in its representation of how community college students finance their education and its impact on choice of STEM major. Community college may view financial aid as a financial burden instead of a supportive parameter."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Policy and Practice", "text": "Reduce gender gap. Gender inequality in participation in the STEM fields is an issue that is well documented in the literature (National Science Board, 2010;Turner & Bowen, 1999). Previous research found gender differences in STEM participation did not disappear when individual and background characteristics are equalized (Xie & Shauman, 2003). Gender differences are also not explained simply by differences in math and science achievement or high school course taking trends given that young women have essentially closed the gender gap in these areas (Riegle-Crumb, King, Grodsky, & Muller, 2012;Xie & Shauman, 2003). One point where there is a clear underrepresentation of women is their college major expectation at the end of high school. The gender gap at the point when students are formulating their intended college major may account for the deficiency of women in STEM fields (Xie & Shauman, 2003). As another possible explanation, some researchers assert the American culture as does other Western nations encourages women to remain in educational and occupational sectors that avoid conflict with traditional gender roles. Even when women enter maledominated professions, women tend to choose subfields that are consistent with their gender roles (Riegle-Crumb et al., 2012). To tip the gender balance toward STEM major entrance, a holistic perspective must be adopted in which education policy and practice initiatives are coordinated between government, STEM professionals, higher education institutions, and primary/secondary schools. The federal government has taken steps to establish partnership between state governments and private organizations to develop programs that increase the presence of young women in the STEM fields. The Department of Education has funded, through competitive grants, over 90 school programs, which support girls and young women in the STEM fields by providing access to rigorous and stimulating academic preparation taught by highly qualified STEM teachers (White House, 2013). Programs such as these with validated success in STEM education should be supported and replicated in other schools. Partnership between federal agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) and private organizations like Girl Scouts of America have a proven track record of providing venues for thousands of girls to learn about exciting STEM careers (White House, 2013). These types of partnership are needed to support and broaden the participation of girls in STEM fields. There are some case studies concerning STEM focused high schools, which indicate that very high percentages of young women in these specialized high schools continue their studies in STEM majors at college. While these schools are state funded, support does come through other sources as federal grants, corporate donations, and local funding (Subotnik, Robert, Rickoff, & Almarode, 2010). What can administrators and teachers in the K-12 segment of the STEM education circuit do to encourage the participation of girls and young women? Two strategies reported that influence the choice of STEM careers by young women are (a) envisaging themselves as STEM professionals in the future; (b) finding a meaningful connection between their future careers and their need to contribute to society and impact people's lives. Women consider the value of their potential career in the college major decision-making process (Lackland & De Lisi, 2001;Harris et al., 2009). Introduction of girls and young women to a broad range of possible STEM careers early in their education and helping them understand the education pathways that are necessary to reach their goals will broaden their participation in the STEM fields. Some studies report that girls turn away from STEM careers as early as grades five and six (Ward, Miller, Sienkiewicz, & Antonucci, 2012). This trend makes it imperative that schools aggressively put in place programs that halt and reverse this trend. Career workshops targeting middle and high school girls are cited as one successful approach to stimulate interest in male dominated fields such as engineering or computer science. Workshops provide girls with specific career information, a safe environment to explore the field, and mentoring opportunities by female STEM professionals (Sinkele & Mupinga, 2011). Interviews of girls found they are in interested in fields that help people, the environment, or animals, which tend to be linked with the biological sciences and not physical sciences or engineering fields. Incorporation of inquiry-based activities incorporated into the school curriculum and out-of-school time (OST) learning programs are reportedly effective in helping girls making the connection. An addition of hands-on, inquiry-based activities designed to introduce STEM concepts to a traditional school science curriculum will assist girls in understanding how careers in science, engineering, and technology are involved in developing solutions for environmental and social problems (Little & Leon de la Barra, 2009). Programs that extend the science experience outside the classroom are often developed through a partnership between teachers and STEM professionals who are employed in the private sector or universities. Interacting with STEM professionals, using equipment or resources not normally available to classroom teachers, and working on socially relevant problems encourages girls to aspire and self-identify with STEM careers (Ward et al., 2012). The challenge of attracting young women to the STEM fields continues from primary/secondary schools into postsecondary institutions. Community colleges already attract a large number of women to their doorsteps to pursue their postsecondary education. Whether these students enter with an interest in reveals that an active learning approach or inquiry-based learning, where instructors and students explore topics in depth and apply the scientific principles and reasoning to reallife problems, result in a better learning experience and mastery of the discipline than the traditional one-way lecture (Brainard, 2007). Commitment to training current and future faculty in evidence-based teaching will go a long way to encouraging young women to enter the STEM fields at community college. Replacing standard lab courses with discovery-based research courses will stimulate excitement about solving real world problems and increase young women's identification as scientists. Although community colleges have not traditionally promoted STEM undergraduate research by faculty and students, more institutions are finding funding or forming partnerships with 4-year institutions, private industries, or research institutes. Promote STEM major choice among disadvantaged minority students. Regarding racial/ethnic differences, Hispanic and African American students lag behind their Asian and white counterparts in terms of entrance to the STEM fields. Their lower entrance numbers combined with higher attrition rates have contributed to their underrepresentation in the STEM workforce (Burk & Mattis, 2007). Inequity in funding of school districts often puts minority students at a disadvantage in academic preparation (Museus et al., 2011). State and federal governments need policies in place that ensure low-income school districts receive sufficient funds to prepare students to succeed in the STEM fields. Partnering with STEM stakeholders such as private industries and foundations to supplement funding in high school districts is one avenue that could augment school budgets. Students aspiring to STEM college majors are often advised to take advanced placement (AP) STEM courses in high school. Unfortunately, not all students have access to these courses. Hispanic and African American students often attend high schools without the critical college prep courses such as calculus and trigonometry. These students typically have lower tracks of math available in their high schools, which are insufficient to prepare them for study in STEM fields. Even when AP classes are available, Hispanic and African Americans tend to be underrepresented in AP courses. The problem of lack of rigorous preparation begins even before high school with many minority students already placed in lower levels of math and science in middle school. Students are behind in their math and science preparation even before entering high school. All too often schools with the highest minority presence have the highest percentage of out-of-field teachers (i.e. not trained in the field) instructing students in STEM subjects (Hagedorn & Purnamasari, 2012). Having access to rigorous STEM courses taught by qualified STEM teachers, positively influences students learning and academic success in high school and beyond (Hagedorn & Purnamasari, 2012). Teacher qualifications have a direct effect on student learning. In light of the continued racial gaps in science and math achievement for minority students, the issue of finding and retaining qualified STEM teachers should be a priority for school districts (Scherer, 2003). Recruiting sufficient numbers of STEM teachers is a priority of the Obama administration with the cited goal of 100,000 STEM teachers in 10 years. State governments should also place STEM teacher training and recruitment as an integral part of their strategy to retain students in the STEM education pipeline. Attracting outstanding STEM students to the teaching profession by providing grants and financial aid to cover their postsecondary education costs should be a priority at the state and federal levels. STEM professionals who enter teaching as a second career are a potential source of teachers with an in-depth understanding of their discipline that is so critical for inspiring today's students. Facilitation of their entrance to the teaching profession through fast tracked teaching credentials will increase the pool of well-qualified STEM teachers. Often minority students and their parents have limited knowledge of potential STEM occupations and educational demands required of a degree in STEM. Teachers and counselors are cited by students and parents as their primary choice of information when considering career options. Since less than 10% of school career counselors have STEM backgrounds and many science/math teachers have limited knowledge of STEM careers, schools need to provide resources and training to their staff and faculties to better prepare them for guiding their students toward STEM careers. Organizing programs where STEM professionals visit classrooms and share their educational and workplace experiences will give students more information on which to base their career decisions (Hall, Dickerson, Batts, Kauffman, & Bosse, 2011). The close proximity of community colleges to local high school makes them the perfect partner to introduce minority students to STEM careers and bolster their academic preparation. Several nationally recognized STEM recruitment efforts in community colleges (Hagedorn & Purnamasari, 2012) have developed programs that allow students in grades ten through twelve to take college prep courses in technical areas such as engineering technology and information technology while receiving college credit. Other programs have focused on \"at risk\" minority students providing them with intensive counseling, summer programs, and research experiences with scientists (Cuyahoga Community College, 2010). Stimulate early interest in STEM. Waning interest in the STEM fields even among students who are most proficient in math and science is a dominant issue connected to the maintenance of students in the STEM pipeline. Although this study measured interest of intended college major upon entering college, the development of interest in STEM field begins much earlier than the 12 th grade of high school (Hurtado et al., 2009). Interviews of scientists and graduate students revealed the timing, source, and nature of their initial interest in science. The majority of students reported their interest in science began prior to middle school. For women, the first spark of interest usually stemmed from school or family initiated activities or support, whereas men's interest was initiated by their own activities or thoughts (Maltese & Tai, 2010). Remaining interviewees reported initial interest in science during middle school, high school, or college was associated with school based factors like the teacher, activities (lab, demonstrations, or projects), and curriculum content (Maltese & Tai, 2010). Inspiring and motivating students from that first spark of interest in the STEM fields through the rigors of STEM education is a daunting challenge, which will require curricular changes in K-12, professional development of STEM teachers, and development of bridges with STEM professionals and STEM college faculty. Some of the discussion so far concerning women and minority students has focused on stimulating interest in STEM careers at an early age and sustaining that interest into postsecondary education. Students need the time and opportunities to recognize the connection between STEM subjects they study in the classroom and real world problems. There is not enough time within the structure of a normal K-12 classroom environment for students to master STEM skills, explore their application to real world situations, and understand how this connects to STEM careers. Schools need to think outside of the box in the resource-strapped financial environments of most states. Schools must collaborate with interested STEM stakeholders such as museums, universities, and private industries to expand and support their STEM curriculum and train their STEM teachers. Informal science education, which usually takes place outside the classroom has been shown to increase student interest and confidence in studying STEM fields. Informal science education can be incorporated in different forms. corporate and private foundations, and the public (Thomasian, 2011). Increased interest in STEM by K-12 students has been reported after participation in programs employing practices that are validated by research. These programs have content, which is based on real-world applications and includes hands-on learning, and STEM career information. Programs can range from one-day workshops for middle school students to summer internships for high school students. A variety of stakeholders including STEM professionals, universities, education foundations, and private industries can be involved in these programs bringing expertise, funding, and community support to raise students' interest in STEM. Current educational research reveals that an active learning approach or inquirybased learning where instructors and students explore topics in depth and apply the scientific principles and reasoning to real-life problems result in a better learning experience and mastery of the discipline than the traditional one-way lecture, which is often the favored form of instruction in the STEM introductory courses in college (Brainard, 2007). Adoption of these teaching approaches in the introductory STEM courses in community colleges, along with replacing standard laboratory courses with discovery-based research courses, can assist in maintaining interest in STEM majors. Expand high school science experiences. Results from this study indicate the number of science courses taken is important in supporting students as they travel through the STEM education pipeline. Increasing the number math and science courses taken by high school students in preparation for college and careers has been a priority of policymakers in response to the nation's STEM workforce crisis. Some efforts to achieve necessary changes in course-taking patterns have focused on graduation requirements for science and math. Graduation requirements have evolved over the past two decades starting with most states requiring 2 years in each subject during the mid-1980s. Gradually graduate requirements have strengthened in both science and math. For example, in 1987, only three states required 3 years of science to graduate high school. By 2008, more than half of the states (27) required 3 years of science (National Science Foundation, 2012). Even higher requirements were less common. The number of states requiring 4 years of science increased from 0 in 1987 to 4 in 2008. Science should mirror the requirements of English in high school where over 90% of states require 4 years of English. Increasing the number of science courses may strengthen academic preparation, enhance student confidence, and maintain interest in the STEM fields (National Science Foundation, 2012). Besides the number of science courses, education leaders and school counselors should focus on the rigor of science courses. Research suggests increasing the number of science credits may not be enough. Students should take more advanced courses, which include second year courses of subject such as advanced biology, chemistry, and physics. An active learning approach or inquiry-based learning will enrich the science learning and experiences of high school students helping them to apply the scientific methods in solving relevant real-life problems (Brainard, 2007). Many studies report that an active learning or student-centered approach in the classroom fosters a better understanding of the scientific process and fundamental concepts of chemistry, physics, and other disciplines (Barr & Tagg, 1995). While there is literature support for the efficacy of this pedagogical method, most teachers model their teaching on experiences from undergraduate or graduate STEM courses where the majority of faculties use the traditional lecture/discussion as their primary instruction method (Science and Engineering Indicators 2008). Mastering inquiry-based pedagogy requires teachers to have the support of intensive professional development programs, time to practice, be able to internalize this type of teaching, and rely on peer support and resources. The commitment to implement high quality inquiry-based classroom and laboratory activities requires long-term commitment by teachers, their administrators, and agencies such as the National Science Foundation, who develop and fund pilot programs using inquiry pedagogy for high school students."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Future Research", "text": "Expansion of the proposed model to include more relevant postsecondary experiences is needed to better understand the processes involved in STEM major choice by community college students. High school academic experiences included in this study are missing from the college component of the model. According to Bettinger (2010), the strength of a student's commitment to staying in the STEM circuit is reflected in the type of classes they take their very first semester at college. Students enrolled in 4-year institutions who took at least 63% of the credit hours in STEM courses the first semester, would eventually major in STEM, whereas students who only averaged 42% of their credit hours in STEM fields would eventually leave STEM majors (Bettinger, 2010) . The course-taking behavior of students is a more reliable indicator of their commitment to their major than their expressed interest or high school academic record (Bettinger, 2010). Thus, future research is encouraged to incorporate Postsecondary transcript data for ELS: 2002, which will be available in 2014. Exploration of course-taking patterns and STEM achievement will enhance the comprehensiveness of the STEM major choice model and provide more insight into the experiences of STEM majors at community colleges. The mentoring relationship established between faculty and high school students who are low income, minority, or potential first generation college students while involved in summer research projects or in intensive academic STEM college prep have been found to positively affect STEM major choice (Lam, Srivatsan, Doversplice, Vesalo, & Mawasha, 2005;Zhe et al., 2010). Currently, capturing these types of interactions is not possible with the available data in ELS: 2002. Future research is needed to include a third follow-up of the survey when it is available (eight years after completion of high school) and to examine the effects of undergraduate research and mentoring with the faculty. This will add another important dimension to academic integration measures for STEM students. Refinement of the outcome variable beyond STEM and non-STEM categories may allow more customized policy and instructional practices for the different disciplines within the STEM field such as life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, or computer/technology fields. Given that participation in these fields varies by gender and race/ethnicity, capturing participation differences may reveal important insights into high school and college experiences in these specific fields. Several variables, which were included in this study may merit revisiting and refining in a future study. For example, the variable representing the total units of math taken can be refined to reflect higher levels of math courses or more rigorous tracks of math such as number of AP courses. Researchers have found Algebra II is critical course for male career choices while 12 th grade calculus is positively correlated with enrollment of young women in science and engineering majors (Watt & Eccles, 2008). Using variables that capture enrollment in these courses may better define the effects of math curriculum on STEM major entrance. Perhaps incorporating SAT math scores would be a better proxy for math achievement than the 12 th grade math exam used in this study as SAT math scores are reported as influential in the literature. In the current study, none of the postsecondary experiences, which are influential for students in 4-year institutions, were found to impact STEM major choice. For example, education aspiration, which is defined in this study as aspiring to a Bachelor's degree, may not be appropriate for this population of students. The immediate concern for many community college students is to transfer to a 4-year institution instead of degree completion. A better proxy for education aspiration for these students may be the intention to transfer to a 4-year institution or complete the Associate's degree. The environment supports incorporated in the study did not impact the STEM major decision for community college students. Researchers must rethink what these type of students need in terms of support. One suggestion would be to look at institutional characteristics such as percentage of minority students or faculties on campus to assess whether have effect on the presence of underrepresented minorities in the STEM fields. Further, more effort should be made to understand the institutional differences of community colleges and their effects on the education and career choices like college majors. Typical institutional characteristics of 4-year institutions such as selectivity, number of full time faculties, or research/teaching priorities are not applicable to community colleges. One researcher in STEM major choice area has suggested that differences in curricular focus are a more appropriate system to characterize these institutions (X. Wang, personal communication May 2013). In this study, one-third of the community college students who enter college interested in STEM majors choose non-STEM majors. Understanding why these students changed their plans to enter the STEM fields will assist faculty and college administrators in planning intervention policies to prevent students from leaving the STEM education circuit. Since the gatekeeper introductory math and science courses are often barriers for beginning STEM students, examining the course-taking patterns and grades might provide insight into their experiences in these courses. Given that many community college students are required to take remedial math courses, are these potential STEM majors discouraged as a result of prolonged time spent in remedial math courses? This group of students merit further study in order to reverse their defection to the non-STEM majors. Finally, a comparison of the factors affecting the entrance of students to 4-year and 2-year institution merits further study in view of the fact that often distinct student populations attend these institutions. Community college students are more likely than students attending 4-year institutions to fall into the following categories: (a) minority; (b) low socioeconomic level; (c) female; (d) non-traditional age; (e) part-time status; (f) academically underprepared for college level work (Horn et al., 2006). The college major choice studies to-date have focused almost solely on students attending 4-year institutions so many of the parameters investigated are important for this specific population of students. While there will certainly be overlap of important factors influencing choice of STEM major for these two populations of students, there are reported differences in the strength of these parameters on choice of STEM major . Development of a model with parameters, which more accurately characterize these two populations of students, will provide educators and policymakers with a comprehensive understanding of their STEM major choice decision process. Insights gained will allow educators and policymakers to customize strategies for a specific population. Thus, a comparative analysis of these two populations of students is merited to inform policymakers responsible for strengthening the STEM workforce (Dowd, 2008). Meeting the economic challenges of the 21 st century requires a robust, welltrained STEM workforce. Predictions from leaders across government, business, and STEM professions suggest the nation is not prepared to meet these challenges. The projected number for future STEM workforce is predicted to be insufficient for meeting the nation's economic needs. Recommendations from policy experts suggest part of the solution begins with the development of a diverse, academically prepared, and motivated population of STEM students who can successfully traverse the STEM education circuit and transition into the STEM workforce. Efforts are needed to provide STEM students with world class academic preparation and to maintain their interest over their entire education. Special attention is needed to encourage minorities and women to participate in the STEM education circuit and join the workforce so that the nation may benefit from their diverse perspectives on global problems. These students often have tremendous challenges and non-traditional pathways to achieve their STEM degrees. Educators and policymakers must assist and support these students as they pass through the STEM education circuit knowing their presence in the STEM workforce will invigorate our economy and improve the nation's ability to compete on the global stage.
