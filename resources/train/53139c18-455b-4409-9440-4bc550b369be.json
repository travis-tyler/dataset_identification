Our system is low-cost, at $300 per robot it is a fraction of the cost of current robot systems. This allows the robots to explore more dangerous environments because the loss of one has minimal cost. It also means a large group can feasibly be deployed even without significant funds. The Distributed Robotic Mapping System is scalable, it is designed to not be dependent on any one robot, therefore the system can involve as many or as few robots as necessary.

The climate of education reform shows an increasing emphasis on teacher accountability and quality. This project broadly explores how other countries evaluate their teachers in order to consider the question: what are the most effective forms of teacher evaluation? Research was gathered through a consultation of primary and secondary sources discussing the relationship between teacher quality and student achievement as well as the history and current status of teacher evaluation in each country. Finally, a survey was distributed to secondary school teachers in the United States to gain an understanding of how teachers feel about being evaluated. The results provide a snapshot of the global context. In Finland, there is no formal system of evaluation. Accountability is rooted in teacher trust and a rigorous and competitive teacher training program. In the Netherlands, schools have a high level of autonomy but are subject to formal inspection by the national government. This data is made publically available and provides a platform for school accountability. In England, there is a formal system of evaluation for school and teachers. At the school level, a value-added model is used to calculate the institution's ability to improve student achievement and this data is available to the public. Within schools, teacher evaluation has recently been tied to job security. The survey results show considerable variation between teachers how evaluations should be manifested, but 100% of respondents agreed that teachers should be evaluated at some point in their careers. This research provides an important introduction to the role of teacher evaluation internationally. By illustrating that teacher accountability and quality are important in countries outside the United States, this work invites further study on the most effective measures of teacher quality internationally. that have not yet adopted the desktop delivery model are hesitant due to some of its inherent limitations. Many of the limitations are based on the inability to leverage graphics processing units within the desktop virtual machines utilized by end users. The research performed in this study looks to eliminate the current limitations of virtual desktop infrastructure by integrating both physical and virtual graphics processing units. In order to research this integration a sample fully virtual infrastructure has been setup, to include all server, network, and shared storage infrastructure. The infrastructure includes all three major hypervisors used in today's enterprise networks. Each of the hypervisors has a unique method of integrating graphics processing units into their guest virtual desktops. Integration has been successful into two of the three hypervisors in use. Successful utilization of the graphics processing units has yielded vast increases in virtual desktop rendering in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional applications. Especially in highly intensive applications such as computer aided design software and full motion video rendering software. Research is still being done to test the full capabilities of the virtual desktop to include the ability to render desktop video games and other use cases. A few implementation limitations have been found to include increased bandwidth utilization between the virtual desktop and the end user, which in some cases might introduce complications with implementations over wide area network topologies. Further research is being done to overcome the limitations introduced when integrating the graphics processing units into the guest virtual desktops. The wards of DC were used to define location, and then the topics linked by region for highest frequency. As predicted, some postings showed strong location bias such as events which correlated with the region where events occurred. These data may be useful for determining engagement levels of various locations and activities. Limitations of this method include multiple meanings or usage for similar key words and hashtags which require disambiguation that cannot easily be performed. Advantages and limitations of data mining using this method are analyzed and possible means of improvement are discussed. \nWe have designed and built a team of low-cost, versatile deployable robots that can collect data in a dangerous environment and relay it to a central server. Our system is able to deployed in unknown environments and relay accurate data back to a server. This data is then rendered into a comprehensive map. In a typical index-of-refraction sensing setup, the change in the reflected (or transmitted) light intensity due to the change in the flow channel is monitored. Using a resonant structure might increase the contrast of the reflection (or transmission) spectra and make this monitoring easier. For example, if the resonant structure is a metal nano particle array, then localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) occurs when the interaction of sub-wavelength particles with incident light yield a collective oscillation of valence electrons at their maximum strength and a sharp dip (peak) at the transmission (reflection) spectra is observed near SPR wavelength. The material type, shape, dimensions, and periodicity of nanoparticles, incidence angle, and background affect the resonance wavelength. Apart from the unwanted deformations, most of these parameters cannot be modified after the fabrication. One way of changing the resonance wavelength is changing incidence angle but it requires a meticulous alignment. Another way of designing a tunable sensor would be changing the optical properties of some components of the structure with applied voltage. Assume a metal nanoparticle (MNP) array is fabricated on top of a graphene coated transparent substrate such as glass. In order to prevent a direct contact between MNPs and graphene, a thin dielectric film might be placed between them. On the two opposite sides of the structure, there are two long metallic contacts in order to make a connection between the graphene layer and a DC source. When the source is off, we have a regular localized SPR based sensor with a resonance wavelength where the transmission (reflection) spectrum has a minimum (maximum). Turning on the DC source changes the optical properties of graphene and the induced dipole moment of the each nanoparticle. By changing the potential distribution along the graphene layer, we physically change the inhomogeneous background and the charge distribution inside the nanoparticles, and hence the surface plasmon resonance of the whole structure. A precisely changed gate voltage should allow us to tune the sensor to any resonance wavelength within a reasonably wide range of wavelengths. Roughly, a polyhedron is a geometrical figure in three-dimensional space that is both regular and bounded by line segments, called edges. This definition leaves much to be desired because polyhedra vary dramatically in their properties. Some extend infinitely into space; some look like stars; others have high degrees of regularity. How does it happen that the ever-more precise mathematicians rely on such a vague term to delimit the scope of a geometrical inquiry after over 2,500 years of study?"}, {"section_title": "EnginEEring", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "StatuS", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Student", "text": "\nWe believe that the answer in large measure can be found by paying close attention to the language used to construct frameworks for mathematical inquiry.\nThe presentation will conclude with recommendations on how to implement the lessons learned from Portugal into drug policy in Mexico to help reduce drug use, addiction, drug use-related violence and health consequences, and over-incarceration. The research is still undergoing, and no final conclusion has been made at this point. However, I expect that certain patterns of information sharing exist, interest groups' messages are important to policy makers, and resources are distributed skewed to interest groups in some degree. I expect that patronage does influence policy making in Tanzania. With little existing research to answer these questions, the researcher chose to pursue an exploratory study that would begin to answer them. In combination with the Northern Irish study, the Afghan study lent itself to a comparative analysis of dance in conflict settings around the world and how it may or may not work as a community-builder. These topics comprise the subject of research.\nThough research is ongoing, one conclusion may be drawn from data collected thus far: while the researcher began the study believing that dance is a universal panacea for conflict, the researcher has learned otherwise. While in many situations dance holds constructive capacity as a communitybuilder, it can also be divisive. However, while dance may not be a universal panacea, the researcher's data has demonstrated that dance's capacity as a universal language can still build constructive intra-and international relationships in many instances. One example of the far-reaching voice of dance is the recent \"Gangnam Style\" song-dance video that has received over 1.3 billion views worldwide. That 1.3 billion people have viewed the same dance and are connected through a common \"Gangnam Style\" experience in itself speaks to the importance of dance as a universal language with tremendous potential warranting further research. Foreign Intervention and Outcome in Civil War: The Afghan Civil War (1978)(1979)(1980)(1981)(1982)(1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992) Background:\nForeign intervention is one of the main characteristics of the Afghan Civil War of 1978-1992, but it is scarcely unique. As many as 71% of all civil wars involve external support. Understanding how third-party intervention affects the outcome of ongoing civil wars can help draw useful lessons about civil war management and the current Afghan crisis. oBjectiveS: This study explores the relationship between third-party intervention and civil war outcome in the Afghan Civil War. I argue that the ability of a foreign power to achieve its desired outcome to an ongoing civil war is determined by its capacity to affect the internal balance of political legitimacy in favor of its domestic ally.\noBjective: However, despite their relevance, very little is known about the structure and regulation of these exchangers 2 . Attempts to study sodium/calcium exchangers in mammalian systems have proven difficult due to the low viability of mutants, further illustrating the importance of these exchangers within the organism. Here we aim to use Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to study sodium/calcium exchanger biology.\nin some regulation of the size of the epidermis versus neural plate domains in the embryo. Loss-of-function studies with morpholino oligonucleotides injected into dorsal blastomeres, which give rise to the neural plate, resulted in the expansion of the neural plate and reduction of the neural crest and epidermal domains. Gain-of-function studies, by injecting synthetic wildtype mRNA are underway to further characterize its role in development. Cascade-likeness is an intrinsic property of biological processes A central theme in systems biology is to reveal the intricate relationship between structure, dynamics, and function of biological networks. The biological function is usually realized by the transformation of the relevant molecules through their interacting network. We name this trajectory of transformation as a biological process. In contrast to the structure-centric approach, we take a process-centric view to address such questions as what a biological process looks like and how it differs from an arbitrary process. As an example, we studied a simple Boolean model for the cell cycle process of budding yeast to characterize a large number of putative processes. This computational task was made possible by some highly efficient algorithms we developed. Our results demonstrated that the biological process is very robust and highly designable. Moreover, we uncovered two dynamical rules that dramatically enhance the robustness and designability. Finally, all processes in a system of small size were enumerated and highly designable processes are cascade-like. This implies that cascade-likeness is an intrinsic property of biological processes.\nCoelomocytes were fixed, permeabilized and stained for EdU, nuclear DNA and actin. Evaluation of the percent of total nuclei that were EdU-labeled indicated that EdU-labeling was higher in immune-challenged animals, but only accounted for at most 9% of coelomocytes that appeared after challenge, suggesting that 91% of additional coelomocytes that appeared post-challenge in the CF were not newly proliferated. Of the glass-adherent subset of coelomocytes, polygonal phagocytes and small phagocytes were primarily EdU-labeled. When proliferation was induced by withdrawal of 1.5% of CF three days after EdU injections, preliminary results show six times more EdU-labeled coelomocytes, which presumably replaced cells that were removed by CF withdrawal. In parallel, the axial organ (a suggested site of coelomocyte proliferation) showed 30% less EdU-labeled nuclei after CF removal, suggesting that replacement coelomocytes proliferated in and were released from the axial organ. Our results demonstrate that EdU-labeling is an effective method to measure cell proliferation in S. purpuratus, which can be employed to characterize the rate of coelomocyte proliferation and to identify their source. We used the CP2K molecular modeling package on the supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center to perform molecular mechanics (MM), quantum mechanics (QM) and the hybrid QM/MM calculations. The systems were first equilibrated by molecular dynamics with the generalized Amber Force Field to the target experimental temperatures of 15K, 77K, and 300K for DBF, and 6K and 300K for tetracene and pentacene. The density functional theory calculations were performed with the DZVP basis set and GTH type pseudopotentials on the dimers. The electrostatic coupling scheme was chosen to treat the mutual polarization between the QM and MM subsystems. A total of eleven 2-picosecond thermodynamic integration windows were used to probe the free energy profile along spin separation that exhibits a driving force of ~2.7 eV. In addition, the time-dependent DFT calculations yielded optical gaps of 3.26eV, 2.35eV, and 2.05eV for the DBF, tetracene, and pentacene dimers. These results all compare well to experimental UV-visible absorption spectra. Restricted open Kohn-Sham calculations were also used to obtain the on-site exchange interaction energy of a DBF molecule, which was subsequently used to determine the electronic coupling strength between its SN and SS diabatic states. Finally, by employing the semi-classical Marcus electron transfer theory, the rate of spin recombination was estimated to be ~10 -21 s -1 . We infected the wild (W1118) flies and TEP mutants (TEP1, TEP2, TEP3, TEP5 and TEP6) with P. luminescens and recorded survival rate (every 12h) for a week. The TEP2 and TEP3 mutants showed slight resistance towards P.\n\nluminescens in comparison to wild type. We propose that these proteins may trigger some kind of sensitivity to the flies against this bacterial pathogen. Further experiments on TEP mutants against nematode infection (axenic and symbiotic) will shed light on their prospective role in the immune response.     The O'Halloran lab is doing a genome wide analysis of exchanger proteins in the model organism, C. elegans. The purpose is to better characterize this understudied family of exchanger proteins. 2 My objective was to characterize NCX mutants, and describe the differences that are observed between mutants and wild type worms.\nshow the effects of this copper induced degradation, different cartridges were spotted with cells for extraction to determine the time in which DNA can no longer be recovered.\n\ncolumBian college of artS and ScienceS\nIn the second part, the delta-hedge strategy is introduced for the BSM model. This allows us to deduce rigorously the corresponding BSM equation for option valuation and obtain the analytic solution for the modified equation. In the third part, the assumption of no transaction cost is abandoned in order to get a better simulation of a real financial market. To this end, we first examine the situation when a transaction fee is charged only once in a certain period of time for as many transactions as desired. Secondly, we suppose that there is a transaction fee for each transaction (the case of a real financial market). This second assumption is considered together with the Leland model approach for the price estimate, which requires adjusting the amount of stocks at a fixed time interval. It explains why the option price can only be estimated rather than determined exactly. Finally, we show how to calculate the expectation of the option price. We note, however, that even though the expectation can be calculated, the corresponding variance diverges. This indicates that a straightforward application of the delta-hedge strategy with the transaction costs can be extremely risky. We discuss several examples by numerical approach. \nThe sensitivity of the LHR instrument is estimated to be ~8 ppmv. Future efforts will focus on further miniaturizing the instrument, de-convolving gas concentration as a function of altitude and expanding the instrument to measure other atmospheric gases such as methane (CH 4 ) and carbon monoxide (CO). The study of temporal and spatial distribution of biomolecules, such as metabolites and proteins in cell samples is significant for understanding biological functions, how molecules interact with others, migrate in the cell, and respond to the stimulation. Current methods of identifying and profiling biomolecules in biological samples use mass-spectrometry based, soft ionization techniques, and so far can only achieve 40-micron lateral resolution. In order to improve the resolution for subcellular study (dimensions on the order of several microns) and keep the sensitivity, we couple near-field ablation with an optic-fiber biosensor.\n\nChemical analysis of metabolites directly from cell samples in ambient conditions is essential to understand the functions of living organisms. Currently the identification and structural characterization of metabolites in tissue samples and large cells (_ 100 _m) is possible through massspectrometry-based, soft-ionization techniques. In order to probe the role of metabolites in smaller cells such as myoblast, fibrobroblast, etc., a method with a higher resolution is needed. In particular knowing the spatial distribution of metabolites at the sub-cellular level in such cells helps in elucidating the biochemical pathways. In order to achieve this, we attempt to combine near-field ablation with mass spectrometry. As a first step towards the integration of near-field ablation with mass spectrometry, we will report preliminary results of the chemical analysis of arabidopsis thaliana. In order to map out the spatial distribution of the metabolites, it is necessary to have a spot size which is a fraction of the cell size. In these experiments we were able to achieve a resolution as high as In short, labeled methods require a complex bioengineering process before an interaction can be tested. Label-free methods do not require such an engineering process; however, yield more convoluted results. In both schemes, conventional equipment is bulky, requires a large sample volume and renders in vivo measurements impossible. Our work centers around the development of a miniaturized portable immunoassay, which utilizes the optical properties of gold nanoparticles to perform highly sensitive molecular recognition. Due of their unique plasmonic properties, metallic nanoparticles are being utilized as multi-functional platforms in new chemical and biological sensing apparatti. In the context of biology, gold colloids are especially intriguing because of their proven durability in biological media. Although engineering advances are steadily improving the efficacy of such sensors, progress in the field is hampered due to a lack of standardized results and tools for characterization. In other words, it is very difficult to objectively compare nanobiosensors across research groups, and also difficult to predict sensor behavior a-priori. In an effort to overcome these limitations, we are constructing a calibration schema to relate a sensor's optical response to its surface particle deposition as characterized by scanning electron microscopy. In conjunction, we have developed opensource software for both modeling a wide range of nanobiosensors, as well a new toolkit for exploratory analysis of UVV is spectroscopy in general. We feel strongly that such efforts will equip the academic biosensing community with software and calibration tools comparable to those already afforded to commercially invested sensing aparatti. \n\nobJeCtives: Confocal spectroscopy in principle can surmount these problems while at the same time, by acquiring a better understanding of the contribution of these collateral optical phenomena and their relation with the targeted fluorescence detection can transfer into valuable noninvasive approaches for anatomical identification. Routinely, several optical processes, such as coherent light elastic scattering or second harmonic generation might be combined with auto-fluorescence and targeted fluorescence labeling to build a comprehensive multichannel image of a given tissue.

From design, synthesis to application of nanomaterials, theoretical modeling of multiphysics is at the core of the broad field of Nanoscience. For instance, it guides the design of nanomaterials from zero-dimensional nanoparticles, to one-dimensional nanoribbons or nanotubes, to two-dimensional thin films; it may explain and even predict the discovery of many novel phenomena. Molecular dynamics (MD) has established itself as a widely employed discipline for the study of material behaviors at atomic level. For the modeling of multiphysics, i.e., thermomechanical-electromagnetic coupling phenomena, we recast the governing equations for atoms by reformulating the Nose-Hoover Thermostat and by incorporating with the Maxwell's equations at atomic level. However, we realize that the extension of MD into computational science over a realistic range of length is limited, due to the large number of particles involved as well as the complex nature of their interactions. The limitations are also imposed by the requirement of smallness of the time step, and yet one is interested in events that occur over a much larger time scale. To expand the realm of modeling and simulation, we propose a multiple length/time scale approach along with the employment of massively parallel computing technique 1 .

In the past 20 years, there has been a surge in research on the magnetocaloric response of materials, due mainly to the possibility of applying this effect for magnetic refrigeration close to room temperature. Our research is devoted to explore and optimize the magnetocaloric properties of known materials, as well to seek for new magnetocaloric features in new materials. This research is important because magnetic refrigeration is a good candidate for reducing our energy consumption, as it is more energetically efficient than the process based on the compression/expansion of gases. To characterize a potential magnetocaloric material, there are several relevant magnitudes that should be measured. The most intuitive one is the adiabatic temperature change, \u0394T ad , which is the temperature change of the material when adiabatically magnetized/demagnetized. A novel test system with fully-controlled magnetic field, temperature, and time capabilities has been designed and implemented. We initiated the research by testing gadolinium which is a generally prominent magnetocaloric material. Next, we introduced a new approach of interpreting the \u0394T ad measurements to emphasize the reversibility of the magnetocaloric effect, contrasting the common belief in the scientific community. The new approach also gives the most precise measurement of a material's Curie temperature. We are focusing on demonstrating that the magnetic refrigeration is a feasible technology by testing and characterizing potential magnetocaloric materials. The ability to autonomously collect data about an unknown environment is critical. When natural disasters occur accurate information about the area is vital for search and rescue teams.

The amount of serotonin receptor mRNA molecules in each stage is determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In situ hybridization is used to determine where these mRNA molecules are located within embryos.

We defined the cytoarchitechtonic boundaries for area Tpt, which is a part of Wernicke's area, and Broadman's area 44 and 45, which comprises Broca's area, in both right and left cerebral hemispheres. Boundaries of interest were identified using serial Nissl stained sections. Design-based stereologic methods were used to determine cortical region volumes, neuron densities, and neuron numbers. Leftward asymmetry in regards to neuron counts was shown in our findings, which is comparable to standard laboratory-reared chimpanzees; however, the degree of asymmetry in this bonobo subject within area Tpt was greater than the range that has been previously observed in a sample of 12 chimpanzee brains. Our findings play an important role in helping to reveal the neuroanatomical changes that occurred after divergence from the last common ancestor of bonobos, chimpanzees, and humans.

Ice cellars, or Si\u0121-uaq, are excavated into perennially frozen ground, or permafrost, which provides natural refrigeration for whale and other game harvested for subsistence by the indigenous I\u00f1upiat people in Arctic Alaska. This method of food storage has been employed by the I\u00f1upiat for over 1,000 years and continues to be essential to their native life style as it provides secure, accessible year-round frozen storage. However, over the past two decades reports have emerged describing ice cellar failures (including instances of flooding and collapse) thought to be caused by increasing air temperatures due to climatic change. The village of Barrow, Alaska, was selected for a case study as it is a The following measures were analyzed: soma area, total dendritic length, mean dendritic segment length, dendritic segment count, dendritic spine number, and dendritic spine density. Univariate analyses indicated that many measures of dendritic complexity increase along the processing hierarchy in both species; however, a repeated measures ANOVA revealed there were no significant species differences in the pattern of regional variation according to any of these measures (F=.553\u2264x\u22644.331, P=.083\u2264x\u2264.485). These findings suggest that the pyramidal neuron morphology underlying neural integration along the levels of the ventral visual stream of the neocortex is similar in humans and chimpanzees. Calcium acts as an important messenger in cells, and must be properly regulated. One key mode of regulation is through the use of exchanger proteins. These proteins include the Sodium/Calcium (Na + /Ca 2+ ,NCX) exchangers, the Sodium/Calcium/Potassium (NCKX) exchanger proteins as well as the Calcium Cation exchanger channels (CCX) which catalyze both Na + /Ca 2+ and Li + /Ca 2+ exchange. These channels are membrane proteins that serve to balance intracellular calcium levels, which is paramount in achieving homeostasis and health within all cells. It is clear that NCX, NCXKX and CCX exchangers are present in the plasma membrane of many human tissue cells, and have been implicated in cardiac disease, ischemic events and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, they play an important role in Ca 2+ regulation during development and regulate cardiac activity throughout the organism's life 1 .\nCaenorhabditis elegans, which posses a simple nervous system and a completely mapped neural wiring diagram 3 provides an optimal platform to investigate the neural circuits affected by the NCX/NCKX/CCX gene family.

To determine the success of the arts integration, the interviews and their conclusions were compared to the bodies of knowledge that already exist in the fields of arts integration and arts education. Results and conclusions will be discussed pending completion of data analysis. The role of personal choice in promoting college men's sun protection cognitions Young adult men engage in fewer sun protection behaviors than women (Kasparian et al., 2009), which likely contributes to older White men having higher skin cancer rates than women (e.g., Skin Cancer Foundation, 2012). White male undergraduates (N = 68) were randomly assigned to read information on sun protection behaviors framed as either recommendations to follow or personal choices to make. This information was presented either in an electronic brochure or in a way that required an active response from participants. ANCOVAs, controlling for past behavior, showed that those who received choice-promoting information reported greater perceptions of choice, F (1, 62) = 3.86, p = .05, and autonomy support F (1, 62) = 8.56, p = .005. However, these effects were only significant for men who received the active format (ps < .04). Further analyses with this group showed that men who received the active format choice-promoting information reported higher willingness to protect their skin, F (1, 30) = 5.87, p = .02. Autonomy support and/or perceptions of choice were positively correlated with sun protection willingness, intentions, and prototypes of the typical male who protects his skin (ps < .05 Open-ended surveys will be distributed to a group of approximately 30 GW students that will feature sample computer-mediated communication messages using emoticons.

Analyzing these texts in an effort to understand those two very different roles will ultimately help us understand the cultural power and importance of literature in denouncing repressive governments.

Portugal's decriminalization system, although not without shortcomings, provides important lessons for other countries trying to reduce the public health impact of drug use and suggests that decriminalization of drug use can be an impactful means of improving public health. This presentation will describe Portuguese decriminalization in detail and the impacts for public health in Portugal. It will then discuss how the lessons learned can be applied in other countries, particularly in Mexico, which has been ravaged by drug-related violence in the past decade. Comparisons will be made between decriminalization in Portugal and Mexico to demonstrate how different methods of decriminalization can produce very different outcomes.\nMutant strains were not found to be dye-filling defective. This indicates that the primary sensory neurons of the mutants are intact. Additionally, it means that the cilia and sensory organs are functional. This is a phenotypic characterization, so it does not quantify the extent of the functionality of the sensory neurons. The other experiments will provide more information in determining the functionality of neurons in mutants. In the presence of Copper, DNA has been shown to degrade.

FACE demonstrated feasibility and acceptability. Those who fail to achieve intimacy by young adulthood experience lower empathy, higher egotism, and feelings of isolation (Berk, 2008). Positive romantic relationships help individuals find a sense of identity, security, and bar against anxieties and depression (Brown et al., 1999). Previous studies show that positive parent-child, friendship, and sibling relationships serve as a basis for positive romantic relationships (Scharf & Mayseless, 2001;Rauer & Volling, 2007). This study hypothesizes that the observation of healthy behaviors in other's romantic relationships will be correlated with a higher frequency of healthy behaviors in one's own relationships. and whether the targets were perceived to be as concavities of the object (bites), floating on top of the object (floaties), or part of an object (parts). We observed object-based effects only when target location was uncertain, independent of whether the targets were interpreted as being part of the object (bites), or simply placed on top of the object (floaties). There was an exception, however, with parts failing to elicit object-based effects. These results re-instate the importance of location uncertainty in object-based attentional guidance, and suggest that object representations, placed within the boundaries of an attended object, benefit perceptually regardless of whether they are perceived to be an integral part-of or on-top-of the object. arts integration is an increasingly important teaching method, as it can be students' only access to the arts.

Furthermore, I decompose the Generalized Entropy measurement into \"within\" and \"between\" country inequality, and I forecast the measures out for two years. PRD was related to greater hopelessness (\u00df = .19; p < .01) and a PRD by gender interaction emerged (\u00df = -.20; p = .02). PRD was also associated with greater alcohol use (\u00df = .23; p < .001) and a PRD by gender interaction emerged (\u00df = .17; p = .04). For both hopelessness and alcohol use, the relationship between PRD and health was significant for men only. For sex under the influence of alcohol, PRD was related to greater risky sexual behavior (\u00df = .20; p = .01) and a PRD by gender interaction emerged (\u00df = -.17; p = .04), but for sex under the influence of alcohol the relationship with PRD was significant only among women. This presentation will present a qualitative case study of a women's group of trauma survivors, conducted at The George Washington University Center Clinic. It will explore the fact that for many months, men were rarely spoken about, and it will examine how men were introduced into the dialogue of the group: at first in more unconscious and indirect ways, for example, in the coleaders' male supervisor, in one of the co-leader's pregnancy, and in talk of (a male) God, and gradually, as relationships and sex were discussed in a more explicit way. The presentation will explore how this group's relationship with men evolved over time, and it will consider the healing benefits of making space for men in a safe and supportive environment. Research indicates that there exist certain patterns and themes within these satirical artifacts that may leave its consumers with unrealistic perceptions of politicians, political issues, and political events.\nThe significance of this study lies in the pervasiveness of the subject matter. \"Drunkorexia\"-restricting caloric intake before drinking alcohol to avoid weight gain and/or facilitate intoxication-is related to greater chances of being physically hurt, taken advantage of sexually, having unprotected sex, and memory loss while drinking, especially among women. \"Drunkorexia\" may be pertinent to female college students with simultaneous (and somewhat incompatible) pressures to drink and be thin.\nResults showed that higher body surveillance in college women is related to a risky drinking behavior, especially when they endorse traditional female gender roles. We will discuss implications for change at the individual, social, and policy levels to try to improve this public health problem.   Confocal imaging with fluorescence labeling has been a major tool to investigate systematic changes in various organs and tissues subjected to experimental paradigms or pathological processes.

Foreign policymakers should understand the internal dynamics of their domestic ally, and think about how their policies would rally popular support for them and how their use of military force could help build 'political assets'. that development projects take a paternalistic approach that does not address real needs and often diminishes the agency and self-worth of the poor. In response to the many well-documented limitations of these strategies, many organizations are starting to favor community-based projects, maintaining that the greater control and investment people have in the project, the more likely it will be that the benefits will be inclusive and sustainable. The objective of this study is to compare the models that different aid organizations use in these 'community-driven development' efforts to examine whether the rhetoric of ownership and participation is in fact translated into reality in Liberia. Five participatory development projects were identified in Liberia as case studies, and interviews were conducted with three relevant stakeholder groups in each project: the NGO or agency staff, the local leaders of the project within the target communities, and the intended beneficiaries. Results showed that perspectives on the projects greatly differed between each of the three stakeholder groups. While the rhetoric suggests that community driven development strategies will lead to community ownership in its most complex and multidimensional form, in practice, this study showed that 'ownership' often takes on a superficial and contradictory meaning. One of the primary reasons identified to explain this digression in meaning was the persistent inequality that typifies power relations between NGOs and communities. Thus, this research calls into question some of the basic assumptions and strategies of the development community in Liberia today, and shows the need for additional critical discussion and research on the global movement towards a 'community driven development' model and its effects at the community level. intermixing with restrictive demands from the domestic \"state/society complex\". The resulting conflict delineates the narrow political economic strategies that Humala has chosen from the limited range between the conceptual poles of \"pragmatism\" or \"ideology\". While many label him a strategic pragmatist, I contend that Humala should be seen as a 'forced equilibrist' with little independent agency as he navigates an ever more divergent \"national role consensus\". I base my research on the wealth of analytical knowledge from \"critical theory\", specifically the British tradition of international political economy (IPE), historical materialism, structuration theory, and constructivist modes like role theory, to describe the Peruvian iteration of the emerging trend in Latin America of 'forced equilibrism'. Methodologically, I focus on three seemingly disjointed \"critical points\": new mineral taxes to pay for increased social spending, neoliberal compromises alienating leftist support bases regarding free trade agreements and coca eradication, and the authoritarian abandonment of a previously balanced management of widespread protests against several key mining projects. in the three most politically active cities in the state, this paper explores how Facebook became routinized as a mainstream forum and a significant influence in youths' daily lives, thereby affecting their political consciousness and identity formation. Facebook gained legitimacy as a sociopolitical tool after the revolution, and through exposure to various ideas, discussion forums, and opportunities to organize and attend events and rallies, youth are developing strong political skills and their own foundations for sociopolitical decision making. The paper's exploration has ramifications for how Tunisian politics needs to be re-imagined in a post-revolutionary context. The era of strictly street politics in the Arab world is over. Social media will become increasingly important for lobbying organizations, the international community, the Tunisian government, political parties, and candidates to achieve a better understanding of a growing and emerging constituency, as well as make predictive assumptions about Tunisia's political trajectory. Facebook in post-Arab Awakening states is not a passing fad and popular tool for revolutionary discourse and organization. Instead, it is a political tool of the future and will have a significant impact on whether or not the revolution's goals will be achieved or if the transition will continue to be marked by political fragmentation and stagnation. The Gap between National Law and Local Culture: Girls' Education in India\nWith more tests and data, this program could be refined to accurately count both ion (ionized gas) hits as well as antiproton hits, and to more accurately distinguish them from noise, annihilation products, and other extraneous hits.

In 2010 the Right to Education Act was enacted, which declares education to be a human right and provides measures to enforce equal access to, and equal quality of, education for girls. My analysis of the Right to Education Act concludes that India has held to its legal obligation by addressing affordability and quality of education, suitability of location, and the creation of girl-friendly schools, which includes facilitating for health needs. However, India's law has not had the intended effect. A wide gap between access to resources in urban and rural areas remains; moreover, it takes more than a statute to change deeply embedded cultural attitudes toward girls and schooling. The role of the nonprofit is to fill the gaps between urban and rural areas and to connect people with their government, because the nonprofits work on a much more local level. This research is meant to reveal this divergent results as a means of helping future legislators to create effective laws that take local culture into account so that the laws can have their intended effects. James Hershberg I hope to answer these questions and more with a detailed study of the Religiosity and the Ban on the Islamic Veil: The U.S. versus Western Europe In 2004, the French government passed the so-called \"ban on the veil,\" prohibiting conscious signs of religious affiliation from public spaces. Almost a decade later, the ban continues to receive great support from the majority of French citizens and a majority of citizens in other Western European countries indicate they would approve of a similar ban in their own counties. Citizens in the United States, however, are strongly against such a proposal. This research will explore if differences in religiosity could contribute to the divergence found between these similarly secular and democratic countries. Raw data from the 2010 Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey was reformatted and analyzed using a cross tabulation test. Results indicated that there is a relationship between religiosity and support for the ban on the veil in the United States and Western Europe. Results showed that individuals who demonstrated a higher level of religiosity were more likely to disprove of the ban on the veil. While many studies have examined subjects like extremism and terrorism, little empirical research has been conducted on this particular relationship. Therefore, these results, while preliminary, should encourage further analysis of this relationship. They also indicate that differences in religiosity should be carefully considered in any cross-national analysis. Furthermore, this research suggests that religiosity could also critically contribute to levels of tolerance and, consequently, the success of immigrant integration. The findings of this study conclude that compared to the United States, China is gaining a stronger foothold in economic assistance, one of the development sectors of greatest concern in Ghana. China has emerged as a greater source of investment as its economy continues to grow at a rapid pace, and Ghanaian companies are showing preference toward Chinese investment because there are fewer regulations with which they have to comply and they are able to retain greater autonomy. In addition, Chinese aid is often more visible to local citizens because of its focus on infrastructure, therefore, they perceive that China has done more. These advantages underscore the need for the United States to refocus its aid policies in Ghana if it wants to continue creating a positive economic impact on par with China. The region of Kashmir has been the primary source of conflict between India and Pakistan since partition in 1947 and has been the focus of multiple armed conflicts and continuous political debate. Despite bilateral talks and international intervention, however, little progress has been made towards a long-term solution, and tensions remain high. Some scholars assert that there is no solution to the conflict beyond the current status quo, while others propose different strategies for furthering the peace process. This project attempts to add to the existing literature on the Kashmir conflict by offering an explanation for this lack of progress by pinpointing and analyzing shifts in Indian security policy at pivotal historical moments from 1947 until 2005. International, domestic, and individual explanations for the Indian decisions that have led to continued conflict will be highlighted. This research will show how an understanding of the determinants of Indian security policy towards Kashmir is useful to inform the current decisions of various players in the conflict.  During gastrulation in animals, a blastula embryo is reorganized into a three-layered gastrula, and different organs then develop from these germ layers. Despite its importance, the mechanisms that initiate cell movements during gastrulation are unknown. Preliminary studies from Dr. Brown's lab on sea urchin embryos (Kamali et al., 2010;Scully et al., 2010) show that levels of the neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) peak immediately prior to gastrulation, and serotonin inhibitors block gastrulation. These studies suggest that serotonin may be the molecule that initiates the gastrulation process in these early embryos. In adult nervous tissue, serotonin receptor molecules bind serotonin and mediate its function. In this study I propose to determine the intraembryonic location of serotonin as well as the levels and location of serotonin receptor mRNA molecules (precursor to the receptor) in various stages of sea urchin embryos prior to and following gastrulation. If serotonin mediates gastrulation, these receptors and serotonin itself should be present in the specific embryo cells that are involved in the gastrulation process."}, {"section_title": "reSultS and concluSionS:", "text": "Through the creation of sodium/calcium exchanger gene specific gfp reporter constructs 4 , we have successfully identified the regions within this organism that express each sodium/calcium exchanger gene, providing a solid foundation for further research on this gene family. A preliminary radiographic analysis of dental development in Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) from Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda Investigations of dental development have figured prominently in attempts to reconstruct fossil hominid life histories . However, comparative data from extant wild great apes of known age remain scarce, particularly from species other than chimpanzees. We report initial results from the first radiographic examination of dental development in wild Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), using a well-documented sample of skeletons recovered in Rwanda. Virunga mountain gorillas are the least frugivorous among great apes and, despite their large size, show earlier ages at weaning and first birth. Thus, they provide a unique opportunity to test relationships between dental development, socioecology, and life history among hominoids. We test the hypothesis that mountain gorillas are accelerated in dental development, as they are in other life history traits, compared to chimpanzees. We collected radiographs of mandibular dentitions using a Nomad Pro portable dental x ray, from 16 individuals of known sex and age (0.0-14.9 years). Molar crown and root calcification status was scored following an eight-stage system (Kuykendall, 1996;Demirjian et al. 1973). In only one case did crown calcification stage fall outside of the age range reported for captive chimpanzees (Kuykendall, 1996). Differences were more commonly observed in root formation, where calcification stages were reached at later ages in three mountain gorillas. While these results do not support our hypothesis, future studies will incorporate an expanded sample and more refined staging system. Associated individual records also provide opportunities to test links between dental development, life history and health status in this population. The cosmic snail: spiral structure from the intra-binary shock of the gamma-ray binary B1259-63 B1259-63 is a binary star system in which a pulsar (neutron star) orbits a massive companion star. Both stars emit energetic winds powered by the rotational kinetic energy of the stars. As these winds collide and interact with each other, the pulsar's wind is separated from its companion's wind by an intra-binary shock. This shock causes the pulsar's wind to form a tail that winds around the high mass star. The wide, highly eccentric orbit of this rare binary allows us to study the interaction between the highly relativistic pulsar wind and much slower and heavier companion wind as a function of separation between the two stars. This provides a way to probe the properties of the winds such as composition and magnetization and learn about the physics of relativistic shock waves. We have obtained X-ray images and spectra of the binary system with the help of Chandra X-Ray Observatory (CXO) -one of the NASA's flagship space missions. In the current study we focus on modeling the spatial structure of the interacting winds and comparing it to the actual CXO images. Our modeling suggests that the pulsar's tail shape can be satisfactorily described by a ballistic flow model with the flow speed of 2% of the speed of light. Unlike earlier theoretical models whose results lacked comparison with any imaging data we find that the spiral structure of the flow is not destroyed by the Coriolis force and little mixing between the two winds occurs out to a distance of 5,000 AU (much larger than the size of the orbit -70 AU). The change in the morphology of the extended X-ray emission seen between the two CXO observations suggests the magnetic field of ~2 mG (in the pulsar wind). Thus, the current analysis of CXO images provides a realistic model for interacting winds in the binary systems of this type. It also advances our further understanding of pulsar winds, Be star winds, and shock physics. The study we have undertaken is unprecedented, it can only be for B1259-63 with CXO, and it is the first time when the colliding shock structure in a binary has been resolved in X-rays. A Tree-Like Network Leads to \"Cost-Free\" Adaptation with Limited Robustness Our recent study of biological adaptation showed that, for the Negative-Feedback-Loop (NFL) aided sensory adaptation processes, energy is constantly dissipated to accurately process information, and there exists an exponential equation that defines the best possible performance-to-cost (tradeoff) relation between the energy dissipation rate, the adaptation speed and the adaptation accuracy (the ESA relation). In this work, we construct a tree-like biochemical network that operates at equilibrium yet still show ability for adaptation. We further demonstrated that such \"cost-free\" system has limited robustness that can only operate accurately in a narrower signal region comparing the NFL systems, and its performance is sensitive to both the rate parameters as well as the type of perturbations. Interestingly, individual Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in Cardiac muscle cells were proposed to utilize a similar mechanism for gating regulation of Calcium flux out from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR), where the Calcium signal to trigger the opening of RyRs (e.g. Calcium-Induced-Calcium-Release) is accurately \"pretuned\". These results suggest that living organisms could use such tree-like network as an alternative mechanism to achieve fast and accurate adaptation. Key factors determining the packaging of NCP arrays to form chromatin include ionic condition, linker DNA length, and epigenetic modifications, especially of the histone tails. We have investigated how the conformations of model tetra-NCP arrays are modulated by these factors using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Here we present recent studies of the effects of ion (KCl and MgCl2), linker length, and histone modification (tail deletions) on NCP arrays.

Therefore, some computational methods of building tertiary structures of non-coding RNA have been proposed. However, current algorithms of RNA tertiary structure prediction give satisfactory accuracy only for small size and simple topology and many of them need manual manipulation. Here, we present an automated and fast program, 3dRNA. Since the organization of RNA structure is largely defined by topological constraints encoded at secondary structural level and tertiary contacts, we build the RNA tertiary structure from the smallest secondary elements (SSEs) by using a two-step procedure. We first assemble the SSEs into hairpins or duplexes and then into complete structure since the tertiary structures of hairpins and duplexes usually can be built with a high accuracy. We also use a network representation of the secondary structure to describe the locations and connectivity of the SSEs, which makes it easy to implement the assembling process automatically. In a benchmark test with known crystal structures, 3dRNA can give predictions with reasonable accuracy for RNAs of larger size and complex topology.

We have obtained Drosophila strains carrying Wolbachia endosymbionts only, Spiroplasma endosymbionts only, both Wolbachia and Spiroplasma bacteria as well as strains lacking the endosymbiotic bacteria. We have hypothesized that the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria may improve pathogen surveillance, allowing for rapid recognition and elimination of pathogens that invade the fly. We will provide evidence that Drosophila flies containing endosymbionts show increased resistance to infection with the two pathogens. Our long-term goal is to identify the molecular basis of any changes that occur in the immune response of flies harboring endosymbiotic bacteria in the presence and absence of pathogenic infection."}, {"section_title": "Student authorS", "text": "Derek Damron has been a major influx of data concerning the myriad of objects (sources) we can detect and investigate in space.

Our ultimate goal is to use an intelligent machine-learning algorithm, known as Learning Tree Decision Algorithm (LTDA), to perform classifications for 50,000 X-ray sources detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We first assembled a training data set with 400 known X-ray sources. For each of these sources, the dataset includes 10 multiwavelength parameters (properties) that will be used for automated classification into 5 types of objects (main sequence stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, and neutron stars). Next, we ran internal tests to verify that the LTDA performs as expected. The results are inspected by plotting source properties in 2D slices of 10-dimentional parameter space and observing known types of objects clustering. We then used the X-ray sources from XMM-Newton observations (Lin et al. 2012) to verify the classifications they present using our LTDA procedure. We were able to verify their classifications within their error rates. Here we will describe our training data set and present the results of these verification runs.

In agreement with previous studies, we found up to a 6-fold increase in the number of coelomocytes when sea urchins were challenged with heat-killed marine bacteria, Vibrio diazotrophicus. However, it was unclear whether the increase in coelomocytes resulted from proliferation of new immune cells, the release of pre-existing cells into coelomic fluid (CF), or both. Therefore, we developed a method to measure proliferation of coelomocytes using ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU), which is a synthetic thymidine analogue that is incorporated into DNA during DNA synthesis. Sea urchins were injected either with EdU (n=3) or with EdU plus Vibrio (n=3), and samples of whole CF containing coelomocytes were withdrawn each day for 15 days."}, {"section_title": "reSultS:", "text": "At the moment, the dye-filling assay has been completed, and the other experiments are in progress.

This technology enables us to measure genome-wide expression profiles. The cost of a microarray experiment is still relatively high. Therefore, the sample size of a microarray experiment is still relatively small. For some important disease studies, microarray data have been collected by different laboratories. We expect to obtain more efficient analysis results if different data sets collected for the same or similar study can be integrated. However, due to many complicated experimental issues, it is necessary to evaluate the genome-wide concordance among these data sets before their integrative analysis. If the underlying behavior of a gene is consistent among different experiments, then the related expression profiles in different data sets will be concordant. Statistically, mixture models have been widely used to accommodate unobserved heterogeneities in a study population. A mixture model based method has been proposed for the integrative concordant analysis of two microarray data sets. It is necessary to extend this approach for an integrative analysis of multiple data sets. The general statistical framework for our integrative analysis is the partial concordance/discordance (PCD) model. Its related statistical estimation difficulty is that its parameter space increases exponentially with the number of data sets. Since the complete concordance model (CC) and the complete independence (CI) model are two basic statistical frameworks that can be derived from the PCD model, we propose a two-level mixture model to approximate the PCD model. It combines the basic CC and CI models and its parameter space increases linearly with the number of data sets. We have implemented an expectation-maximization (E-M) algorithm for the model parameter estimation. Simulation studies have been conducted to understand the performance of our method.

One of the isotopes of K is radioactive and decays to 40 Ar. In the initial application of the K-Ar geochronometer, the concentrations of 40 K and 40 Ar are measured on two separate splits of the sample raising concerns about sample homogeneity. With the development of the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar variant, K and Ar are measured on the same material even on samples as small as a single mineral grain. Even though the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method offers significant improvements, there are still possibilities of errors, especially if more then a single grain is tested at a time. Another difficulty with argon dating is possible site contamination caused by different geological processes, which mix older volcanic components in with primary ones. Other sources of error are both excess argon and argon loss. However, most issues with 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating can be examined through incremental laser heating and single grained analysis, making this dating method applicable to many fields. In the field of paleoanthropology 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating has been instrumental in the dating of sites and in understanding human evolution. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates for Java, Indonesia demonstrate how argon dates have assisted in both developing and correcting human evolutionary theory.

The key importance of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating to paleoanthropologists is that it allows the assignment of numerical ages to various anthropologic events allowing them to understand when there was movement and at what rate, which leads to a better understanding of human evolution. Our construction's main advantage is a very large \"marked region\" (containing the e-cycle) which touches all other regions. Because the \"marked region\" does not contribute to the differential map, this has the effect of greatly simplifying the combinatorial complexity associated with counting differentials in our chain complex as well as restricting the total number of generators. We will also show applications of our method to some calculations for specific manifolds. In the first part, we review the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model and basics of stochastic calculus, which allows us to set up the stock price model via rigorous mathematical approach. In particular, we discuss one of the assumptions that there is no transaction cost enforced, which turns out to be impractical in modern market."}, {"section_title": "Turing Categories", "text": "Computability theory is one of the revolutionary ideas of the 20th century, and has gone on to become one of the pillars of the foundations of mathematics. It explores the idea of what can be done by any powerfulenough agent. Category theory studies objects and the connections between them. It was originally developed for use in topology, but has come to be seen as a fundamental part of mathematics. Today, it is recognized that much, if not all, of mathematics can be done in category theory. However, computability theory is just starting to be codified in category theory. We explore this codification, using the techiniques of logical analysis. We find that we can find more general versions of some results. Determination of optical band gaps for PAH and soot in a N2-diluted, ethylene/air non-premixed flames Simultaneous visible absorbance and scattering measurements were made at a height of 20 mm above the fuel tube exit in a nitrogen-diluted, ethylene/ air, non-premixed flame and this data was used to determine the optical band gap, as a function of radial position in the flame. In our previous work, analysis of the Raman spectrum suggested the source of the scattering was PAH species with a molecular mass range of 500 -1000 Da. In a recent manuscript from our group, light from a light emitting diode, with center emission wavelength of 445 nm, was used to make line of sight absorption measurements in the flame. After tomographic reconstruction of the radial extinction field, the optical band gap was derived from the near edge absorption spectrum using a Tauc analysis. The optical band gap, 2.38 \u00b1 0.08 eV, was then compared with calculations of the electronic structure of a series of D2h PAH using time-dependent density functional theory. HOMO-LUMO gaps for these PAH were correlated with the number of aromatic rings in the molecules. From this correlation, the measured band gap suggested that the source of the extinction could be a PAH with as few as 10 aromatic rings. In the current work, a super continuum light source is used to make simultaneous line of sight absorbance and scattering measurements. The current system allows for adjustment of the scattering angle, wavelength, and polarization, while also allowing for the scattering to be accounted for in the Tauc analysis of the absorbance data. Initial results using the super continuum source are consistent with the results from the LED source, while offering better spectral resolution, more intensity, an extended spectral coverage, and additional information from scattering data.

Most institutions in the SDR can be linked to institutions in the NSF-NIH Survey of Three regions of a recombinant Sp185/333 protein from the purple sea urchin have different functions. The California purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, possesses a sophisticated innate immune system that functions without adaptive immune capabilities. It responds to pathogens effectively by expressing a highly diverse array of Sp185/333 proteins, suggesting that these proteins are involved in immune responses against pathogens. Individual sea urchins can express more than 260 distinct Sp185/333 proteins and one speculation on the advantages of this level of diversity is that different versions may have different immune functions. Although diverse, the deduced proteins share an overall organization and structure with a hydrophobic leader, a glycinerich N-terminal region with a RGD motif (integrin binding), a histidine-rich region, and a C terminal region. There is no transmembrane region and no cysteines in the deduced sequences. The amino acid composition suggests that the proteins are intrinsically disordered and thus may not have any stable secondary folding. The lack of homology with known proteins precludes any functional predictions, but the conserved leader and RGD motif provide clues that these proteins may be secreted and interact with cell surface integrins. A recombinant Sp185/333 protein (rSp0032 with E1 element pattern) shows specific, non-reversible and high affinity binding against the marine Gram negative bacterial species, Vibrio diazotrophicus. We have employed three fragments of the rSp0032 protein to determine which region of the protein is responsible for bacterial binding. These fragments are the 1) glycine-rich N-terminal region, 2) RGD motif, and 3) histidine-rich region. Preliminary results suggest that the N-terminal glycine-rich region and histidine-rich region function in bacterial binding, and that the RGD motif mediates protein-protein multimerization. Our results provide preliminary insight into how the full length rSp0032 proteins bind to bacteria and has laid the groundwork for future Nuclear Magnetic Resonance studies to evaluate the rSp0032 structure.

We satisfy infinitely many mutually conflicting requirements by fitting together opposite strategies in a step-by-step construction. Computable relations are those for which there exist algorithms requiring no external knowledge to compute them. Non-computable relations are further classified into an infinite hierarchy, based on the amount of external knowledge needed to perform the computation. This level of external knowledge is called the Turing degree. We study how a specific computable relation on a computable structure changes under an isomorphic transformation of the structure. We are especially interested when the transformation encodes a computable relation into a relation of certain higher Turing degree while preserving the computability of the transformed structure. Laser heterodyne radiometry (LHR) is a spectroscopic technique that allows for the detection of weak signals via technology that is adapted from radio receivers. A weak input signal is mixed with a stronger local oscillator resulting in a beating frequency (beat signal) at a lower, easier to measure frequency (in the RF region). In the case of LHR, the weak signal is sunlight that has undergone absorption from trace gases in the atmospheric column and the local oscillator is a distributive feedback (DFB) laser tuned to a frequency close to an absorption feature of the gas of interest. DFB lasers are desirable for use as local oscillators as they are not only cost-effective but they are commercially available in frequencies that can be tuned to specific features in the rotational spectra of many of the significant greenhouses gases of interest. In conjunction with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, measurements of CO 2 were taken by mixing sunlight with laser light while scanning the laser(s) across two absorption features in the CO 2 spectrum -one centered at 1573.6 nm and another centered at 1611.5 nm. The two beams of light are combined on single mode fibers and mixed on a fast photodetector. This results in an RF beat signal which has an amplitude that is related to absorbance. From the absorbance measurement, concentration of CO 2 can be calculated. Since the LHR instrument collects sunlight as it passes through the atmosphere, the total column CO 2 concentration is measured."}, {"section_title": "Natural ScieNceS", "text": "As the initial test towards integrating the near-field technique with a biosensor, the near-field ablation on Arabidopsis thaliana leaf samples and spectra data from crushed leaf solutions using optic-fiber biosensors will be reported.

A countable tree is computable if there is an algorithm that decides which nodes belong to the tree.

Infinite computable binary trees have infinite paths, but not necessarily computable ones, not even computably enumerable ones. On the other hand, using the topological properties of trees, Jockusch and Soare established that every infinite computable binary tree has an infinite path with the same Turing jump as any computable set. We will demonstrate the proof of this result. We will show how this and other results about computable trees can be applied to a variety of important problems in computable model theory by transforming them to problems about finding infinite paths through certain computable trees.

Several scholars have argued that fictional television shows about politics can have an impact on how citizens view their system of government and its key players in a similar way to the news media. The principal objective of the study is to examine the way in which fictional political television series portray female politicians and the impact these portrayals have on public opinion. Specifically, the study will look at whether television series featuring female politicians prime viewers to think more positively about women in politics. After exposure to either an episode of Commander in Chief, which features a positive portrayal of a female president, an episode of The West Wing, or no entertainment content, participants will be asked to evaluate the male and female candidates described in a fictional newspaper article. Analysis of these responses will allow for assessment of whether watching an episode of Commander in Chief results in a change in the characteristics that hold the greatest importance in viewers' overall evaluation of the female candidate. Additional analysis will seek to determine whether or not a change in these characteristics results in a more positive overall evaluation of the female candidate on the part of viewers of Commander in Chief as compared to viewers of The West Wing and participants who did not view any entertainment content. Overall, the study will seek to add support to previous research on effects of fictional entertainment content. It will also seek to expand the research related to television portrayals of gender roles beyond the previous studies of the effects of stereotypical portrayals of female characters.

Five rabbits from each group underwent surgical intervention to the right eye, a 6 mm central corneal ablation to the epithelium and stroma using an Alger brush with 0.5 mm burr. After ablation, all rabbits in group A received 120s application of CAP. Two rabbits in Group A received CAP application without ablation. Eyes monitored for haze, inflammation, and reepithelialization with slit lamp examination. 24 hours after ablation, two corneas were harvested from each group.

These positions are then calculated and quantified using a particle tracking algorithm, which is then used to calculate the strain acting on the surface of the vocal folds. The stress, and hence the forces, acting on the vocal fold surfaces are calculated from the strain. results to date: Preliminary results like those shown in Figure 1 have been acquired. These results illustrate that it is possible to calculate the position of particles marked on a selfoscillating in vitro model of the vocal folds. In order to capture the position of all of the particles, further work will need to be undertaken to optimize the particle tracking algorithm and the strain then calculated.\nGlioma U87 cells were cultured in vitro, and subsequently treated with CAP and AuNPs.

ECG electrodes captured signals for HR measurements. After hearts stabilized, a 470nm LED (Mightex, Pleasanton, CA) illuminated the epicardium in 5 msec duration pulses at a frequency of 1 and 2 Hz, for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, the light was turned off and recordings were monitored. At the end of each study, b-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (1 \u00b5M) was added to confirm that the b-adrenergic receptors were able to be stimulated in the excised heart. results: Mouse hearts were imaged to look at the distribution of nerve fibers. The investigator observed densely packed arrays of nerve fibers on the epicardial surfaces of heart slices up to 20 \u03bcm deep, a finding which provided confidence that epicardial illumination would stimulate sympathetic neurons so close to the surface. An increase in HR (18\u00b19 bpm) as well as LVP (up to 75% increase) was observed in all three ChR2 hearts after stimulation with blue light. Addition of isoproterenol further increased HR (22\u00b12 bpm) and LVP (up to 21% increase).\nImmune responses to pre-B ALL were measured in an in vitro co-culture system using ELISA to measure levels of Interferon-gamma (IFN-g) & IL-10 production. CD8 T cells whose T-cell receptors are transgenic for the malespecific antigen, HY, were used in all co-cultures.\nThirty rats were intracranially implanted with 9L rat gliosarcoma on Day 0.

Survival was compared across all three groups.\nA balloon was inserted into the left ventricle of whole rat hearts and preloaded to 10 mmHg to measure LV pressure (isovolumic contraction). The direct effect of administering DCA was measured by ECG, left ventricular pressure, and the fluorescence of NADH. NADH was easily imaged using its natural fluorescent property. After excitation by UV (365nm), the NADH of the mitochondrion fluoresced blue light (450nm) that was filtered by a band pass filter and acquired using a high sensitivity CCD camera. results: Addition of DCA to perfusate when oxygen and ATP were non-limiting (i.e. no ischemia) significantly increases NADH intensity with no changes in pressure (n=4). On the other hand, addition of DCA to perfusate when oxygen and ATP were limiting (i.e. ischemia) did not change NADH intensity, but pressure development was significantly increased (n=6).\nAn US guided core needle biopsy was performed utilizing a 14 gauge spring loaded device. Prior to the biopsy 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected intradermally as well as the deeper tissues. Immediately following the biopsy, the patient was escorted to the Breast Center's Nuclear medicine suite. The patient was injected with 20.0 mCi of Technetium-99m-Sestamibi in the right antecubital. results: Imaging was performed on a high resolution gamma camera to evaluate the extent of disease and for evaluation for additional, occult foci of cancer. Rapid 1 minute and delayed images were obtained. Results of the BSGI demonstrated no focal area of radiotracer uptake inconsistent with the mammographic and sonographic findings.

Consented patients were During the course of the study, 20 patients were approached to complete the survey. Out of these patients, only 17 completed the pre and posttest. Of the subjects who had a graduate education level, 41% of the +EIS subjects had a mean change of anxiety score equal to 11.9 compared to 32% of the patients who had undergraduate degree (mean=7) and 15% of subjects with a high school diploma (mean=5).\nAll of the patients that had IVC filters inserted at GW from 2003-2012 were identified. For each filter that was inserted, the following data was collected: reason for filter, date filter inserted, and type of filter. If the filter was retrieved the following data was also collected: reason for removal, indwelling time and any complications that were noted during the removal.\nA retrospective review of all patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion for AIS between January 2007 and January 2012, a total of 198 patients, was performed. Patients were classified based on their pre-operative xrays using the Lenke classification system. Cobb angles were recorded for the proximal thoracic, middle thoracic, thoracolumbar curves and the sagittal T5-T12 angle on all patients pre-operatively and at the first followup. Operative notes were reviewed for levels of instrumentation, use of POs, levels of osteotomies, estimated blood loss (EBL), and presence of surgical complications. Curve flexibility and surgical effectiveness were assessed based on: correction rate, flexibility rate, and correction index. Only the major structural curve was used for comparison between patients. Comparisons were made between the groups for those with major thoracic curves and those with major lumbar curves. Additionally, groups were compared based on curve size and curve flexibility results: There was no difference in absolute coronal curve correction between the two groups regardless of the location of the curve. Additionally, there was no difference in the degree of post-operative thoracic sagittal kyphosis. However, there was an improved correction index in the PO group in thoracic curves and when all of the major curves were analyzed together. Regardless of curve location, the PO group had a higher amount of EBL. In curves with a pre-operative measurement of >65\u00b0 the osteotomy group had a larger pre-operative curve magnitude and less pre-operative flexibility but a significantly larger correction index. There was no difference in EBL between the groups in curves > 65\u00b0. In curves < 65\u00b0, there were no significant differences between groups, except increased EBL in the osteotomy group. In the stiffer curves (flexibility index < 0.55) the PO group had a higher pre-operative curve magnitude and a lower flexibility index. This subgroup demonstrated an improved correction index in the osteotomy group that was associated with a significantly increased EBL. No patients underwent an osteotomy when the curve flexibility was > 0.55.\nChronic pain patients are routinely asked questions about their pain and the impact of pain on daily life during their outpatient pain clinic visit. Their responses to these questions on chronic pain were gauged on a Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) completed during the patient interview. The PCS total scores were compared with age, pain intensity, duration of pain, and knowledge of cause for pain.\nThe study cohort consisted of all primary tibial bypasses entered in a prospective, multicenter database (ACS-NSQIP) from 2006-2010 with exclusion of re-operative cases. The bypasses were divided into six groups, 1) greater saphenous vein (GSV), 2) prosthetic conduit, 3) prosthetic conduit with a distal anastomotic venous adjunct such as a cuff or patch, 4) composite graft of ePTFE and a vein segment, 5) spliced autogenous vein, and 6) arm vein. Thirty-day graft failure, patient demographics and operative details were compared among groups. Univariate associations between patient factors and conduit were tested and those variables that had p<.20 were used in a multivariate model to predict patency. results: 5,375 tibial bypasses were analyzed by conduit; GSV 3,983 (74%), prosthetic 889 (17%), spliced vein 160 (3%), prosthetic with adjunct 112 (2%), arm vein 93(2%), composite 91 (2%). There was no difference among groups in terms of diabetes, renal failure, tobacco use, or rest pain as an indication for bypass. There was no difference in perioperative mortality based on conduit. After adjusting for gender, age, weight, race, and previous cardiac surgery (CABG), the bypass conduit had a significant independent association with 30 day graft patency (p=.006). The GSV failure rate was 7.5%. Composite grafts had a significantly higher 30-day failure rate (15.4%, p=0.006). There was no significant difference in 30-day patency of spliced vein (5.6%, p=0.37) or arm vein (4.3%, p=0.24) conduits compared to GSV. However, spliced vein and arm vein involved longer OR time and spliced vein increased transfusion requirements. Prosthetic grafts had significantly lower 30-day patency compared to GSV (10.5%, p=0.004). The addition of adjuvant venous tissue at the distal anastomosis of prosthetic bypasses did not significantly improve their 30-day patency (Prosthetic/venous adjunct graft failure rate 9.8% vs. PROSTHETIC graft failure rate 10.5%).\nA recruitment e-mail was sent to all medical students enrolled in clinical rotations; first responders were interviewed until saturation in emerging themes was achieved. Interviews were conducted and recorded in a private office setting, then transcribed into a Word document. Five mature-aged students and four traditional students were interviewed. The investigators individually coded the transcripts to identify emerging themes. Coded themes underwent peer review, with triangulation of data collection, to determine main themes.\nIn January 2012, the authors developed and led a session for first year medical students focusing on e-professionalism and social media. During the session, real-life examples of health care professionals and students posted content on social media (e.g. Facebook, blogs, Twitter) generated discussion about appropriate and inappropriate uses. A panel of GW physicians who use social media spoke about their own experiences and guiding principles, and answered questions from the students. After the session, students reflected in writing in response to brief prompts about their own experiences with social media both before and after entrance to medical school, and outlined their current behavior and expectations as a result of attending the educational session. Prompts included: \u2022 Who are you representing online? \u2022 How do you define e-professionalism online? \u2022 How has your social media identity changed since you entered medical school? \u2022 After participating in [the social media instructional] session, are you considering changing anything in your social media presence? \u2022 If you were to draft a \"social media guideline\" for the incoming first-year class what would it look like? A subset of students consented to participate in the study; their written reflections were deidentified, and then coded by two investigators to elicit common themes. All four investigators met to reconcile codes and ensure inter-rater reliability. results: Sixty-four students consented to participate in the study. The analysis is only partially completed but so far multiple themes have emerged including: \u2022 Online presence representing self, profession, family, and future career \u2022 Changes in social media activity since entering medical school such as limiting access, changing content, increased awareness of possible repercussions, changes in amount of use \u2022 Changes in social media presence after the workshop including increased awareness of positive uses of social media in medicine, and changes in content or access to personal sites\nA literature search was performed to research the exam. A financial analysis was performed by obtaining the number of students who had taken the exam and the registration fee for Step 2CS from the USMLE website. Next, using financial aid office estimates and the varying locations of medical schools, travel expenses were averaged at $300. A list of 25 medical school Deans was made, and they were contacted by email. The 8 who agreed and were able to schedule an interview were interviewed via the phone.\nThe survey was developed through a combination of literature research, weekly discussion with local physicians, and working in clinics with adolescents performing well child check-ups and family planning. International and national studies in other parts of Ecuador served as a foundation for creating the survey for Yaruqui. Weekly discussions with local physicians were utilized to add additional questions that would be both culturally sensitive and community specific. The downside to these additional questions was that they were not verified in previous studies.\nSemi-structured in-depth interviews, each lasting approximately 1 hour, were conducted with 34 indigenous Guatemalan artisan women. Interview topics included experience with an NGO that integrates health education with income generation, employment history as an artisan, recall of health education workshop content, and observed changes since involvement with the NGO. Data analysis applied a Grounded Theory approach.\nThe current study is a secondary data analysis of a sample of Eritrean women (n= 8, 754) surveyed in the 2002 Eritrea Demographic and Health Survey. Measures of women's autonomy and socio-demographic characteristic are included as independent variables. Two aspects of female genital cutting in Eritrea serve as dichotomous outcome variables: (1) at least one daughter circumcised (practice of FGC) and (2) support of the continuation of FGC (attitude). Bivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to assess preliminary associations between the outcome variables and independent variables. Multivariate logistic regression will be used to determine significant predictors, related to women's autonomy, of the practice of FGC and attitudes towards FGC. Data will be analyzed using Stata 12.0. Tungiasis, commonly referred to as \"jiggers\" or by locals \"the dirty peoples disease\" is a neglected tropical disease caused by sand fly infestations. Jiggers has not yet become a public health priority in Sub-Saharan Africa despite a likely substantial but understudied disease burden in this region. Only few and very recent epidemiological studies have been published from Sub-Saharan Africa, none of which addressing the burden among children <5.\nThe methodology used was \"process use\" in evaluation through informal and semi-structured interviews with experts and stakeholders. This method allowed participants to reflect upon their work with PIA, communicate concerns and recommendations, and ponder strategies to reenergize and improve their work.\nThe study used a semi-structured interview approach in which data was gathered on the experiences of four self-identified gay or lesbian women aged 19 to 32 while interacting with their healthcare providers. Each interview was recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes found in the data. results to date: Initial results reveal the importance of knowledge by the providers, the comfort of the women with providers, and the relationship of trust between patient and provider.\nIn these preliminary studies, the following fruits were tested: banana, grape, lemon, cherry, and pineapple. Samples of each fruit-both isolated and in combination with IAPP-were made at the concentration of our IAPP control and were run through the CD instrument. Results were confirmed using AFM. results: Proteins that are run through the CD instrument yield some combination of the three secondary structures-alpha-helix, beta-sheet, or random coil. IAPP is an a-helical protein, yet when given the time to aggregate, IAPP exhibits a random coil secondary structure due to its amyloidogenicity. Of the fruits tested, banana, grape, and lemon yielded structures similar to the alpha-helix seen in IAPP samples prior to aggregation.\nWe sought to achieve our objectives by using Boston Public Health Human factors engineering utilizes methods from social science, engineering, and psychology to reveal how to improve the performance and reliability of systems that involve the interface of humans and technology. Unlike other high reliability systems where only very low rates of error are acceptable, healthcare has been slow to embrace the need to understand how work is performed. Rather than imagining how work should be performed, proper observation and analysis would enable the design of systems that support performance of real work, reduce error-producing conditions, and make good on the promise of increased efficiency.\nA specific module on kidney and pancreas transplantation was developed along with a ten-question pre-test and post-test. After a study group to assess this testing tool, two groups of nursing students, a summer and fall semester, were invited to take part in the study to assess the impact of the specific transplant module that was presented as a 2-hour lecture. results: A pilot study was done to evaluate the pre-test/post-test tool developed prior to usage. Final analysis of the study revealed that there was a significant improvement in post-test as compared to pre-test scores among these two groups of nursing students.\nAll Facebook posts (n=474) as of 02/23/2013 were downloaded. Of the total number of posts, approximately 25% (n=123) were selected randomly and evaluated in terms of frequency and content. An initial coding revealed 6 public health related themes: 1=weight, eating disorder, and body image 2=sexuality and sex, 3=alcohol and drug, 4=relationship, 5= socioeconomic, and 6= loneliness/depression.\nA systematic search of the literature was done using the key words \"sperm health\", \"HIV\", and \"antiretrovirals\". The resulting studies were divided between those that found negative associations between ART and semen health and those that found no association or a positive association (improvement in semen quality).\nFor this evaluation, a person had one or more, paired VL and CD4 performed from 1999 through 2011. Log 10 -transformed averages of VL and geometric means of CD4 were determined by month, as were the distributions of the final test values by calendar year. Two-limit Tobit (censored regression) models were used to estimate the true mean log VL.\nThe sampling frame for this conceptual content analysis is every 2012 issue of four selected magazines (two African American and their two counterpart mainstream women's magazines) to yield a total of 48 issues. The magazines will be manually coded for the mention of HIV, related concepts (health, global health, empowerment, stigma, violence), frequency, and the type of message (advertisement, feature, editorial, etc.).\nA study is being conducted among immigrants from Africa, Asia and Europe. The studies will recruit about 1000 peoples by the end of the years. For now, the conclusion of this study will be based on a sample of 200 peoples (120 males+80 females). All patients in the study received BCG vaccine in their countries before immigrating to USA and a Positive PPD tested in USA. One group received the treatment and another group did not. Two criteria has been taken in consideration when recruiting people: their stay in USA and either they received a treatment or not for tuberculosis. Over 20 20 10 10 results: One percent of people who did not receive treatment after a + PPD become infected with tuberculosis infections compare to .9 % of people who received nine month treatment with tuberculosis medication.\nReconstituted GGC at doses of 250, 400, 550 and 700 mg/kg or saline as a control was injected intraperitoneally into 20 newborn mice, which were sacrificed at 60, 120, 180, or 240 minutes. In functional connectivity studies, results are predicated on how a certain region of the \"pain matrix\" will co-vary with another region when different tasks are performed. This information acts a proxy for neuronal interconnections between these related regions. Functional connectivity has shown patterns of connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insula in a variety of disease states. Current investigations use longer painful stimulations in an attempt to understand how the brain processes \"real-life\" pain instead of the artificial on-off pattern that is typically used in experiments. Direct comparisons of functional connectivity during these different patterns of pain processing in non-pathological volunteers have not been explored.\nIn vitro primary cultured astrocytes and astrocyte-OPC co-cultures were used to examine how astrocytes respond to ET-1, and the resulting effect on OPCs. Focal demyelinated lesions were created using lysolecithin in adult mice. Mini-osmotic pumps were used to deliver pharmacological agents into demyelinated lesions in vivo. Transgenic Notch Reporter (TNR) mice were used to visualize canonical Notch activation in vivo. GFAP CreERT and ET-1 flox/flox mice were bred to selectively delete ET-1 expression in astrocytes. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunocytochemistry were employed for both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) also known as concussions, are caused by blunt force trauma to the head with one or more of the following conditions: a period of altered mental status, impaired cognitive ability, or loss of consciousness lasting less than 30 minutes and observed signs of neurological and neuropsychological dysfunction. In the United States, more than 1.5 million people experience traumatic brain injury each year, of which approximately 75 percent sustain an mTBI. The increasing incidence of these injuries through a variety of etiologies including motor vehicle accidents, sports, and combat injuries has encouraged efforts to better characterize this injury. However, heterogeneity of injuries and study designs have made evaluation of mTBI inconsistent; thus, there is a need to identify effective neural markers in brain injury in order to allow for standardization in diagnostic criteria and qualities of prognosis. obJeCtives: This review aims to consolidate and examine existing candidate neural biochemical markers that have been considered for mTBI characterization.\nLiterature search was performed through PubMed and MEDLINE databases, limited to the past ten years. Further searches utilized MeSH databases using keywords: mTBI, serum biomarkers, traumatic brain injury. Manual reviews of articles collected were made, examining candidate markers for mTBI with regards to their nature, effectiveness, and timing. results: Upon review of the literature, glial fibrillary acidic protein-breakdown products (GFAP-BDP) showed the most promising results as a biological marker for mTBI. GFAP-BDP was detected within one hour post-mTBI, and was associated with measures of injury severity as well as focal mass lesions. Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1) and alpha-II spectrin signature breakdown products (aII spectrin SBDP) require further evaluation as viable markers for mTBI; however, are more promising than older researched markers such as S100 protein beta-beta homodimer isoform (S100b), cleaved tau protein (CTP) and neuron specific enolase (NSE), which all show conflicting results and inconsistencies in published data.\nWe conducted an online survey of GW undergraduate students (N=46; Mean age=19.8 \u00b11.3 years). Participants were recruited via flyers and email announcements. Measures assessed social norms for weight loss (e.g., \"How socially acceptable is it to eat unhealthy foods?\"), overweight social contacts (e.g., \"Is your best friend overweight?\"), and self-reported height and weight. Weight status was categorized with normal/under-weight (NW): BMI < 24.9) and overweight/obese (OW/OB): BMI > 25). results: 15% of the sample (N=7) were OW/OB and 85% (N=39) were NW. Among OW/ OB the mean BMI=30.03 \u00b1 3.7; among NW, the mean BMI = 21.93 \u00b1 2.06. 33% percent of OW/OB participants reported OV/OB best friends, compared to 12.8% of NW participants. However, OW/OB and NW reported similar percentages of casual contacts trying to lose weight (OW/OB=85.7%; NW=87.2%). Among NW participants 87.1% endorsed that it was socially acceptable to eat unhealthy foods, compared with 57.1% of OW/OB participants (p=.054). NW participants (33.3%) also endorsed that it was socially acceptable to be physically inactive compared with 71.4% of OW/OB (p=.057). Both NW and OW/OB participants endorsed similar norms for weight loss: 57.8% of NW and 66.7% of OW/OB participants reported their closest social contacts would approve them losing weight.\nObjectives were achieved through electronic medical record chart review (N=483), and a physician survey (N=7). Using SPSS, the researcher conducted analysis on charts to determine rate of compliance before and after the intervention was introduced. Crosstabs were used to determine the effects of patient age and gender on providers' compliance. Physician surveys were analyzed using frequencies to determine common barriers to compliance. results to date: At six months post-QI, clinicians more closely adhered to the pediatric weight management guidelines than prior to the QI initiative. Clinicians showed bigger increases in compliance with measures specific to obese and overweight patients, particularly in setting self-management goals, and scheduling follow-up appointments. There were smaller increases in compliance with general preventative measures applicable to every patient-assessing family history, nutrition and physical activity. A major gap in the study was low response rates for the provider survey, though the responses received did indicate that clinicians are in need of more appealing handouts to give to families, and are highly in favor of an in-house nutritionist or health educator, and more access to a specialized weight management clinic.\nData from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) were linked to information from School Health Profiles survey. A total of 1,154 students in 14 public high schools were included in the analysis. The dependent variables included a healthy eating index, frequency of soda consumption, and BMI percentile. The independent variables included in the analysis were the following school policies: 1) healthy and unhealthy food availability, 2) reduced price nutritious foods, 3) student-conducted taste tests of healthy foods, 4) collection of healthy eating suggestions from students, staff, and parents, and 5) provision of nutrition information to parents and families. Simple and multiple linear regression models were conducted to assess associations between school policies and student behaviors.\nWe developed the Trauma Experiences Checklist (TEC), which is a 41-item instrument, to thoroughly measure traumatic and stressful events across a range of social, familial, and environmental contexts specifically during childhood and adolescence. Participants were recruited from five inpatient settings and were asked to endorse the frequency of a broad range of traumatic and stressful experiences that may have happened before the age of 18 years. An analogous version of the TEC was developed (TEC-Informant Version) for use with close relatives, friends, or others. Exploratory factor analysis of the TEC was done and resulted in two internally consistent subscales, labeled interpersonal abuse and family stress and violence, death, and legal involvement. Validity of these subscales was assessed by comparing derived subscale scores to Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form, Parental Harsh Discipline, Violence Exposure, and TEC-informant scores. results: In this study, we describe the development, factor structure, internal consistency reliability, and initial validity of the TEC in measuring trauma and stressful events during childhood/adolescence. We uncovered two subscales that appear to have acceptable internal consistency reliability and concurrent validity.\nWe assessed 180 predominately African American, low-income, and socially disadvantaged first-episode psychosis individuals using a rigorous battery of measures of symptoms, substance use, family history, social history, and cognitive functioning. Symptom onset, and thus DUP, was carefully assessed using a standardized process.\nAs part of a 2-wave longitudinal cohort study conducted in Ghana, over 1,200 interviews were collected and a total of 697 adolescent girls were included in this analysis. Items from the Child Behavioral Check List (CBCL) measuring depressive symptoms were used to calculate an overall depressive/anxious score for each girl. Based on previous findings identifying specific sexual behaviors that increase STI exposure, three dependent variables were chosen to identify and analyze whether depressive/anxious scores predicted risky sexual behavior. These variables included: condom-use during most recent sexual encounter; number of sexual partners; and whether younger girls (13-15 years of age) transitioned from never having sex to having sex within 18 months. results: Multiple logistic regressions were conducted and determined depressive symptoms at Wave 1 significantly predicted an increased odds of having multiple sexual partners at Wave 2 (p=.046). The relationship was not significant when confounding variables were placed in the model. Depressive symptoms did not significantly predict the other two outcome variables.\nArticles were selected based on their relatedness to the topic of breastfeeding in high-risk infants. Priority was given to randomized control trials and research conducted among WIC participants.\nFrozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles among patients who underwent IVF using their own eggs performed from January 2003 through April 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The embryos were obtained beginning in January 2002 and were cryopreserved by slow freeze protocols until December 2008 and by vitrification beginning in January 2009 at the blastocyst stage. Primary outcomes included clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of embryos that survived the freezing and thawing procedures, the percentage of intact cells in surviving embryos, biochemical pregnancy and implantation rates. Comparisons were done using X 2 or t-test as appropriate. results: A total of 4,596 FET cycles, in which 7,599 embryos were transferred, was available for analysis. Of these 2841 used embryos frozen using slow freeze cryopreservation protocols and 1755 by vitrification. Vitrification yielded superior outcomes including embryo survival rates (92% vs. 96%, P<.0001), intact cells (89% vs. 95%, P<.0001), clinical pregnancy (35% vs. 58%, P<.0001), implantation rate per embryo transferred (25% vs. 47%, P<.0001), and live birth rate (25% vs. 44%, P<.0001), as well as lower rates of biochemical pregnancies (24% vs. 16%, P<.0001)."}, {"section_title": "ConClusions:", "text": "Our data indicates that with the presently available infrastructure, we can routinely and consistently overcome a major problem in the confocal imaging, and to turn these problems into an advantage. The approach has major advantages over the conventional confocal imaging allowing combining minimum and non-invasive optical techniques for vital confocal imaging and rapid identification in fixed samples. We transfected A549 human lung epithelial cells with a full length MUC5B promoter (4.1 kbp) and deletion-luciferase(Luc) constructs. Cells were also transfected with the 1.5 MUC5AC promoter-Luc construct. Cells were exposed to 1uM Dex for 24 hours. Cell lysates were isolated and analyzed for chemiluminescent activity and protein content. Data were normalized for promoter activity (MUC5B-or MUC5AC promoter-Luc/PGL3-Luc/protein). In a subsequent experiments, cells were or were not transfected with full length MUC5B-Luc or MUC5AC-Luc plasmids in the presence or absence of Dex and mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR.\nPromoter analyses with the full length MUC5B plasmid indicate that Dex does not regulate MUC5B expression transcriptionally, in contrast to MUC5AC. However, Dex increased the activity of the 2140 deletion construct, which has several GRE sites, indicating that Dex further studies are warranted. We present two cases of intractable chronic abdominal pain. Patient A, a 37 year old male diagnosed with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis and patient B, a 47 year old female diagnosed with Type II diabetes mellitus and gastroparesis. Both presented with severe abdominal hyperalgesia refractory to treatment. Both underwent multiple outpatient ketamine infusions on consecutive days with significant improvement of symptoms. Patient A initially complained of a sharp 7/10 pain with occasional flare-ups that required ER visits for pain control. He exhibited tenderness to palpation and allodynia to light touch in the epigastrum. Patient B described an aching pain rated 6-7/10 and was exacerbated by eating. Her past relevant surgical history  We determine and analyze the X-ray crystal structure of the Nt as a dimer at 2.4-\u00c5 resolution using molecular-replacement methods, and a multicopy crystallographic structure of the monomer using 5 atomic models and strict 4-fold NCS constraints in refinement procedures. We measure the pH-sensitivity of a truncated Nt mutant by light-scattering techniques, and bicarbonate, bisulfite, mutant self-association bindings by surface plasmon resonance techniques.\nThe Nt responds to changes in pH or bicarbonate fluctuations. In proximal tubule cells, we propose a model where the ARD is a gate for the foyer. Plasma is a partially ionized gas, where electrons are free rather than being bound to an atom. Because the positive and negative charges can move somewhat freely, plasma is electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Plasma is therefore sometimes referred to as \"the fourth state of matter\" 2 . Recent research in the field of physics has allowed for development of plasma at room temperature and atmospheric pressure called \"non-thermal\" or \"cold\" atmospheric plasma. In addition to its usage for tumor ablation, recent research has shown that non-thermal plasma can be used to enhance blood coagulation Current instrumentation primarily utilizes a dielectric barrier discharge method, that is not applicable or practical in the clinical setting. This study was undertaken to determine if a handheld operated system could enable hemostasis and coagulation. Results indicated an increase of viscosity with a gel like/semisolid quality at 5min following treatment of human fibrinogen. Similarly a coagulum was noted in heparined treated blood in 4min. Results for both experiments 3and 4showed no tissue damage from the plasma treatment (as oppose to the cauterization in experiment (4)), and thrombus formation adhering to endothelial lining of vessel walls with 5min treatment. Those vessels that received no treatment did not show signs of thrombus formation.\nNon-thermal plasma appears to induce coagulation by converting fibrinogen to fibrin. Its added advantage over diathermy cauterization is the minimal tissue damage observed. As the data collected was primarily observational, mechanistic studies determining the effects on coagulation are needed. Current efforts are underway to utilize scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to visualize changes in fibrinogen post-plasma treatment. Here we tested the hypothesis that emerin plays a role in chromatin remodeling via stabilizing nuclear lamina-heterochromatin interactions necessary for appropriate and time dependent muscle differentiation. material and methods: We used WT and emerin null mouse myogenic stem cells to study transcriptional and epigenetic changes during in vitro exit from the cell cycle and differentiation to the myogenic lineage. Specific cell cycle (E2F) and myogenic genes were analyzed by qPCR and ChIP-qPCR to determine mRNA timing and H3K9me3 enrichment on gene promoters. Nuclear lamina-chromatin colocalization was determined and quantified by confocal imaging and Matlab. results: Our results showed that TK1 and other cell cycle genes are inappropriately persistently expressed in emerin null cells during differentiation causing delayed exit from cell cycle. Transcripts marking commitment to the myogenic lineage (myogenin and Mef5A) showed delayed activation on both mRNA and protein level. Epigenetic imprints predicted observed deviations from transcriptional timing in emerin null cells, with persistent suppressive chromatin state on myog promoter upon myogenic induction and failure to appropriately establish repressive histone marks (H3K9me3) on Tk1 promoter (cell cycle). Finally, we showed that the early cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation of emerin null myoblasts were accompanied by decreased H3K9me3 staining at the nuclear periphery (lamin A/C immunostaining).\nMyogenic cells lacking emerin exhibit perturbations in terminal commitment to the myogenic lineage. We used a series of mitotic experiments wherein airway epithelial mitosis was desynchronized and resynchronized via G 1 /S checkpoint manipulation. Cumulative analysis shows mitotic synchrony is the homeostatic state in airway epithelial progenitor populations and poorly-synchronized mitosis (as in asthma) induces TGF-b1 secretion and a proinflammatory/pro-fibrotic airway. This finding establishes rationale for targeting progenitor cell mitotic behavior rather than immune-mediated inflammation in fibrotic disease. Rapid molecular diagnostics and discovery of novel genes in myopathy: a next-generation sequencing approach baCKground: Myopathy forms a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases. Clinically different phenotypes of myopathy are due to different genes causing similar disorders (genetic heterogeneity) and different mutations in the same gene causing different phenotypes (allelic heterogeneity). With more than a hundred genes known to cause myopathy, diagnosis of the disease-causing mutation can be especially arduous (increased time, cost) using single-gene testing. With the advent of newer next-generation sequencing technologies, all candidate myopathy genes can be sequenced in parallel through targeted sequencing or whole exome sequencing approaches in a timely and cost-effective manner. obJeCtive: The purpose of this study is to use next-generation sequencing technologies to provide molecular diagnostics and discovery of novel genetic loci for patients with previously un-explained myopathies. We also compare the efficacy of targeted and whole exome sequencing strategies towards diagnosing disease-causing genes in myopathy.\nBoth targeted and exome sequencing panels effectively deliver molecular diagnostics for myopathy patients at substantially reduced cost and time compared to single gene testing. Our pilot data suggests a strategy moving forward, where targeted sequencing is used as a first pass screening approach for confident exclusion of known myopathy causing genes. We prepared a series of 3D co-cultures, in which human lung fibroblasts were overlaid with Matrigel\u00ae and HNE basal cells were seeded onto the top layer. The ratio of fibroblasts to HNE cells was varied between cultures, as was the thickness of the Matrigel\u00ae layer. A control culture with HNE cells seeded in Matrigel\u00ae alone was also prepared. Spatial and temporal changes in morphology were monitored via bright field microscopy over the course of 7-10 days. The cultures were subsequently fixed, sectioned by cryostate, and further analyzed via hematoxylin and eosin staining. results: Morphology and growth kinetics of co-cultures varied dramatically depending on the ratio of fibroblasts to HNE cells. In co-cultures with fibroblasts and epithelial cells seeded in equal amounts of 100,000 cells, we detected the most rapid formation of acini with vast networks of tubular connections. In the control cultures, in which HNE cells were seeded in Matrigel\u00ae alone, only glandular acini were formed. These results suggest that HNE basal cells were prompted to differentiate into more complex networks of acini and tubules due to the influence of growth factors secreted by fibroblasts.\nOur study suggests that variation in the ADGY5 gene may impact not just fetal growth, but may also impact muscle and fat development in women; the same allele associated with decreased birth weight was shown to be associated with lower measures of skeletal muscle and subcutaneous fat volume. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism behind the interaction of fat and skeletal muscle with the ADCY5 rs933294 SNP.  \nIn conclusion, Extract B at 1.5% should be further looked at in in vivo trials as a potential treatment adjunct for patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, while it To identify global methylation patterns in skeletal muscle of males with the mutant (G) and wild type (T) alleles.\nThe measured results from this work will generate data describing the forces acting on the surface of the vocal folds. This information will then be used in conjunction with other data (e.g. velocity and pressure) for this type of model and provide insight into how cysts and polyps form and evolve. obJeCtives: This research is of great importance because cancer is the leading cause of death in the world according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Cancer has been challenged by the need for more specific therapies to improve outcomes.\nIt can be concluded that CAP enhanced the migration rate of AuNPs. Moreover, cells were activated by CAP before incubated with AuNPs. In this work, we aimed to achieve a compact, low cost and semi-automated MIA system which can potentially lead to a handheld diagnostic instrument. methods: To achieve the objectives above, we proposed a novel CMOS magnetic sensor technology along with a new hybrid CMOS/Microfluidics packaging approach. In this system, a CMOS split-drain Hall Effect Magnetic Field Effect Transistor (MAGFET) was designed to measure the magnetic field generated by magnetic beads. The MAGFET was optimized using a numerical noise model to result in a highly robust SNR, and fabricated employing a fairly conventional CMOS 0.5\u00b5m commercial fabrication process to reduce the cost. Release of norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic neurons enhances heart rate (HR) and contractility through b receptors, but may also be a key player in the formation of cardiac arrhythmias 1,2 . As such, b-blockers, which target the b-adrenergic receptors in cardiac cells, have been long used as treatment for cardiac arrhythmias 1 . Although the connection between b-adrenergic stimulation and cardiac arrhythmias has been made, exact mechanisms remain elusive. This research presents and tests a novel methodology of light-activated endogenous NE release that can eventually be applied to controlled studies of b-blockers and the arrhythmic events that arise from b-adrenergic stimulation. obJeCtives: The main objectives of this study were to discover whether hearts from mice expressing a light-gated ion channel in cardiac neurons could be stimulated with light to release NE, and to observe the effects of NE on left ventricular pressure (LVP) and HR.\nBlue light pulsing increased left ventricular pressure and heart rate, confirming the release of norepinephrine from catecholaminergic cells expressing ChR2 in isolated mouse hearts. This experiment introduces a new and physiologically relevant model for the study of cardiac arrhythmias that arise from the activation of intrinsic sympathetic fibers and local \u03b1-adrenergic stimulation in excised mouse hearts. rendering inside it, a surgeon can simulate drilling. Our generalized Focus + Context framework allows the user to visualize the target area as a 3D volume and then switch to a 2D slice visualization where the target area is explored by scrolling through the sequence of 2D slices. This gives the necessary detailed information about the anatomy while preserving the explicit spatial perception with the rest of the dataset. The problem of volume occlusion is addressed by allowing a sub-volume visualization within the focus region so that only important areas are displayed. The applicability of the lens to be used as a drill gives the user the flexibility to accurately plan the surgical intervention path and to explore the resulting 3D anatomy. Our team has incorporated the requirements of both radiologists and surgeons for medical data exploration into one unified tool. This tool is a generalized framework that provides the necessary intervention plan information that multidisciplinary medical teams use in their work. Ultrasound appeared to be most effective at lower frequencies (400-600 kHz) and higher intensities (0.8-1.0 W/cm 2 ). Some structural changes in the epithelial layer of the cornea were observed at all applied ultrasound parameter combinations. In general ultrasound has a potential to provide effective and safe method for ocular drug delivery in treatment of eye infection and inflammation. researCh method / approaCh: Arterial blood flow was studied in an experiment using a bent pipe as a model for a curved artery. Carotid artery flow rate was generated using a physiological waveform input in a programmable pump. Flow visualization was performed using particle image velocimetry (2C-2D PIV) technique, which yielded velocity vector fields. Vorticity fields were acquired and then post-processed using  Various metrics for the flow were generated across the entire physiological waveform. These data were used to create histograms and plots, helping visualize the behavior of the flow as a function of time. Significant activity was observed in the flow during its acceleration and deceleration phases. High vortical structure counts were also observed during the deceleration phases. researCh ConClusions: The research has provided new insight into the dynamics of arterial flow. The automated method was successfully developed and implemented, leading to efficient processing of large amounts of PIV data, and generation of useful metrics that help characterize the flow. This method also enables generation of more accurate regime maps, plots that help visually characterize the flow. These improved regime maps have the potential of improving stent design. Recreating the native contour of the mandible is challenging. This research addresses automated ways of optimizing the pre-operative planning of the mandibular reconstruction surgery. We are optimizing 1) the number, shape, and orientation of the osteotomies in order to best recreate the mandible in three dimensions 2) the position of the osteotomies in order to minimize injury to the perforator vessels and 3) the position of the osteotomies along the linear axis of the fibula in order to maximize the length of the pedicle for anastomosis. is used to find the optimal wedges length and orientation by minimizing the least square error between the mandible curve and the osteotomized fibula segments. And a greedy algorithm counts on the blood vessels locations to find the best osteotomies on the fibula. A case study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of the planned surgery using our system. The accuracy of the computer aided planning software was then assessed by evaluating the angles and lengths and the locations of the segments. results to date: The surgical results using the virtual model were compared to the current gold standard of non-aided surgery. The recommended reconstruction met all the requirements of the standard reconstruction performed without using it.\nThe surgeon would plan the surgical defect preoperatively based on the patient characteristics, and would identify the perforators to the skin based on preoperative angiograms of the lower extremities. Outcomes would be maximized, surgery would be more durable, and operative time would be dramatically reduced. The optimization process improves the mandibular reconstruction surgery by mapping the surgery accurately and by reducing planning and intra-operative surgery time. It appears from this study that computer aided planning software has great potential to reduce patient risk by cutting operative time, and to improve osteocutaneous flap survival rates by optimizing both bony and vascular parameters. Plaster-of-Paris (POP) splints were made with 4\"x12\" slabs. The splints were made with 8, 10, or 12 layers of PoP and submerged in warm water for 5 seconds, with excess water wrung out by hand. Five ridged and five non-ridged splints were made for each layer group, with ridges measuring 1-cm in height and 2-cm in width. Both ridged and non-ridged splints were allowed to dry on 2-ply of webril on the volar surface, and 1-ply on the dorsal surface for 48 hours. The splints and webril were removed before further testing. Fiberglass splints were made in a similar manner to the PoP splints. 4\"x12\" slabs of fiberglass were used for testing. The splints were submerged in water, wrung out by hand. None of the fiberglass splints were made with ridges. The splints were allowed to dry with webril placed on the dorsal and volar surfaces for 48 hours before testing was started. Each splint as subjected to three-point bend testing using an MTS machine. Each splint was secured 1 cm from the longitudinal edges of the construct. Increasing dorsal pressure was applied at the middle of each splint to failure. SCN5A and GABRB3 proteins are highly expressed at the plasma membrane and in cell lysates of Hep3B cells, and mRNA expression is significantly decreased following knockdown with siRNAs. We identified putative transcription factor binding sites phosphorylated by ERKs (known to contribute to cancer aggression) on the SCN5A promoter or by PKA (which we have previously cited as a mediator of GR signaling in HCC) on the GABRB3 promoter using the PROMO virtual database. We additionally validated that these factors do bind and regulate SCN5A and GABRB3 transcription. Invasion and metastasis in cell lines and a mouse model were blocked using the antiarrhythmic drug flecainide, which specifically inhibits SCN5A activation, and with pregnenolone, which selectively activates GABAA receptors.\nEM-T cells are a very rare population, and are incompletely understood. Our very low avidity TCR transgenic mice may provide a unique model for studying EM-T cells. On going studies are focused on characterizing the functional response of the TCR vlo CD8 + T cells to antigen. Future studies will include the use of TCR vlo CD8 + T cells in adoptive transfer models which will be used to examine the ability of these cells to avoid or delay tolerance induced by the tumor microenvironment. Overall, these preliminary studies suggest that endogenous memory T cells may provide a novel tool for use as cancer immunotherapeutics.   The nature of palliative and hospice care has changed dramatically over the past decade. Despite the focus on interprofessional patient care, it is unclear if physical therapy (PT) is routinely provided in these settings. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to describe the utilization of PT services in palliative and hospice care settings and to identify barriers to service provision. methods: An online survey was developed by 2 PT faculty and 2 student PTs. A 23 item survey resulted using an iterative review process with content experts to ensure face validity. The survey was distributed electronically to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization listserv (~2,000). Respondents were asked to address utilization of PT services in the previous year. results: One hundred and sixteen agencies responded to the survey (5.8% return rate). Most respondents were hospice programs or combined hospice and palliative care programs. Approximately half were located in a mixed urban/rural setting, providing service in multiple venues. The majority were Medicare certified (95%) and independently owned (61%). The average daily census was 108. Most respondents (97.8%) provide PT services to their clients. Only 35% employ their own PTs, while 68% use contract services. Only half reported more than 10 patients received PT services in a given calendar year, with cancer, heart disease, dementia and lung disease cited as the most frequent diagnosis. A nurse identifies the need for PT services (94%), followed by a family member, and finally a primary care provider. Impaired mobility (85%) and safety concerns (82%) most frequently prompt a referral. More than half of those receiving PT receive less than 5 treatments. The most common barrier to providing PT services was insufficient payment to cover the cost (44%). Twenty-seven percent of respondents reported that PT services were not appropriate for the population and 24% stated that PTs were unavailable to provide needed services. Other barriers included lack of knowledge regarding benefits of PT or referrals too late in the care process. In vitro, MRC5 human diploid fibroblasts were transfected such that BMI1 expression was knocked down: using the RNAi approach; or BMI1 was overexpressed: using a retrovirus. As a result, we developed four cell lines: MRC5-B0 (vector control); MRC5-BMI1 (BMI1 overexpressing); MRC5-Cntrl-I (control RNAi); and MRC5-BMI1-I (BMI1 shRNA expressing). These cells were analyzed for the expression of BMI1 to ascertain for overexpression or knockdown of BMI1. Next, we examined these cells for proliferation and senescence, the expression of various genes known to be altered in senescent cells, and the expression of a few representative miRNAs. when compared to normal epithelial cells. We hypothesized that miR-671-5p regulates target genes that are important in breast cancer tumorigenesis. We used several miRNA target prediction programs, such as Diana-Microt, MicroRNA.org, MiRDB, TargetMiner and TargetScan-Vert 6.2 to identify potential target genes for miR-671-5p to produce a list of overlapping target genes. In this study, we focus on one of the most prominent target genes,  141 is a member of the miRNA-200 family and has been linked to breast cancer metastasis. We hypothesized that expression of miR-141 increases during the breast lesion progression. We aimed to prove this hypothesis and identify potential target genes for miR-141. Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues from 9 breast cancer patients, which included ADH, DCIS, IDC, and normal components, were analyzed for miR-141 expression levels. We found that miR-141 was expressed higher in ADH, DCIS, and IDC tissue samples as compared to normal tissue. We also transfected miR-141 The rate of LE following radiation therapy the rate was 11.0% compared to 9% without (ns). Of those treated with radiation, the rates following treatment with a supraclavicular (SCLV) field, posterior axillary boost, and whole breast irradiation alone were 22.0%, 25.0%, and 5.0%, respectively. There was a trend level of significance (phi coefficient = 0.18, p= 0.23 for SCLV and phi= 0.21, p= 0.19 for chest wall fields) for the more aggressive treatments. > 9 lymph nodes removed had an LE rate of 50.0% versus 3.0% with fewer nodes removed (\u2264 9) (p<0.01, phi coefficient = 0.43). Patients without LE had an average 5.7 \u00b1 5.5 nodes removed versus 14.8 \u00b1 9.6 in those with LE (p<0.01). The total number of positive nodes and the percent positive nodes were not associated with the outcome of LE.\nPre B cell ALL induces less IFN-g and more IL10 production from CD8 T cells, which might result from poor antigen presentation. Our objective is to elucidate the mechanism(s) of ER-alpha regulation by BP1. The post-translational regulation of ER-alpha is attributed to BP1 regulation of BRCA1, p300 and BCAR1. We show that BP1 binds to and activates the EP300 gene, which encodes p300, a known histone acetyl transferase (HAT) which competitively binds and acetylates ER alpha and \"rescues\" it from degradation. We also show that cells overexpressing BP1 have higher survival and proliferation than empty vector containing cells when grown in 3\u00b5M tamoxifen. In addition, BP1 overexpressing cells have increased levels of breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1) protein compared with empty vector containing cells.\nWe hypothesize that pBP1 plays a major role in the transition from ER+ tumors to tamoxifen resistant tumors to ER-tumors, making it an important prognostic indicator in ER+ tumors, as well as a potential therapeutic target. In mammographic screening of the breast, pleomorphic calcifications can be a radiologic marker of both benign and malignant lesions. Mammographically hematopoiesis. The hematopoietic cells were not associated with a mass lesion or with microcalcifications and showed no relation to the vasculature. Additionally, there was an incidental focus of ADH. By immunohistochemistry, the megakaryocytes were reactive for CD61 but not for cytokeratin (MAK-6). The myeloid lineage was reactive for myeloperoxidase (MPO). Clusters of normoblasts were noted within the breast parenchyma.\nBlack Following a heart attack, oxygen is limited so the function of the mitochondrion is severely depressed and the capability to produce ATP from NADH is severely hindered. Without mitochondrion, cells have to result to anaerobic glycolysis, yielding very small amounts of NADH and ATP and only for a very short period of time. It is impossible to yield any ATP from fat anaerobically, therefore only carbohydrate can be used. The amount of ATP the heart has available is very low and the mechanical function is depressed significantly even after resuscitation and restoration of oxygen. Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a compound that has previously been shown to increase ATP production in muscle cells. obJeCtive: Use NADH imaging in order to understand the underlying mechanism of DCA and its improvement on cardiac function after cardiac arrest.\nThe accumulation of NADH after the addition of DCA in the non-ischemic scenario suggests there is more available NADH that can be used to produce ATP if needed. However, given that the heart is not recovering from ischemia, the additional NADH that is produced is not utilized for ATP, resulting in an accumulation. In a heart where ATP is limited, as in following cardiac Cryoinjury was associated with a marked decrease in NADH fluorescence that closely correlated with the degree of triphenyl tetrazolium (TTC) staining. Time course of the NADH decrease had strong temperature dependence, with higher temperatures leading to a faster rate of post-ablation NADH loss. Presence of the blood within coronary circulation did not interfere with the appearance of the lesions on NADH channel.\nThe results confirmed feasibility of live visualization of cryoablation lesions in blood-perfused cardiac preparations. We found accessory appendages to have significant clinical correlation with palpitations and atrial fibrillation. The association between septal pouches and accessory appendages with CVA or TIA was borderline significant; this retrospective study may have been underpowered to detect this suggestive finding. Further investigation of these newly identified anatomic abnormalities by CT is warranted. It will be considered a success if 50% of the subjects can be successfully be managed and monitored for three hours on pump after successful cannulation and lung injury induction. This experiment will use eight 80-90 kg pigs. The subjects will be properly anesthetized and monitored (cardiac monitor, temperature probe, and oxygen saturation monitor). After lung injury induction, labs (TEG, ABG, CBC, CMP, lactate, coags) will be drawn, and they will be placed on ECMO. For 3 hours, the team will conduct the routine management of the circuit, troubleshoot problems, and collect data with the ultrasonic microemboli detector. In addition, labs will be drawn from the arterial line every 45 minutes. At the end of a 3-hour period on ECMO, the pig will be euthanized. Spectra between all three groups differed significantly throughout the 300-800nm range. The largest difference was observed in the 300-400nm illumination range due to the loss of endogenous NADH fluorescence in acute lesions, but not in the healed tissue. In the 400-620nm illumination range both acute and healed epicardial lesions exhibited higher intensity of scattered and reflected light compared to the surrounding unablated tissue. In the 620-800nm range, the differences between the three groups diminished.\nThe results suggest that visualization of acute and chronic lesions is possible based on the spectral differences in reflected and emitted light. The sensitivity and specificity of lesion identification can be further increased by ratiometry of the images acquired at various illumination wavelengths. This spectral information offers the option for improving the efficacy of both acute and repeated RFA procedures. This method could be implemented by adding an excitation/emission fiber-optic waveguide to the tip of an RFA catheter.   Transforming growth factor-\u00df (TGF-\u00df) comprises a small family of highly potent and pleiotrophic factors that regulate development, wound repair, immune function, cell cycle, and apoptosis. These factors are known to be critical modulators in cardiovascular diseases and many types of cancer. However, the pathways affected by TGF-\u00dfs are far from understood despite being one of the most studied groups of factors. obJeCtive: The purpose of this study was to more fully elucidate TGF-\u00df1 target genes in order to help understand the diverse actions of this key cytokine in cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammation, and immunity.  We sought to assess if rats treated with the clinical EGFR-TKI drug, erlotinib (Tarceva), at a lower dose (10 mg/kg/day) for a more prolonged (9 weeks) period, also displayed cardiac dysfunction (echocardiography) and associated hypomagnesemia. methods: Six to 7 week old (150-185 g) Sprague-Dawley male rats were placed on a Mg-normal diet (100% RDA) supplemented with essential vitamins and nutrients for up to 9 weeks. Tarceva (erlotinib) was administered to the rats in custom prepared diets to approximate a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. We observed significant progressive hypomagnesemia (P<0.05) at 5 and 9 weeks, when a 3-fold elevation (P<0.05) of neutrophil superoxide production was seen. Moderately decreased (P<0.05) cardiac LV ejection fraction and % fractional shortening were observed by 7 weeks, and diastolic dysfunction (lower mitral valve E/A ratio) achieved significance (P<0.05) at 9 weeks of erlotinib treatment. We conclude that EGFR-TK inhibiting agents also cause hypomagnesemia and this may partly underlie the oxidative stress and impaired cardiac contractility observed in our rodent model. The clinical relevance of these findings with the increasing use of EGFR-TK inhibiting drugs remains to be determined. In an era of increased measurements of serum testosterone in men, clinicians are encountering the common clinical scenario of men with \"borderline\" testosterone levels which are close to the lower limit of the normal reference interval. There is little literature on this population. obJeCtive: Our study seeks to clinically characterize men who are referred for borderline testosterone levels and to determine the prevalence of hypogonadism in this population using repeat testosterone measurements. methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 162 adult men referred for borderline testosterone levels, defined as a total testosterone between 200 and 350 ng/dL (6.9-12 nmol/L). The main outcome variable was hypogonadism as defined by various interpretative models using repeat measurements of total and bioavailable testosterone and symptoms.\nClinicians are advised to repeat testing for men with initial borderline testosterone levels as fewer than half had confirmed hypogonadism. This is a case report discussing the anesthetic management of a parturient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  The patient successfully underwent caesarean section, and the baby was born without complications. The baby required continuous positive airway pressure briefly after delivery but did not require intubation. The mother's symptoms resolved after the caesarean section.\nThere are special anesthetic concerns when sedating the parturient. Drug choice is especially important as it can affect fetus viability after delivery. 2 was low to begin with). This however was only seen on day 1 of the 3 day infusions and again showed no visible correlation between increased dose and lower scores. All of our patients, including Patient 2 who had much lower scores even at baseline, returned to their baseline BIS score at within an hour of infusion conclusion and being sent home.\nIn these three patients the BIS scores appeared to decrease during outpatient ketamine infusion at subanesthetic doses. The BIS score in each patient returned to baseline within one hour after the ketamine infusion was discontinued. Moreover, these are very preliminary results for which more conclusions cannot be made until we have recruited and enrolled more patients. We report an initial false negative Breast Specific Gamma Imaging (\"BSGI\") finding in a patient with diagnosed invasive breast cancer in whom the anesthetic used during minimally invasive biopsy performed immediately prior to BSGI imaging contained a vasocontrictive agent. Repeat BSGI several days later demonstrated a clearly positive BSGI.\nAvoiding vasoconstrictive agents immediately prior to BSGI imaging or allowing sufficient time between minimally invasive biopsy and imaging with BSGI will allow for optimal diagnosis of cancer as well as improve patient care. To ascertain whether providing pregnant women with information fact sheet about epidural will decrease anxiety and improve their overall epidural experience.\nThe early results did not show a significant difference between the intervention group and the control group; we will continue the study to have more subjects for more accurate results. Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, helps reduce severe debilitating neuropathic pain in patients unresponsive to conventional treatment. Potential ketamine side effects include sedation, hallucinations, hypertension and tachycardia. There have been no published studies to date examining these side effects in outpatient ketamine infusions. Our goals are to determine 1) the safety of outpatient ketamine infusions and 2) the effect of ketamine infusions on pain. methods: With IRB approval, we reviewed the vital signs, sedation assessment and pain scores of 46 patients diagnosed with severe chronic neuropathic pain. Each patient underwent 3 consecutive days of 4 hour ketamine infusions. Ketamine doses ranged from 0.2 mg/kg/hr to 1.2 mg/kg/hr for a total of 4 hours. In general, doses were incrementally increased from Day 1 to Day 3. Vital signs and Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) scores were recorded at baseline, every 15 minutes during the infusion, and 1 hour after infusion completion. Pre-infusion and post infusion pain scores were obtained each day. statistiCal analysis: The percent change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation was computed for each patient on each day, for the highest increase and decrease from baseline. Ketamine dose was categorized into 5 dose ranges (0.2 to 0.3, >0.3 to 0.5, >0.5 to 0.7, > 0.7 to 0.9, and >0.9). Chi square was used to evaluate the association between dose and largest increase and decrease in the above variables. A paired t-test was used to examine changes in pain scores over time.\nConsecutive multi-day outpatient ketamine infusions have been shown to reduce pain in patients with refractory neuropathic pain and complex regional pain syndromes. We examined the safety profile of outpatient ketamine infusions with respect to hemodynamic changes, respiratory rate, oxygenation and level of sedation over a wide range of ketamine doses. There was little deviation from baseline in the majority of our patients. Increased SBP and HR were associated with higher ketamine doses. RR and oxygen saturation were not significantly altered during the infusions, across all doses. Sedation level decreased during ketamine infusions although patients were easily arousable. All patients returned to pre-infusion sedation level upon discharge. There was a significant decrease between the mean pain scores measured pre-infusion on Day 1 and post-infusion on Day 3. Continuous 4 hour infusions of ketamine at subanesthetic doses significantly decrease pain scores and may be safely administered to outpatients for management of severe chronic neuropathic pain. Prospective, cross-sectional study setting: Urban tertiary medical center methods: Family conferences between a parent and PICU attending physician to discuss a critical treatment decision were audio-taped.\nThe results from the study will help target the various patient populations and how likely they are to return to have their filters removed. The next step will be to create a follow-up plan with the patients and see if the retrieval percentages increase. MRA supplemented with 3D contrast-enhanced MR perfusion allows further assessment of the perfusion deficit in patients with CLI. Preliminary data is promising for using this novel technique for qualitatively and quantitatively evaluating the perfusion deficit in the lower extremities of patients with non-healing wounds. This information may be particularly useful to guide therapeutic intervention when physiological parameters are unreliable, such as elevated ABIs, and to assess the impact of angiosome-related ischemia. The goals of surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) are to prevent further curvature progression and improve the alignment of the spine in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes. Use of posterior based spinal osteotomies has been suggested as a technique to improve the flexibility of spinal deformities which may lead to improved three dimensional deformity correction. Despite the advancement of these complex surgical techniques, limited insight, based on clinical data, exists for both the efficacy of osteotomies in the treatment of AIS as well as indications for when osteotomies should be preformed. The purpose of the present study was two-fold: 1) to assess the clinical utility of Ponte osteotomies (PO) in the correction of coronal and sagittal deformities in idiopathic scoliosis and 2) determine indications for the use of POs in the correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.\nOngoing research with no conclusions at this time. The average number of people present in the trauma bay over the first two minutes of resuscitation ranged from 2.7 to 10.0 (mean(SD) = 6.5(1.7)). The number of team members present was greater for the highest acuity level activations (+2.2, p<0.001) and for patients with a penetrating injury (+1.0, p=0.02), while lack of pre-arrival notification was associated with fewer people present (-1.2, p<0.001). The number of tasks completed in the first two minutes ranged from 4 to 19 (mean(SD) = 11.7(3.8)). A best fit curve applied to these data showed that the maximum number of tasks was performed by seven member teams, while teams that were smaller or larger completed fewer tasks.\nIn this survey completed by a small number of patients, increased age and knowledge of causality for pain appear to be associated with less pain catastrophizing. Longitudinal studies with a larger sample size may help further determine the impact of these factors on pain catastrophizing. Increasing age was significantly associated with a poorer response for all main outcomes and increasing day 3 (basal) FSH levels, a marker of ovarian reserve, were significantly associated with both a decreased number of follicles generated and eggs retrieved. For the insLQ, 107, 59 and 6 patients were no-insLQ/no-insLQ, no-insLQ/insLQ, insLQ/insLQ, respectively. We also investigated a polymorphism (rs4073366 G>C) that was 142 bp from insLQ. For rs4073366, 124, 43 and 5 patients had the GG, CG, CC genotypes, respectively. Both variants were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and no patients were homozygous for both polymorphisms (insLQ/insLQ; C/C). The insLQ variant was not significantly associated with any of the main outcomes to COH. Carrier status for the rs4073366 C variant was associated (P = 0.033) with an increased risk (OR 2.95, 95% CI = 1.09-7.96) of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\nThe insLQ polymorphism confers a high-function phenotype to the LHR in vitro. However, while age and day 3 FSH levels were predictive of outcome, we found no association between insLQ and patient response to COH. Interestingly, the rs4073366 C variant carrier status is potentially predictive of OHSS in patients undergoing COH. Obstructive Sleep Apnea and CPAP benefit on Atrial Fibrillation, Heart Failure and Stroke risk. introduCtion: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is associated with increased risk of Atrial \nVenous conduits (GSV, spliced vein, arm vein) deliver the best perioperative patency for tibial bypass and GSV remains the most commonly used graft for tibial revascularization. Prosthetic grafts had a higher perioperative bypass failure rate. Composite grafts should be abandoned because their patency is not better than pure prosthetic conduits. The addition of a distal venous adjunct did not seem to improve acute prosthetic graft patency which may reflect lack of effect on thrombogenicity rather than the myointimal hyperplastic response that impacts long term failure of tibial bypass. Clinicians need to be able to measure the volume in the intravascular, interstitial, and intracellular compartments with a non-invasive real-time device. obJeCtives: The aim is to test the feasibility and validity of a novel electrical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) technique that permits on-line measurements of compartmental volume changes in human subjects.  By adding rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, we were able to prevent in vivo bladder smooth muscle hypertrophy that normally occurs in the presence of hypoxia, cellular injury or mechanical stress. When SKPs were cultured with FBS, we observed that there is a high degree of differentiation into smooth muscle cells. Interestingly, when SKPs were cultured with condition media exposed to normal bladder cells, they expressed high levels of smoothelin-A RNA, a specific marker for bladder smooth muscle expression. This suggests that SKPs can potentially be an alternative tissue source for use in tissue BOO replacement surgery.\nBoth regenerative and molecular medicine has a major role in providing a less invasive treatment that specifically targets the pathological mechanism of BOO. However, many challenges lie ahead. Ultimately, more studies on human cells must be conducted before their potentials can truly be  The Nine medical students between their 1st and 2nd year of school served as counselors for 1 week at a condition specific camp (epilepsy, heart disease, or diabetes) sponsored by Children's National Medical Center. Focus groups were held on the last day of camp for a total of 3 separate groups. Focus group data was audio taped, transcribed and assessed using standard qualitative techniques by two researchers trained in qualitative analysis to identify themes related to the students' experience at a medical specialty camp. The trustworthiness of the data analysis was enhanced through the use of 1) member checks, 2) triangulation of data coding and analysis by multiple researchers, 3) triangulation of data collection with the use of focus groups and interviews and 4) thick, rich, description and the use of quotes. results: Students described the experience as motivating and career reinforcing, and it helped them \"move beyond the textbook.\" They strengthened their professional identity formation by deepening their commitment to serving future patients with empathy, by seeing and talking to patients as people and not just diseases, and by wanting to help patients' live healthier lives. Qualitative data from the free response sections was analyzed for themes.\nThe data suggest that even with minimal training, anatomists are as facile at teaching ultrasound anatomy as clinicians. Furthermore, with enough training and substantial teaching practice, the anatomists could easily use ultrasound as an effective teaching tool, based on the concept of a learning curve that was evident in the data. Data demonstrated a slight, although non-statistically significant preference of the students to the clinicians' teaching. However, no major statistically significant differences are observed between the two groups of instructors with respect to preparation and knowledge. In addition, the data show an increase in positive student responses to the anatomy faculty instruction as the sessions progressed, corresponding with the increased comfort level of the anatomists in teaching using ultrasound.\nThe data suggest that even with minimal training, anatomists are as facile at teaching ultrasound anatomy as clinicians. Furthermore, with enough training and substantial teaching practice, the anatomists could easily use ultrasound as an effective teaching tool, based on the concept of a learning curve that was evident in the data. This study will allow medical educators to assess ultrasound teaching by both anatomists and clinicians, and encourage the assimilation of hands-on ultrasound into human anatomy courses. This research will also have implications for medical school curricula, with emphasis on human resource utilization and allocation. We designed an anonymous online survey utilizing SurveyMonkey software and e-mailed the link to all pathology residency program directors in the United States. We requested that interested program directors forward the survey link to their residents. Data was obtained on pathology electives, grossing experience, and frozen section experience. Likert scale questions assessed confidence level in knowledge and skills. For analysis, we considered an answer of very or extremely to be \"confident\" and an answer of slightly or not at all to be \"not confident\". Timely and appropriate outpatient follow up to ED visits reduces healthcare costs, inefficiencies within the system and improves health outcomes. These appointments are often made or recommended in the ED, but attendance is low (less than 70% at LAC+USC). Patients most often report that they failed to attend scheduled appointments as a result of forgetfulness or confusion regarding dates, times, and locations of these appointment. A simple textmessage reminder system may be the key to resolving this clinical problem. obJeCtive: To study the effect of a fully automated text-message reminder system on patient attendance to follow-up outpatient appointments. The goal of this study is to design, implement, and evaluate an interactive method of teaching clinically relevant anatomy to medical students on the OB/GYN clerkship through computer-based e-modules and related anatomy laboratory sessions. Our integrated clinical teaching model builds on our unpublished study data, which indicates a need to close the anatomical knowledge gap found in medical students entering the third year clerkship. Our preliminary data so far predicts the success of nesting the anatomical sciences, when relevant, into the curriculum. Our multi-disciplinary team is currently designing interactive modules and will be assessing their effectiveness in the coming academic year. We hope to demonstrate that using this nesting technique improves clinically-relevant anatomical knowledge in adult learners. Over 80% percent of students who responded to the survey found the case helpful in identifying physician's roles with respect to reproduction. Ninety six percent agreed that abortion was an appropriate topic to cover. The Blackboard postings identified major themes including physician responsibilities, unbiased information, and abortion laws. A constant theme that emerged was students' acknowledgement of the complications of abortion and the ethical dilemmas physicians face.\nThe multidisciplinary format to teaching mobile healthcare appears to have a positive increase in student understanding and ability to communicate in associated fields. The impact of growth in knowledge was apparent for students with and without background knowledge regardless of content area. These results support the use of multidisciplinary education in fields such as mobile healthcare that require collaboration from various professions. Future studies will consider the long-term benefit and alternative modalities of integrative teaching methods. were female. Mean number of people in a resident's social network was 10.5. The NSSQ results on average showed that ObGyn residents had statistically significant higher levels of emotional support than the \"average\" person (152.9 vs. 123.3, p value 0.02). ObGyn residents had total network support (99.0 vs. 96.0, p value 0.73 ), aid (60.0 vs. 62.3, p value 0.81), functional support (210.5 vs. 201.9, p value 0.61) and network size (10.5 vs. 10.9, p value 0.71) equivalent to the \"average\" person. Obgyn residents experienced an average higher loss score than the \"average\" person (4.3 vs. 2.3, p value 0.0001), although the percentage of residents whom experienced loss was equivalent to the \"average\" control group (40%). Social support was not correlated with residency success in terms of CREOG scores or Evaluation scores. The subgroups with the most correlation were: men's social support correlated to CREOG score (r =0.72) and Asian's social support correlated to faculty evaluation score (r = -0.99) and CREOG score (r = -0.76). Age, female sex, white race, black race did not correlate with measures of residency success.\nThe Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure of total network support, as well as emotional support, aid and total loss. ObGyn residents in this academic institution seem to have a high level of emotional support and a high level of total network, but may be lacking in terms of tangible support functions such as aid and network size. This may be related to living away from family and friends. Interestingly, the selected measures of residency successes were not correlated to level of social support. This could reflect that the effect of a strong support system may be better examined by other measures than CREOG scores and faculty evaluations or that social support is not a factor in performance during residency training. Concerns exist about lack of faculty observation and the quality and frequency of feedback when PGY-1s perform procedures early in training. Lack of direct observation precludes the documentation of resident competency and reduces opportunities for feedback. Faculty availability nights and weekends could influence these factors. obJeCtive: Ob-Gyn PGY-1s completed a questionnaire when they performed procedures in order to: 1) document their experience being observed doing procedures 2) document their feedback experience and 3) determine the impact of the timing of their work shift on the observations and feedback they received. Nine of the ten PGY-1s participated in the study. They recorded data from 33 of 72 possible shifts (46%), a mean of 4 shifts/resident. They reported that 71% of their total procedures (N=662) were observed. Senior residents observed them 43% of the time, nurses 15% and faculty 13%. PGY-1s reported receiving feedback 29% of the time--more likely on writing admission orders, hand-offs and performing a delivery. They reported feedback to be effective 96% of the time they received it and this did not differ regarding who provided the feedback (p=0.7384). The shift had no statistically significant effect on the frequency of observation and feedback. Faculty, however, were more likely observers during the day (p< .0001) and nurses during evening/weekend shifts (p<.0001). Senior resident observations were split equally day and evenings/weekends.\nPGY1s reported being observed performing patient care activities 71% of the time. Senior residents and nurses were more likely than faculty to observe PGY-1s. Faculty were less likely to observe PGY-1s on nights and weekends. Important surgical anatomy, such as vascular, abdominal, pelvic and neural anatomy, is taught early in medical school training. The literature shows that many physicians, especially surgical specialists, feel anatomical education of medical students is significantly inadequate and nesting of anatomical sciences in the curriculum is needed. This is of great concern for students entering their surgery rotation and quantitative data concerning this anatomical knowledge deficit is lacking.\nKnowledge of surgical anatomy is varied for medical students entering clerkships in general surgery and surgical subspecialties. The data collected will be utilized to create interactive learning modules using principles of active learning and instructional design, aimed at improving clinically-relevant anatomical knowledge, a second step in the nesting process in our curriculum. These modules will be available to students prior to their inpatient surgical rotations with the goal of closing their anatomical knowledge gap, thus making them more successful on their surgical rotations. To evaluate the impact of external stressors on laparoscopic skills of Obstetrics and Gynecology Residents. The findings are summarized in ConClusions: Stress appears to reduce the amount of time required for and the accuracy with which residents complete laparoscopic tasks. It is known that stress hinders learning. Our data indicate that stress hinders accuracy and, given the requirement for accuracy in laparoscopy, support the need to minimize stress in the training residents. \nOur research has shown that this is exam is a significant financial burden. With a possible pass rate of 99.7%, it is not identifying many clinically incompetent students. Over the past decade, most schools have implemented a comprehensive OSCE that could replace this exam. Evidence from the literature review indicates that training that is individualized and incorporates a variety of media methods can be an effective method to provide didactic as well as hands-on skill building education to family caregivers.\nThe outcome of this intervention was clear -when you offer waste diversion stations to event patrons, they will be used; when you staff these waste stations, the items collected are sorted more effectively than stations without support staff. These results have been presented to DC Council in the form of a policy recommendation, which also highlights existing event waste policies across the United States. This poster presentation will demonstrate the successes and challenges of Waste Diversion DC, along with a progress report for the policy change recommendation to DC Council. Is rushing a risk factor for laceration injury? It depends on how researchers ask the question.\nFall hazards in skilled trades have been understudied. This unique university-general contractor partnership capitalizes on the opportunity to ensure public health principles are being realized during construction. This presentation will include the application of the GAFR assessment instrument and the current preliminary results, highlighting the importance of observational assessment of worksites. Additionally, the lessons learned from the field assessments will also be discussed. Preliminary assessment of the exposure data shows that a majority of the men in the study had levels of 1N (98.4%) and TCPy (91.1%) above the method limits of detection. Of the 192 semen samples, 43.75% (n=84) had at least one semen parameter below the WHO reference criteria (i.e., concentration >20million sperm/mL, >50% motile sperm or >4% normal forms). The mean (standard deviation) percent disomy for each disomic condition were: XX18: 0.41(0.40); YY18: 0.38(0.33); XY18: 1.11(0.83); and total disomy: 1.90 (1.26). Statistical analyses for this presentation will use Poisson regression to assess associations between exposure to carbaryl (as 1N) and chlorpyrifos (as TCPy) and the frequency of sex chromosome disomy, and will include covariates such as age, smoking status and abstinence time.\nThis study will be one of the first to assess whether exposures to two non-persistent pesticides at environmentally relevant levels are associated with sex chromosome disomy in human sperm. For my summer experience, I traveled to Thailand as George Washington's first international summer intern for a new clinical elective program at Khon Kaen University. My main objectives were threefold: to discover the medical educational differences between Thailand and America; gain clinical knowledge of the diagnosis and care of patients in Thailand in the Orthopedic Surgery and Obstetrics and Gynecology department; and create a student manual and web-blog for future GWU classes traveling to KKU to learn about my experiences. methods: I spent six weeks working in Srinagarind Hospital in Khon Kaen, Thailand: four weeks in the orthopedic surgery department and two weeks in the Ob/Gyn department. For the remaining two weeks I created a manual for future GW students traveling to Thailand. While in Thailand, I assisted the staff both in out-patient and in the OR. In orthopedics, I assisted physicians by casting clubbed feet, suturing, and scrubbing in on surgeries. In Ob/Gyn I peformed pelvic exams, annual exams, prenatal exams, and witnessed both cesarean and vaginal deliveries.\nFor any intervention to successfully impact the neonatal period, navigation into the Saur is a critical component. The only way to enter the Saur is by understanding and respecting the cultural paradigm that shaped it. Only then can an intervention be designed to fit the espoused values. Recognizing and appreciating confinement and the associated practices will allow interventions to have tremendous success. There is a blind spot that exists in interventions is that this confinement's role in service delivery is not recognized and is under appreciated. Understand unique aspects and barriers in the sexual health of adolescents in the Yaruqui area of Ecuador and develop a survey that will be distributed and analyzed by local physicians and healthcare officials to guide future programs on adolescent sexual health and adolescent pregnancy. baCKground: Yaruqui is a rural town located in the outskirts of Quito, the capital of Ecuador, which serves as a major community hospital for many smaller rural clinics in the surrounding region (Area de Salud 14). Yaruqui and the subcenters in Area 14 are public hospitals and clinics operated by Ecuador's Ministry of Public Health (Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica or MSP). The MSP currently has public health programs for adolescents in place but it remains evident by physicians in the region that adolescent pregnancy continues to be a significant social issue and further work needs to be done to uncover details such as the frequency of adolescent pregnancy, risk and protective factors that contribute to early pregnancy, and the adolescent thought process and outlook toward sexuality.\nAs millions suffer preventable morbidity and mortality, there is opportunity to thwart these human rights violations by building an infrastructure for health, that is, the systems necessary for hygienic lifestyles and access to  ConClusions: Engaging communities based on their health indicators and assessing local response provided valuable information. Continuing these assessments will allow future interventions to better focus on the population's health needs. These assessments are also feasible at minimal cost. This paper presents a novel handwashing ladder which emphasizes that access to the physical resources of soap, water and towels should be addressed in hygiene interventions. Some examples of how to use this ladder to more sustainably move a population towards best known handwashing practices are also presented.\nThis handwashing ladder allows for more sustainable progress in hygiene within a community than previous guidelines, since progress can be made incrementally, and, in many cases, on one individual aspect of the handwashing process at a time. This study was conducted in 4 villages of Yucatan peninsula where previous Chagas activities have been carried out, but none of which targeted children specifically. A total of 261 drawings were collected from 4 villages from primary school children, ages 6-12. The images and the messages on the drawings were scored qualitatively. The scoring tool included 6 major themes and 50 subthemes that were inductively and deductively defined. The findings were further examined to determine differences by village, age and gender.\nThe results of this study demonstrate that drawings can provide valuable insight into children's knowledge and the findings will be very influential in the development of future Chagas education efforts with specific activities for children. Many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Guatemala strive to alleviate poverty among indigenous women through income generation. Select NGOs incorporate health education within their programs as a strategy to address health more directly. This qualitative study identifies factors essential to achieving success for two such NGOs. obJeCtive: To identify lessons learned and best practices from organizations working to improve the livelihood and wellbeing of indigenous Guatemalan women through income generation plus health education. Organizational-as well as artisan-level factors surfaced as instrumental to successful income generation plus health education efforts. Artisans expressed maximizing earning potential by diversifying into non-artisan work. At the organizational level, staff expressed a genuine dedication to the organization's social good mission. NGOs also placed importance on group interactions, which diffused and reinforced health education content. As a result, although health education activities were secondary to income generation, respondents recalled specific health information covered.\nJiggers affected half of the village population of all ages, and with considerable evidence of associated morbidity, depression, secondary infection and stigma. The study was not powered to study rare severe outcomes including amputation and mortality. We demonstrated that \"Jiggers\" is not associated with poor personal hygiene but rather to time spent walking barefoot; insights that may combat the \"dirty people's\" stigma. A broader study of villages in Sub-Saharan Africa is warranted. Jiggers was anecdotally suggested to be of recent origin in this setting and possibly linked to climate changes (droughts). Resources and awareness must be allocated to address and prevent this truly neglected tropical disease. Social norms about gender, power, and violence drive the gender-based violence (GBV) epidemic in South Africa. In response, the KwaZulu Natal Network on Violence against Women initiated the Prevention in Action (PIA) movement to achieve an end to GBV. Traditional interventions try to empower women to mobilize against GBV, but recent efforts work to engage men to take action. PIA now embraces this innovation by working with women and men against GBV. obJeCtives: This case study of Wentworth, South Africa aimed to: understand the potential of men to prevent GBV; evaluate how the Network tries to mobilize men and women to take action; and explore with community-organizers their goals, challenges, opportunities, and visions for the future of PIA.\nWentworth recognizes changes in attitudes toward GBV and accepts PIA as a long- Lowering fertility rates in developing countries could improve stability, increase economic productivity, and mitigate environmental degradation. methods: This study uses Demographic and Health Survey data to assess the effects of family planning and levels of education on fertility among women in Timor-Leste, a country with high maternal mortality and one of the fastest growing youth populations in the world. Four multivariate regression models were generated to test the impact of education and family planning knowledge and use on fertility levels. results: Among women reporting contraceptive knowledge and use, those with at least a secondary education have .280 and .223 fewer children respectively than those with no education. Those with a primary education have .101 and .152 fewer children respectively than those with no education. Furthermore, secondary or higher levels of education alone were determined to have a greater impact on reducing the total number of children born than primary education combined with contraceptive knowledge.\nThese results highlight the significance of education in reducing fertility levels. Furthermore, this study finds education to be more important than contraceptive knowledge or use in lowering the total number of children Follow-up calls are still continuing and analysis has not been performed.\nThe plan is a comprehensive blueprint that each department can use for direction during a hurricane disaster. It is flexible, allowing Department Directors to have full authority over their department. Some weaknesses in the plan appear to be the lack of training exercises prior to a disaster and direction for the recovery phase. Without a description of the generators, it is also possible that the facility would be susceptible to generator failure. Finally, the financial hardship that storms produce has the potential to cause irremediable damage. The Hurricane and Inclement Weather Plan provides a summary of the events that are expected to occur during a hurricane disaster. The plan has areas of weakness, however these could be corrected through careful re-evaluation of the plan, disaster drills, and a study of the available literature. Finally, a literature review was conducted to gather terms used in published works. results: A glossary of thirty new standardized terms were created defining words, including homophobia, sexual identity, intimate partner, among others. The glossary was provided to the Mayor's Office for utilization during data collection within the LGBT community and was distributed to DC Government agencies for drafting LGBT surveys, in-take forms, and other data collection tools.\nThe current climate surrounding LGBT issues calls for both politically correct and culturally sensitive language. Minimal research has been conducted to strengthen LGBT terminology for health services research. Creating a standardized glossary of terms for the Office of LGBT affairs was necessary to bring clarity and consistency to research conducted in the LGBT community. Lesbian women face health issues that are distinct and require personalized preventative services in which to deal with them (Mayer et al., 2008). Generally speaking, gay women are a population that has a poorer health status than their heterosexual counterparts (Koh, 2000). The lack of preventative services sought by lesbians has the propensity to lead to poor health outcomes in this population (Koh, 2000). obJeCtive: Hence the purpose of this research is to explore the quality of healthcare provision that the lesbian community receives. Gay women's health concerns have only recently entered the forefront of medical literature and research agendas (Malterud, Bjorkman, Flatval, Ohnstad, Thesen & Rortevti, 2009). Lesbians are a habitually overlooked population that deserves to be a focus in order to improve their health outcomes.\nFrom the results implications will further be discussed in order to make further suggestions to aid in the improvement of the quality of healthcare provision by providers to the lesbian community. The study of amyloid protein aggregation is critical to the pathological understanding of several diseases-Type II Diabetes, Alzheimer's, Huntington's-that can be fatal and continue to plague patients, as there is no known cure for these disorders. 1,2 Research in this field has been ongoing for the past few decades, yet a significant obstacle in conducting amyloid studies is defining the mechanism by which amyloid protein aggregation occurs. 2 One technique used to monitor aggregation activity is circular dichroism, which is the differential absorbance of left and right circularly polarized light. Circular dichroism (CD) detects differences in secondary and tertiary protein structure by quantitatively assigning values of circularly polarized light absorbance to proteins. 3,4 Though CD could be used to research most, if not all, amyloidogenic diseases, we used CD to study the protein folding of the Type II Diabetes-associated amyloid protein called Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP). IAPP's characteristic rapid in vitro aggregation makes it a desirable protein for study. 2 Previous research has shown that certain foods, specifically fruits and vegetables, exhibit amyloid aggregation-inhibiting characteristics, though it has yet to be determined which components of these foods are responsible for this therapeutic effect. 5\nBecause certain fruit samples combined with IAPP yielded alpha-helical structures, we believe that these fruits are capable of IAPP-aggregation inhibition in vitro. The therapeutic moieties within the samples have yet to be determined. Further studies must be done using other fruit and vegetable samples, followed by studies using mammalian cells. We sought to describe the epidemiology of emergency department (ED) visits for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in an urban area with diverse neighborhood populations using syndromic surveillance data.\nPrior to receiving their discharge paperwork, at our institution, parents of hospitalized patients may not be sufficiently informed about their child's laboratory testing. Greater effort to improve counseling about subspecialty follow up appointments and new medications is likely to be beneficial. The portability and cost-effectiveness of ultrasound makes it an ideal learning tool to supplement traditional methods employed in Gross Anatomy curricula. The introduction of ultrasound anatomy modules into the first year of medical school facilitates the transition between the didactic anatomy course and clinical applications. Studies have shown that the basic operation and interpretation of ultrasound can be effectively taught to medical students, using short instructive sessions and hands-on training. obJeCtives: Currently, there is not a consensus on the content of Ultrasound-Applied Anatomy Training (USAAT) for medical students. We sought to identify the high-yield anatomical topics that are the most clincally relevant and feasible for ultrasound guided teaching in Gross Anatomy courses taught to first year medical students. results: The Focus Group generated a list of 1460 structures, which was narrowed down to 312 structures by the First Round Survey . Second Round Survey is pending in the data collection phase.\nThe results of this study can be used to identify and implement the high-yield educational topics as ultrasound curriculum modules in Gross Anatomy training. The median age of the 37 participants was 18.0 years (SD 1.57), almost all African American (n=36/37),with n=6 reporting prior history of pregnancy without giving birth, and 78.4% (n=29/37) reported being in steady or committed relationship at the time of study participation. The mean age of sexarche was 15.4 (SD 1.4), 86% (n=32/37) reported condom use and 29% (n=11/37) reported using Depo-Provera or oral contraceptive pills to prevent pregnancy at last intercourse. Three patterns of pregnancy intention emerged when asked about their views of pregnancy and how they would feel if they found out they were pregnant today. The majority (n=17/37) discussed only positive content regarding pregnancy. All participants reporting previous pregnancies were in this group. Thirty-five percent (n=13/37) discussed contradictory views about pregnancy. Nineteen percent (n=7/37) had negative or neutral views about pregnancy. Timing, preparation, financial support, and age were important factors in whether participants expressed positive or negative content in regards to pregnancy. Conversely participants described many concerns with hormonal contraception, with most common being including side effects including weight gain (n=18) and reducing future fertility (n=5). There were no statistical differences between the groups in regards to age, reported condom use, relationship status, and hormonal contraception use to prevent pregnancy at last intercourse.\nAs transplantation is becoming more commonplace it may be beneficial for nursing schools to place specific modules such as this one on renal transplantation into nursing curriculum. vasoactive infusion (p = <.001) and hospital-to-hospital transfer (p = .004).\nInformation from the study may provide a framework for addressing HL learning needs of APRNs. Educational enrichment may translate into improved patientprovider communication for all practitioners and improved patient health outcomes. Organizational policy and practice changes regarding the impact of activities to increase HL awareness are potential outcomes as a result of this study. Over a mean of 6.5 years of follow-up, the DCCT recorded self-reported smoking behaviors, glycemic exposure based on HbA1c values, and complication status. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess whether time-dependent measurements of smoking predict HbA1c levels. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess time-dependent smoking exposures as predictors of nephropathy and retinopathy. All models were adjusted for potential baseline confounders.\nSmoking is associated with poor glycemic control and an increased risk of microvascular complications in individuals with type 1 diabetes.  3, a place where members can express feelings, share experiences, and ask for advice. However, the cyber world may not provide the diagnosis and treatment necessary for clinical conditions. obJeCtive: This study assesses the content in the newly created Facebook Page: GWU Secrets, a page moderated by student(s) allowing for \"secrets\" to be posted anonymously through survey monkey or Gmail.\nThe data provides a snapshot of the relevant public health issues discussed in an online medium amongst college students. The GWSecrets Facebook page has only been live for two weeks and has already generated 474 posts, some of which indicate students seeking help for health and mental health related topics. These data are important for emphasizing the cultural change occurring among our college students. Public health professionals must also adapt to these changing times in order to be maximally effective at reaching all populations with the right messages, in the right forums, at the right time. With the use of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), HIV has transitioned to become a chronic disease rather than a life threatening illness. This allows HIV positive men to lead more normal lives and pursue opportunities to procreate. There have been a few studies that have evaluated the sperm health in HIV positive men undergoing ART, suggesting that standard sperm parameters are negatively affected by treatment. obJeCtives: This study examines the current knowledge of the effects that HAART may have on sperm health, particularly looking into potential chromosomal abnormalities and proposes a new study to evaluate the impacts of HIV, HAART, and sperm aneuploidy.\nDue to the survey results, it appears that there is a great interest in the beneficial effects of AAT but in terms of implementation, more research will need to be done for each facility individually. Further research should include an assessment of how the patients/residents feel about AAT in order to accurately gauge how beneficial it will be in a specific setting. Because facilities that serve the community are extremely versatile, it would be crucial to analyze the population in which the facility serves to best assess how AAT can be implemented in that facility. for Sexual Health at GW. Upon completion of the survey, one-on-one interviews will be conducted with consenting physicians to explore the specific health needs of their specific patient populations. As this is an initial exploratory study, basic descriptive analyses will be performed to calculate means and percentages and examine the distribution characteristics of the survey data. results to date: The survey has received IRB approval, but data collection has yet to be completed. Preliminary data from a small number of responses suggest that about 50% of MFA practitioners see patients with sexual health issues \"often\" or \"very often\". Responses suggest that the top barriers experienced by MFA practitioners to screening for and referring patients for sexual health issues include time constraints, lack of competence in treating sexual health issues, financial/insurance issues, and lack of available providers. Thus far, there has been overwhelmingly positive response among MFA practitioners in regards to the need for a Center for Sexual Health at GW as well as an eagerness to refer to such center were it to exist.\nFindings from the proposed survey and follow-up interviews will provide MFA practitioners interested in devloping a Center for Sexual Health at GW with the information necessary to provide effective and comprehensive sexual health services for MFA patients. The project will also help inform providers of the need for such a clinic and the availability of sexual health specialty care within the MFA. The study purpose is to better understand chronic disease management in the uninsured population accessing health care through the NP TAC clinic. The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the TAC clinic in achieving high blood pressure (BP) reduction. The study aims to identify clinic resources affecting disease management to improve health care outcomes. Findings included a statistically significant reduction in average systolic BP (p = 0.012, 95% CI [-21.05, -2.80], and reduction in diastolic BP (p = 0.057, 95% CI [-12.78, 0.191 The average population of the six posts evaluated was 1056 persons, with a yearly medevac rate of 4%. The top four causes of evacuation (excluding OB and prenatal screening were, Orthopedic (31%), Gastrointestinal (16%), Cardiac (9%), and Urologic (9%). Males and females were evacuated in equal proportions (51% and 48%), employees at a higher rate than eligible family members (56% and 44%), and married persons at a greater frequency than single people (48% and 31%). Only 31% of all medevac cases were classified as true emergencies, and only 15% were hospitalized before evacuation. Almost 46% of patients did not receive treatment before evacuation, and a U.S. licensed provider did not evaluate 21% of patients prior to medevac.\nThis study was small and its results should be viewed with caution. Multiple logistic regression analysis determined that a significant association occurred with the odds of not being readmitted after a 7 day follow up appointment was 20 times greater than a patient without 7 day appointment. Age was found to be a significant factor for readmission. For every age a patient was older the odds of being readmitted was increased by a factor of 1.175. Furthermore, patients with social support were 38 times not to be readmitted within 30 days and heart failure was shown to predict readmission by a factor of 62.82.\nCommunity trends in both VL and CD4 for our patients have shown marked improvement over this 13-year period. This is likely due to many factors with ongoing TI and those who underwent TI and were restarted on cART. results: In the non-TI group, 85 children (median age 12 years; age range 1-19; male: female ratio 0.8) were enrolled. The majority of patients were Black (n=55; 65%), born in the US (n=66; 79%), and a large number were African (n=15; 18%). The median age of starting cART was >16 months of age. The median ever achieved maximum CD4 T-cell count was 1516 cells/mm 3 (38%). The TI group enrolled 33 children (median age 15 years; age range 4-18; male: female ratio 1.2). The majority of patients were Black (n=27; 82%) and were born in the US (n=28; 85%). The median age of starting cART was >10 months of age. The median ever achieved maximum CD4 T-cell count was 1490 cells/mm 3 (38%). The median length of treatment before TI was >7 years (range 1 month-16 years). The most common reason for TI was poor adherence to medications (n=16; 44%). The median duration of TI was 16 months (1-53 months). At the cART restart date, the median CD4 T-cell count was 380 cells/mm 3 (20%). The median time to achieve maximum CD4 count after TI was 1 year with an increase to a median of 632 cells/mm3 (25% The long standing recommendation for treating patients with positive PPD post-BCG immunization continues to be the subject of controversy. For many years, clinicians recommended 9-12 months treatment for a positive PPD post-BCG immunization. Many immigrants from Africa, Asia, and Europe received the BCG vaccine as children to prevent tuberculosis. Most of these immigrants test positive for PPD. These patients are always labeled as having latent tuberculosis and given nine months of tuberculosis medication called isoniazid (INH) obJeCtives: To evaluate the recommendation on the use of nine months of treatment for suspected latent tuberculosis after a positive PPD post-BCG immunization. methods: This is a stratify retrospective case control study. People has been randomly selected. The study will be conducted among immigrants from Africa, Asia, and Europe leaving in the United States. The target is to have a sample of about 1,000 peoples by the end of the year. As of now, this is a preliminary result based on a sample of 200 people (120 males and 80 females). All patients in the study have received BCG vaccine in their countries before immigrating to the USA and showing a positive PPD test in the USA. One group received the treatment and another group did not. Two criteria have been taken into consideration when selecting people: their stay in USA and whether they received treatment for tuberculosis or not. One percent of people who did not receive treatment after a + PPD become infected with tuberculosis infections compare to .9 % of people who received nine-month treatment with tuberculosis medication called INH.\nOverall, our data suggests that an alternative apoptosis-triggered replication program appears to be a general feature of the herpesvirus. Cytotoxic therapy is often required to treat neoplasms caused by these viruses including Kaposi's sarcoma and Burkitt's lymphoma caused by KSHV and EBV, respectively. Since cytotoxic therapy is often used to treat herpesvirus-associated cancers, and since cytotoxic agents apparently activate herpesvirus replication, it may prove advantageous to treat patients with antiherpesvirus agents in addition to cytotoxic agents. More than 50% of the cultured cells were BrdU+ in the young mice while less than 30% were positive in the aged mice. Additionally, the tracheal epithelia progenitors from male and female aged mice were dysschronously distributed along the cell cycle (G1, S, G2/M: 40, 15, 45% and 40, 33, 26%, respectively) compared to those from male and female young mice (62, 16, 22% and 61, 11, and 28%, respectively).\nOur data support the concept that aging is sufficient to induce obJeCtives: The aim of this study is to verify the targeting of a complement inhibitor, rEV576, to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) utilizing two reagents, a single chain fragment (scFv) and a peptide (laminin). The inhibitor will function to curtail the activation and complement deposition at the endplate that is seen in MG. methods: C57B1/6J black mice were injected with scFv-rEV576 (400 \u03bcg) or Laminin-rEV576 (200 \u03bcg). Twenty-four hours following the injection animals were sacrificed and tissue was taken for the analysis. Diaphragms from each animal were cryosectioned. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using an antibody to rEV576 to detect the complement inhibitor recombinant protein and bungarotoxin to identify NMJs. Hematoxylin & Eosin stain was performed to look at infiltrates to the NMJ region. To verify the inhibitory activity of rEV576 in vitro analysis by hemolytic assay on sensitized sheep erythrocytes was conducted. In addition, In vivo studies utilizing anti-C5b-9 implemented to confirm the lack of MAC deposition at the NMJs.  Procalcitonin has been shown to be ubiquitously and uniformly expressed in multiple tissues throughout the body in response to a bacterial infection and sepsis. We propose to assess the utility of biomarkers in the circulation as a novel and non-invasive technique for the early identification of hospitalacquired bacterial infection of transcutaneous CVCs. This protocol will be based on the usual practices of clinicians employed during admission and evaluation for patients entering the intensive care setting/ internal medicine ward, when treating physicians deem that an indwelling intravascular device is required for their clinical care. We will prospectively collect samples on consenting adults who have had a CVC placed after admission or transfer to the medical intensive care setting. With prospective observation, we expect that a small percentage of those patients will go on to develop a CVC-related infection or suspected CVCrelated infection. Serial blood samples from the catheters and from the peripheral blood will be drawn from these patients in order to characterize the presence, type and temporal response to treatment of circulating inflammatory biomarkers.  Five microgram of purified IgG neutralized 51.06% of the enzymatic activity of 250ng of Na-APR-1wt. This assay generated an excellent inter-and intra-operator precision with the %CVs < 20. An excellent dose response was also observed. ED50 of 14.15\u03bcg (95%FL = 10.47\u03bcg --18.93\u03bcg) and 11.46\u03bcg (95%FL = 4.86\u03bcg --27.42\u03bcg) was estimated for time 1 and 7 month post manufacture respectively. RP at 7 months was found to be 1.23 (95%FL = 0.792--1.917).\nThese neutralizing antibody and potency assay results of Na-APR-1 M74 vaccine lay the foundation for a Phase 1 Clinical Trial in USA and Brazil. Subsequently, this vaccine will be combined with Necator americanus Glutathione transferase-1 (Na- results: In the HIV positive group, IL-8 was significantly reduced in the CVL of postmenopausal women on HRT (n=7) compared to CVL from premenopausal (n=11) and postmenopausal women (n=11). In the HIV negative group, both MIP3a and HBD-2 were significantly reduced in postmenopausal women (n=11) compared to premenopausal women (n=11). However, no significant alterations in Elafin levels were observed in any of the groups.\nThese results identify which ADL-related SIST-M-IR items are most informative in differentiating CN elderly from MCI, thus helping identify the earliest functional changes in elderly at risk for AD. Overall, refining the sensitivity in clinical assessment tools will help clinicians differentiate those individuals with normal aging from those who are developing cognitive impairment. By distinguishing individuals at early stages of cognitive decline, efforts towards prevention and ultimately treatment of AD will be more effective. As surgical techniques improve, more children are surviving corrective surgery for congenital heart defects. It has been hypothesized that surgery utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can result in neurologic damage due to oxidative stress caused by ischemia-reperfusion and reoxygenation injury of CPB. 1,2 Injection of gamma-glutamylcysteine (GGC), a precursor of glutathione which crosses the blood brain barrier, has been demonstrated to increase levels of glutathione in mice. 3,4 Glutathione (GSH) is known to protect cells from free radical damage. obJeCtive: We set out to determine the tissue concentrations of glutathione achieved in murine brain following injection of GGC intraperitoneally. This was done to determine if GGC could be used therapeutically to protect against neurologic damage from CPB-induced oxidative stress.\nThis brief review demonstrates the deficiency in research of candidate neural biomarkers for the evaluation of mTBI. Although GFAP-BDP shows the most promising results as a neural marker, additional research is required to validate these findings and there are ongoing studies to pursue consistency in the data. The availability of neural biomarkers to accurately characterize traumatic brain injury has multiple benefits besides advantages to diagnosis and prognosis, including healthcare cost reductions, identification in brain injury pathophysiology, and as an additional modality to treatment protocols. Epidemiological studies have shown SO 2 exposure leads to an increase in resting heart rate, which has been hypothesized to be cause by altered autonomic control of cardiovascular function, but the mechanism(s) responsible for these outcomes are unknown. Additionally, while these studies have focused on adult exposures, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has stated that there is a lack of research addressing the health effects of prenatal and neonatal SO 2 exposure. To address this question, a chamber was designed to expose pregnant Sprague Dawley rats to 5 parts per million SO 2 for 1 hour daily throughout gestation and 6 days postnatal. Electrocardiograms were recorded from pups at 5 days postnatal to examine changes in resting heart rate elicited by perinatal SO 2 exposure. In vitro studies employed whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine changes in neurotransmission to cardiac vagal neurons within the nucleus ambiguus upon SO 2 exposure using a preparation maintaining fictive inspiratory activity recorded from the hypoglossal rootlet. Perinatal SO 2 exposure increased heart rate, indicative of a loss of cardioprotective parasympathetic activity. Neither spontaneous nor inspiratory-related inhibitory GABAergic or glycinergic neurotransmission to cardiac vagal neurons was altered by SO 2 exposure. However excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission was decreased by 50.0 percent upon SO 2 exposure. This diminished excitatory neurotransmission was tetrodotoxin-sensitive, indicating SO 2 exposure impairs the activity of preceding glutamatergic neurons that synapse upon cardiac vagal neurons. Additional studies examining SO 2 exposure in the prenatal versus postnatal time periods have shown that postnatal exposure through postnatal day 5 alone elicits the elevated heart rate and loss of glutamatergic neurotransmission to CVNs. These findings demonstrate that a cellular target of SO 2 exposure is a decreased excitatory neurotransmission to CVNs, causing decreased parasympathetic control of resting heart rate, tachycardia, and autonomic imbalance to the heart. They also suggest susceptibility to these health risks are highest during the postnatal time period, indicating there is a need for reducing exposure limits to protect the neonatal population. Prediabetes is a state of high risk of developing diabetes mellitus. It is strongly associated with obesity. Metformin is used in patients with prediabetes to prevent progression to disease and to aid in weight loss. However, the mechanism by which metformin aids in weight loss has not been completely understood. This study examines if its effect on weight is related to Hemoglobin A1c level (Hb A1c). obJeCtive: To determine if the effect of receiving metformin with lifestyle modification counseling on weight in obese prediabetic patients is related to their Hb A1c level. methods: This is a retrospective study. Charts of patients seen in the weight loss clinic at GW Medical Faculty Associates during the period from January 2009 to December 2011 were reviewed. All patients with prediabetes (defined in this study as Hb A1c in the range between 5.7 and 6.4) at the first visit that were receiving metformin during follow up were selected. Patients who didn't return for a second visit, followed up for less than 8 weeks, or were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus were excluded. Data was collected for up to 18 months of follow up. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their HbA1c level on the first visit. High Hb A1c group was composed of patients with 6.0 to 6.4 Hb A1c level, and low Hb A1c group had those with 5.7 to 5.9 Hb A1c level. results: A total of 70 patients met the criteria, 35 in each group. They started with a mean BMI of 41.03 in the high Hb A1c group, and 43.41 in the low Hb A1c group. Follow-up period in the study ranged from 8 weeks to 18 months and the number of visits ranged from 2 to 11 visits. Both groups lost weight with a mean reduction of BMI of 1.40 in the High Hb A1c group, and 1.45 in the low Hb A1c group.\nAlthough OV/OB participants reported a higher percentage of overweight friends, more than half of the NW sample reported their friends would approve of them losing weight. These findings emphasize the need to address perceptions of weight and weight status among both NW and OV/OB college students. The perceptions of weight and weight behaviors on campus may be a precursor for identifying more severe eating pathologies. Limitations of this analysis included a primarily female sample (N=45), a small OW/OB sample (N=7) and selfreported weight data. However, the results of this formative research may lead to the development of a more informed eating pathology screening and obesity treatment programs on college campuses.\nAs providers continue to improve their implementation of the QI guidelines, the measures outlined in the Quality Improvement initiative will establish community-wide improvement in nutrition and wellness. The immediate next steps of the present study will be placement of a provider toolkit in the clinic. The toolkit will be developed based on the answers provided in the provider survey, to address some of the barriers they face in complying with the guidelines. In the District of Columbia, 20 percent of adolescents are obese, and most do not consume the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables. Several individual, social, and environmental factors have been found to impact adolescents' dietary habits. As adolescents spend much of their days in school, the school environment may have an effect on the nutritional habits and overall health of the students.\nThese results do not agree with past studies that found significant associations between school policies and student behaviors. The only significant association does not appear to have a logical correlation and may be the results of a type I error. Limitations to this project include the use of a single school-level policy in analysis as opposed to the interaction or combination of multiple policies, and the self-report nature of the YRBS and possibility of over or underreporting in student behaviors. While the current study did not find any significant and plausible associations between school-level policies and student dietary behaviors, past studies have determined that the school nutrition environment does impact students' behavior. Future research should examine the effects of the interactions of multiple policies on student behavior. To assess the association of parents' educational level on their nutritional and physical activity knowledge. methods: This is a prospective study of 72 participants from a nutrition and wellness program targeting parents of African American preschoolers. Sociodemographic, child's nutritional and physical exercise habit survey and anthropometric data were collected from all participants at baseline. results: 77% of the participants were grandmothers or mothers; the mean age was 44.8 and 13% of participants were college graduates. 66% were obese. The mean scores for nutrition and physical activity knowledge were 41 % and 58%, respectively. 89% of the participants reported that their children exercised at least once a week. 51% of the participants' children drink soda or sweetened beverages. Mothers' educational level was significantly associated with nutrition knowledge (p =.01).\nLarger sample size and longer time evaluation are needed to assess the association and impact of maternal education on between parents' knowledge of physical activity and nutrition and their children's behavior. Parents play an instrumental role in modeling their children's health behaviors and exposing them to new foods, and engaging them in physical activities. obJeCtive: To assess the association of parents' educational level on their nutritional and physical activity knowledge. methods: This is a prospective study of 72 participants from a nutrition and wellness program targeting parents of African American preschoolers. Sociodemographic, child's nutritional and physical exercise habit survey and anthropometric data were collected from all participants at baseline. results: 77% of the participants were grandmothers or mothers; the mean age was 44.8 and 13% of participants were college graduates. 66% were obese. The mean scores for nutrition and physical activity knowledge were 41 % and 58%, respectively. 89% of the participants reported that their children exercised at least once a week. 51% of the participants' children drink soda or sweetened beverages. Mothers' educational level was significantly associated with nutrition knowledge (p =.01).\nLarger sample size and longer time evaluation are needed to assess the association and impact of maternal education on between parents' knowledge of physical activity and nutrition and their children's behavior. is proving to be vast and varied. However, other interesting data have emerged. In addition to the survey-based data, a sub-group of the study participants with ASD (n=60) completed an art therapy measure, the Face Stimulus Assessment (FSA;Betts, 2003).  Group Photo Therapy for At-risk Adolescent Girls The 2011 DC Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation Report called for a higher demand for mentorship and youth-specific programs that support interaction with peers. Multi-dimensional approaches to improving the well-being of youth that incorporate the art therapies have emerged to meet this need. Research in this area indicates that using photography as a therapeutic tool for adolescents may help teens increase self-worth, safely experience their emotions, and receive social support. While there is extensive literature narrating the benefits of photography in therapy through case examples, within the scope of current empirical research on the use of creative therapies with adolescent issues, photography is rarely considered. Therefore, the present study is investigating the effects of group photo therapy in a program for at-risk adolescent females. This program was developed through collaboration with a local non-profit organization that provides services for at-risk youth. Such factors that contribute to at-risk status for these participants include poverty, low self-esteem, poor self-efficacy, depression, self-destructive behaviors, and poor school performance. As such, the present study is examining whether the at-risk adolescent females' participation in the group photo therapy sessions has an effect on their mood, sense of self-efficacy, and social connectedness. Data being collected reflect the process and outcomes of participation in weekly photo therapy sessions for a duration of 10 weeks. Data sources include participants' journals, photographs, self-reflection questionnaires, transcriptions and field notes from photo therapy sessions. In addition, three instruments are being administered pre-and post-intervention: the CES Depression Inventory, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and The Hemingway Measure of Adolescent Connectedness. Preliminary data will be presented, reflecting any changes in participants' self-reported levels of depression, self-efficacy and social connectedness. Pertinent themes that emerge within the sessions will be reported, and the efficacy of photography as a tool to express identity, experience, and underlying conflicts and emotions will be discussed. Results of this study may demonstrate the benefits of photo therapy with at-risk female adolescents. Furthermore, the study results may provide an opportunity to gain awareness of the value of photography as a therapeutic tool in exploring topics relevant to adolescent development, and contribute to the continued exploration of effective interventions for improving adolescent transition to adulthood. Measuring trauma and stressful events in childhood and adolescence among patients with first-episode psychosis: Initial factor structure, reliability, and validity of the Trauma Experiences Checklist (TEC) baCKground: A history of trauma and stressful events, especially in childhood and adolescence, is common among individuals with serious mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Traumatic experiences are thought to be a socio-environmental risk factor not only for poorer outcomes, but also potentially for the onset of these disorders, perhaps mediated by perturbations in dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic system. To further advance understandings of the association between childhood/adolescent traumatic experiences and serious mental illnesses like the psychotic disorders, improved measurement tools are needed.\nThe TEC is a potentially useful tool in assessing traumatic life events across various social contexts during childhood and adolescence, and may help to advance measurement in this burgeoning area of research. The dominant American culture understands sexuality on a polarized system. This simplification labels people as heterosexual or non-heterosexual. And, the system relies on labeling individuals based on sexual behaviors, which limits the complexity of sexual minorities and categorizes people as abnormal, or differing from social norms. Many seek justification by searching for determinants of sexuality to reduce marginalization. Research has shown marginalization produces higher stress, which contributes to the prevalence of mental health disorders and substance abuse among sexual minorities (King et al., 2008;Meyer et al., 2008;Hatzenbuehler, 2009). The aim of this narrative inquiry is to explore the What demographic, socio-environmental, and substance use-related factors predict duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and is DUP associated with neurocognition in first-episode psychosis? baCKground: Early intervention and prevention for psychotic disorders is of increasing importance to the mental health community. One way to advance early intervention is to better understand factors driving the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), which has been linked to significantly poorer outcomes across multiple domains, including poorer prognosis and more severe symptoms. Research has shown that there are multiple risk factors that contribute to longer DUP: single marital status (Pek et al., 2006), living in poverty (Compton et al., 2011), a greater severity of negative symptoms (Boonstra et al., 2012), and most importantly, a gradual mode of onset of psychosis. obJeCtives: This study aimed to reinforce previously studied predictors of DUP, examine never-yet-studied predictors, and assess the relationship between DUP and neurocognition. Neurocognition is important because it could be a link between psychosis and neurotoxicity explaining the established association between DUP and poorer outcomes (Perkins et al., 2005). Furthering the understanding of risk factors, such as premorbid adversity or gradual onset, could inform interventions focused on those at greatest risk for long periods of treatment delay. Examining novel factors, such as incarceration or childhood maltreatment, allow for a fuller understanding of DUP and a more directed approach to future research.\nRise in Cr is common in hospitalized children, especially critically ill children. The objectives of this literature review are to identify factors that support breastfeeding from birth until after hospital discharge in high-risk infants. This paper examines four time points: initiation of breast milk expression, maintenance of breast milk supply, transition to breastfeeding directly and post discharge follow-up and support. The paper also discusses what WIC is doing and what they can improve to prevent poor pregnancy outcomes and support breastfeeding in high-risk infants and their mothers.\nMultiple factors contribute to successful breastfeeding in high-risk infants. Breastfeeding promotion programs and lactation counseling influence both initiation and duration of breastfeeding in NICU infants. Peer counseling also has a significant influence on duration of breast milk expression.  The third stage of labor refers to the period between delivery of the baby and complete expulsion of the placenta. Although there is no standard definition of early versus delayed umbilical cord clamping, recent randomized controlled trials demonstrate benefits for both term and preterm infants from delayed cord clamping. Even a brief delay in cord clamping results in placental transfusion, giving the term neonate approximately 30% more blood volume and the preterm as much as 50%, thereby substantially increasing iron stores within the first few months of life. ConClusions: Delayed cord clamping is rarely practiced despite substantial current evidence in its favor. Many professional organizations even recommend delaying cord clamping as part of their guidelines for the active management of the third stage of labor. Therefore, a change in practice is called for. To determine the efficacy and cost effectiveness of the standard prenatal care offered in Nicaragua and the United States. methods: In a comparative study of standard prenatal care in Nicaragua with the prenatal care in the U.S., the number of appointments, the types of tests/ screenings, the frequency of tests/screenings, and the maternal and neonatal mortality rates were compared. Data concerning prenatal care was collected from a U.S. obstetric gynecologist and a Nicaraguan government nurse and doctor in the respective countries. The mortality rates used were provided by The World Bank 1,2 . results to date: Standard prenatal care in Nicaragua recommended fewer appointments for pregnant mothers than U.S. standard care. In March 2012, the Nicaraguan government implemented a reduction of the recommended appointments from nine to six, whereas in the U.S., standard care provides mothers with at least 11 visits. Additionally, due to the different living conditions, there are some differences in tests/screenings performed in each country, and overall, the U.S. performs more screenings on mothers. For example, in Nicaragua, it is standard to screen expectant mothers for Toxoplasmosis due to general inadequate sanitation. Furthermore, in the U.S., screenings for the mother and fetus for genetic diseases are available; however these resources are limited in Nicaragua, and not even available in Las Salinas.\nMany unaccounted factors have interfered with the ability to make concrete conclusions about the efficacy and cost effectiveness of standard prenatal care in Nicaragua and the U.S. relative to one another. For example, the data collection in Nicaragua was completed primarily in Las Salinas, a very small and rural town not representative of all of Nicaragua. The differences in access to healthcare were another important factor. First, unlike the United States, the healthcare provided at the Nicaraguan government health posts are covered by government subsidies. Theoretically, this allows all pregnant mothers prenatal care, regardless of family income. However, transportation to these government clinics is another issue. While there is a public transportation system in the bigger cities, many patients are hindered by the limited transportation options. Therefore, though the standard of care recommends 6 appointments, the significant inconvenience of getting to the clinic reduced the actual number of visits for many women. Furthermore, the clinic did not have a phone and many patients also did not have phones. If the patient needed to contact the doctor or the nurse, they needed to find them in person or have their personal cell phone numbers.\nGiven that this is the largest study worldwide comparing vitrification to slow freeze cryopreservation embryos, there is substantial evidence to support the superiority of vitrification over slow freeze technology. All treatment outcomes were consistently and substantially better for vitrification compared to slow freeze embryos. The transition in protocols implemented at Shady Grove Fertility Center and other fertility centers around the world thus has important beneficial clinical consequences for patients in terms of treatment outcomes, risk factors, time investment, and cost.\nThese study findings do not offer conclusive evidence that participation in the dipo increases the risk of early sexual debut among initiated versus uninitiated Krobo females. Study findings suggest the reduction in age of dipo eligibility may increase the likelihood of sexual debut following the ceremony. Participants who received the rite as toddlers had a greater length of time between the dipo and adulthood to become sexually active post-initiation than females who were initiated during their late teens/early twenties. In order for the efforts of the public health community to be successful, it is critical for the public to improve their understanding of their health and make informed health decisions. It is imperative to increase the utilization of reputable online resources for sexual health information among adults age 22 to 35 years of age. The Internet is a widely used venue for accessing sexual health information, yet we do not know how this population uses the Internet to access sexual health resources.\nAs a result of the popularity of mobile devices, health information websites need to ensure their websites are easily accessible on mobile devices. Government domains (.gov) need an online presence that contains scientific data presented at a lower reading level. Incorporating symptom checkers specific to sexual health, or online games related to sexual health, will encourage men to engage in online health media. Finally, in order to address women's concerns with their fertility, websites must tailor their message towards reproductive choice and preventing pregnancy right now."}, {"section_title": "results:", "text": "Dex decreased the promoter activity of MUC5AC, but did not alter the promoter activity of the full length MUC5B(4.1kb)-luc construct. However, Dex increased the activity of the 2140 deletion construct, which has several GRE sites.\nThe structures reveal that R298 implicated in the disorders is part of a putative conduit that transverses the Nt. The conduit opens to the transmembrane domain (TMD) on one end and an apparent foyer entrance on the opposite end. The naturally occurring mutation R298S disrupts an electrostatic pocket within the conduit that disables substrate binding. We also report similar conducts in family member AE1 (Band 3) when exploring its crystal structure. Further, we identify by biophysical analyses on a truncated Nt that the autoregulatory domain (ARD) at the N-terminus of the Nt is responsible for self-associations.\nWe have sequenced 65 samples by targeted sequencing and 42 samples by exome sequencing. Targeted sequencing showed lower exon drop-out rates compared to exome sequencing (2% instead of 10%). Depth of coverage varied from 50X -5000X for targeted sequencing and 20X -50X for exome sequencing depending on the number of samples pooled, and instrument used for sequencing. We showed an example of a case where a homozygous mutation in dysferlin gene (known muscular dystrophy gene) was missed by exome sequencing and detected by targeted sequencing. On the other hand, we were able to identify mutations in a novel gene through exome sequencing: GDPmannose pyrophosphorylase B (GMPPB) associated with congenital and limb girdle muscular dystrophy.\nCorneal reepithelialization on day 1 showed that rabbits in group A (treated) had an average epithelial defect of 9.25 mm 2 and group B (untreated) had a defect of 12.05 mm 2 , not a statistically significant difference. H & E stained sections showed the expected responses of stromal fibroblasts to debridement injury in both groups. Epithelial thickness and stromal cell counts on both groups 20 days after injury showed no significant statistical differences. At 24 hours and 20 days after injury, analyses show that CAP-treatment increased fibronectin deposition in the anterior stroma and aSMA localization within stromal fibroblasts; quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence data will be needed to determine whether these differences are significant.  The overarching goal of our research is to present an efficient and automated method of quantifying secondary flow structures in blood flow through curved arteries. The results from application of this method will deepen our understanding of the dynamics of arterial blood flow and eventually help improve stent design. motivation for the researCh: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US, and as such, is an important problem. The biological mechanisms that affect cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms, are known to be influenced by the behavior of secondary flows in curved arteries, and their interactions with stents. As such, a better understanding of this type of flow is necessary. This need, coupled with the richness in fluid dynamics and the kaleidoscope of secondary flow structures encountered in blood flowing through curved arteries serves as motivation for this research. Terabytes of data are generated from running the in vitro experiments for relatively short periods of time. This has necessitated the development of an automated method for efficient analysis of the data. researCh method / approaCh: Arterial blood flow was studied in an experiment using a bent pipe as a model for a curved artery. Carotid artery flow rate was generated using a physiological waveform input in a programmable pump. Flow visualization was performed using particle image velocimetry (2C-2D PIV) technique, which yielded velocity vector fields. Vorticity fields were acquired and then post-processed using continuous wavelet transforms to detect coherent structures (vortices) in the secondary flow. At this stage, 'Boundary Tracing', a new automated method of detecting and isolating coherent vortical structures based on 'Otsu's Method', was used to further process the data. In addition to isolating the structures, the method also generated metrics such as count of structures detected, scale of these structures, and information about circulation. This process was repeated at different instances of time across the physiological waveform, allowing characterization of the evolution of the periodic secondary flow, as a function of time. researCh results: Various metrics for the flow were generated across the entire physiological waveform. These data were used to create histograms and plots, helping visualize the behavior of the flow as a function of time. Significant activity was observed in the flow during its acceleration and deceleration phases. High vortical structure counts were also observed during the deceleration phases. researCh ConClusions: The research has provided new insight into the dynamics of arterial flow. The automated method was successfully developed and implemented, leading to efficient processing of large amounts of PIV data, and generation of useful metrics that help characterize the flow. This method also enables generation of more accurate regime maps, plots that help visually characterize the flow. These improved regime maps have the potential of improving stent design. imbalances in pressure gradients and centrifugal forces [1,2] . The analytical procedures to predict secondary flow structures are complicated, requiring solution of governing Navier-Stokes equations in toroidal co-ordinates and asymptotic theories [2,3] . This research sought to explore whether or not a construct could be created for osteochondral tissue regeneration that could support and encourage stem cell growth and differentiation, while also maintaining structural integrity, and even produce improved mechanical strength. motivation for the researCh: The osteochondral region of the knee or other articulate joints consists of several layers of cartilage consisting of different material orientation and structure and a bone layer. In native tissue these layers for a strong, continuous tissue interface. In the field of regenerative medicine, efforts to create tissue engineering scaffolds for osteochondral repair have encountered problems with replicating the bone-cartilage interface. These scaffolds consist of materials of different internal structure, or of different materials altogether, and often such scaffolds fail at the interface region. This research is intended to present a design solution to this problem by utilizing 3D printing to print anisotropic, yet continuous structures that have two distinct, biomimetic layers and additional support features to improve compressive and shear strength. researCh method/approaCh: For the 3D printed osteochondral scaffolds, constructs were designed using Rhinoceros 3D modeling package. Scaffolds were then printed in groups of six using a PrinterBot 3D printing system modified with a 347 \u00b5m diameter nozzle, and a spool of 1.75 mm diameter Poly lactic acid (PLA) polymer. 3D models were converted into a gcode instruction file using Slic3r, and then used to instruct the printer via the Pronterface software package. There were a total of six experimental groups designed: (1) homogenous cross-hatched structures; (2) bi-phasic structures consisting of a cross hatched pattern and an intersecting rings structures; and (3) biomimetic bi-phasic structures with key features; each of the structure with large and small pore features. In addition, we applied a collagen type II coating on the printed scaffolds to further improve their cytocompatibility properties. A protocol for chemically functionalized attachment known as acetylation was utilized. As opposed to a chemical process, hydrogen-treated MWCNT used in previous study were also attached to scaffolds using absorption. All mechanical tests were done using and ATS axial tester, a 50 Newton load cell and compression placard. When 3D printed scaffolds were coated, the surfaces of poly-L-lysine nanotube and acetylated collagen constructs were also evaluated using a SEM. All cellular studies used human bone marrow derived MSCs cultured in cell culture media. Once all the scaffolds were fabricated and modified, a proliferation study was conducted. researCh results: All of the scaffolds showed excellent mechanical properties similar to or exceeding cartilage (.75 to 1 MPa) and subchondral bone (30 to 50 Mpa) in human osteochondral tissue. Under compressive loading, the biphasic key models both in small and large feature have the highest modulus when compared to the homogeneous controls and the bi-phasic models. The proliferation study result showed on day one, with slightly greater cellular activity on bi-phasic scaffolds when compared to homogenous control groups. More importantly, our result shows that all of the biphasic scaffolds with small features can significantly promote MSC proliferation after 5 days. Based on table 4, these biphasic scaffolds with smaller feature attain increased surface area and greater feature density, thus providing a more advantageous environment for cellular growth. Furthermore, the scaffolds with acetylated collagen and poly-L-lysine coated H2 treated MWCNTs outperformed all other groups, which shows that nanostructured surface morphology and chemical modification can greatly increase MSC proliferation researCh ConClusion: This study yielded a series of biomimetic and bi-phasic constructs that had excellent mechanical properties, cytocompatibility and anatomical shape for musculoskeletal tissue engineering applications. This study showed that, through modification of the initial design parameters, the surface area, pore density and number of internal features could be easily controlled to yield desirable MSC activity. It was also demonstrated that the design of both a bi-phasic construct and that of a mechanically enhanced key structure increased cellular activity, and the addition of an internal key feature enhanced the mechanical characteristics of the scaffold when compared to homogenous control scaffolds. Finally, chemical and nano-constituent modification showed that the addition of collagen and poly-L-lysine coated MWCNTs further enhanced MSC proliferation in vitro.    The formation of cysts (fluid-filled distensions) and polyps (more fibrous distensions) on the vocal folds is one of several causes of voice pathologies diagnosed by physicians in clinics each year. In the US alone, it is estimated that 28 million people suffer from voice problems, costing approximately $2billion annually [Verdolini, 2001], and out of a sample of 1,262 patients, 11.4% were diagnosed with polyps and 1% with cysts (7.9% were diagnosed as normal) [Herrington-Hall et al., 1988]. These pathologies present patients with significant, and in some cases chronic, difficulties with verbal communication and expression, causing a marked decrease in their quality of life. obJeCtive: It is our aim to measure the forces acting on the vocal folds during contact in an artificial model with physiological properties, which will be used to improve models of vocal fold tissue interaction and better understand the formation of cysts and polyps in patients.\nOur results show that CAP enhanced the migration rate of AuNPs. In specific, the number of nanoparticles penetrated into the cells was greater if AuNPs were applied after 60s plasma treatment.\nA majority (>50%) of TCR vlo CD8 + T cells displayed a phenotype of CD44 hi , CXCR3 hi , Gr1 hi , GITR hi , CD69 lo , CD25 lo , CD49d lo which is consistent with the marker pattern for endogenous memory T cells. This phenotype is not observed in the thymus, but occurs after thymic egress and was documented in peripheral tissues (spleen and lymph nodes), as well as in the bone marrow of these mice. Our preliminary tumor studies suggest that mice bearing TCR vlo CD8 + T cells delayed subcutaneous B16 melanoma growth compared to wildtype animals.\nMale Dendritic cells in culture with HY specific CD8 T cells (positive control) induce high levels of IFN-g and low levels of IL10 as expected. Male B cells in culture with HY CD8 T cells (negative control) did not induce significant IFN-g or IL10 production. Male Pre-B ALL in presence of HY CD8 T cells induced significantly lower levels of IFN-g, but higher levels of IL-10. Female Pre-B ALL in culture with HY specific CD8 T cells does not induce significant IFN-g or IL10 production, suggesting the effect is antigen-specific.\nRats in the control group had a median survival of 11 days, while those in the 2-DG Day 0 and 2-DG Day 5 had median survivals of 18 days (p<0.009 vs. control) and 17 days (p<0.0461 vs. control), respectively.\nControl animals had a median survival of 13 days. The treatment group that received rapamycin five days after tumor implantation had a median survival of 18 days (p=.0003 vs. control) with an increase in survival of 38%.The treatment group that received rapamycin on day 0 had a median survivals of 27 (p<.0001 vs. control), increasing survival by 108%.\nBlacks developed CML more than 7 years earlier than Whites with markedly different age distributions at diagnosis. Black Males exhibited a bi-modal distribution with an early (peak at 40 years) and late onset CML (peak at 58 years) while White Males had an early peak (37 years) followed by a more pronounced peak at age 73. Blacks had higher age-adjusted incidence rates corresponding to a Black:White incidence rate ratio of 1.10 (95% CI, 1.02-1.08) for males and 1.08 (95% CI, 1.00-1.17) for females. We observed interactions between race and age; age-specific incidence rates were higher among Blacks diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 49 after which rates were higher for Whites. The incidence rate cross-over between Blacks and Whites was robust to adjustment for calendar period and birth cohort effects (Black vs. White female: p=0.0220; Black vs. White male: p=0.0125).\nAs compared to men from the general population, men referred for borderline testosterone levels had higher rates of sexual dysfunction, overweight/obesity, and depression. In men with initial borderline total testosterone measurements, 48% had a repeat low total testosterone and 25% had a low bioavailable testosterone using the lower limits of the reference intervals for the assays used.\nA total of 138 ketamine infusions were administered to 46 patients with severe neuropathic pain. The total dose of ketamine infused ranged from 36 mg to 510 mg. The vast majority of patients showed small (<20%) changes in hemodynamic, respiratory and oxygenation parameters. 40 patients showed SBP increases of less than 20% from baseline and 32 showed SBP increases of less than 10% from baseline. There was a strong association between ketamine dose and highest SBP increase (p <0.01). An increase of greater than 20% from baseline was seen in 6 patients, 3 of which were in the highest dose group (>0.9 mg/kg/hr). Increased HR was associated with higher doses (p<0.05). Patients in the highest dose range had a maximum HR increase of 20% or more. However, across all dose ranges, 78% of patients experienced less than 10% increase above baseline and 84% (36 patients) had less than 20% increase. All patients had a baseline SAS score of 4 (calm, cooperative). The lowest SAS score for all patients during the infusions was 3 (sedated, easily arousable). Pain scores decreased from 6.5 \u00b1 2.4 on Day 1 pre-infusion to 3.1 \u00b1 2.2 on Day 3 post-infusion. The 95% confidence interval was 2.8 to 4.1 points on the pain scale (p<.0001).\nLowest doses occurred for CT-guided biopsy, where median DLP was 268, 302 and 296 mGy-cm in thoracic, abdominal and pelvic biopsies, respectively. Highest median DLPs occurred in abdominal and pelvic ablations, where median doses of 1223 mGy-cm (range 229-8472) and 3302 mGy-cm (range 282-8427) were observed, respectively. For biopsies and drainages, more dose was accumulated from pre-and post-procedure scanning than from scanning during the procedure. For ablations, more dose was accumulated from scans obtained for procedural guidance. The mean effective dose for all cases was 8 mSv with a range of 1 to 160 mSv. Across institutions, the least variable doses were observed for thoracic drainage (11-fold variability) while the most variable doses were for abdominal drainage (74-fold variability).\nAll patients had a GMFCS score of \u22654. The average follow up was 2.2 years. The average MI for the entire group improved from 57 to 20 (p<0.0001). Of those patients who had all radiographic abnormalities addressed at surgery, 91% had a final MI of < 25%. In those patients who did not have all radiographic abnormalities addressed, only 33% had a MI < 25% at final follow up. There were no intra-operative complications, however 13 patients had at least one post-op complication (6: persistent hip pain, 5: skin ulceration, 2: heterotopic ossification, 1: post-op fracture).\nDuring the time period studied, 1099 filters had been inserted and 272 filters were removed for an overall removal rate of 24.75%. The highest retrieval rate was in 2010 in which 34.25% of the filters inserted were removed. The retrieval rates of filters inserted in 2011 and 2012 will continue to increase as patients have enough time to come back in and get them removed. The most common reason for filter placement was future gastric bypass surgery, which accounted for 44.45% of the filters inserted. Other common reasons for filter insertion were: pre-operative, post-operative, injury, and current PE or deep vein thrombosis. Out of the 272 filters that were removed, 44 were noted to be tilted, 20 had been endothelialized, 11 had fractured, 8 had migrated and 8 had perforated the IVC. There were also 10 unsuccessful filter removals due to severe endothelialization within the IVC.\nOf the 21 chronic pain patients interviewed, there were 15 females and 6 males. The PCS total score was found to be higher in younger adults than in older adults with a correlation coefficient of -0.43. Pain intensity and knowledge of causality was found to have correlation coefficient of 0.38 and -0.39, respectively when compared with the PCS total score. The PCS total score was found to have poor correlation (0.13) with duration of pain.\nFor the clinician instructors, with the number of evaluations returned (n) equaling 277, the average mean and standard deviation per question on the 5-point Likert scale was 4.84\u00b10.42. For the anatomist instructors, n=159, the average mean and SD was 4.72\u00b10.58. The data demonstrated a slight, although non-statistically significant preference of the students to the clinicians' teaching. No major statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups of instructors with respect to preparation and knowledge. The two evaluation questions that resulted in a statistical significance were \"Did the teacher present the information in an organized fashion?\" and \"Do you feel that ultrasound is helpful with understanding the anatomy?\" with p\u22640.001 for both. Furthermore, the data show an increase in positive student responses to the anatomy faculty instruction as the sessions progressed, corresponding with the increased comfort level of the anatomists in teaching using ultrasound. This phenomenon is further reinforced by the qualitative data.\nOver 87% of students were able to identify cross sections of structures on computed tomography scan. Students preformed similarly well discussing breast anatomy with 92% of students answering questions correctly. Around 60% of students were able to answer questions about the abdomen and vertebral landmarks correctly. Retention of vasculature, inguinal and peripheral neural anatomy was poor, with only 45%, 44% and 32% of students answering respective questions correctly. Only 56% of students correctly answered questions concerning the anatomy of the uterus and fallopian tubes, and 51% had knowledge of pelvic vasculature. Students scored significantly lower in knowledge of lymphatic drainage of the pelvis (10.7%) and embryology (44.6 %). Having had a prior surgical rotation, such as obstetrics and gynecology, did not improve students' anatomy knowledge at the beginning of the general surgery rotation as compared to having no prior surgical experience (p = 0.25).\nThree main themes emerged from our study. First, abundant life experience influences students' perception of their role on clinical rotations. A mature student explained, \"\u2026having kids\u2026 being married and divorced\u2026 helps in connecting with patients.\" Previous work experience shapes expectations as a physician-in-training. While traditional students tend to be \"intimidated,\" mature students desire to \"take the initiative.\" Age plays a role in the students' ability to relate to senior team members, as well as medical student colleagues. Traditional students note that mature students are \"more realistic\" due to their \"life experience in the workplace.\"\nOur financial analysis showed Step 2CS cost medical students an estimated total of $157,754,600 by 2011. Of the Student Affairs Deans that were interviewed, there were a variety of opinions. Some stated Step 2CS has helped medical schools improve clinical competency and helped drive curriculum. Another interviewee noted that this exam helped with funding for a comprehensive OSCE. Several Deans however feel that the exam is unnecessary; adding to students' debt, adding more stress to fourth year, being scheduling burden, and is redundant since a comprehensive OSCE is already in place. No Dean reported having a student that did not eventually pass, our current data shows a 99.7% passing rate. Additionally, almost all Deans agreed that they have a comprehensive OSCE in place for third/ fourth year medical students, and that they did not find the NBME score sheet helpful.\nAs a foreigner, I first learned basic words and phrases and how to understand the Thai culture. Almost all professors and students can speak English. However, most patients, and general public don't speak any English. It is not traditional to hug or shake hands. The traditional Thai greeting is called a \"whi\", where you put your palms together in a prayer-like gesture and bow to the person. Students are very soft spoken and it is perfectly acceptable to laugh or giggle with the professor and in front of the patient. I witnessed the Doctor-patient relationship in Thailand first hand. There is no patient confidentiality in Thailand, but it maximizes time and space. There are generally 2 people interviewed within one outpatient room, and all patients share one room when in-patient. For the most part, international students cannot communicate directly with the patients because of the language barrier. I could communicate with the physicians, but learned to speak slowly, and be patient when misunderstood. Thailand medical practice greatly differs from the US. While medical school in America is 4 years, it is 6 years in Thailand, and therefore students go straight from high school. George Washington University gets about 10 cadavers donated a year, while KKU has around 50 donated for the orthopedic residents alone. Between all the departments 7,500 bodies are donated each year. The OR in Thailand is different from America in many ways. First, the scrubbing-in technique is different. In America the scrubbers you use are disposed after one use, but in Thailand they can be autoclaved and reused. In Thailand you wear communal sandals in the OR. Lastly, everything in America is disposable with a one-time use: gloves, gown, instruments etc. In Thailand, everything can be reused. The gloves used during surgery are opened for the first time, but once you are finished with them you put them in a re-use bucket where they are cleaned and used for non-sterile techniques.\nThe AUBMC ED is similar to a U.S. university hospital ED; the most prominent difference is that patients must pay for any required laboratory test or medicine before it is administered. The AUB medical students, who effortlessly switched between Arabic, English, and French, seemed to have very similar training to GW medical students. The community resources we visited with the Family Medicine rotation were impressive; the children's school, for example, had computers operated by breath and laser gait analysis. The LAU VOC was a basic facility located in an extremely impoverished and neglected community. Still, I came away impressed by the dedication of the physicians who staff the clinic, as well as with the fact that these visits are required for LAU medical students.\nThe saur's origins are rooted in three concepts: vulnerability, pollution, and consideration, which are reinforced for by tradition. These concepts contribute to the strict rules for entrance and exit into the saur. Although the exit of the newborn from confinement and the entry of others into confinement are strictly regulated, neither is entirely prohibited. The Saur is actually porous. Families will only allow access to the newborn to members who they believe will help the child in the cultural paradigm of illness, which is evil spirits. Negotiation into Saur was the critical part of the Shivgarh intervention.\nThe survey compiled contained 140 questions and addressed over 10 different aspects of adolescent sexual health. From familial environment, economic status, and sexual education to religion, psychosocial conditions, and knowledge of contraception, abstinence, and the act of sexual intercourse, the questionnaire tried to address the adolescent's outlook on sexual health. Ultimately, the survey was given to local physicians in order to initiate research in the community, with the discretion to modify the survey as needed to best serve the community and research.\nPreliminary data analysis reveals differences in the drawings by village but not by age or sex. The drawings from the villages with more intervention and education activities showed greater knowledge of a number of themes in comparison to villages with less Chagas intervention activities. By April of this year, data analysis and summary of findings will be complete.\nRespondents described newly gained confidence, stating that their minds \"woke up\" and that they no longer feared speaking up. This confidence resulted from the process of earning and managing their own money. Moreover, the use of group meetings by NGOs enabled women to interact with other women outside the home, creating further opportunities for sharing and learning. Women also discussed the importance of family, both in terms of the support required to ensure their continued participation with income generation as well as the motivation instilled to gain enough income and secure education for their children. obJeCtives: This study seeks to explore the impact of measures of women's autonomy on women's attitudes towards FGC and having a daughter circumcised.\nInitially, words articulated in PIA to involve the community alienated men as perpetrators of violence, and did not consider their potential as partners in prevention. This problem is slowly being addressed by changing rhetoric from \"violence against women\" to \"GBV\" and emphasizing men's roles as partners, not perpetrators. Additionally, the process use in evaluation methodology seemed to encourage many of the participants during interviews to rethink their roles and responsibilities in PIA and re-energize their desire to end GBV through PIA. However, the Network has taken too much control over the intervention, with little consideration of the concerns and suggestions of community-organizers, which discourages them from working together to address challenges.\nOf 113 participants, 96% stated that they felt completely or mostly prepared and 4% reported feeling unprepared to care for their child upon discharge. All felt completely or mostly prepared to explain the hospital course to their child's pediatrician. 69% stated that they were completely confident filling out medical forms by themselves, which was a surrogate for health literacy. Discordant information between the participant and the medical record for hospital events most often pertained to non-serum laboratory testing (37%). Discordant information between the participant and the documented discharge plan most often involved follow up appointments with subspecialists (13%) and the type of new medications to begin at discharge (16%). There were no significant differences in discordance between participants whose child was admitted to a team comprised of trainees or to an attending-only service.\nStatistical analysis revealed knowledge gaps among APRNs in all five HL content areas. There were no associations between APRN knowledge and years' experience in the APRN role, age of the APRN, or with most educational preparations. The APRNs enrolled in terminal degree programs had statistically significant higher scores regarding HL knowledge than study subjects not enrolled in these programs.\nDuring the DCCT, current smokers had consistently higher HbA1c values compared with former and never smokers (0.35% mean difference vs. never smokers; 0.29% mean difference vs. former smokers). Additionally, current smokers had a 42% higher risk of retinopathy and 34% higher risk of nephropathy compared with never smokers. The significant associations between smoking and complications were fully attenuated after adjusting for HbA1c. Former smokers did not differ significantly from never smokers with respect to HbA1c and the risk of complications.\nAmong all posts 47% were related to specific public health themes: socioeconomic status (3%), weight or body image dissatisfaction (3%), loneliness/ depression (3%), drugs or alcohol (7%), relationships (14%), sex or sexuality (17%). Other themes included life as a varsity athlete, grades, residence life, Greek life, and religious beliefs.\nThe search resulted in eight studies that looked at the effects of ART on sperm parameters. Looking across the studies, there is suggestion that ART has a greater impact on sperm parameters than HIV. Of the eight studies, only one of those studies looked directly at chromosomal abnormalities, while the others focused on sperm parameters as defined by the World Health Organization. Only one found a positive association between ART and semen parameters. One study suggests that ART improves the outcome of IUI and sperm washing. One study suggests that HAART may improve semen parameters but states that the study was too short to see the potential detrimental effects. The remaining five studies saw negative relationships between ART and semen parameters, one of which suggests that ART is toxic to gametes and can cause mitochondrial damage.\nAs of the study midpoint, roughly two-thirds (64%) of participants reported using a smartphone, while 36% admitted to using a feature phone. Those who had quit versus not quit smoking on their scheduled quit date was almost evenly split, with 47% not quitting and 53% quitting. Despite the fact that the majority of participants admitted to quitting on their quit date, 59% still smoke either \"everyday\" or \"somedays,\" while 41% say they don't smoke at all. Overall, the participants rated the text messaging program a 3.8 out of 5. The majority would \"highly recommend\" the text messages and phone counseling separately to a friend, 68% and 77%, respectively, a figure that increased to 100% when the two services were combined. The website did not appear to be a useful service for the participants. While each of the services individually and collectively was well-received, participants did note that they would have preferred fewer texts and texts with more variety, but they didn't specify at what point in time. Only two participants, however, remarked that they had stopped the texts altogether.\nRanging from 575 persons in 1999 to 854 in 2011, a total of 1,814 individuals had one or more paired tests (~ 25,000 total). Final VL decreased by 86 copies/ml annually and final CD4 increased by 16 cells/\u00b5L ( Fig. 1A) with correlations (R 2 ) from second-order polynomial regressions of 0.94 ( Fig. 1B) and 0.84 (Fig. 1C), respectively, for the monthly means. The percentage of veterans with viral loads below the lower limit of quantitation rose from 29% to 72%, while the percentage of veterans with CD4 <200 cells/\u00b5L dropped from 31% to 11%.\nPreliminary results indicate there are more mentions of HIV/AIDS in African American women's magazines than in mainstream magazines. HIV/AIDS is usually mentioned in the context of global helath in mainstream magazine's Data collection and analysis are currently underway and will be completed by the presentation date. This research is being completed in partial fulfillment of Ms. Davis' MPH requirements.\nWe found that \"participating in games that involve retrieving words\" (p=0.0001), \"navigating to unfamiliar areas\" (p=0.001), \"performing mental tasks involved in a former primary job\" (p=0.002), and \"fixing things or finishing projects\" (p=0.002) best discriminated between CN and MCI subjects with MCI subjects performing worse than CN.\nA total of 411 adult participants completed the patient survey; 11% were morbidly obese, 31% obese, 30% overweight, 24% normal weight and 3% underweight. Fifty-nine percent reported BMI understanding as not at all, not well or unsure, whereas 41% reported well or very well, with no difference among BMI classes (p=0.66). Twenty percent of patients were unaware of their BMI prior to receiving the handout. Thirty-five percent of patients who were aware of BMI intended to speak to their physician about weight, compared to 21% who were unaware (p=0.012). Nearly 30% were somewhat surprised or very surprised, whereas 70% were not surprised or not very surprised about BMI results. By visit end, 57% of participants discussed BMI with their physician; those with above-normal BMI were significantly more likely to do so (p=0.0114). Two-thirds of patients planned to modify diet and/ or exercise based on the BMI information. Regarding the physician survey, there were 70 responders, of whom 52% reported discussing BMI with half or more of their patients. Forty percent of physicians reported that the patient initiated the discussion half or more of the time. More than 60% stated that the BMI handout was very helpful or somewhat helpful.\nAfter controlling for potential school and student-level confounding variables, the only statistically significant association that existed was between student soda consumption and school-conducted taste tests.\nAfter controlling for the effect of mode of onset of psychosis, previous incarceration, the level of childhood and adolescent maltreatment, and past history of substance use were significant predictors of DUP. Neurocognition, across all seven domains measured, was not associated with DUP. ConClusions: Early intervention efforts should focus on those at highest risk for longer DUP. The social determinants, such as neighborhood disorder, demonstrate a need for more community`-based prevention measures that will affect not only those at risk for psychosis but all children living in the geographical area. Better capacity to identify those with early psychosis will allow for earlier intervention, thereby promoting recovery. obJeCtives: This study aimed to determine whether a predictive relationship exists between the prevalence of depressive or anxious symptoms and risky sexual behaviors among young girls living in Ghana. Moreover, we looked primarily at whether depressive and anxious symptoms predict risky sexual behavior eighteen months later with the assumption that depressed girls are more vulnerable to sexual and reproductive health problems such as contracting HIV/AIDS or unintended pregnancies.\nWhen compared to recommendations (ADA and ISPAD), many youths were not meeting nutritional guidelines. This included percent daily intake of protein, carbohydrates, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and dietary fiber3. Further, 50.2% of youth reported LDL cholesterol levels greater than recommended guidelines for primary prevention of CV disease in youths with T1D. Significant positive correlations were found between HbA1c and percent of total calories from fat (r = .24, p < 0.01), polyunsaturated fat (r = .16, p < 0.05), dietary cholesterol (r = .20, p < 0.01), and LDL (r = .24, p < .01). Significant negative correlations were identified between HbA1c and percent of total calories from carbohydrates (r = -.23, p < 0.01) and dietary fiber (r = -.13, p < 0.05).\nBoth men and women indicated they are likely to turn to the Internet for health related concerns. Men indicated using the Internet for nutrition and fitness information, while women did not specify any health topic in particular. Men were considerably more likely to read blogs compared to female participants; women were concerned with derogatory or untrue comments, lack of confidentiality and lack of credentialed information on blogs."}, {"section_title": "ConClusion:", "text": "The in vitro 3D co-culture is a useful model for evaluating the effects of growth factors secreted by mesenchymal cells on the differentiation of HNE cells into glandular structures. In future studies, we hope to further probe the nature of submucosal gland differentiation by evaluating temporal changes in gene expression. Plasma is a partially ionized gas, where electrons are free rather than being bound to an atom. Because the positive and negative charges can move somewhat freely, plasma is electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Plasma is therefore sometimes referred to as \"the fourth state of matter\". Recent research in the field of physics has allowed for development of plasma at room temperature and atmospheric pressure called \"non-thermal\" or \"cold\" atmospheric plasma. The ability to produce plasma at ambient conditions allows the ionized gases to be directed towards cancerous cells or tissues, which are more sensitive to the reactive oxygen species than non-tumor cells are, that appear to be resistant. Plasma medicine is a rapidly growing field, with different disciplines of medicine using the technology for various innovative purposes. In addition to its usage for tumor ablation, recent research has shown that non-thermal plasma can be used to increase the rate for the natural process of blood coagulation as well as induce blood coagulation in blood samples that have been treated with an anti-coagulant. The current theory is that the plasma induces a conversion of the clotting factor fibrinogen to fibrin, bypassing the clotting cascade. Current instrumentation primarily utilizes a dielectric barrier discharge method, which is not applicable or practical in the clinical setting. This study utilized a handheld operated system, which relies on slightly different application of the plasma stream but similar mechanisms of plasma creation. For these experiments, an electrical discharge was applied to helium gas to create the non-thermal plasma. The procedure included 4 separate experiments with plasma treatment at 8.2mV: (1) TRIS buffered, purified human fibrinogen treated with plasma for 30s, 1 minute, 2m, and 5m and non-treated, followed by objective analysis of changes in viscosity. Results indicated an increase of viscosity with a gel like/semisolid quality at 5m (2) Citrated, heparinized, EDTA (anticoagulants) and whole human blood treated ex vivo with plasma for 30s, 1m, 2m, and 5m and objective analysis of changes in viscosity. The same results were seen as with the purified fibrinogen experiment. 3Heparinized mouse mesenteric vessels treated en vivo with plasma at 2m, 3m, 5m and no treatment for 5m and examined for tissue damage and thrombus formation by light microscopy. 4 Our aim is to establish an in vitro airway secretome model for normal epithelium as a tool to study relevant global protein changes that occur in lung diseases.  The fetal insulin hypothesis states that common genetic variants predisposing to insulin resistance also reduce fetal birth weight since fetal insulin acts as a key growth factor. A recent genome wide association study identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs9883204 in ADCY5 and rs900400 near CCNL1, that were associated with fetal birth weight. Interestingly, the weight-lowering C allele of the rs9883204 SNP is in high linkage disequilibrium with allele A of the rs11708067 SNP which has been associated with a high risk of type 2 diabetes and elevated fasting glucose. Likewise, CCNL1 may be involved in insulin secretion as well. The bio-mechanism behind insulin resistance genetic variants causing lower birth weight has yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, neither ADCY5 nor CCNL1 have been shown to be associated with adult phenotypes, including adult height and BMI. obJeCtive: Our study sought to further expand our understanding of the relationship between the ADCY5 and CCNL1 genes and human development by examining associations between the birth weight-associated SNPs and a range of adult musculoskeletal phenotypes such as muscle volume, subcutaneous fat volume, and bone density.\nWe conclude that liver injury up regulates TGF-b1 that inhibits parenchymal cell proliferation, but stimulates HSC proliferation leading to production of ECM and type I collagen resulting in fibrosis. Beta defensins are antimicrobial peptides that are part of the innate immune system and produced by the skin to combat skin infections. 1 The skin of atopic dermatitis patients is deficient in these peptides and it is believed that this may have a direct effect on the increased susceptibility of these patients to recurrent skin infections which occur due to the significant barrier disruption, chronic skin inflammation, and impaired innate immune response that are all characteristics of the disease. 2 Compounds that induce the production of beta defensins in the skin without concurrently inducing inflammatory cytokines have potential use in atopic dermatitis therapy and screening methods have been developed to screen plant extracts with this profile. 3 obJeCtives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of two such plant extracts (Extract A and B) on the production of b-defensin (cBD103), which is analogous to human beta defensin 3 (hBD3), in canine keratinocyte cultures, while also assessing their effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and TNF-a).\nPolymorphisms at rs28357094 in SPP1 influence global methylation patterns in the skeletal muscle of healthy males. Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) has been shown to reduce corneal infection but little is known about the impact of CAP on healthy corneal tissues and their ability to respond to injuries. obJeCtive: To examine the effect of Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) on wound healing after corneal epithelial and basement membrane ablation in New Zealand white rabbits.\nWe have shown that commercially available pharmacological agents can be repurposed from their traditional roles to prevent cancer metastasis. The alterations in ion channel expression represent novel gene targets that can be utilized as therapeutic alternatives with substantial translational potential.  responses, but have not been studied in cancer models. In this study, we describe mice (TCR vlo ) bearing a very low avidity TCR transgene specific for the melanoma antigen tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2 180-188 ). Remarkably, more than 50% of the TCR vlo CD8 + T cells express markers consistent with endogenous memory. These mice were tested for their ability to control B16 melanoma. methods: CD8 + T cells from the TCR transgenic mouse strain TCR vlo were characterized by flow cytometry for markers associated with endogenous memory. C57BL/6 mice were compared to TCR vlo mice for their ability to control tumor challenge. In that study, mice were injected subcutaneously with B16 tumor cells and were subsequently injected with a TRP-2 pulsed dendritic cell vaccine. Tumor size was measured using a caliper.\nNon To study the role of WNT pathway in regulating BMI1 expression and vice versa, we generated BMI1-overexpressing and knockdown MCF10A cells. Using these cells, we performed and quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot and promoter-reporter analyses for BMI1 and the various genes that are part of WNT pathway. We also determined expression of BMI1 and WNT inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines. Finally, the role BMI1 and WNT inhibitors was studied for cancer stem cell phenotype using mammosphere formation, Aldefluor assay and FACS analysis of CD44 and CD24 markers.  Ndn,Pi16,Luc71,Rrp1b,Brd4,Centd3,and Csf1r)  With future studies, we hope this knowledge can be applied to a clinical application for treatment purposes. The glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of tumor growth through inhibition of the glycolytic pathway and subsequent halting of glycolytic ATP generation in tumor cells. Previous studies have shown that effective use of 2-DG in cancer treatment requires high systemic doses that can cause dose-limiting side effects. Therefore, clinical trials have been approved for only low dose systemic 2-DG. We postulate that these systemic side effects can largely be avoided by direct intracranial delivery of 2-DG. We implanted 2-DG-impregnated controlled release biopolymer wafers intracranially in rats and assessed efficacy. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of 2-DG as a monotherapy in treating intracranial 9L rat gliosarcoma in vivo.\nThe results of this study show that 2-DG alone, when delivered locally, can cause a statistically significant increase in survival in rats with intracranial 9L Twenty-four rats were implanted with intracranial 9L gliosarcoma and were then divided into the following three groups: 1) no treatment, 2) 50% rapamycin treatment (5mg total of drug) at time of tumor implant (day 0), and 50% rapamycin treatment (5mg total of drug) 5 days after tumor implantation. Survival was the primary endpoint for this experiment.\nOur results show that rapamycin delivered intracranially exhibited a statistically significant survival benefit in a rodent gliosaroma model. Further studies should examine its effect when delivered in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in glioma models. Control animals had a mean survival of 11 days while the Mebendazole treatment group had a median survival of 15 days (p=0.0003 vs. control).\nOur results show that daily oral gavage of Mebendazole increased survival in an intracranial gliosarcoma model. Fortuitously, this is an agent that has already been approved by the FDA for anti-parasitic treatment and has an extensive history of use in humans to date. We look forward to the upcoming clinical trial of this anti-parasitic compound. Standard descriptive analyses were complemented with age-period-cohort (APC) models that adjusted for year of diagnosis (calendar-period) and year of birth (birth-cohort).\nHuge variability in radiation dose is seen in CT-guided procedures, with an average 38-fold difference between minimum and maximum DLPs for the 9 different procedure types. More study is required to identify the modifiable sources of such variability. Further research is required to establish recommendations for protocol optimization, and reduction in dose variability. Future research should target specific strategies for dose economy of localization, procedural guidance, and post procedure evaluation scans. Hip subluxation in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is common. While there is agreement that intervention is needed to maintain hip reduction in young children with CP, controversy exists in the treatment of skeletally mature patients with CP. Our goal was to assess the efficacy and complications of surgical interventions for hip subluxation in skeletally mature patients with spastic CP. methods: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with CP who underwent hip surgery for subluxation between 2005 and 2011. 20 patients were found to be skeletally mature and composed our study group. Charts were reviewed for the procedure performed and the pre-operative and most recent radiographs were reviewed to measure the acetabular index (AI), migration index (MI), and neck shaft angle (NSA). We also compared those patients who had all of their abnormal pre-operative radiographic findings addressed at surgery (acetabular osteotomy for AI > 25, open reduction for MI > 50%, and proximal femoral varus osteotomy for NSA > 135) vs those who did not, to evaluate the success of their procedure (defined as MI < 25% at final follow up).\nHip subluxation in skeletally mature patients with cerebral palsy is difficult to successfully treat and is associated with a significant incidence of postoperative complications. We found the likelihood of a successful outcome was directly related to the appropriateness of the surgical procedure performed. When all pre-operative radiographic abnormalities were addressed during surgery the chance of a successful outcome at final follow up was much higher than when a less comprehensive surgical intervention was performed. To determine the retrieval rate of ICV filters at The George Washington University Hospital. To determine the occurrence of complications during retrieval of IVC filters. To determine the reasons that IVC filters were placed and which patients were more likely to return to have their filter removed.\nThe data presented here support the indications that osteotomies are best utilized in AIS patients with combined larger (>65\u00b0) and stiffer (flexibility index < 0.55) curves. In these cases the use of POs was able to loosen the curve to achieve a maximum correction unattainable with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation alone without leading to an increase intra-operative blood loss. Ongoing research with no results at this time.\nWe confirmed a high prevalence of AF, CVA/TIA and HF in OSA. CPAP use in OSA patients was associated with statistically significant decreased risk of CVA/TIA and heart failure (EF<45), but with no significant statistical benefit on the AF risk. Despite advances in endovascular techniques, tibial bypass may still be required for revascularization to obtain healing and limb salvage. Perioperative (30 day) graft patency is an important outcome parameter reflecting technical considerations and acute graft thrombosis. Both are important prerequisites for longterm patency. In this analysis, we compare the 30-day patency of greater saphenous vein to alternative conduit configurations for tibial bypasses.\nCase based learning, a framing lecture, and a safe place to express and challenge opinions together constitute an effective strategy for introducing a controversial topic in medical education. In order to better assess the impact of the Case, we plan to follow up with the students and conduct a focus group of third-year medical students after completing their OBGYN rotation.  (2.96, 3.08).\nMature-aged students draw upon previous life experience, which shapes role expectations, as well as medical team dynamics.  \nJust-in-time e-learning is an effective way to improve knowledge of normal and abnormal MBS studies. However, it was not statistically shown that the module increased interpretation performance. One possible explanation is that basic knowledge may not be reinforced by the day-to-day activities of the practicing radiologist whereas radiographic interpretive skills remain the same or are enhanced by daily experience. Nevertheless, a JITL model could be utilized for radiology education for both residency and continuing medical education, and affords many advantages such as being able to set an individual learning pace, high accessibility, and relatively short/concise educational segments. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy and agreeability of a large scale roll-out of e-learning training Assessing the cultural beliefs of medical students:impact on the cadaveric dissection experience in the gross anatomy laboratory It is well established that cadaver dissection offers a beneficial learning experience to medical students in gross anatomy courses. Although researchers have sought to identify different learning styles in the dissection lab among students of various nationalities, no study has addressed the specific question of how a student's cultural identity or beliefs play a role in the emotional aspect of cadaver dissection. The purpose of this study is to examine the emotional impact of cadaver dissection across cultures and whether this impact affects the learners or learning experience. This is a quantitative/qualitative study targeting first year medical students of various cultural backgrounds partaking in cadaveric dissection. Students will be recruited via e-mail and will complete an online survey. Based on preliminary oral responses, a relationship between students' cultural identities and unique experiences in the gross anatomy laboratory was reported. This study will help medical educators understand the student learning experience of cadaveric dissection as it relates to cultural identity and will facilitate the preparation of students for the dissecting room experience. This poster provides a review of interim results from a qualitative study on first year medical students' attitudes and perceptions of their definition of medical professionalism in social media. Included in the study is an evaluation of changes in perspective since becoming a medical student and after participating in an E-Professionalism and Social Media instructional session.\nMedical students are consumers and producers of social media. Including online professionalism in the curriculum in this way with a focus on implication and best practices can help them develop an awareness of their professional presence in this electronic era. The USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills examination was introduced to medical students in 2004 in order to assess students' clinical competence. The exam consists of 12 patient encounters in which students are evaluated on their clinical skills, interpersonal and communication skills, and English proficiency. Step 2 CS is currently offered in 5 cities and costs $1200 to register. By 2011, a total of 118,333 US/Canadian students had taken their first attempt at this exam, and a total of $122,254,700 had been paid in registration fees alone for first-time attempters. obJeCtives: To assess the value and impact of the USMLE Step 2CS in the educational process of US medical students, by doing an economic analysis, looking at the pass rates of the exam, and by speaking to medical school deans across the country.\nBy utilizing evidence from the literature, the ARC will be able to develop a comprehensive training program that will promote resiliency and allow family caregivers to increase self-efficacy and self-mastery. Particularly challenging is the four labels span the entire visible spectrum while overlapping in both excitation and emission. Furthermore, the auto fluorescence overlaps with multiple probes, resulting in diminished signal to noise or false granularity that could be detected by the software as FISH signal. In the initial studies, the emission peaks of Spectrum Aqua probe used to detect chromosome 18 (480 nm) and commonly used nuclear counterstain DAPI (470 nm), were too close. So we replaced DAPI with Topro-3 (661 nm). Although Topro-3 and Spectrum Orange (588 nm) emissions were spectrally too close to separate using conventional fluorescence microscopy, spectral imaging using online linear unmixing can be employed to separate these fluorescence emissions and to produse intensity modulated channels corresponding to the spatial contribution of each fluorophore. We adapted the linear unmixing procedure from commercially available software (Zeiss). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with Apochromat 63X/1.4 oil objectives in a high throughput manner. Z-stack were acquired from multiple positions preprogrammed on the system. With this approach, we are able to acquire data consistent with the previous literature. Among 12 men analyzed using the semi-automated method, median total sex chromosome disomy frequency was 1.62%, which is within range with previous reports. These results further validate that semi-automated methods can be used to score sperm disomy with results comparable to manual methods. Recycling an empty drink container or a paper flyer at an outdoor event should be easy. Unfortunately, in Washington, DC, an event host can gain a Special Event Permit without providing any recycling or waste diversion infrastructure during their event. This lack of infrastructure places the responsibility of recycling at events solely on the attendees rather than being a joint effort between the host and the attendees. The outcome -most recyclable or compostable waste generated at these events lands in the trash. We were able to divert over 200 pounds of waste over a 3-hour period and our preliminary analysis shows that the staffed stations -stations that incorporated education from trained staff -had the most success; increasing recycling by 60% and increasing composting by nearly 50%, compared to the other stations.\nThrough my experience, I learned about Thai people and their culture, Doctor-patient and Doctorstudent Relationships, Communicating with Patients and Doctors as a foreigner, Thailand Medical Practices and How They Compare to the US. The provision of basic education on personal hygiene, typhoid and dengue fever endemic to a remote area such as Janampet, in Andhra Pradesh will create an awareness and in the long run can be beneficial in lowering the incidence of disease. obJeCtives: To educate the children in the Janampet community to effectively combat After the end of the three-week training period, the 3rd grade students whose average age was seven went from getting 9% -58.5% of the class getting all the questions correct in the personal hygiene lesson. There were similar results in the 8th and 10th grade classes. The 8th graders whose average age was 13 went from no more than 50% to over 80% of the class getting all the questions correct for both Dengue and Typhoid fever lesson. Similarly, the 10th graders whose average age was 16 went from 0%-25% of the class getting all questions correct in the Dengue fever session. The assessment on the level of improvement in the knowledge of Typhoid fever could not be made because a pre-survey was not carried out for the 10th graders.\nThe results of the survey demonstrates that the 3rd, 8th and 10th grade students were better able to recognize the mode of transmission, signs and symptoms and treatment of both Dengue and Typhoid fever. A future assessment should be carried out to observe the statistical impact of child education in the incidence these diseases in the local community of Janampet. \u2022 Identify common illnesses, disease motifs common to the underserved populations in the tribal villages of Narmada District \u2022 Understand the contribution of biopsychosocial elements present for the manifestation of recurrent and continued disease within the region \u2022 Understand the current problems faced by the villagers and Anoopam Mission healthcare providers in order to effectively apply medical interventional strategies to both remove and prevent the villagers from the sustained cycles of disease \u2022 Observe the action of Anoopam Mission healthcare providers and local Indian Government on the wellbeing of the villagers and the effects on the incidence and prevalence of certain diseases in Narmada District methods 4 weeks were spent in an observational study, rounding with a team of onsite medical officers. Both the villagers and healthcare providers were interviewed regarding the types of illnesses prevalent within the region and the biopsychosocial causes of these common diseases. A week was spent researching and interviewing the local government's forest conservation officers and their role in the development of the wellbeing of the villagers. 3 weeks were spent performing independent research on the socioeconomic and cultural demographics of Narmada District and reviewing literature on the prevalent diseases of the region to better understand the medical interventions that were employed by the healthcare providers.\nThe high quality of the medical care and medical education in Beirut Globally, 25% of neonatal deaths occurring in India, with most occurring in resource limited settings at home against a backdrop of high risk practices and behaviors, poor care seeking, and limited access to care. Despite the existence of cost effective interventions, the early neonatal period has received very minimal impact in mortality reduction because of the inability of health workers to perform early home visitations. This study will be a sub-study of the Shivgarh trial, a RCT looking at behavior change in reducing neonatal mortality that reduced NMR by 50% by performing home visitations to the \"saur\".

The goal is that this survey can be utilized as a tool by physicians and healthcare officials to guide future programs on adolescent sexual health and pregnancy.  Many VHT members are dedicated and capable to apply their health knowledge and perform their responsibilities. They eagerly participate in continuing education and initiatives like community-wide vaccination days. They are accepted and valued by their communities. Members report barriers to effectiveness in limited transportation, time, and mobile communications.\nNGOs implementing income generation plus health education among indigenous Guatemalan artisans have the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of their participants. Future income generation projects may benefit from applying the current study's lessons learned and conceptual model. By the end of the session, the participant will be able to:  Women were less likely to report IPV, know where to seek help, or be asked about injuries when IPV is suspected during health visits. Making support services available and educating women of how to access these resources are some of the steps that can be taken to reduce negative health outcomes. Training health professionals for diagnosing and referring injured women to these support services would also help reduce the prevalence of IPV in Egypt. Since the conclusion of the Guatemalan civil war in 1996, many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have seized the opportunity to engage indigenous women in income generation activities with the goal of improving their lives. Accompanying economic independence is a beginning shift in women's gender roles.\nAs of today, no conclusions can be made.

However, very few studies have looked into the possible chromosomal abnormalities that result from the use of HAART and the effects on male fertility. This literature review has resulted in the initiation of a study examining sperm chromosomal abnormalities among participants in the Men's AIDS Cohort Study (MACS Over time, AAT has been implemented in a variety of healthcare settings due to its positive psychological, emotional, and physiological effects. Most of the research on AAT, however, does not include its effects on the community. For example, homeless shelters, abuse shelters, etc. are services for the community that primarily deal with individuals suffering from psychological, emotional, or physical distress. More research must be conducted in community settings to determine how effective AAT can be as a therapy. obJeCtives: The goals of the project included to incorporate a community service opportunity into a learning experience by creating an educational video on AAT; to learn the benefits of AAT in a healthcare setting; and to identify which service facilities for the homeless in Washington D.C. have an interest in implementing AAT. 36 surveys total were completed with 30 being current staff members at the previously listed facilities. Over 90% of those surveyed thought that The Healing Powers of Dog Therapy video was an effective educational tool on AAT. Only 47% of those surveyed, however, thought that AAT would be applicable at their facility. The greatest concern, which 20% of people that were surveyed conveyed, was that their residents/patients might have had a traumatic experience in the past, leading them to be resistant to AAT.\nThe results support the notion that text messaging combined with phone counseling offers a promising strategy for tobacco cessation.

For both individual-and population-level impact, adherence is critical. Understanding the relationship between optimism and adherence may provide opportunities for intervention. The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between optimism and pessimism and medication adherence, and to determine whether these are best expressed as polar opposites on a unidimensional continuum or as two independent constructs. ConClusions: Our data suggested that optimism and pessimism represent independent constructs. This study will inform development of future interventions to improve adherence interventions among HIV-infected persons. Given the disproportionate rate of HIV infection among African American women, compared to their non-Black counterparts, there may be a difference in media messaging which may lead to a different decision making process among the two populations. Women's magazines may be an important indicator of the type of public health messages women are exposed to, and thus may be associated with perceived vulnerability, sexual decisions, and ultimately HIV incidence and prevalence. It is therefore critical to examine the key differences in media messages related to HIV targeting African-Americans, and their non-Black counterparts. obJeCtive: The objectives of this content analysis are to examine to what extent HIV/ AIDS is discussed in Black versus mainstream women's magazines, and to identify which themes are most predominant in the portrayal of HIV/AIDS, in both Black and mainstream women's magazines.\nThis expectation of this content analysis is that it will lead to the identification of themes around the portrayal of HIV/AIDS in both sample sets of US Our goal was to determine whether this alternative replication program is unique to KSHV or if it is a common feature of all herpesviruses. We focused our efforts on HHV-4 (also known as Epstein Barr Virus or EBV), HHV-6B, HHV-6A and HHV-7. We successfully demonstrated that DCPE induces apoptosis in cell lines latently infected with EBV, HHV-7, HHV-6B and -6A. We further showed that DCPE induces viral replication in EBV and HHV-7 latently infected cells lines as evident by a significant increase in the amount of viral DNA present in the supernatant as compared to the negative control. Lastly, we demonstrated viral protein expression induced by apoptosis occurs for KSHV, HHV-4, HHV-6B, and HHV-7 latently infected cell lines.\nThese findings indicate that the levels of immune mediators in the FRT such The long stand recommendations of treating patients with positive PPD post BCG immunization has been subjected to a big debate nowadays.

Some of these disadvantages are: discomfort, the side effect of medications, direct and indirect cost related to the treatment, clinician's wasting time.; the cost of the treatment for the government. Based on the preliminary results we selected the following EEG properties to detect early cortical malfunction in the Fragile X model: (1) the power spectral densities differences at equivalents to pre-symptomatic ages in low frequency EEG range (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10) between control and Fragile X groups; and (2) cross-correlation measures and their change across development. researCh ConClusion: Our results suggest several measures for early detection of cortical abnormalities in Fragile X model. Similar techniques can be used during the pre-symptomatic ages in humans. Future studies of these cortical properties will facilitate finding novel EEG diagnostics for pre-term and term infants at risk for autism. We investigated which ADL-related SIST-M-IR items best discriminate between CN and MCI subjects in 447 subjects participating in the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (MADRC) longitudinal cohort (289 CN, 158 MCI). We first performed data reduction analyses to reduce the 41 items to 10 items which appeared to best discriminate CN from MCI. We then performed backward elimination (p<0.05 cutoff) logistic regression analyses predicting the probability of CN vs. MCI diagnosis using the 10 selected items. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, and estimated premorbid intelligence (AMNART Verbal IQ).\nResults demonstrated that approximately 40% of participants displayed HA during an auditory description decision task, indicating that this task does not robustly activate the hippocampus. However, the participants that did show HA were predominantly left-lateralized, regardless of diagnosis (patient vs. control). Furthermore, lateralization of language function was aligned with lateralization of activation of memory structures, such that individuals with typical language patterns (left) showed left-lateralized HA, while subjects with atypical language showed atypical activation. This left-lateralized HA in adults may be related to the material-specific lateralization of memory function in adults. in mice. We hypothesized that blocking MPO activity in ischemic stroke could have beneficial effects. We performed transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice using 30 min reperfusion model. 4-amino benzoic-hydrazide(ABAH),an irreversible highly specific MPO inhibitor, was administered intraperitoneally twice daily to the stroke mice for up to 21 days after stroke induction. Stroke mice given salineand sham mice (mice that underwent surgery but without actually inducing stroke) were used as controls..We found that MPO inhibitionsubstantially decreased the number of myeloid inflammatory cells and neuronal cell death in the ischemic brain on day 7 after stroke.Post-insult ABAH treatment also markedly increased 5-bromo-2' deoxyuridine (BrdU) -positive cells compared with saline-treated control mice in the ischemic subventricluar zone (SVZ). We evaluated behavioral changes on day -1, 1, 3, 7, 10, 14 and 21 after ischemia.We found that ABAH-treated mice demonstrated significantly improved neurological functions compared to saline-treated mice, to nearly the same level of functions as that of the sham mice. Therefore, our study suggests that MPO inhibition could be a potential novel therapy for ischemic stroke. Washington, DC 20052 faCulty advisor Vittorio Gallo sChool of mediCine and health sCienCes Endothelin-1 is an astrocyte-derived signal which inhibits remyelination baCKground: Multiple sclerosis (MS) results in demyelinated lesions throughout the central nervous system. In response to demyelination, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) repopulate the lesion and begin to differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). Some lesions, however, fail to remyelinate for unknown reasons. Reactive astrogliosis has been shown to inhibit OPC differentiation during remyelination, but the role of reactive astrocytes in regulating OPC differentiation is still controversial. We have previously identified an endogenous signal, endothelin-1 (ET-1), which promotes reactive astrogliosis, but its effects on remyelination have not been explored. obJeCtives: In this study we aimed to determine the role of ET-1 in the regulation of OPC differentiation using in vitro culture systems and experimentally induced demyelination in mice. We examined the role of ET-1 in inducing expression of downstream inhibitory molecules in astrocytes in an effort to identify signaling pathways which are detrimental to remyelination.\nIn obese prediabetic patients that received metformin during following up in the weight loss clinic, there was no significant difference in weight loss at different levels of Hb A1c. Further prospective studies should be done. Participants were recruited from a general medicine clinic in Washington DC. At the beginning of appointments, assistants measured height and weight, then provided the BMI handout and an anonymous survey about patient understanding of BMI, whether patients discussed weight with their physician and if they intended to make lifestyle changes after reviewing the BMI handout. Physicians were later e-mailed an anonymous survey, asking how often and who initiates discussions about patient weight and the usefulness of the BMI handout.\nAmong a diverse, urban patient population with a high prevalence of obesity, a BMI handout can be a valuable tool for raising patient awareness about BMI. Additionally, physicians may find the handout to be a helpful first step in discussing weight management and lifestyle interventions. and an additional 44% in the overweight range in a 2011 chart audit sample. ConClusions: By working with the patients at Columbia Road Health Services, not only did I gain the opportunity to practice my patient education and Spanish language skills, I was able to witness firsthand the challenges faced by a low-income, immigrant population in maintaining their health. I plan to return to the programs to volunteer in the spring. Obesity has been increasing in prevalence in the United States. Obesity increases the risk of developing many medical conditions including certain cancers, especially endometrial, renal, colon, pancreatic, and esophageal. The purpose of this study was to assess if patients at a university weight loss clinic were aware of the relationship between obesity and cancer, and to determine if knowledge of this relationship affected their motivation to lose weight.\nAlthough the results were not entirely significant, this study provides insight into the individual, psychological factors affecting adolescent girls' behaviors. Future research should explore the differences between internalizing and externalizing psychological factors in order to more clearly identify traits that lead to risky sexual behaviors among Automated adverse-event (AE) detection using triggers derived from the electronic health record (EHR) is an effective method of identifying adverse events, including rise in serum creatinine (Cr).

This may place them at increased risk for CV diabetes-related complications. Further, their reported nutrition was associated with HbA1c, suggesting an immediate relationship with glycemic control. Diabetes education efforts regarding healthy eating and dietary management may need to be enhanced to achieve recommendations. Factors associated with early sexual debut among Ghanaian women from the Manya -Krobo district, -Ghana, 2011 baCKground: The dipo, a Krobo puberty initiation rite practiced annually among an estimated 2,000 Ghanaian females ages 2 -20, is a cultural rite of passage into womanhood that is intended to promote abstinence from sexual activity until marriage. obJeCtives: This study examined the risk of early sexual debut among dipo-initiated Krobo females versus uninitiated Krobo females. This study also assessed Manya -Krobo societal opinions regarding the sexual health outcomes of initiates and existing modifications of the rite. Dipo initiated participants had a 1.8 increased hazard rate of early sexual debut as compared to uninitiated participants after adjusting for covariates, however, results were not statistically significant (aHR: 1.8, 95% C.I: 0.8 -4.0). Qualitative data indicated that some dipo opponents stated participation promotes promiscuity and teen pregnancy while select supporters asserted the rite protects participants from these outcomes.

The sensitivity of mammography in women with dense breast tissue decreases significantly. Therefore additional imaging modalities are needed to improve cancer detection. While the performance of mammography together with sonography can raise the overall breast cancer detection rate, these two modalities both rely on the anatomic differences between breast cancer and normal breast tissue. Alternative imaging modalities which are based on the physiologic differences between breast cancer and normal breast tissue, such as MRI and BSGI have the ability to detect additional breast cancers not identified by anatomic based imaging modalities. Breast Specific Gamma Imaging (BSGI) is based on angiogenesis, mitochondrial activity and cellular proliferation.

Hypertension, HIV-associated nephropathy, and Focal Segmental Glumerulosclerosis are all manifestations of kidney disease seen at dissimilar rates among African Americans. Until recently, the genetic basis for this disparity was unknown. Recent research, however, strongly suggests a link between the APOL1 gene and the predisposition to kidney disease in African Americans . A genomic region on chromosome 22, located 14 kbp downstream from the MYH9 gene, explains much of the differences seen between people of African vs. European ancestry for nondiabetic end stage kidney disease. In this genomic region lies the APOL1 gene that encodes apolipoprotein L-1, whose known activities include powerful trypanosome lysis, autophagic cell death, lipid metabolism, and cellular senescence. The APOL1 gene in African American populations contains two distinct haplotypes G1 and G2. The G1 haplotype contains two nonsynonymous coding sequence singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that replace serine at residue 342 with glycine (S342G) and isoleucine at residue 384 with methionine (I384M). The G2 haplotype is defined by a 6-nucleotide deletion that leads to an in-frame deletion of two amino acids, asparagine-388 and tyrosine-389. Examination of the APOL1 genotype in the Dallas Heart Study, a population-based cohort, demonstrated that most individuals with the G1 haplotype were at increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease compared to those with the WT haplotype. It has been shown that the G1 haplotype has persisted in the population because it also confers protection against sleeping sickness. It is known that the kidneys play a pivotal role in maintaining and regulating the skeletal system. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases calcium reabsorption by the kidney while calcitonin inhibits calcium reabsorption. The kidneys also produce the active form of vitamin D. With that in mind, we sought to investigate whether haplotype variation in the APOL1 gene might also influence measures of bone health. Studies evaluating genetic factors,which contribute to fracture risk and vitamin D levels have been performed in adults but remain limited in children. In this study, we explored the relationship between APOL1 G1 haplotypes and fracture risk and vitamin D levels in healthy African American children. We tested two variants that make up the G1 haplotype. This haplotype consists of the two derived nonsynonymous coding variants rs73885319 (S342G) and rs60910145 (I384M) in the last exon of APOL1. genotyping: The genotypes were determined with assay-bydesign Taqman genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using allele discrimination assays that employ the 5' nuclease activity of Taq polymerase to detect a fluorescent reporter signal . Both alleles are detected simultaneously using SNP-specific oligonucleotides labeled with different fluorophores, and genotypes automatically determined by the ratio of the two fluorophores. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the each genetic variant contained a minimum of 10 ng of DNA, 900 nM primers, 200 nM probes, and TaqMan Genotyping Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 10 \u00b5L. PCR was performed on ABI thermocyclers (9700 or 2720) using the following PCR profile: 10 minutes at 95 \u00b0C (denaturation), 44 cycles of 15 seconds at 92 \u00b0C, and 1 minute at an annealing temperature of 60 \u00b0C. The post-PCR allele calling was completed using an ABI 7900HT (genotyping software SDS ver. 2.3) and checked manually. statistical analysis: Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium was tested for the SNP using a chi square test with one degree of freedom. The normality of each quantitative phenotype was confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Associations between the SNP and fracture status were tested using logistic regression with BMI and 25(OH)D levels as covariates. Associations between the SNP and 25(OH)D levels were tested using ANCOVA models, with BMI and fracture status as covariates. Post-hoc pair-wise comparisons were performed for those ANCOVAs showing a significant genotype effect F-test, and the resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Sidak method. All regression models used a full genetic model comparing homozygous common allele individuals to heterozygotes to homozygous rare allele individuals. The nominal p-value for significance was 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata V11 (College Station, TX). results Individuals with theAPOL1 G1 haplotype did not show any statistically significant relationships with any measured phenotype in this study. We performed an unadjusted analysis of fracture status and found that populations with the APOL1 G1 haplotype did not demonstrate an increased fracture risk. Similarly we did not find a significant correlation for G1 haplotype when we adjusted fracture status for BMI and vitamin D levels. Finally, we analyzed vitamin D levels and DXA scores adjusted for BMI and fracture status.

Each task was preceded by 4 minutes of rest. A 3-T scanner was used to collect whole brain FMRI images. Using the contralateral insula as a seed region, FSL Software was used to process the data and create functional connectivity maps and compare and contrast results between the two pain tasks. results: Functional Connectivity maps were generated for each task and showed covariance between the contralateral insula and the known areas of the \"pain matrix\". A visual/qualitative increase in connectivity is seen in the \"Pain 1\" map in comparison to \"Pain 2\". Quantitatively, some subjects show a numerical difference in connectivity, but statistical analysis did not show any difference between the two at an aggregate level. disCussion: Every year, the amount of money that is spent on pain management trends upwards at an exponential pace. Researchers hope that functional connectivity studies will help us understand the specific brain regions that contribute to the pathological manifestation of chronic pain. This nascent technique is still being reconfigured to facilitate meaningful understanding and our study is critical to devising a protocol that codifies outcomes with a high level of utility and statistical relevance. We are currently optimizing our analysis technique to further validate the qualitative differences between Pain 1 and Pain 2 as an adequately powered study. We examined if a language task would reliably elicit hippocampal activation (HA) in an epilepsy population. We compared lateralization of HA between patients and typically developing (TD) controls and the lateralization of HA between atypical and typical language dominant participants. Regarding hippocampal LI, there was a trend for the controls to demonstrate more left-lateralized HA than the patients, but this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.081, patients mean LI: 0.24, controls mean LI: 0.47). Categorically, for controls HA was left-lateralized in 26, bilateral in 5, and right in 4, while for patients HA was left-lateralized in 13, bilateral in 4, and right in 2. Mean hippocampal LI for participants with typical language was left-lateralized (both groups combined=0.4) and atypically-lateralized for participants with atypical language (both groups combined=-0.43). Categorically, the consistent lateralization patterns were as follows: 39 left-lateralized language and left HA, 1 bilateral language and bilateral HA, and 0 right-lateralized language and right HA."}, {"section_title": "methods", "text": "Patients at a university weight loss clinic were asked to complete a survey assessing their knowledge about the relationship between obesity and cancer. The survey asked for specific demographic information, including gender, age, level of education, and history of cancer diagnosis. The survey asked about awareness between obesity and cancer, to list cancers linked to obesity, and how knowledge of a link between obesity and cancer might affect his or her motivation to lose weight (greatly increase, somewhat increase, no impact, somewhat decrease, or greatly decrease motivation). Surveys were anonymously collected, and data were entered and stored in Microsoft Excel. results Forty-eight weight loss clinic patients (36 female, 11 male, 1 unknown) completed the survey. The mean age of participants surveyed was 47.5 years old. Of the 48 patients, 27 were unaware of a relationship between obesity and cancer. Of these patients, 18 reported that knowledge of a relationship between obesity and cancer would increase their motivation to lose weight (15 greatly increase, 3 somewhat increase). There was a significant difference in degree of increased motivation (greatly increase vs. somewhat increase) to lose weight in unaware patients compared to those who were already aware of the link (p=0.02).

Surplus embryos are typically \"cryopreserved\" (frozen) and stored for later use. Ensuring the most effective method of cryopreservation of surplus embryos in IVF has important consequences for patients, including the minimization of time investment, discomfort, risk, and expense of undergoing a new cycle of ovarian stimulation for fresh IVF. Shady Grove Fertility Center, a large fertility practice, transitioned from slow freeze cryopreservation to vitrification protocols to cryopreserve surplus embryos. obJeCtives: Given the suggestive but inconsistent evidence of the superiority of embryo vitrification over slow freezing in the medical literature, this study was designed to retrospectively compare the clinical outcomes before and after transitioning to the new protocols at Shady Grove Fertility Center.\nNutrition intake in youths with type I diabetes baCKground: For youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D), adolescence is characterized by a period of poor adherence.
