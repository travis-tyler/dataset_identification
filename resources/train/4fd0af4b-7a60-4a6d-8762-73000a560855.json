Specifically there is an interest in systems that use biology to convert light into electrical energy as way to use the advantages of biology to harvest a sustainable energy source. These devices are collectively known as photo-bioelectric systems. In this study we aim to develop a new photo-bioelectric system through the combination of several well-known technologies and widely conserved biological phenomena. The system is distinct from a microbial fuel cell (MFC), as it uses an aluminum oxide cell design to interface phototrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms with power production.\nMany photo-bioelectric systems are modeled on microbial fuel cells and have been described [1, 2] . A MFC has microbes associated with the anode oxidizing organic compounds under normally anaerobic conditions, using the anode as the terminal electron acceptor [3] . Electrons are shuttled to a platinum cathode where they combine with O 2 and H + , yielding water [3] . In the closest related class of photo-MFCs, the MFC is fed organic carbon from algae [4] [5] [6] or plant root exudates [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Energy stored by photosynthesis is liberated when the organic matter is oxidized by bacteria. In another design, algae are added to the cathodic side of the MFC, supplying O 2 in the electron consuming reaction [5] . In both cases electrons are donated from electron transfer chains to the anode. Cyanobacteria can also donate electrons to the anode during respiration of cellular carbon reserves in dark phases with redox shuttles such as HNQ [13] [14] [15] .\nThe need for a redox shuttle to move electrons from algae to anode limits this type of cell to closed systems. Recently it was shown pure cultures of cyanobacteria could directly donate electrons to the anode [16] . The authors postulate these organisms donate electrons via nanowires when CO 2 is limiting [16] . It is also possible to extract electrons from photosynthesis by using hydrogen as an intermediary [2] . Hydrogen is produced by hydrogenases or nitrogenases and then oxidized at a platinum electrode, recovering the electrons [2] . Ryu et al. take a different approach by inserting nano-electrodes directly into photosynthetic membranes of alga, extracting electrons using an overvoltage [17] . This eliminates light to chemical energy conversion losses, theoretically increasing efficiency, but consumes energy needed by the organism for growth and sustained survival.\nIn this study we present a system that is distinct from established photo-bioelectric systems. It is designed around the normal processes that occur when phototrophs and heterotrophs grow and replicate. Phototrophs and heterotrophs pump carbon through ecosystems, shifting inorganic carbon equilibrium reactions and in the process affecting pH. Algae alter pH by removing CO 2 and HCO 3 2 , which shift the equilibrium and produces hydroxide ions, resulting in pH values as high as 11 [18] . Respiration oxidizes organic compounds to CO 2 and organic acids, reducing pH. The system extracts energy from acids and bases which are waste products of heterotrophic and phototrophic metabolism respectively. These products of metabolism are interfaced with an electrical system by using an aluminum fuel cell under the alkaline conditions. In this type of fuel cell, water and base react with aluminum to form aluminum oxides and electrons [19] . In an isolated system the electrons typically reduce hydrogen ions resulting in hydrogen gas, however they can also be drawn into an external circuit with an applied voltage.\nThe goal of this study is to demonstrate a proof of principle of exploiting the chemical gradient that occurs when photosynthesis and respiration are separated. The mechanistic data presented focus on the algal side of the cell. We show power production in the cell is pH dependent in the absence of algae. Power production is light and photosynthesis dependent when the algae are present. Finally a cell was deployed in the field to test the robustness of the design outside of the laboratory."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Algal Cultivation", "text": "Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 was grown in f/2 medium [20] with a salinity of 20 ppt.

S3 . To increase the light absorption area algae were continuously pumped through the cell and a tubular type photobioreactor on top of a fluorescent light box, giving the algae 400 cm 2 of surface area to absorb light at an average intensity of 117 mmol/m 2 /s. This setup was light-proofed so only light from the light box reached the algae. Light and dark cycling was then controlled by turning the light box on and off with cycle lengths of four hours. The low pH side of the cell contained f/2 medium at pH 7. Two voltage channels were recorded on a HOBO U12 4-channel data logger (Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA). The first channel measures the voltage of the cell across a 10 K V resistor and the second channel measures pH from an Orion Research pH meter using the voltage outputs on the meter. The voltage output from the pH meter was amplified using an OpAmp circuit shown in Fig. S3 to ensure the signal was in the sensitivity range of the data logger. Voltage data was converted to pH using a standard curve generated from voltage outputs at known pH values. The grounds within the logger are tied together. To prevent interference between the cell voltage channel and the pH voltage channel an oscillator circuit was built so only one channel was being measured at any moment while the other was disconnected. It was necessary to electronically insulate the pH probe from the electrodes in the cells to prevent spurious pH readings. This was achieved by passing the algae through two drip insulators on either side of the electrode which broke any electrical connection between the pH electrode and the electrode in the cell while allowing continuous pH monitoring. Periodic samples were tested to confirm the pH values recorded reflected the pH values at the electrode."}, {"section_title": "Long Term Light/Dark Experiment", "text": "The smaller test cell was used for this experiment.

Respiration decreases pH through the oxidation of organic compounds, generating CO 2 which shifts the inorganic carbon equilibrium and produces hydrogen ions.

By separating heterotrophic and phototrophic metabolism a pH gradient can be generated. This pH gradient can be used to generate power. Importantly, the presented system is effectively a photosynthesis dependent battery in the current stage of development due to the use of aluminum (Al) as the anode and does not yet constitute a standalone energy generation system. Substitution of the Al electrode with a catalyst would make it a stand-alone biologically driven power source. The cell has an algae-filled high pH side with an Al electrode and low pH side with a platinum electrode, separated by a paper membrane (Fig. 1B) . The Al reacts with basic water produced by algal carbon fixation. Al is ionized, leaving electrons on the anode which pass through an external circuit, combining with hydrogen ions at the platinum electrode producing H 2 (shown below).\nInitially we show the cell is responsive to pH by increasing pH stepwise on the basic side of the cell in the absence of algae while voltage was monitored. The data confirm increased pH results in increased voltage (Fig. 2A) . Because voltage is dependent on having high pH on one side of the cell and low pH on the other, the greater the difference the higher the voltage as seen in Fig. 2A .\nResults were obtained in cell-free media, showing living cells are not necessary for pH-dependent power production. We observed a steady-state voltage at lower pH values but at pHs higher than ca. 10, voltage continued to increase. One possibility is that the reaction has not yet achieved steady state at the surface of the aluminum at these higher pHs. Aluminum oxidation chemistry at the surface of the metal is complex and not yet completely understood, however we hypothesize that the hydroxide is Support for the proposed Al reaction was observed by comparing electrodes before and after ten days of operation. Electrode ionization was observed near the air-liquid interface (Fig. S1 ). These data support hydroxide dependent production of current through the oxidation of Al. The exact mechanism of Al oxidation in our system is unknown and may proceed by several parallel reactions [19] . While the intermediate steps in Al oxidation are important, here we focus on developing a process linking the biology of algae to an electron producing reaction.\nOptimal operating load was determined with a power curve, where current was measured at increasing external resistances (Fig.  S2) . Optimal resistance was 500 V, where 285 mW/m 2 Pt electrode was produced. Often in photo-bioelectric systems either algae or a bacterial intermediary must first colonize the electrode [2] . In our system voltage is produced immediately upon submersion of the electrodes, showing colonization is not required, which is consistent with power generation being driven by the pH. In addition, different alga in different media with similar pH values produce similar voltages including Microcystis aeruginosa LE-3 (freshwater cyanobacterium), Scenedesmus sp. HTB1 (freshwater green alga) and Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 (marine alga).\nWe hypothesized production of hydroxide ions through the removal of inorganic carbon via photosynthesis drives power production. In our next set of experiments we tested if voltage is light dependent. Algae in the cell were passed through a series of light/dark cycles while voltage and pH were monitored. During light phases, pH and voltage increase (Fig. 2B) . Photosynthesis likely causes the pH increase and leads to higher cell voltage. During dark phases, photosynthesis stops and voltage decreases as hydroxide is consumed in the reaction with Al. In a separate trial the light/dark dependence was tested and found to be stable over the two week course of the experiment (Fig. 3) . These data show increases in voltage are light dependent and likely due to pH increases from photosynthesis. The results also show that the same magnitude of voltage is produced when the same magnitude of pH gradient is present. To confirm power output is dependent on photosynthesis we used DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylure), a specific inhibitor of photosystem II. DCMU was added to cultures under constant illumination while voltage and pH were monitored. Upon addition of the inhibitor pH increase stopped, whereas the pH of the solvent control lacking DCMU continued to climb (Fig. 4A) . Cell voltage resembles the pH curve, voltage increase stopped after addition of the inhibitor, while voltage continued to climb in the control (Fig. 4B) . Voltage plateaued before pH in the control, potentially indicating inhibition by constraints on the cathodic reaction imposed by the size of the Pt electrode, or the internal resistance of the cell. The data show specific inhibition of photosynthesis results in lower pH and lower voltage, confirming voltage is light and photosynthesis dependent.\nNext we were interested in testing the limits of this type of cell. We hypothesized power was limited by internal resistance; this was tested with a cell cast into 1.5% agar with 5 M NaCl. This setup produced a peak power output of 33 W/m 2 Pt electrode with a stable power output of 0.7 W/m 2 Pt. This peak power output is over 33 fold higher than the next highest photo-bioelectric cell [6] and nearly 6 fold higher than the highest bioelectric system [22] . High power is possible due to liberation of stored energy in the Al electrode through reaction with algae-derived hydroxide. The Al electrode could be substituted with a catalyst to extract electrons from hydroxide ions such as a perovskite oxide [23] . It should also be possible to increase power by decreasing the pH of the acidic side of the cell, though the focus of the current paper is on the algal side of the cell. The current device is useful for powering remote sensors in aquatic systems and for algal biofuel production to control pH and provide power for mixing ponds.\nThe mechanism of action suggests the cell is species neutral. The species neutral nature of the cell was tested with a larger version deployed in a Chesapeake Bay tributary. This cell incorporated the entire proposed design principle and is shown in figure 5A . A power curve showed peak power output occurred at 50 V resistance (Fig. S2) . Power was produced immediately upon submerging the cell at the site, where pH was 8.3. The cell interior maintained a lower pH than the surrounding water throughout the experiment. A maximum power output of 192 mW/m 2 Pt electrode was recorded shortly after start up with an average power output of 11 mW/m 2 Pt (Fig. 5B) . Unlike the laboratory-scale test, the cell was affected by environmental factors including storms and tides. Power produced roughly follows the day/night cycle, deviations from this cycle correlate well with changes in tides. Changes in tides affect power output by altering the area of submerged Pt electrode. After the fourth day a storm moved over the site and stirred up sediment, correlating with a drop in power to 0.3-1 mW/m 2 Pt electrode (Fig. 5B) . We speculate this was due to a pH decrease from inhibition of photosynthesis. After this period the cell recovered, and resumed power production. From these data we conclude the cell can successfully produces power with an undefined freshwater microbial community. The system we presented represents a novel class of photo-bioelectric cell, where photosynthesis and respiration are linked to electrical power production via known electrochemical reactions. This type of cell can generate high current densities and operate outside of the laboratory in a species neutral manner. Power production from different species is likely dependent on the rate at which algae removed inorganic carbon from water. This rate will differ based on the algal species present and the densities on those algae. To maintain a constant voltage from the system under differing conditions of algal carbon fixation the external resistance can be adjusted to obtain a desired voltage.\nIt is important to remember that the current cell design is dependent on oxidation of aluminum and therefore does not yet constitute a stand-alone sustainable energy source. It may however be used as a way to liberate the energy stored in the reduced metal in a portable manner. This would allow aluminum to be used effectively as an energy storage medium for transferring energy from areas that have access to large reserves of renewable energy, such as hydroelectric power, to areas that do not. Further research may allow power to be generated directly from the pH gradient that occurs when photosynthetic carbon fixation is separated from respiration. Figure S3 Diagram of the circuit used to measure pH and voltage continuously. Common grounding within the data logger requires the pH channel and the algal cell voltage channel to be alternately measured so they do not interfere with the measurement. In this circuit two 9 V sources run through an oscillator which alternately connects and disconnects each 9 V source for 30 seconds. When connected, the current activates an NPN transistor, which acts as an electronic switch, allowing the voltage from the cell to continue on to the data logger shown to the right. For pH measurement the transistor gates a low voltage output from the pH meter. This output continues on to an OpAmp where the signal is amplified to be within the optimal voltage range of the data logger. Circuit diagram was drawn in circuitlab (www.circuitlab.com).
