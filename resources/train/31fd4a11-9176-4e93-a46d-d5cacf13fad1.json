[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: For elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis, aggressive immunosuppression can be difficult to tolerate, and surgery remains an important treatment option for joint pain and deformity. We sought to examine the epidemiology of surgical reconstruction for rheumatoid arthritis among older individuals who were newly diagnosed with the disorder.\nWe identified a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries (sixty-six years of age and older) newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis from 2000 to 2005, and followed these patients longitudinally for a mean of 4.6 years. We used univariate analysis to compare the time from the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis to the first operation among the 360 patients who underwent surgery during the study period.\nResults: In our study cohort, 589 procedures were performed among 360 patients, and 132 patients (37%) underwent multiple procedures. The rate of upper extremity reconstruction was 0.9%, the rate of lower extremity reconstruction was 1.2%, and knee arthroplasty was the most common procedure performed initially (31%) and overall (29%). Upper extremity procedures were performed sooner than lower extremity procedures (fourteen versus twenty-five months; p = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, surgery rates declined with age for upper and lower extremity procedures (p < 0.001).\nConclusions: Knee replacement remains the most common initial procedure among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\nHowever, upper extremity procedures are performed earlier than lower extremity procedures. Understanding the patient and provider factors that underlie variation in procedure rates can inform future strategies to improve the delivery of care to patients with rheumatoid arthritis."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "T he prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis has risen in recent years, resulting in substantial increases in rheumatoid arthritis-associated disability, cost, and mortality [1] [2] [3] . Furthermore, rheumatoid arthritis is increasingly concentrated among elderly individuals, and nearly 50% of patients who are newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis are sixty-five years of age and older 4 . Although there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, early treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can slow disease progression and has rapidly become the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed disease 5 .\nUnlike young individuals, elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis are less likely to receive treatment with DMARDs 6, 7 , are more likely to suffer from multiple comorbid conditions requiring additional medications, and may be more sensitive to drug interactions and polypharmacy [8] [9] [10] . Additionally, complications from potent immunosuppressive medications may be more difficult for elderly individuals to tolerate; drug metabolism may be markedly different among older individuals 11, 12 . Rheumatoid arthritis-related joint and soft-tissue reconstructive procedures can predictably correct deformity, avoid flexion contraction, alleviate pain, and improve function and quality of life 13, 14 . Furthermore, surgical reconstruction for the upper extremity can often be performed on an outpatient basis under regional anesthetic, minimizing the physiologic stress of surgery. However, surgery is often considered only in the late stage of rheumatoid arthritis for patients who have developed severe pain, joint destruction, or function loss with failure to respond to pharmaceutical therapy 13, 15, 16 . Moreover, the patient and provider factors that influence the timing of surgery are not well understood.\nGiven the aging population in the United States, defining the epidemiology of rheumatoid arthritis-related procedures among elderly patients can identify potential areas of unmet need and systematic differences in treatment. In this context, we examined the incidence of upper and lower extremity procedures performed for rheumatoid arthritisrelated deformities among a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries in the United States. Our purpose was to define the timing and rates of upper and lower limb reconstructive procedures performed following the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. We hypothesized that overall rates of upper and lower limb reconstruction decline with age and are significantly associated with sociodemographic factors and regional density of specialists. To identify new cases, we excluded patients with any rheumatoid arthritis-related claims twelve months before their first diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis after 2000, and this study cohort was followed until the end of 2010. We used Medicare Inpatient, Outpatient, and Carrier claim files to identify rheumatoid arthritis diagnoses and health-care utilization during the study period. These files contain fee-for-service claims data submitted by the inpatient institution, outpatient institution, and physicians. Diagnoses were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes, and surgical procedures were coded by ICD-9 procedure codes (Medicare Inpatient files) or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (Medicare Outpatient and Carrier files). We included only patients with greater than two outpatient services with rheumatoid arthritis as the primary diagnosis (ICD-9 codes 714.0, 714.1, 714.2, 714.3, and 714.4), seven to 365 days apart between 2000 and 2005, to increase the reliability of the rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. Patients entered the study cohort on the date of first rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis if they were without any rheumatoid arthritis-related claims in the prior twelve months, and stayed in the cohort until death or disenrollment from Medicare."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Creation of the Study Cohort", "text": "We used the Medicare Beneficiary Summary file to capture demographic and enrollment information of patients. Our cohort only included patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were sixty-six years or older on entry into the study and were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B for at least twelve months before the first diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis during the study period. Patients younger than sixty-six years enrolled in Medicare for other indications were specifically excluded. We excluded all of the patients who were Health Maintenance Organization (Part C) enrollees at any time during the study period because of the lack of their Part-B data in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Outcome Variables", "text": "We followed patients until December 31, 2010, to determine the rate of rheumatoid arthritis-related reconstructive surgery of the upper and lower extremities. The time from diagnosis to surgery was measured for each patient in years. We calculated the rate of surgery as the probability of undergoing surgery within the study period. The ICD-9 procedure codes and CPT codes used to identify each procedure are listed in a table in the Appendix. Upper extremity procedures included arthroplasty of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand; arthrodesis of the hand and wrist; synovectomy of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand; and tendon repair, transfer, and tenolysis for the hand and fingers. Lower extremity procedures included arthroplasty of the hip and knee and arthrodesis, arthroplasty, and synovectomy of the ankle and foot. To identify joint and soft-tissue reconstructive surgical procedures performed for the management of rheumatoid arthritis, we only used claims with CPT codes for these procedures coded under a principal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in the claims, indicating that the procedure performed was related to rheumatoid arthritis."}, {"section_title": "Patient and Provider Characteristics", "text": "We obtained baseline patient characteristics for each study subject. Age was categorized in the following groups: sixty-six to sixty-nine, seventy to seventyfour, seventy-five to seventy-nine, and eighty years and older. Race was defined as white, black, and other. Socioeconomic status was estimated from the residence zip code of the beneficiaries and the income, education, and occupation summary of the U.S. zip codes from the 2000 U.S. Census 17 . We calculated the score for comorbidities on the basis of the Elixhauser comorbidity index as an indicator of overall health condition 18, 19 . To examine regional differences, we included the density of rheumatologists and of orthopaedic surgeons. To do this, we obtained the hospital referral region where each subject resided by linking their residence zip code to the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care hospital referral region level data 20 . We then linked hospital referral region identifiers to the Dartmouth Atlas physician capacity data for the density of specialists (rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons) in the region of each subject's residence (the number of specialists per one million residents in the region). Finally, we included residence location, categorized as metropolitan areas versus nonmetropolitan or rural areas, into the analysis to help control for potential differences in rheumatoid arthritis care introduced by geographic variation. We did this by linking the residence zip code of each study subject to the Federal Information Processing Standards codes in the 2013 U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum Codes for Metro and Nonmetro counties 21 ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "We performed univariate analysis of the data on patients undergoing rheumatoid arthritis-related surgery to assess the effect of patient and regional factors on the timing of surgery. We used the median time interval from diagnosis to surgery by patient characteristics rather than the mean time interval because of the outliers in each patient group. We specifically used the Kruskal-Wallis test, which is a nonparametric test that does not assume normal distribution and can be used in the comparison of medians 22 . To examine the factors that influence the probability of undergoing rheumatoid arthritis-related surgery among patients newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, we used survival analysis to determine receipt of initial surgery and the time to event. Patients who did not have any operation for rheumatoid arthritis were censored. We performed multivariable analyses examining the risk of receiving rheumatoid arthritis-related upper extremity surgery and lower extremity surgery, using a Cox proportional-hazards model with patient sociodemographics, comorbidity score, and density of rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons in the residence area as covariates to control for these factors simultaneously. Significance was set at an alpha level of 0.05.

In our study cohort, age was approximately evenly "}, {"section_title": "405", "text": "distributed among each category. The majority of the subjects were female (76%) and white (85%). Comorbid conditions were categorized using the Elixhauser method to account for the number and severity of illnesses, which were then divided into even quartiles. Regionally, 81% of the patients resided in metropolitan areas.\nWe captured 295 rheumatoid arthritis-related upper extremity surgeries (158 patients) and 294 lower extremity surgeries (215 patients). In our cohort, 589 procedures were performed in 360 patients, and 132 patients (37%) underwent multiple procedures. Thirteen patients had both upper extremity and lower extremity procedures. The average rates of upper and lower extremity surgery performed after a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis were thirty-four and thirty-six procedures per 10,000 patients per year, respectively (Table II) . Among those procedures, 77% were performed during the initial rheumatoid arthritis-related operation and 23% were performed after the initial operation during the follow-up. The most common initial procedure performed was total or partial knee replacement (31%), followed by hip replacement (15%), hand arthroplasty (10%), and tendon reconstruction and/or muscle release in the hand (8%). Among hand procedures, the most commonly performed was metacarpophalangeal arthroplasty (16%), followed by metacarpophalangeal joint synovectomy (13%) and arthrodesis of the interphalangeal joint (11%). Repair or transfer of flexor or extensor tendons comprised 15% of all hand procedures. Overall, the rate of upper extremity reconstruction was 0.9% and the rate of lower extremity reconstruction was 1.2%. In our cohort, upper extremity procedures were performed sooner than lower extremity procedures (fourteen versus twenty-five months; p = 0.02). Among the patients who had at least one procedure for rheumatoid arthritis, older patients underwent surgery sooner than younger patients. For example, the median time between the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and having upper extremity surgery was thirty-one months for sixty-six to sixty-nine-year-old patients and only one month for patients who were eighty years of age or older (p < 0.001). A greater number of comorbidities was associated with earlier upper (p = 0.04) and lower extremity surgery (p = 0.01). Finally, patients who received state assistance for their Medicare premium underwent the first upper extremity surgery earlier than did patients who did not require assistance (two months versus twenty months; p = 0.01) (Table III) .\nThe multivariable analysis of factors that influenced the probability of receiving rheumatoid arthritis-related surgery during the study period is given in a table in the Appendix. Patients who were eighty years of age or older were less likely to undergo upper extremity surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16 to 0.49) than were patients who were sixty-six to sixty-nine years old. Black patients were less likely to receive upper extremity surgery than were white patients (HR, 0.24; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.76). Regional factors were also associated with the timing and probability of surgery. Patients who resided in regions with the greatest density of rheumatologists were less likely to undergo upper extremity surgery than were patients who lived in regions with the fewest rheumatologists (HR, 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.89). Conversely, a higher density of orthopaedic surgeons was associated with a higher probability of receiving surgery after diagnosis (HR, 1.62; 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.47). For lower extremity surgery, patients at least eighty years of age had a lower probability of surgery (HR, 0.25; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.41). Furthermore, patients who lived in a nonmetropolitan area had a lower rate of surgery per unit of time compared with metropolitan residents (HR, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.48 to 0.94). Finally, patients who received assistance from the state for the monthly Medicare premium had a higher probability of undergoing lower extremity surgery after the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis than patients who did not receive assistance (HR, 1.88, 95% CI: 1.09 to 3.23)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "I n this study of Medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, approximately 2% of the individuals underwent upper and/or lower extremity reconstruction. The majority of patients underwent surgery within three years following diagnosis, and the most common initial rheumatoid arthritis-related reconstructive surgery was knee arthroplasty (31%). Rates of surgery declined with advancing age, even after controlling for comorbid conditions and sociodemographic factors. Upper extremity procedures were performed sooner than lower extremity procedures and were influenced by the regional density of specialists.\nIn our cohort, rates of surgery were low, consistent with prior studies that have demonstrated the declining rate of surgical intervention for rheumatoid arthritis-related joint deformities [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Although advances in medical treatment could explain these phenomena, this may not be true for older individuals. In our study, older individuals remained less likely to receive surgery, and elderly individuals are less likely than younger individuals to have access to outpatient clinic care for rheumatologic complaints 24, 29, 30 . Additionally, we found that the patients eighty years of age or older who did undergo surgery had the surgery much sooner after diagnosis than did younger patients. This trend may suggest that patients who are diagnosed later in life may either have a delay in diagnosis or have a more aggressive course [31] [32] [33] . It is possible that elderly individuals may rely on hand function, strength, and dexterity to maintain independence with activities of daily living and self-care. They may be more sensitive to declines in range of motion or pain than are younger individuals and may seek surgical intervention earlier to preserve mobility and function 34, 35 . Therefore, early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis may improve patient outcomes because of the early initiation of medication and rehabilitation therapy.\nOur study has several notable limitations. First, our findings were drawn from Medicare claims, which may be subject to coding errors inherent in administrative data. For example, it is not feasible to apply clinical guidelines, such as the American College of Rheumatology criteria, to identify newly diagnosed cases in Medicare claims data because of the lack of available clinical outcomes, laboratory findings, and selfreported symptom measures. However, a recent study comparing the reliability of diagnosis identification between office records and Medicare claims revealed a 90% correlation between these two data sources 36 . Medicare data have been widely used to examine treatment patterns, and they provide robust data owing to large, population-based samples. Compared with clinical trials or observational registries that are biased toward tertiary care centers, CMS claims data reflect real-world clinical practice [36] [37] [38] . Another limitation of our study is that, as a result of using Medicare claims data for outpatient services, we were unable to capture medication use during the study period, which may influence surgical rates. Ample evidence shows that the use of DMARDs, especially a combination of DMARDs, is effective in retarding disease progression, including joint destruction [39] [40] [41] [42] . However, given the period from which our study cohort was drawn, we were unable to adequately determine the use of DMARDs among older patients with rheumatoid arthritis because of variation in prescription medication coverage. Although we adjusted for provider density, future studies examining the effect of medication regimens on surgical rates are warranted. Additionally, we do not have information regarding disease severity or the indications for specific surgical procedures. Although administrative data lack this granularity, future studies that incorporate patient-reported outcome and detailed clinical data may provide insight into the nuances of surgical rates among elderly individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care data currently do not contain the density of hand surgeons in each hospital referral region as a physician capacity measure. Thus, we did not include this variable in the analysis as one of the predictors of rheumatoid arthritis-related upper extremity surgery.\nNonetheless, our study provides a new perspective on the epidemiology of surgical reconstruction for extremity disability among elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DMARD use among elderly individuals is less aggressive and initiated later than for younger patients with rheumatoid arthritis 6-10 , and elderly patients may have progression to debilitating joint pain and deformity more quickly than younger individuals [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . Elderly patients could be considered earlier for surgical therapy in order to preserve extremity function and mobility. Surgery among the elderly is well tolerated and could potentially improve overall quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living and maintain independence 49, 50 . Additionally, patients with profound deformities report a benefit from surgery, even with relatively modest gains in arc of motion or ulnar drift 14, 51 . Furthermore, although DMARDs are associated with an increased risk of complications with lower extremity procedures, this may not be true for upper extremity procedures [52] [53] [54] . The most common complications after rheumatoid arthritis-related surgical treatments include surgical site infection and venous thromboembolism [54] [55] [56] [57] . Other complications, such as implant dislocation, instability, and failure, occur frequently in both large and small joints and often require revision [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . However, prior research on complications after rheumatoid arthritis-related hand procedures is limited compared with studies regarding the complications after lower extremity surgical procedures. Finally, unlike lower extremity reconstructive procedures, upper extremity procedures are often performed on an outpatient basis, with relatively few readmissions and low mortality rates.\nIt has been suggested that the reconstructive sequence for rheumatoid arthritis-related joint destruction should address proximal joints prior to distal joints and lower extremity joints prior to upper extremity joints. In our cohort, knee and hip arthroplasties were among the most common initial procedures and comprised 46% of all initial procedures. Notably, over half of patients undergo upper extremity reconstruction initially for rheumatoid arthritis-related deformity 63 . Although the indications for surgery are not clear from administrative data, for elderly individuals, maintaining pain-free hand function and dexterity may be critical to activities of daily living and maintaining independence. For many patients with rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatologists provide the majority of care and direct the referral patterns for all aspects of their care. Therefore, differences in attitudes regarding the effectiveness of surgical treatment between rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons may explain differences in rheumatoid arthritis-related upper extremity surgery among regions with differing densities of subspecialist care 13 . Alternatively, lower rates of surgery could also be due to increased access to DMARDs to slow the progress of disease. Finally, it is possible that health behaviors regarding compliance and prevention differ geographically [64] [65] [66] [67] . To better control for these potential differences, we included data on metropolitan and nonmetropolitan or rural residence in our measures.\nRates of extremity surgery for rheumatoid arthritis are low among elderly individuals, and this surgery is more commonly performed in the early years following diagnosis. Future studies comparing the relative effectiveness of medical and surgical therapy on the preservation of function among elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis can inform the management of this common and challenging disease."}]
