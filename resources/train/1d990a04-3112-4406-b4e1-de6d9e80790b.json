[{"section_title": "", "text": "What percentage of students enrolled in associate's and bachelor's degree programs had changed their majors within 3 years of initial enrollment? Within 3 years of initial enrollment, about 30 percent of undergraduates in associate's and bachelor's degree programs who had declared a major had changed their major at least once (figure 1). About one-third of students enrolled in bachelor's degree programs changed majors, compared with 28 percent of those enrolled in associate's degree programs. About 1 in 10 students changed majors more than once: 10 percent of associate's degree students and 9 percent of bachelor's degree students.

The rate at which students changed majors varied by their original field of study. Whereas 35 percent of students who had originally declared a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) major had changed their field of study within 3 years, 29 percent of those who had originally declared a non-STEM major had done so (figure 2). \u2022 About half (52 percent) of students whose original declared major was mathematics switched majors within 3 years. Mathematics majors changed majors at a rate higher than that of students in all other fields, both STEM and non-STEM, except the natural sciences. \u2022 Among students in STEM fields, those majoring in computer and information sciences and in engineering and engineering technology changed majors at lower rates than did students majoring in either natural sciences or mathematics (28 and 32 percent vs. 40 and 52 percent, respectively). \u2022 Students whose original major was computer and information sciences changed majors at a rate that was lower than the rates for students who originally majored in humanities and education, but was not statistically different from those of students who majored in any other non-STEM field. \u2022 Among students in non-STEM fields, those in other applied fields had the lowest rates of major change (22 percent), followed by students in health care fields (26 percent). FIGURE 2. Percentage of 2011-12 beginning postsecondary students who ever changed majors, by original declared field of study: 2014 This National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Data Point presents information on education topics of interest. It was authored by Katherine Leu of RTI International. Estimates based on samples are subject to sampling variability, and apparent differences may not be statistically significant. All noted differences are statistically significant at the .05 level. In the design, conduct, and data processing of NCES surveys, efforts are made to minimize the effects of nonsampling errors, such as item nonresponse, measurement error, data processing error, or other systematic error."}]
