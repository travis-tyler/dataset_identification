[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Brain-predicted age difference scores are calculated by subtracting chronological age from 'brain' age. Positive scores reflect accelerated ageing and are associated with increased mortality risk and poorer physical function. To date, however, the relationship between brainpredicted age difference scores and specific cognitive functions has not been systematically examined. First, applying machine learning to 1,359 T1-weighted MRI scans, we predicted the relationship between chronological age and voxel-wise grey matter data. This model was then applied to MRI data from three independent datasets, significantly predicting chronological age: Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University (n=175), the Cognitive Reserve/Reference Ability Neural Network study (n=380), and The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (n=487). Each independent dataset had rich neuropsychological data. Brain-predicted age difference scores were significantly negatively correlated with general cognitive status (two datasets); processing speed, visual attention, cognitive flexibility (three datasets); visual attention and cognitive flexibility (two datasets); and semantic verbal fluency (two datasets). They were not significantly correlated with processing speed, cognitive flexibility, response inhibition and selective attention, sustained attention, verbal episodic memory or working memory in any dataset. As such, there is firm evidence of correlations between increased brain-predicted age differences and reduced cognitive function only in some domains that are implicated in cognitive ageing."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Longitudinal neuropsychological testing in older adults can be used to detect cognitive decline. However, practice effects can obscure assessment of cognitive ability (Elman et al., 2018) , and test performance is affected by subject-level factors such as the individual's level of comprehension, reading ability, self-efficacy, motivation, fatigue, and fluctuations in concentration (McCaffrey & Westervelt, 1995) . In contrast, objective biomarkers are not subject to such biases or patients' physical limitations (Jollans & Whelan, 2016 ). An objective biomarker of cognitive ageing would therefore be useful for the timely identification of cognitive decline outside of age-related norms.\nAgeing is a process with significant heterogeneity across individuals (McCrory & Kenny, 2018) . Consequently, chronological age is not the most accurate marker of an individual's rate of biological ageing (Sprott, 2010) . Ageing biomarkers have been developed that provide additional information about an individual's health status and life expectancy (Dean & Morgan, 1988) . For example, DNA methylation data can estimate epigenetic ageing ('epigenetic clocks'), reflecting the age of an individual's tissues or blood cells (Fiorito et al., 2019) . Subtracting chronological age from the biological age results in a biologically informative summary scorethe predicted age differencefor each individual, which reflects the deviation from typical lifespan trajectories (Richard et al., 2018) . This approach has also been applied in neuroimaging, where machine learning can be used to quantify the relationship between structural MRI data and chronological age, in order to estimate an individual's 'brain age'. Subtracting chronological age from the estimated 'brain age' results in a brain predicted-age difference score (brainPAD, also referred to as brain age gap, brainAGE, Brain-Age Score; (Beheshti, Maikusa, & Matsuda, 2018; Franke, Ziegler, Kl\u00f6ppel, & Gaser, 2010; Schnack et al., 2016) which quantifies how a person's brain health differs from what would be expected for their chronological age.\nBrainPAD is a promising biomarker of general brain ageing as it already satisfies several criteria for ageing biomarkers (Butler et al., 2004) . BrainPAD is predictive of mortality (Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018) and of age-sensitive physiological measures, including grip strength, lung function, walking speed and allostatic load (Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018) .\nMoreover, BrainPAD could potentially be used as a biomarker of cognitive ageing as it is negatively correlated with fluid cognitive performance (Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018) and is significantly increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Franke & Gaser, 2012; Gaser et al., 2013; L\u00f6we, Gaser, & Franke, 2016) . However, the potential of brainPAD as a cognitive ageing biomarker is currently limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the exact relationship between brainPAD and specific cognitive functions in healthy individuals.\nStudies relating specific cognitive functions and brainPAD have been assessed in solely clinical samples (e.g., Cole et al. (2015) , traumatic brain injury), or in mixed samples of clinical groups and healthy controls (e.g., Beheshti et al. (2018) ; AD, MCI, and healthy controls) and not samples comprised only of healthy adults. As such, the reported associations between brainPAD and specific domains of cognitive function in such studies (Beheshti et al., 2018; Cole et al., 2015) may be skewed towards significance by the inclusion of the clinical samples with typically higher brainPADs. Consequently, these findings may not represent the brainPAD-cognition relationship in normal ageing. For example, Le and colleagues (2018) reported a significant negative correlation between brainPAD and response inhibition and selective attention in a sample of individuals comprised of healthy controls and patients with mood or anxiety disorders, substance use disorder and/or eating disorders. However, significantly increased brainPADs have been reported in mood disorders such as major depression (Koutsouleris et al., 2014) and in substance use disorders such as alcohol dependence (Guggenmos et al., 2017) . As both major depression and alcohol dependence are associated with cognitive impairments (Chanraud et al., 2007; McIntyre et al., 2013) , the significant brainPAD-cognitive function correlations reported across samples including such populations could be driven by the inclusion of such clinical groups.\nThe relationship between specific cognitive functions and BrainPAD has also been somewhat obscured by statistical considerations. Recent work has empirically demonstrated that chronological age must be controlled for when testing relationships between brainPAD and cognitive functions (Le et al., 2018; Smith, Vidaurre, Alfaro-Almagro, Nichols, & Miller, 2019) . Failure to correct for chronological age can result in false positive findings because some cognitive variables are correlated with chronological agebut not brain ageingand brainPAD is typically correlated with chronological age (Le et al., 2018) . In light of this recent work, it is difficult to interpret studies that did not control for chronological age when investigating the brainPAD-cognition relationship in healthy controls (Franke, Gaser, Manor, & Novak, 2013; L\u00f6we et al., 2016) . A second statistical issue is a failure to correct for multiple comparisons. Researchers testing the brainPAD-cognition relationship have tended to carry out multiple statistical tests of the correlation between brainPAD and various cognitive measures. The performance of multiple statistical tests can increase the Type I error and result in false positive findings (Ranganathan, Pramesh, & Buyse, 2016) . However, some papers did not control for multiple comparisons when investigating the brainPAD-cognition relationship (Beheshti et al., 2018; Cole, Underwood, et al., 2017) . Other studies have investigated the relationship between brainPAD and specific domains of cognitive function while controlling for chronological age and multiple comparisons, but there are conflicting results for most cognitive domains. For example, a significant correlation between verbal fluency and brainPAD was reported by Franke and colleagues (2013) whereas Richard and colleagues (2018) found no association between verbal fluency and brainPAD. We have summarized the brainPADcognition findings in Table 1. The first step in generating a brainPAD score is creating a feature set of neuroimaging data which is correlated with chronological age. Neuroimaging data have high dimensionality, which can result in overfitting and overoptimistic predictions (Whelan & Garavan, 2014) . Brain age prediction models thus rely on feature engineering techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA; Franke et al., 2010; Gutierrez Becker, Klein, & Wachinger, 2018) or even dot products of different features (e.g. vectors of GM and white matter (WM) voxels as in Cole et al., 2015; Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018; Cole, Underwood, et al., 2017) in order to reduce the dimensionality (Mwangi, Tian, & Soares, 2014) . Although these models ultimately create generalizable and accurate predictions, these come at the cost of reduced interpretability of the contributions of the features (Bunea et al., 2011; Mateos-P\u00e9rez et al., 2018) , which is important for assessing the neurobiological validity of the model (Woo, Chang, Lindquist, & Wager, 2017) and to identify specific brain areas for further investigation (Scheinost et al., 2019) . An alternative to applying PCA or other data reduction techniques is to use penalized regression methods such as the Elastic Net (Zou & Hastie, 2005) , with only one class of features (e.g. GM voxels) as input. GM data is particularly well-suited for age prediction as GM volume linearly declines with age (but cf. Fjell et al., 2013) whereas WM volume has a less straightforward relationship with age, as it doesn't decline significantly until middle age (Farokhian, Yang, Beheshti, Matsuda, & Wu, 2017; Ge et al., 2002) . The Elastic Net is a machine learning model well-suited to the high dimensionality and multicollinearity inherent in neuroimaging data as shown by the finding that it produced the most consistent predictions as compared to various other models over datasets with varying sample-, feature set-, and effect-sizes (Jollans et al., in revision) .\nA final challenge in the development of neuroimaging biomarkers, or neuromarkers, is ensuring the generalisability of the neuromarker to new data. For practical reasons, crossvalidation, where a dataset is split into a training set and a test set , is often used as an estimate of model accuracy for new data (Jollans & Whelan, 2018; Scheinost et al., 2019) . However, cross-validation accuracy estimates are often optimistically biased and can vary considerably , particularly when preprocessing and feature selection are carried out on the entire dataset before splitting it into training and test sets (Dwyer, Falkai, & Koutsouleris, 2018; Woo et al., 2017) . As such, the gold-standard for assessing the external validity and generalisability of a neuromarker is by testing how the model performs on a completely independent held-out dataset (Jollans & Whelan, 2018) .\nWhile various brainPAD studies have externally validated their models (Beheshti et al., 2018; Cole et al., 2015; Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018; Cole, Underwood, et al., 2017; Franke et al., 2010; Gutierrez Becker et al., 2018; Lancaster, Lorenz, Leech, & Cole, 2018; Liem et al., 2017; Madan & Kensinger, 2018; Varikuti et al., 2018) , only a few studies have reported model performance in terms of accuracy (i.e., correlation or mean absolute error between brainpredicted age and chronological age) on the external validation dataset (Cole et al., 2015; Lancaster et al., 2018; Liem et al., 2017; Madan & Kensinger, 2018) . This does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the models whose accuracy is reported in terms of internal crossvalidation performance. However, not reporting the external validation performance limits the interpretation of the accuracy and generalisability of various brainPAD models as typically performance will be lower in the external validation dataset.\nIn order to clarify the unclear relationship between brainPAD and specific domains of cognitive function, we aimed to 1) establish an interpretable model of brainPAD using the Elastic Net with GM voxel-wise data, 2) externally validate this model in three independent datasets, and 3) to establish the domains of cognitive function that are reliably correlated with brainPAD across different datasets."}, {"section_title": "Table 1", "text": "Summary of findings on the relationship between brainPAD and cognitive function, indicating whether results were statistically significant (Sig.), statistically significant in healthy controls (Sig. in HCs) , adjusted for age (Age adj.) and corrected for multiple comparisons (MC corr.

The weighted MAE is equal to the MAE divided by the age range of the sample tested and is a more suitable metric for comparing the MAE of brainPAD models across studies as it accounts for the impact of a sample's age range on prediction accuracy (Cole, Franke, & Cherbuin, 2018) .

To correct for the proportional bias in the model, the prediction was added to the intercept of the training set, and the result was then divided by the slope of the training set. This correction does not affect the relationship between brainPAD and outcome measures but scales the data correctly so that brainPAD scores can be interpreted in units of years proportional to a person's chronological age. Similar corrections have been applied in other brainPAD models (Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018) . BrainPAD was calculated by subtracting chronological age from the corrected predicted age, hence, a positive brainPAD value indicates a brain-predicted age that exceeds the participant's chronological age, suggesting accelerated brain ageing.

In order to assess the relative predictive weight for each voxel and to extract the AAL region of interest in which each voxel was situated, the absolute value of the coefficient values were ranked from largest to smallest (using a custom MATLAB function get_beta_labels.m). As a brief overview, the 20 largest negative and positive coefficient values are shown in tables 4 and 5, respectively (see attached excel sheet for coefficient values for all voxels). Voxels with positive coefficient values contributed to older brain age predictions and voxels with negative coefficient values contributed to younger brain age predictions. \nIn addition to the good interpretability of our model, the model is also biologically plausible as the top 20 brain voxels contributing to older brain age are all located in brain regions previously shown to be vulnerable to age-related GM volumetric decline, including the insula (Good et al., 2001; Kennedy et al., 2009; Resnick, Pham, Kraut, Zonderman, & Davatzikos, 2003; Taki et al., 2011) , thalamus (Abe et al., 2008; Sullivan, Rosenbloom, Serventi, & Pfefferbaum, 2004; Taki et al., 2011; Walhovd et al., 2005) , and temporal cortex (Abe et al., 2008) . Within the temporal cortex specifically, there were strong contributions to older brain age from voxels in the temporal pole, where there are negative ageing effects on GM volume (Allen, Bruss, Brown, & Damasio, 2005; Lemaitre et al., 2012) . Voxels within temporal lobe structures, such as the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus also strongly contributed to older brain age which is in line with evidence of age-related volumetric declines in the left amygdala (Giorgio et al., 2010) , bilateral hippocampus (Giorgio et al., 2010; Jernigan et al., 2001) and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (Jernigan et al., 2001; Taki et al., 2011) . Similarly, another heavily weighted contribution to brain age was found from a voxel within the left precentral gyrus, where GM volume is negatively associated with age (Kennedy et al., 2009; Taki et al., 2011) . Finally, there was a strong contribution from a voxel within the cerebellar vermis, where there are increased rates of GM volume loss during ageing in comparison to other areas of the cerebellum (Yu, Korgaonkar, & Grieve, 2017) .\nThe voxels which contributed most strongly to an older brain age were located within regions vulnerable to age-related GM volumetric decline. However, some of the voxels that contributed most strongly to a younger brain age were found adjacent to the negatively weighted voxels. One potential explanation is that brainPAD measures GM atrophy, and therefore individuals with relatively less atrophy will have higher GM density on the edges of the cortex and subcortical structures. In contrast, individuals with more atrophy will have greater GM density distal from the edges of the cortex (when registered in standard space), and consequently positively weighted voxels (i.e., which contributed to older brain age) were located in those distal regions."}, {"section_title": "BrainPAD and Cognitive Function", "text": "Across multiple datasets, higher brainPAD scores were significantly correlated with reduced performance on measures of general cognitive status, semantic verbal fluency, processing speed, cognitive flexibility, and visual attention (see Figure 3 and Table 6 ).

However, brainPAD was not significantly correlated with the MMSE in TILDA. Nonetheless, given the statistically significant replication across two of the three datasets, there is reliable evidence in support of the correlation between brainPAD and general cognitive status in healthy older adults. Previous studies have reported that brainPAD is related to general cognitive status, albeit in samples including individuals with MCI, AD, or dementia (Beheshti et al., 2018; Kaufmann et al., 2018) , and without adjusting for the effect of age or controlling for multiple comparisons (Beheshti et al., 2018; Cole, Underwood, et al., 2017 ; but see Table 1 Footnote 4 for information about adjusting for age in Cole, Underwood et al., 2017) . In contrast to our findings, Gaser et al. (2013) reported that brainPAD was correlated with the CDR and ADAS but not the MMSE in an MCI sample.\nHowever, Gaser et al. (2013) did not account for the effect of age. While L\u00f6we et al. (2016) reported that brainPAD was negatively correlated with the MMSE across mixed samples of APOE e4 carriers and non-carriers (including healthy controls, MCI, and AD), it was not significantly correlated with the MMSE within healthy control and MCI subgroups. Sample sizes within these subgroups were relatively small, ranging from 14 to 81 participants.\nConsequently, the correlations between brainPAD and the MMSE in these participants may not have been adequately powered to reach significance. Our study is the first to report a relationship between brainPAD and measures of general cognitive status in healthy adults while controlling for the effects of age and correcting for multiple comparisons. This is also the first study to investigate the relationship between brainPAD and DRS score. Our findings provide strong support for the existence of a significant negative relationship between brainPAD and general cognitive status.\nIt was beyond the scope of the present study to formally test associations between brain areas contributing to brainPAD and cognitive measures. The voxels that best predicted chronological age were found in the thalamus, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala. There is previous evidence of positive correlations between the MMSE and GM volume within the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus (Dinomais et al., 2016) , and the thalamus (Ferrarini et al., 2008; Yi et al., 2016) , and between the DRS and combined GM and WM volume within the left hippocampus (Fama et al., 1997) . In our brainPAD model, voxels within these areas were among the 20 voxels most heavily contributing to brainPAD.\nHowever, it is more appropriate to consider brainPAD as a summary score representing global brain atrophy as it was driven by contributions from voxels spread across the brain. Impaired performance on the MMSE is also associated with global brain (Fox, Scahill, Crum, & Rossor, 1999; Mak et al., 2015) and GM atrophy (Brunetti et al., 2000) . Similarly, there is a positive relationship between DRS and total cortical GM volume (Stout, Jernigan, Archibald, & Salmon, 1996) . As such, the correlation between brainPAD and general cognitive status is supported by previous evidence of brain changes related to performance on these measures. This strengthens the argument in favour of brainPAD as an objective measure of general cognitive function given that brainPAD is not subject to the various biases and effects (e.g. low reliability, practice effects) that limit the MMSE (Galasko, Abramson, Corey-Bloom, & Thal, 1993; Pfeffer, Kurosaki, Chance, Filos, & Bates, 1984; Tombaugh & McIntyre, 1992) and the DRS (Emery, Gillie, & Smith, 1996; Green, Woodard, & Green, 1995) ."}, {"section_title": "Semantic Verbal Fluency", "text": "BrainPAD was significantly negatively correlated with semantic verbal fluency, as measured using the Animals task, in both DEU and CR/RANN but not in TILDA. Regardless, the replication of this result across both DEU and CR/RANN was statistically significant. This finding contradicts non-significant correlations between brainPAD and composite measures of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency (Cole, Underwood, et al., 2017; Richard et al., 2018) , although the former study used age-adjusted t-scores to control for the age-cognition relationship rather than adding age as a covariate to the brainPAD-fluency measure (cf. Le et al., 2018) . As semantic verbal fluency is associated with age (Clark et al., 2009; Santos Nogueira, Azevedo Reis, & Vieira, 2016) , the failure to adjust for age may have obscured a significant effect. Alternatively, these previously reported non-significant correlations could be explained by the use of composite measures of both phonemic and semantic fluency as we did not find strong evidence for a relationship between phonemic verbal fluency and brainPAD (although it was significant in DEU, this correlation was not replicated in CR/RANN).\nTherefore, it is possible that a non-significant relationship between phonemic fluency and brainPAD in the and Richard et al. (2018) study may have diluted a possible significant relationship between semantic fluency and brainPAD. In a study controlling for age, brainPAD was found to significantly negatively correlate with semantic verbal fluency . The brainPAD-semantic verbal fluency correlation is further supported by evidence that some voxels that contribute heavily to brainPAD in our model are located in regions where GM volume has been positively correlated with semantic verbal fluency, including the cerebellum (Grogan, Green, Ali, Crinion, & Price, 2009 ) and the thalamus, in adolescents born prematurely (Gim\u00e9nez et al., 2006) , and in regions where lesions have been negatively related to semantic verbal fluency, such as the left temporal lobe and insula (Baldo, Schwartz, Wilkins, & Dronkers, 2006 ). Although the Animals task has been described as an optimal test of neuropsychological function (Ardila, Ostrosky-Sol\u00eds, & Bernal, 2006 ), scores on this task are affected by various factors, including scoring and administration procedures (Woods, Wyma, Herron, & Yund, 2016) and practice effects (Cooper et al., 2001; Harrison, Buxton, Husain, & Wise, 2000; Wilson, Watson, Baddeley, Emslie, & Evans, 2000) . As such, brainPAD, as an objective marker of general brain health and global cognitive function, could be a viable alternative to the Animals task. In sum, our results provide further evidence in support of a correlation between brainPAD and semantic verbal fluency."}, {"section_title": "Processing speed, visual attention, and cognitive flexibility", "text": "Across all three datasets, brainPAD was negatively correlated with processing speed, visual attention, and cognitive flexibility as measured by trail-making tests (TMT B or CTT 2).\nThe TMT B is a relatively sensitive measure of cognitive decline: completion times were shown to be significantly different between healthy controls, MCI, and AD (Ashendorf et al., 2008) .\nLikewise, the CTT 2 is sensitive to cognitive decline, with differences between AD and healthy controls (Lin et al., 2014) , and between healthy controls, MCI, and AD (Guo et al., 2010) .\nTherefore, it is no surprise that processing speed, visual attention, and cognitive flexibility were also negatively correlated with an index of accelerated brain ageing. Indeed, previous studies have reported similar results for trail-making versus brainPAD; however, these studies did not correct for multiple comparisons (Cole, Underwood, et al., 2017) or used clinical samples (TBI; Cole et al., 2015) . Our data therefore augment these findings by replicating this result across three independent datasets. Tentative neurobiological support can be found for this correlation in the overlap in correlations between TMT B performance and GM volume in regions containing voxels which contribute heavily to brainPAD in our model. TMT B performance is negatively correlated with medial temporal lobe atrophy (Oosterman et al., 2010) and is positively related with GM density within the cerebellum in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (Rentiya, Khan, Ergun, Ying, & Desmond, 2017) . This evidence could suggest that brainPAD may be a potential objective measure of cognitive decline as it is not subject to the same factors which bias trail-making performance, including to practice effects (Bartels, Wegrzyn, Wiedl, Ackermann, & Ehrenreich, 2010) , rater effects (Feeney et al., 2016) and participant literacy (Vaucher et al., 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Visual attention and cognitive flexibility", "text": "BrainPAD was also negatively correlated with visual attention and cognitive flexibility (TMT B minus A), in DEU and CR/RANN, but not in TILDA (CTT 2 minus 1). Replication of this finding (albeit with relatively small rho values) in DEU and CR/RANN suggests a modest association between visual attention and cognitive flexibility. The relationship between brainPAD and TMT B minus A was only investigated in one previous study, in a TBI sample, (Cole et al., 2015) where a significant positive correlation was reported. Task-based fMRI studies have shown significantly increased activation during TMT B versus TMT A within the left precentral gyrus (Moll, Oliveira-Souza, Moll, Bramati, & Andreiuolo, 2002) and the insula (Zakzanis, Mraz, & Graham, 2005) . Additionally, a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping study reported a negative association between lesions within the left insular cortex and a TMT task accuracy score, which like the TMT B minus A score attenuates the influence of processing speed and reflects cognitive flexibility (Varja\u010di\u0107 et al., 2018) . Like the TMT B score, the TMT B minus A is also correlated with atrophy of the bilateral medial temporal lobes (Oosterman et al., 2010) . All of these regions contain voxels which contribute to older brain age in our model and therefore these various findings may provide some neurobiological basis for the correlation between brainPAD and visual attention and cognitive flexibility. As such, although the TMT B minus A can distinguish between stable and progressive MCI on a group level (Zanetti et al., 2006) , and is associated with reduced mobility, increased mortality risk (Vazzana et al., 2010) and slower walking speed (Ble et al., 2005) , as a derived measure of the TMT, the TMT B minus A index is similarly affected by the various factors that can limit interpretation of the TMT B scores. Therefore, given the correlation shown here between TMT B minus A and brainPAD, brainPAD may be a potential objective measure of general cognitive function.\nIt is notable that several significant brainPAD-cognition relationships were observed in the DEU and CR/RANN datasets, but not in TILDA. We tentatively offer some suggestions for this pattern of results. Confounding factors obscuring the brainPAD-general cognitive status relationship may have been uniquely present in TILDA. Whereas the DEU and CR/RANN cohorts were part of neuroimaging research studies, which have typically strict inclusion criteria, the TILDA MRI sample were a subset of a large nationally representative longitudinal study encompassing health, economic and social research (B. J. Whelan & Savva, 2013) .\nTILDA therefore had few inclusion criteria: being at least 50 years old, having a residential address, and absence of dementia at baseline (Kearney et al., 2011; Savva, Maty, Setti, & Feeney, 2013) . TILDA's MRI sample were screened for MRI contraindications and were on average healthier than the full sample, but it is likely that the TILDA sample included participants who might normally be excluded from neuroimaging research studies (e.g., those using psychotropic or cardiovascular medication). Moreover, the range of some cognitive measures in TILDA was also smaller than DEU and CR/RANN in some cases (see Supplemental Table 3 ): notably for general cognitive status, and visual attention and cognitive flexibility, where the brainPAD-cognition correlations were not replicated within TILDA.\nRestricted range of scores on these measures in TILDA may have contributed to smaller correlation coefficients (Bland & Altman, 2011; Mendoza & Mumford, 1987) . Additionally, the age range within TILDA was smaller than both DEU and CR/RANN which may have reduced the statistical power of the brainPAD-cognition correlations within TILDA as range restriction on covariates has also been shown to reduce power (Miciak, Taylor, Stuebing, Fletcher, & Vaughn, 2016) and decrease the magnitude of correlation coefficients (Sackett & Yang, 2000) ."}, {"section_title": "Model evaluation", "text": "We evaluated our model based on its predictive accuracy in three independent test sets, as proposed by Madan and Kensinger (2018) . While internal cross-validation is a valuable and widely used technique that can attenuate overfitting (Arlot & Celisse, 2010) ; the use of cross-validation in certain situations and when it is not implemented correctly, can result in overestimated prediction accuracy and overfitting (Saeb, Lonini, Jayaraman, Mohr, & Kording, 2016; Skocik, Collins, Callahan-Flintoft, Bowman, & Wyble, 2016; Varoquaux et al., 2017) . For brainPAD to be considered for clinical use, it must perform accurately with MRIs acquired in different scanners and under different protocols. However, in most instances of cross-validation, while the test set is split and held completely independent from the training set, factors common to both sets, such as scanner and protocol, could influence model performance. As such, the gold-standard evaluation for brainPAD should be accurate performance on independent external datasets.\nThe significant correlations between chronological age and brain-predicted age in all three external datasets shows that our model is accurate and generalizable (0.65, 0.78, and 0.87 for external datasets). Although the magnitude of these correlations is lower than correlations reported elsewhere, ranging from 0.91 to 0.94 (Cole et al., 2015; Cole, Poudel, et al., 2017; Franke et al., 2010; Lancaster et al., 2018; Liem et al., 2017) , it exceeds other externally validated brain-predicted age studies, ranging from 0.65 to 0.85 (Beheshti et al., 2018; Madan & Kensinger, 2018; Varikuti et al., 2018) .\nWith respect to mean absolute error (MAE), our model did not perform as well as other externally validated studies, ranging from 4.28 to 7.5 years (Beheshti et al., 2018; Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018; Franke et al., 2010; Lancaster et al., 2018; Madan & Kensinger, 2018) .\nAs we targeted an interpretable model of brain age, we may have lost some precision by not integrating WM information as input in the model, as was done by Cole et al. and Franke et al. Another potential reason is that other studies centered the age predictions using the mean of the ages from the test set. Although this correction is typically not explicitly described in method sections, Madan and Kensinger (2018) note that this is a standard correction in brain age prediction. Moreover, some studies also match the variance in predicted age in the test set with the variance of the training data (Madan & Kensinger, 2018) . Both corrections are principled and acceptable methods of correcting for the regression to the mean artefact in brain age predictions but they result in biased age predictions in the test set. These corrections also limit the use of brainPAD to make single subject predictions, as both the test set mean and variance are used in the prediction. Our method used only training set information and therefore produced slightly less accurate but less biased predictions. Finally, our model may also appear to be less precise in terms of MAE as an artefact of the greater age range of our sample in comparison to most brainPAD studies. An alternative metric, the weighted MAE (calculated by dividing the MAE by the age range of the sample), may enable better comparisons across studies with different age ranges (Cole, Franke, et al., 2018) . While our weighted MAE is higher than some studies, ranging from 0.072 to 0.087 (Lancaster et al., 2018; Liem et al., 2017) , the lowest weighted MAE in our sample (0.14 in CR/RANN) outperformed this metric when calculated for other studies, 0.178 (Beheshti et al., 2018) , and 0.18 (Varikuti et al., 2018) and is comparable to 0.139 (Franke et al., 2010, 'Test 4' external test set) . As such, the predictive accuracy of our model is comparable to the rest of the literature and is arguably less biased as only training set information is used."}, {"section_title": "Model interpretation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model interpretability", "text": "The interpretability of machine learning models is an important and widely discussed problem (Doshi-Velez & Kim, 2017) , and although it is poorly defined (Lipton, 2018) "}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "A possible limitation of the current model is that it uses only voxel-wise GM density\ndata and thus our model may have lower accuracy due to this restricted feature set. Other brain age models have used feature sets including combinations of cortical and subcortical GM regional volumes (Steffener et al., 2016) ; combinations of GM voxel density values, cortical thickness, and regional volume data (Gutierrez Becker et al., 2018) ; combinations of cortical thickness, cortical surface area, subcortical volume, and functional connectivity information (Liem et al., 2017) ; and combinations of GM and WM voxel-wise density information (Cole et al., 2015; Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018; Cole, Underwood, et al., 2017) .\nHowever, such feature sets typically require dimension reduction such as PCA (Gutierrez Becker et al., 2018) or even dot products to combine GM and WM data (Cole et al., 2015; Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018; Cole, Underwood, et al., 2017) . These steps reduce the interpretability of the relationship between the original feature and brain age. Our aim was to produce an interpretable model, an aim which required a simple feature set. While this focus on improved interpretability may have limited our model's accuracy as larger and more complex feature sets often produce more accurate predictions (Scheinost et al., 2019) , our model's accuracy is still comparable to other models reported to-date in the literature.\nLikewise, while our model is readily interpretable; greater interpretability could potentially be achieved by forcing sparsity to limit the number of voxels making significant contributions to brain age predictions. Modified Elastic Net algorithms, such as Enet-BETA (Liu & Li, 2017) , can obtain sparser models which would reduce the number of predictive voxels, thereby further improving interpretability. However, as the Elastic Net's prediction accuracy can increase with feature set size (Jollans et al., in revision) , limiting the feature set size could reduce model accuracy. Our model may strike the right balance between interpretability and accuracy.\nThe major limitation of our study is that for the majority of the cognitive domains investigated here, we used different cognitive measures to assess the putatively same cognitive processes. For example, although we considered the CTT 2 as a direct 'culture-free' analogue of the TMT B, as it is widely described (Elkin-Frankston, Lebowitz, Kapust, Hollis, & O'Connor, 2007; Messinis, Malegiannaki, Christodoulou, Panagiotopoulos, & Papathanasopoulos, 2011) , the CTT 2 has different stimuli (shapes and colors vs numbers and letters) and takes longer because it has more stimuli (Mitrushina, Boone, Razani, & D'Elia, 2005) . Consequently, some have argued, based on findings of significant difference in mean scores on CTT 2 and TMT B, that the tests are not direct equivalents (Dugbartey, Townes, & Mahurin, 2000; Strauss, Sherman, & Spreen, 2006) . However, mean scores for both measures are calculated as time to completion and thus a difference in means between both measures reflects a difference primarily in test length. A more appropriate measure of test equivalence would be correlations between mean scores, and various studies report significant correlations between both measures (Dugbartey et al., 2000; Elkin-Frankston et al., 2007; Lee, Cheung, Chan, & Chan, 2000; Messinis et al., 2011) . Similar arguments might be made for the other tests (e.g. the MMSE and DRS) that we used to assess the same cognitive constructs (e.g. general cognitive status). While it would be preferable to use the identical measures across datasets, our study used existing data and was designed after data collection. As a result, this approach was not possible here. Nonetheless, the measures used here were broadly comparable in that they are apparent measures of the same underlying cognitive constructs and it is these constructs which we are most interested in, more so than the actual measures."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The brain age model presented here is accurate and generalizable as it significantly predicts chronological age in 3 independent datasets. Furthermore, this model is interpretable and biologically plausible as older brain age is driven by decreased GM density in voxels that have been previously shown to be vulnerable to GM atrophy and volume loss. Finally, brainPAD scores, calculated using this model, are associated with reduced cognitive performance within the domains of general cognitive status; semantic verbal fluency;\nprocessing speed, visual attention, and cognitive flexibility; and visual attention and cognitive flexibility. The replication of these correlations in multiple datasets demonstrates that the relationship between brainPAD and these domains of cognitive function is robust to culturaland site/scanner effects. As such, given that brainPAD is also not limited by task effects which can hinder neuropsychological assessment, these findings provide support for the use of brainPAD as an objective measure of general cognitive function with applications as a general measure of brain health and cognitive performance in the clinic and as a summary outcome measure for intervention studies in research settings."}]
