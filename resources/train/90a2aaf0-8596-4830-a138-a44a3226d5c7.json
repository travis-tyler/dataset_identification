[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged into humans. Within the span of two-and-a-half months, it spread from a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin in Wuhan, China to a World Health Organization (WHO)-declared global pandemic emergency impacting 114 countries [1,2]. During this time, rapid development of laboratory diagnostics for the novel virus became a global priority; prompt diagnosis, isolation, and contact tracing became central to controlling the advancing pandemic surge. Several government, hospital, and academic labs designed PCR-based assays which were compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) for global dissemination. Seven of these laboratory developed tests (LDTs) were shared on the WHO website on Jan 24, 2020, barely a month after the first reported cases [3]. An additional LDT was developed in mid-January 2020 at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory [4].\nPCR-based diagnostic assays rely on the careful design of synthetic oligonucleotide primers and probes. Nucleotide mismatches between primers, probes, and target genetic material result in thermodynamic instabilities that can disrupt PCR chemistry, impair detection, and produce false negative results. This is especially problematic when detecting RNA viruses, like coronaviruses, whose genomes mutate readily compared to DNA-based organisms. Consequently, oligonucleotide design strategies for viral pathogens focus on genomic locations where low mutation rates are crucial to preserving biological function and pathogen viability.\nNovel pathogens present unique challenges for oligonucleotide design because their genomes are poorly characterized. Without extensive reference genome sequences, it becomes difficult to discern stable genomic loci to target for oligonucleotide design. In the case of recently emerged zoonotic viruses, these challenges are compounded by hard-to-predict genomic changes accompanying adaptation to the new host. This makes a pandemic caused by a novel zoonotic RNA virus a challenging scenario in which to develop PCR-based diagnostics: oligonucleotide design choices carry high stakes but must be made with incomplete and insufficient information.\nHere, we provide an assessment of oligonucleotide designs from those crucial early LDTs for SARS-CoV-2, many of which were widely adopted as the pandemic grew globally. Our analysis benefits from an unprecedented global genomics effort that has generated around 40,000 publicly released SARS-CoV-2 genomes in a mere 5 months. We have used this abundance of genome sequences to evaluate the frequency of mutations in genomic locations targeted by eight early LDTs.\nWe also provide the bioinformatic pipeline used for our analysis, called PCR_strainer, as a valuable general-purpose tool for clinical microbiology laboratories. It allows straightforward and fast assessment of diagnostic PCR assays against numerous reference genomes representing the circulating strain diversity of a target pathogen."}, {"section_title": "SARS-COV-2 GENOME SEQUENCES ::: Material and Methods", "text": "We downloaded 38,980 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and accompanying metadata from the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).

These sequences were submitted before June 8, 2020 from specimens collected between Dec 31, 2019 and May 31, 2020. We selected all available sequences, restricted to full genomes (over 29,000 bp), and excluded sequences with over 5% Ns.

It is available from https://github.com/KevinKuchinski/PCR_strainer. It performed in silico PCR simulation using Thermonucleotide BLAST (TNTBLAST) v2.04 [5]. TNTBLAST results were limited to best matches, with 30 \u00b0C minimum annealing temperature for primers and probes to generate maximum amplicon diversity. Default salt and oligonucleotide molarity parameters were used. PCR_strainer parsed the output from TNTBLAST to extract the number of gaps and mismatches between each assay oligonucleotide and each reference genome at target locations.

A multiple sequence alignment was generated using MUSCLE v3.8.1551 using a maximum of 16 iterations [6].

The resulting tree was visualized using the ETE Toolkit module for Python [8]."}, {"section_title": "ASSAYS ANALYZED IN THIS STUDY ::: Results", "text": "For this analysis, we focused on 7 SARS-CoV-2 LDTs compiled by the WHO and initially released on Jan 24, 2020. The original document of compiled assays, as provided by the WHO, is included as Supplement S2 [3]. We also analyzed an assay developed by the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory [4]. These LDTs are summarized in Table 1\n. The majority of these assays (6 of 8) were multiplexed as 2 or 3 oligonucleotide sets. This gave a total of 15 target locations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The most commonly targeted gene was the nucleocapsid (N) gene (n = 8), followed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene (n = 4). Each of the following was targeted by one set of oligonucleotides: the envelope (E) gene, nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) gene, and an uncharacterized location in open reading frame 1ab (orf1ab)."}, {"section_title": "THREE SETS OF OLIGONUCLEOTIDES HAD EXTENSIVE MISMATCHES AGAINST SARS-CoV-2 GENOME SEQUENCES ::: Results", "text": "To assess the inclusivity of oligonucleotides from these assays, we curated a dataset of 15,001 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from specimens collected between Dec 31, 2019 and May 31, 2020. The composition of the dataset by region and collection month is shown in Fig. 1\n.\nUsing PCR_strainer, we identified genomes in our dataset with nucleotide mismatches in locations targeted by the early SARS-CoV-2 LDTs described above. The frequency of mismatches for each set of oligonucleotides is reported in Table 2\n. Overall, these oligonucleotide designs maintained high inclusivity among circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants throughout the first five months of the pandemic. For 12 out of 15 sets of oligonucleotides, over 98% of genomes had no mismatches. The remaining 3 sets of oligonucleotides (dark shading in Table 2) had outlying mismatch frequencies and were analyzed further using PCR_strainer."}, {"section_title": "PERVASIVE SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE MISMATCHES IN ASSAYS FROM CHARIT\u00c9 GROUP AND JAPAN NIID ::: Results", "text": "Two sets of oligonucleotides had mismatches against all 15,001 SARS-CoV-2 reference genomes in our dataset: the Charit\u00e9 group\u2019s RdRP gene assay and the Japan NIID\u2019s N gene assay. For both assays, almost all genomes contained a single mismatch: 99.7% against the RdRP gene assay and 99.5% against the N gene assay (Table 2). Using PCR_strainer, we obtained all viral genomic sequences at locations targeted by these assays and counted the frequency of each variant at the forward primer, reverse primer, and probe target locations (Table 3\n). For both assays, one sequence variant in the reverse primer location accounted for nearly all mismatched genomes, suggesting a simple update the oligonucleotide sequences for these assays."}, {"section_title": "INVESTIGATING POLYMORPHISMS IN CHINA CDC\u2019S N GENE ASSAY ::: Results", "text": "The third oligonucleotide set with extensive mismatches was the China CDC\u2019s N gene assay. PCR_strainer reported mismatches against 20.1% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes analyzed, with 3 or more mismatches in 19.0% of genomes (Table 2). Using PCR_strainer, we obtained the sequences of the forward primer, reverse primer, and probe target locations in all genomes. We observed 23 different sequence variants with up to 8 mismatches at the forward primer target location. One of these variants, which we will call the \u2018AAC\u2019 variant, was present in 18.8% of genomes in our dataset (Table 3).\nWe analyzed the prevalence of the \u2018AAC\u2019 variant within our reference genomes over time (Fig. 2\n). Its first appearance was in a specimen collected Feb 25, 2020 in Germany. This suggests that polymorphisms in this location arose during spread outside of China, at least one month after the assay had been designed. We also analyzed the \u2018AAC\u2019 variant\u2019s prevalence by region (Fig. 3\n), revealing it was most prevalent in South America and Europe, appearing in 49.2% and 30.9% of genomes respectively. In China, where this assay was designed during the initial phase of the outbreak, only 9 genomes (1.5%) were reported with this variant before June 1, 2020. The earliest of these was not collected until March 15, 2020.\nNext, we constructed a phylogeny of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes in our dataset from May 2020, the most recent completed month at the time of writing (Fig. 4\n). We coloured branches by whether all descendent genomes contained \u2018AAC\u2019 variant (blue) or original (black) genotypes. This tree showed the variant belonged to a clearly defined clade. We identified the common ancestral node of all variants, and 99.5% of leaves descending from this node represented genomes containing the \u2018AAC\u2019 variant sequence. Furthermore, this clade closely overlapped with the GISAID \u2018GR\u2019 clade: 99.5% of genomes with the \u2018AAC\u2019 variant were identified as members of Clade \u2018GR\u2019, and 100% of genomes identified as members of clade \u2018GR\u2019 contained the \u2018AAC\u2019 variant. It also overlapped less-closely with the B.1.1 lineage proposed by Rambault et al. [12]: 100% of genomes identified as members of Lineage B.1.1 contained the \u2018AAC\u2019 variant, while only 83.0% of genomes with \u2018AAC\u2019 variant were identified as members of Lineage B.1.1.\nWhen polymorphisms are identified in a PCR target location, a common strategy is to generate a consensus sequence and incorporate degenerate bases into the affected oligonucleotide. PCR_strainer facilitates this task by generating separate FASTA files containing target location sequences from all genomes in the provided dataset. We used this FASTA file to generate a consensus sequence for the forward primer target location of the China CDC\u2019s N gene assay, incorporating degenerate nucleotides into polymorphic positions with a consensus threshold of 10%. This consensus sequence provides a possible update to the forward primer sequence, changing it from 5\u2019-GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT-3\u2019 to 5\u2019-RRMGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT-3\u2019."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "From our analysis using PCR_strainer, we report that most oligonucleotides in these assays have maintained high inclusivity during the first fourth months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. There were only 3 oligonucleotides with substantial mismatches and polymorphisms: the reverse primer from the Charit\u00e9 group\u2019s RdRP gene assay, the reverse primer from the Japan NIID\u2019s N gene assay, and the forward primer from the China CDC\u2019s N gene assay.\nSingle mismatches in the Charit\u00e9 group and Japan NIID assays were uniform and pervasive, suggesting they were artefacts of the oligonucleotide design process. The mismatch in the Japan NIID\u2019s assay was due to an error in the first reported SARS-CoV-2 genome assembly, and investigations by the assay\u2019s designers did not find any impact on clinical performance [11]. The mismatch in the Charit\u00e9 group\u2019s assay appears to be the result of using closely related sarbecovirus genomes as reference material in the design process. These sequences contained divergent nucleotides at the mismatched position that swayed the consensus sequence away from the nucleotide present in SARS-CoV-2 [9]. Both of these situations highlight the challenges of designing PCR oligonucleotides for novel pathogens with poorly characterized genomes: assay developers must rely on early, potentially error-prone genome assemblies or supplement their reference sequences with closely related organisms whose genomes may diverge in the target regions selected.\nPolymorphisms affecting the China CDC\u2019s assay were extensive and varied, suggesting they were unfortunate consequences of viral evolution. The most common of these variants was present in 14.9% of genomes in our dataset, but it did not appear until at least one month after the assay was designed and it was not especially prevalent in genomes from China. The clear association of this variant with the emergence of a viral clade highlights another challenge of PCR design for novel pathogens, especially mutable RNA viruses: rapid adaption to new hosts can result in extensive genomic mutations that are difficult to predict and avoid when designing diagnostic assays.\nOur analysis cannot determine if these mismatches and polymorphisms would impact clinical performance, but their positions do not obviously suggest PCR failure. The prevalent \u2018AAC\u2019 variant in the China CDC\u2019s assay was confined to the 3 least-critical nucleotides at the 5\u2019 end of the primer. Mismatches in the Charit\u00e9 group and Japan NIID assays were both 14 positions from the more-crucial 3\u2019 end of the primers. Indeed, as stated above, the Japan NIID group failed to observe a difference in detection between primers with and without the mismatch [11].\nTaken together, these results provide a reassuring assessment of the early SARS-CoV-2 assays, many of which were widely adopted. They also provide instructive lessons about designing PCR assays for the diagnosis of novel viral pathogens. We have highlighted four of these lessons here.\nThe first lesson is that reference laboratories should maintain a collection of PCR oligonucleotides that are inclusive across higher-level viral taxa. At the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, pan-sarbecovirus oligonucleotides were instrumental for investigating the etiology of the first cases and rapidly developing stop-gap diagnostic assays. These kinds of oligonucleotide collections should focus on higher-level viral taxa that are common sources of novel zoonotic disease and, consequently, pose the most significant pandemic threats. They also allow isolates of accessible, closely related viruses to be used as control and validation material when specimens of the novel etiological pathogen are limited or unavailable.\nThe second lesson is that public health funders should commit to research characterizing viral diversity in wildlife, livestock, and game species. Crucial laboratory tools enabled the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 and prompt design of early diagnostic tests (e.g. pan-sarbecovirus PCR oligonucleotides) existed because of bat coronavirus research arising from the SARS incident in 2003-04. Numerous outbreaks and pandemics in the 20th and 21st centuries originated from the interface between humans, livestock, game, and wildlife. Successful prevention, preparedness, and response to these crises depend on characterizing this viral diversity.\nThe third lesson is that diagnostic PCR assays for novel pathogens should be multiplexed for redundancy. The SARS-CoV-2 experience reveals that stop-gap assays can be compromised by oligonucleotide design artefacts and unforeseen polymorphisms arising through early viral adaptation and evolution. This risk can be mitigated by including additional targets in the PCR. Assay redundancy can be further enhanced by adding confirmatory targets that are inclusive across higher-level taxa. For instance, the Charit\u00e9 group\u2019s pan-sarbecovirus E gene assay was used for this purpose in half of the assays analyzed in the study.\nThe fourth lesson is that genomic sequencing of specimens must keep pace with the spread of an outbreak. Polymorphisms accumulate as zoonotic pathogens adapt to new hosts, and the locations where they occur are difficult to predict. Specimens should be sequenced routinely to identify design artefacts, monitor emerging polymorphisms, and promptly update oligonucleotide designs. This is equally true for endemic viruses, where polymorphisms regularly arise through antigenic drift. Laboratories accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) are required to monitor the compatibility of their LDTs with currently circulating strains; routine genomic sequencing of viral isolates and bioinformatic analysis using PCR_strainer can address this requirement."}, {"section_title": "Uncited Reference", "text": "[10]."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of Competing Interest", "text": "The authors report no declarations of interest."}]
