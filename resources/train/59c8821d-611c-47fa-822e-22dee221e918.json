These existing maps showing marsh vegetation types in coastal Louisiana have been used to document temporal changes in vegetation types and land-water relationships in coastal Louisiana and to refine the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) datasets. These datasets were limited because of their coarseness and have proven insufficient for large-scale targeted conservation planning efforts conducted by natural resource managers and coastal researchers. Although these datasets provide useful historical information, technological limitations prevented these and other mapping efforts from providing sufficiently detailed calculations of areal changes and shifts in marsh vegetation types. To help meet these needs, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management produced a detailed classification of marsh vegetation types indicative of salinity zones for 2007 and 2013 by using advanced geographic information system datasets that were created by using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), digital color-infrared aerial imagery, and lidar data at a spatial scale of 10 meters (m) (Hartley and others, 2017) . Additionally, we conducted a change analysis to determine how marsh types have changed from 2007 and 2013. The ability to understand past dynamics and anticipate future trends in vegetation change and related land loss in the coastal region of Louisiana is vital to ongoing and future efforts to conserve the region's critical wetland ecosystem. Our analysis provides Federal and State agencies, as well as researchers and interested parties in the private sector, with current (2017) and large-scale detailed information which could be used to base future decisions in the interest of preserving the coastal marshes of Louisiana."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "Habitat types were classified by using decision-tree (DT) classification analyses and rulesets produced by using Rulequest See5 in combination with ERDAS IMAGINE 2010, National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Mapping Tool version 2.087, Esri ArcMap version 10.2, and Trimble eCognition version 9.2 software packages. See5 has been used to produce broad land-cover classifications, including NLCD (Homer and others, 2007; others, 2014, 2015) and Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP). DT classification analyses use dependent variables (such as ground reference data) and a suite of predictor variables (such as independent spatial variables) to develop multivariate classification trees for classifying a target area. Seven Landsat TM scenes cover the study area ( fig. 1 ). DT classification analyses were developed for each Landsat TM scene.\nBuilding upon earlier efforts of others (2008, 2014) , this study involved classification of land cover in coastal Louisiana by using reference data from approximately 8,500 sample points collected via helicopter surveys during each survey year. CCAP data from 2006 and 2010 served as additional reference data for non-wetland classes. A changevector analysis was conducted to exclude areas of change between the 2010 CCAP data and the 2013 imagery used for this analysis. Areas which were determined to have undergone a change between 2010 and 2013 were excluded from potential selection as reference data for non-wetland classes.\nIndependent Viewer (http://glovis.usgs.gov/) with the Standard Terrain Correction (level 1T); level 1T correction provides systematic radiometric and geometric accuracy by incorporating groundcontrol points while employing a DEM for topographic accuracy. No further geometric correction was applied, except for subpixel shifts to ensure pixel alignment among all Landsat TM scenes. All satellite multispectral imagery was processed in terms of top-of-atmosphere reflectance units. Additionally, the modified normalized-difference water index (Xu, 2006) and the normalized-difference vegetation index (Rouse and others, 1974) were calculated and used as independent variables in the DT analyses. For all Landsat TM imagery, a Tasseled-Cap Transformation (Crist and Cicone, 1984) of Landsat TM bands 1-5 and 7 was applied to include additional information on brightness, greenness, and wetness as independent variables. Schmidt and others (2004) found elevation to be the greatest determining factor for mapping coastal vegetation. Inundation frequency, in part a function of elevation, was found to influence the occurrence of marsh communities in coastal Louisiana (Couvillion and Beck, 2013) ; therefore, to best leverage high-resolution (3-m) airborne lidar bareearth DEMs when available in the study area, all datasets used in the DT analyses were resampled to 10 m from their native resolutions.\nTrimble eCognition version 9.2 was used to generate image objects by parish from the 2007 and 2013 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) color-infrared aerial photography. The image objects were created at a parish extent because the original NAIP imagery was mosaicked to the parish boundaries. This also allowed for better data processing and handling because creation of image objects can result in large vector files not easily handled within ArcMap. The final 10-m classification was produced by using a script in ArcMap to determine the majority DT-based class for each image object.\nLand cover was delineated within the study area into sixteen classes: (1) High Intensity Developed, (2) Medium Intensity Developed, (3) Low Intensity Developed, (4) Developed Open Space, (5) Cultivated, (6) Pasture/Hay, (7) Upland Forest, (8) Processing methods for the classified 2007 satellite imagery consisted of first resampling the spatial resolution from 30 m to 10 m. Next, we merged a 2008 water mask derived from the 2008 NWI water layer onto the resampled image because this represented the best water layer available and was within an acceptable time frame. The final 10-m classification was produced by using a script in ArcMap to determine the majority DT-based class for each image object by parish. Each parish file was then merged into a composite to compose the entire coastal Louisiana zone. The final composite of the image was then reclassified from 16 categories to 6 (table 2) to enable a simplified crosswalk matrix during the change-analysis process.\nProcessing methods for the classified 2013 imagery was similar to those of the 2007 dataset. The spatial resolution of the imagery was resampled from 30 m to 10 m. Next, we created mask layers from the urban categories from the 2007 and 2013 classified imagery. The 2007 urban mask was then merged into the classified 2013 imagery to keep all urban areas classified in 2007 to be carried forward into 2013. We then merged the 2013 urban areas back into the 2013 imagery so that those areas classified in 2013 would get the proper urban class on the basis of the 2013 imagery. We also merged the 2008 water mask onto the 2013 imagery to allow for water classified in 2008 to continue to be classified as water in 2013. We did this because we believed that the majority of water would not revert back to any land category.\nThe final 10-m classification was produced by using a majority filter script in ArcMap to determine the majority DT-based class for each image object by parish. Just like the 2007 classified imagery, each parish file was then merged into a composite. The final image was then reclassified from 16 categories to 6.\nA pixel-by-pixel change analysis was conducted on the final two datasets (that is, the 2007 and 2013 six-category classification) to determine the final change-analysis matrix (table 3) . "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study provides a more objective and repeatable method for classifying marsh types of coastal Louisiana and greater level of thematic detail than previously available. The most appropriate use of this classification is for understanding general distribution and overall changes in areal coverage of emergent marshes at the landscape level. Similar to CCAP and NLCD, this marsh-type classification might warrant a 4-to 5-year update cycle. The seamless classification produced by this work can be used to help develop and refine conservation efforts for priority natural resources. Moreover, these data may improve projections of landscape change and serve as a baseline for monitoring future changes resulting from chronic and episodic stressors others, 2008, 2014) .\nMarsh types calculated during this study for coastal Louisiana suggested a 1.27-percent decline in the available marsh between the two time periods. The general trend across coastal Louisiana was a shift to increasingly saltier marsh types. Fresh marsh remained almost the same, with only a small decrease from 7.65 to 7.37 percent during the 2007 and 2013 study periods. Intermediate marsh followed the same pattern, with brackish marsh showing a reverse (increasing) pattern. Changes in saline (saltwater) marsh were minimal but trending to less saline marsh.\nFor the two snapshots we analyzed (that is, 2007 and 2013), the total marsh acreage decreased. With the loss of marsh and resultant changes in hydrology, it is likely that changes in marsh type may show greater variation in the future, even if given only minor changes in precipitation levels."}]
