We conducted genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors influencing CSF biomarker level, cerebral amyloid deposition, and disease progression. The genome-wide association study was performed via a meta-analysis of two non-overlapping discovery sample sets to identify genetic variants other than APOE \u03b54 predictive of the CSF biomarker level (A\u03b2 1-42 , t-Tau, p-Tau 181P , t-Tau:A\u03b2 1-42 ratio, and p-Tau 181P :A\u03b2 1-42 ratio) in patients enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study.

Understanding the factors influencing cognitive decline of AD will enable us to better search for therapeutics to intervene or preempt this process. It is well established now that the CSF biosignature of increased total tau (t-tau) and phosphor-tau (p-tau) species especially tau phosphorylated at the threonine 181 (p-tau 181p ) and decreased amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 peptide (A\u03b2 1- progression in MCI subjects, as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB), by performing a GWAS in two independent sample sets and identified several novel loci that achieved genome-wide significance (intronic SNPs in UBR5 and PARP6, and an intergenic SNP near ACOT11). [14] In this report, we also describe GWAS or GWAS meta-analysis using florbetapir PET as a quantitative trait and using a dichotomized measure of amyloid positivity, and disease progression/rate of cognitive decline in late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) population."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We performed a genome-wide association study via a meta-analysis of two discovery sample sets (discovery sample set 1: genotyped using the Illumina Human610-Quad; discovery sample set 2: genotyped using Illumina Omni2.5, Table 1 and Table A in S1 File) to identify genetic variants other than APOE \u03b54 predictive of the CSF biomarker level (A\u03b2 , t-Tau, p-Tau 181P , t-Tau:A\u03b2 1-42 ratio, and p-Tau 181P :A\u03b2 1-42 ratio) in patients enrolled in the ADNI study, and followed-up by replication of any locus passing the genome-wide significance threshold of P < 5 x 10 \u22128 . In the discovery phase, we identified variants from one single locus associated with CSF , they are located in a~60kb interval in chromosome 10 that contains the rare FRA10A folate-sensitive fragile site FRA10AC1 ( Figure B1 in S1 File). This genetic association was replicated (rs116953792 P one-sided = 0.04) in the replication sample set (Table 1 and Table A in S1 File, n = 172 genotyped using Illumina OmniExpress). We also performed joint meta-analysis of both discovery sample sets together with the replication sample set. The FRA10AC1 association became stronger in the joint analysis (directly genotyped SNV rs10509663 P FE = 1.7 x 10 \u22129 , imputed SNV rs116953792 P FE = 7.6 x 10\n, Figs 1 and 2A) . We identified an additional genome wide-significant locus within the15q21 locus (directly genotyped SNV rs4301994 P FE = 6.5 x 10 \u22128\n; imputed SNV rs1503351 P FE = 4.0 x 10 \u22128\n, Figs 1 and 2B) also associated with CSF A\u03b2 level. This locus is in the intergenic region of chromosome 15 (15q21) between spermatogenesis associated 8 (SPATA8) and hypothetical LOC91948. There are spliced yet uncharacterized EST in this \"intergenic\" region. No other variants passed the genome-wide significance threshold level for any of the other CSF biomarkers (t-Tau, p- Tau 181P , t-Tau:A\u03b2 1-42 ratio, and p-Tau 181P :A\u03b2 1-42 ratio, Figures B2-5 in S1 File). As expected, APOE \u03b54, age, and clinical diagnosis were predictive of CSF A\u03b2 level in all three sample sets. The association between FRA10AC1 locus and CSF A\u03b2 is primarily driven by the first two sample sets with uncorrected significance levels of p = 0.0006 for the Upennbiomk_Hu-man610-Quad sample set and p = 1.86 x 10 \u22126 for the Upennbiomk5_Omni2.5 sample set, and P two-sided = 0.2 (P one-sided = 0.1) for the Upennbiomk6_OmniExpress sample set for the directly genotyped marker rs10509663. The imputed SNV rs116953792 however achieved P one-sided = 0.04 for the Upennbiomk6_OmniExpress sample set. The association between rs4301994 and CSF A\u03b2 1-42 is supported by all three sample sets with uncorrected significance levels of P = 0.003 for the Upennbiomk_Human610-Quad sample set, P = 6.6 x 10 \u22125 for the Upennbiomk5_Omni2.5 sample set, and P = 0.03 in the Upennbiomk6_OmniExpress sample set. The regression beta coefficients and least square means of the minor allele dosage for rs10509663 (FRA10AC1) and rs4301994 (15q21 locus) are shown in the forest plot (Fig 3A and 3B) and Table 2 , displaying a consistent trend across the three sample sets. Both directly genotyped markers rs10509663 and rs4301994 did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (P = 0.38 and 1, respectively based on Omni2.5 data among cognitively normal controls). Table 3 contains those mostly independent variants (both the most significant directly genotyped and imputed markers are retained) that are significantly associated with A\u03b2 1-42 level from our meta-analysis, along with other variants with uncorrected P 1x10 -6 in any CSF biomarker meta-analysis. The full list of variants meeting this more liberal threshold appears in the S1 Table. Although the CSF A\u03b2 1-42 measurement using Upennbiomk5 (baseline A\u03b2 1-42 for 117 ADNI-GO subjects and 272 ADNI-2 subjects) were not taken at the exact same visit as the florbetapir PET imaging, the overall correlation for the overlapping subjects between the two measurements was negatively correlated (r = -0.72). We expected the results from the cerebral amyloid deposition GWAS to provide complementary evidence with CSF A\u03b2 1-42 meta-analysis even if the sample sets are not identical and the endpoints are not perfectly negatively correlated. In our florbetapir PET GWAS meta-analysis without correcting for APOE \u03b54 dosage, the APOE locus predicted florbetapir PET SUVR value (directly genotyped SNV rs429358 P = 7.99 x 10 \u221232 ) as expected from the published results ( Figure C1 in S1 File). There are uncommon variants (such as rs76117213, an intronic variant in WD repeat and FYVE domain containing 3 (WDFY3), P = 1.39 x 10 \u22127 without correction for APOE \u03b54 dosage, P = 4.08 x 10 \u22126 with correction for APOE \u03b54 dosage). The uncommon variant results, however, shall be interpreted with caution as these variants occurred at low minor allele frequency and the association statistics are based on small sample size for rare genotype groups. Table 4 contains the variants that were significant in florbetapir PET GWAS along with other variants with uncorrected P < 1x10 -6 in any florbetapir PET GWAS analysis, most variants are independent except for the chromosome 19 region. The full list of variants meeting this more liberal threshold appears in the S2 Table. Top 15q21 locus variants associated with CSF A\u03b2 1-42 exhibited a nominal association with florbetapir PET SUVR value (P = 0.002 for directly genotyped SNV rs4301994; P = 0.001 for imputed SNV rs1503351). Similarly, the imputed variant rs116953792 from FRA10AC1 also exhibited a nominal association with florbetapir PET SUVR value (P = 0.01).\nResults for the top CSF A\u03b2 1-42 variant rs10509663 from FRA10AC1 in this and other analyses (S3 Table) are discussed in the S1 File. For the rate of cognitive decline GWAS in the late-MCI subgroup, there were some variants that achieved the conventional genome-wide significance threshold (Figure D in S1 File), those variants occurred at low frequency (MAF < 0.05). An intronic variant rs2694777 in the GDNF family receptor alpha 1 gene (GFRA1) is among the common variants with suggestive association with rate of cognitive decline as measured by rate of change in CDR-SB (P = 1.2 x 10\nEuropean ancestry sample set and P = 6.77 x 10 \u22126 in all races). The full list of variants with P 10 \u22126 appears in the S4 Table. The results from this study, for variants reported in the literature relevant/associated with CSF biomarkers, florbetapir PET, and disease progression were also reported in the S1 File.\nGene set enrichment analysis may yield signals of enriched gene sets in GWAS analysis despite the individual variants not reaching genome wide significance. Applying INRICH [15] enrichment analysis to the CSF biomarker GWAS results yields gene sets such as miR-33 target genes (P empirical = 0.0002, P corrected = 0.03) being enriched among p-tau 181p :A\u03b21-42 suggestive association hits (P < 0.0005) ( Table 5 and S5 Table) . miR-33 was identified to be a potent posttranscriptional regulator of lipid metabolism genes [16, 17] and cause disruption of cellular cholesterol homeostasis leading to pathologic processes including AD. Among, the potential targets of miR-33, PRKAA1 (Protein kinase, AMP-activated, alpha 1 catalytic subunit) mediates an autophagic process to clear extracellular A\u03b2 fibrils by microglia, the immune cells in the brain. [18] Other potential targets of miR-33 included ARID5B (AT rich interactive domain 5B (MRF1-like)), KCNMA1 (Potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel, subfamily M, alpha member 1), and LGI1 (leucine-rich, glioma inactivated). ARID5B was previously LGI1 is an extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule forming a complex with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins (postsynaptic density proteins 95 and 93, and the synapse-associated protein 97), presynaptic scaffolding proteins (Ca2+/calmodulinactivated serine-threonine kinase and Lin7), and presynaptic K+ channels (K v 1.1, K v 1.4 and K v \u03b21 subunits) and demonstrated to be important in epilepsy, but ECM and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), one of the most abundant glycanated protein types found in the nervous system and a major ECM component, which form dense lattice-like structures, termed perineuronal nets (PNNs), are thought to be neuroprotective in AD. [22] Application of A\u03b2 to rodent primary neuronal cultures caused neuronal death of neurons not associated with PNNs, while the neurons expressing PNNs were not affected. [23] The same miR-33 target genes were observed to be enriched in other CSF biomarker suggestive hits, although the corrected enrichment p-value is greater than 0.05. In addition, miR-193 and miR-146 target genes are also enriched, miR-193 was one of the nine down-regulated miRNA identified in adult-onset AD Drosophila brains. [24] miR-193b were all upregulated in oxidative stressed (i.e. H 2 O 2 -induced) primary hippocampal neurons and different strains of senescence accelerated mice. [25] . miR-146 was reported to be related to upregulated immune and inflammatory in Alzheimer's disease. [26] Discussion\nIn this study we have analyzed the ADNI Cohort to predict CSF and PET biomarker status and cognitive decline rates from genetic data and to assess if use of molecular biomarkers as quantitative traits provides extra power to uncover novel genotype-phenotype relationships in AD. Unequivocally, APOE \u03b54 allele is the strongest genetic predictor of CSF biomarker level, cerebral amyloid deposition, and disease progression. The effect size for other genetic markers is much smaller. CSF biomarker measurements have the advantage that their measurements are widely sensitive across different patient subpopulations ranging from cognitive normal to AD. Cognitive measurements on the other hand are sensitive for different patient population segments and this will limit the sample size available for GWAS if we study the rate of cognitive decline directly in the selected patient population. For example, the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is most sensitive for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, while the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) will be more appropriate for AD patients. In this sample set, variants in FRA10AC1 and 15q21 were associated with CSF A\u03b2 1-42 reaching genome-wide significance, replication was achieved with the FRA10AC1 variant. FRA10AC1 (fragile site, folic acid type, rare, fra(10)(q23.3) or fra(10)(q24.2) candidate 1) encodes a nuclear phosphorprotein of unknown function. The 5' UTR of this gene is part of a CpG island and contains a tandem CGG repeat region that normally consists of 8-14 repeats but can expand to over 200 repeats. The CGG repeat is~723 base pairs away from the rs116953792, the most significant SNP (P = 2.0 x 10 \u221210 , in LD with the directly genotyped variant rs10509663) associated with CSF A\u03b2 1-42 level. The expanded allele becomes hypermethylated and is not transcribed and an expanded repeat region has not been associated with any disease phenotype. The extent of LD between the CpG repeat and rs116953792, is unclear, given their close proximity. WDFY3 is one of the biologically most interesting genes identified to have suggestive association with the florbetapir PET quantitative trait with or without correction for APOE \u03b54 dosage. WDFY3 encodes a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein that functions as a master conductor for aggregate clearance by autophagy. This protein shuttles from the nuclear membrane to co-localize with aggregated proteins, and complexes with other autophagic components to achieve macroautophagy-mediated clearance of aggregated proteins. This protein is of particular interest given the proposed synergy between amyloid and tau aggregates in driving AD progression. Another variant (rs17009220, P = 0.00484, http://www.gwascentral.org/ marker/HGVM16286779/results?t=2) in WDFY3 exhibited nominally significant interaction (SNP \u00c3 APOE \u03b54) in an AD case-control GWAS study. [27] GFRA1 gene, which encodes GDNF family receptor alpha 1, a member of the GDNF receptor family, is among the few genes with suggestive association to rate of cognitive decline in the LMCI subgroup. The GDNF family receptor alpha 1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-linked cell surface receptor for both glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN), and mediates activation of the RET tyrosine kinase receptor. GDNF and NTN are two structurally related, potent neurotrophic factors that play key roles in the control of neuron survival and differentiation. Neuronal loss is a hallmark of AD, a neurodegenerative disease.\nHuman and mouse experiments have implicated the role of miRNA in the regulation of A\u03b2, tau, inflammation, and cell death as the main disease mechanisms of AD [28] . In our GWAS and INRICH analyses, it was intriguing that molecules involved in A\u03b2 autophagy, inflammation, cell death and proliferation are enriched in INRICH analysis or among the top hits of GWAS analyses. APOE \u03b54 has been the most convincing genome wide signal in AD, and variants in APOE-APOC1-APOC4-APOC2 and TOMM40-APOE have previously been associated with total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations. [29, 30] Cholesterol metabolism was implicated to be enriched in the etiology of AD in previous study. [31] In the INRICH analysis, miR-33 targets are enriched in CSF GWAS analysis and miR-33 is critical in regulating cholesterol metabolism, affirming the interrelationship between cholesterol metabolism and AD process.\nStudies comparing (a) non-demented individuals free of substantial Alzheimer's pathology (controls), (b) non-demented individuals with equivalent loads of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques (\"mismatches\") and tangles, and (c) demented Alzheimer's cases, observed four main phenotypic differences between the groups, which include demented cases had significantly higher burdens of fibrillar thioflavin-S positive plaques and of oligomeric amyloid-\u03b2 deposits reactive to conformer-specific antibody NAB61 than \"mismatches\". [32] Thus, florbetapir PET most likely could not distinguish between these different forms of amyloid deposition. Therefore, future amyloid phenotype differentiating the pathological forms of amyloid deposition will help genetic association study.\nFuture studies with larger sample sizes or replication samples are needed to further dissect the genetic basis of CSF and cerebral biomarkers. AD progression is a challenging problem as the patients are likely to be at different stages of the disease continuum, additionally, deterioration is not linear over the course of the disease progression. Furthermore, different neuropsycogntive instruments are sensitive for patients at different stages of the disease continuum, thus, genetic association studies further suffers from the sample size after stratification by disease stage."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).
