[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. We currently have only a partial understanding of how phylogenetic relationships relate to patterns of community structure, in part because, for most groups of organisms, we do not know the extent to which ecological similarity results from common ancestry. Associations between phylogenetic relatedness and local community structure are particularly interesting for groups in which many species that span a gradient of phylogenetic divergence occur in potential sympatry. We explored the relationship between evolutionary relatedness and current species co-occurrence among the North American wood-warblers (Aves: Parulidae), a group of songbirds known both for its species diversity and for exhibiting high levels of sympatry at breeding sites. Species co-occurrences were derived from North American Breeding Bird Survey transects comprising 160 000 census points distributed across North America. The nested point-within-transect structure of this survey provides an unusual opportunity to remove larger-scale geographical effects on local community composition and thereby consider patterns of co-occurrence only among regionally sympatric pairs of species. We indexed evolutionary relatedness among all pairs of taxa by genetic distances based on long mitochondrial DNA protein-coding sequences. Most regionally sympatric taxon pairs rarely co-occur at local sites, and the most closely related never exhibit high local cooccurrences, as predicted if past or present competitive effects are strongest for these recently separated lineages. Quantile regression shows that, for a subset of taxa, local co-occurrence does increase with time since common ancestry, and that this apparent relaxation of competitive exclusion is strongest for distantly related species that have differentiated in fundamental ecological and behavioral traits, such as terrestrial vs. arboreal foraging.\nComparisons against a null model of species co-occurrence further demonstrate that these patterns occur against a background of phylogenetic niche conservatism: across all phylogenetic distances, sympatric species co-occurred at higher rates than expected by chance, a pattern that might stem from a tendency by these species to show conservatism in their selection of similar general habitat types. Considered in concert, these analyses suggest the simultaneous mediation of local community structure by the ecological similarity of closely related species and by trait divergence among a subset of more distant lineages."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The connection between phylogenetic similarity and community composition is an important but largely unresolved issue in evolutionary ecology. Because closely related species will usually share many ecological traits via common ancestry, evolutionary relationships are likely to be associated with patterns of community assembly (Darwin 1859 , Lack 1971 , Ricklefs and Schluter 1993 , but these phylogenetic effects might influence species coexistence in several ways. The general observation that closely related organisms tend to occupy similar habitats and often use similar environmental resources long predates the founding of ecology as a science, and the extent to which this ecological stasis results from the inheritance of niche-related traits from a common ancestor is termed ''phylogenetic niche conservation'' (e.g., Wiens and Graham 2005) . Research on phylogenetic niche conservatism has been recently invigorated by the growing availability of robust phylogenetic hypotheses based on data independent from ecological traits, but few generalizable trends are apparent across studies. The present literature suggests that phylogenetic niche conservatism is detectable in some but not all communities of organisms. Furthermore, its magnitude differs depending on the ecological traits under comparison and additional factors, such as the degree of ecological interaction among related species (Losos 1996 , McPeek and Miller 1996 , Peterson et al. 1999 , Prinzing et al. 2001 , Webb et al. 2002 , Ackerly 2003 , Anderson et al. 2004 , Cavender-Bares et al. 2004 , 2006 , Wiens and Graham 2005 , Kembel and Hubbel 2006 , Knouft et al. 2006 , Weiblen et al. 2006 ).\nCompetition among related species is likely one of the principal forces causing the erosion of phylogenetic niche conservation: for species that interact ecologically, the initial ecological similarity that results from common ancestry will likely increase competition, potentially leading over time either to competitive exclusion or ecological differentiation (Webb et al. 2002) . This process is most evident in adaptive radiations, in which groups of sympatric species have diversified extensively with concomitant differentiation in traits related to their use of ecological resources (Losos and Miles 2002) . In such situations, divergent selection that results from competition could overwhelm any underlying retention of niche conservatism, as found by for a highly diverse community of Cuban Anolis lizards, within which phylogenetic relationships explained only a small amount of the among-species ecological variation. This is perhaps an extreme example of a general trend: most groups of closely related and ecologically interacting species will share some traits by common ancestry and differ in other traits, owing to divergent selection and other processes of evolutionary differentiation.\nAn interesting intermediate situation involves groups in which the species composition of local communities varies substantially in time and space, as these taxa are individually involved in many potential interactions. In the absence of more stable associations between particular species that result in tight coevolutionary responses, species in highly variable communities might be more likely to assort themselves along relatively few axes of dissimilarity and therefore retain a larger signature of phylogenetic niche conservation. In addition, groups of organisms with high diversity, geographic distributions that have been labile through evolutionary time, and high individual dispersal are particularly appropriate models for exploring how phylogenetic relationships relate to the balance between niche conservation and ecological divergence, because these attributes will diminish the degree of biogeographic determinism in community composition by bringing together many pairs of taxa that would otherwise be allopatric. The diverse North American Parulidae fit these criteria, as nearly all wood-warbler species have persisted as independent lineages for at least several million years (see Plate 1; Bermingham 1999, 2002) . During their tenures in North America, the continental landscape has been transformed many times by glacial and climate cycles and consequent broad-scale shifts in habitat distributions (Graham 1999 , Klicka and Zink 1999 , Johnson and Cicero 2004 , Weir and Schluter 2004 , Lovette 2005 . Nearly all of the approximately 6.0 3 10 8 individual North American wood-warblers (Rich et al. 2004 ) also migrate annually, and many studies of marked individuals (summarized in Poole and Gill [2004] ) have shown that natal philopatry is low, at least at the fine local scale of intensively monitored study plots. Resulting from this natal dispersal and movements of adults among sites in different years (Holmes et al. 1996 , Cilimburg et al. 2002 , wood-warblers redistribute themselves across local habitats annually. This combination of large population sizes, repeated historical displacement of geographic ranges, and high individual dispersal means that most wood-warbler individuals breed at locations where other wood-warbler species are present.\nAs documented by Robert MacArthur in his classic study of five sympatric ''spruce woods' warblers'' (MacArthur 1958) , at the local scale co-occurring songbird species show differentiation in their spatial foraging niches and other traits (e.g., Holmes et al. 1979 , Morse 1989 , Suhonen et al. 1994 . In a MacArthurian framework, behavioral and ecological differentiation reduce interspecific competition and permit related species to co-occur. However, whether local niche differentiation explains broad spatial patterns of species co-occurrence is controversial because the species composition of wood-warbler communities varies across sites and years (Wiens 1989) .\nA principal reason why the effect of evolutionary relatedness on community structure remains largely unexplored is that some fundamental tests of the relationship require information from different spatial scales (Anderson et al. 2004 , Cavender-Bares et al. 2006 : the competitive ecological interactions that can drive local patterns of community structure occur at a fine local scale best studied at points or in small study plots, yet these interactions must simultaneously be integrated across the much broader geographic distributions of potentially co-occurring taxa. Most previous studies of phylogenetic patterns in community structure have concentrated on interactions at one of these scales (e.g., Webb 2000 , Silvertown et al. 2001 , Gillespie 2004 , Kembel and Hubbell 2006 ; however, unique avian censuses organized by the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) program (Sauer et al. 2003 ) allow us to synthesize complementary information at both levels. Distinguishing between these alternatives requires separating the biogeographic or other historical factors that constrain the pool of candidate species from the ecological factors that cause competitive exclusion or facilitate co-occurrence (Ricklefs 1987 (Ricklefs , 2006 . Underlying historical factors unrelated to direct competition include the fact that lineages that have speciated in allopatry might remain separated by the same physiographic features that caused their initial isolation and hence never come into ecological contact. Even pairs of species that do occur in sympatry will usually have geographic distributions that do not perfectly overlap. Current ecological interactions are thus limited to a part of each species' overall range. The fact that each species has a unique geographic distribution that varies in overlap with those of other species is a general challenge in comparing ecological cooccurrences across many different pairs of species, as an absence of species' overlap at a given point could result from being outside one species' geographic range, or more interestingly from ecological processes, such as differential habitat selection or competitive exclusion (Stone et al. 1996 , Ackerly et al. 2006 , Silvertown et al. 2006 . The spatial structure of the BBS (i.e., many census points replicated along short transects) is particularly useful for our purposes because it allows us to remove the confounding effects of these larger scale differences in total geographic range from our measures of local co-occurrence.\nHere, we use BBS census information in combination with DNA-based genetic distances to assess whether phylogenetic relatedness among regionally sympatric wood-warblers is positively or negatively correlated with co-occurrence at the same points in space, the birds' local breeding sites. A positive relationship (i.e., related species co-occurring at higher than expected rates) would suggest that local community composition is mediated in part by phylogenetic niche conservatism of habitat or habitat-linked aspects of niches, whereas a negative relationship would suggest that past or present competition among closely related species limits their local ecological co-occurrence. In further analyses, we explore whether these patterns are influenced by a fundamental attribute of warbler behavior that leads to strong spatial niche segregation, the species-specific tendency to forage terrestrially or arboreally. We also compare patterns of co-occurrence at the local spatial scale defined by census points, with the regional-scale patterns defined by entire census transects. Unlike most previous studies of phylogenetic effects on community structure, the structure of our data sets requires that we compare matrices of genetic and ecological distances; our comparisons therefore do not require ancestral state reconstructions and thereby minimize the importance of the underlying assumption that we have identified the correct phylogenetic tree topology. Instead, we use a null-model approach to identify and explore associations between phylogenetic relatedness and overlap in species' use of local breeding sites. PLATE 1. The Prairie Warbler (Dendroica discolor) is one of 42 common species of North American wood-warblers that frequently breed in sympatry with closely related species. Photo credit: Marie P. Read."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Breeding bird survey co-occurrences", "text": "Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) censuses are run during the breeding season by experienced volunteers who conduct standardized 3-minute counts of all birds heard or seen at 50 equally spaced locations along a 39.4-km (25-mile) transect (Sauer et al. 2003) . Most transects are recensused annually, and data spanning 1997-2003 are available for the species detected at each census point, as well as the summed observations for each transect. The resulting 162 800 census points (Fig. 1) provide a robust representation of all but the most geographically restricted or peripheral North American wood-warblers.\nHere we define the wood-warblers detected at a single census point as co-occurring in local sympatry, as these individuals are certainly within auditory detection distance of one another and are likely to occupy at least partially overlapping territories. To derive a measure of local sympatry, we considered only BBS transects on which both members of each pair of species were detected, as this physical proximity indicates that both species are members of the pool of taxa from which we drew the local community at each census point. For each point observation of species A, we determined the probability that wood-warbler species B was detected at that same census point, generating an index of dissimilarity in co-occurrence that spans 0 (complete cooccurrence) to 1 (no co-occurrence). To account for differences in prevalence among species, the matrix of co-occurrences also included the reciprocal calculation for each species pair (i.e., probability of detecting species A at points where species B was found). These values provide a continent-wide assessment of species cooccurrences measured only at the fine spatial scale most relevant to current ecological interactions among species. Scaling these values such that higher numbers indicate lower co-occurrence facilitates comparisons with the corresponding pairwise genetic distances, in which higher values indicate more ancient common ancestry.\nWe have contrasted these patterns of local cooccurrence with patterns of regional co-occurrence, in order to determine whether patterns found in local cooccurrence are the result of phenomena that were not happening at larger scales. Regional co-occurrence was defined as existing when both members of a species pair were reported at least once on an individual 50-point transect in a given year, regardless of whether the two species were reported at the same point. Taken across all BBS transects, regional co-occurrence was given as a value ranging from 0 (species B is always reported on a transect that also reported species A) to 1 (species B is never reported on a transect that has species A).\nWe base both local and regional co-occurrence indices on reported detections of warbler species, and each detection is a combined result of the presence of a bird species at a site and the human detection of the individual bird(s). Because the detection data result from both a biological process and a methodological filter (detection by observers), it is important to know whether the patterns found reflect the biological process and not a methodological artifact. To our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive attempt to estimate the detection probabilities of all of the warbler species examined in this study. While we cannot calculate these detection probabilities in a fully rigorous manner (e.g., MacKenzie et al. 2002) with the data at hand, we can calculate indices of detection probability that allow us to explore some potential biases. For each species of wood-warbler, we randomly selected a single point on each BBS transect that had reported the species on at least two points in at least one year; the actual median number of points at which a species was reported ranging from 2 (for one species only) to 11 across all species. The transect had to be censused for at least five years, and transects censused for longer had one or two years of data randomly discarded to leave exactly five years of available data. Using a standardized number of years' data avoided inducing variation in the detection index due to differences among species in the number of years that transects were censused. The randomly selected census point within the transect had to have reported the target species in at least two separate years. Our rationale is that we are purposefully selecting transects in regions in which a given species was likely to present, as well as specific census points at which habitat was suitable and the species potentially present every year. The detection index for each species was the proportion of point-years, summed across all selected points, on which that species was detected. The values of the detection indices used here are the median values from 1000 iterations of the process of randomly selecting a single census point per transect. In calculating these indices of detection, we assume that among-year detection probability contains information about within-year detection probability, the latter being the detection probability of interest.\nValues of the detection index spanned 0.43-0.62 for different species, with a median of 0.52 and a mean value of 0.53. Thus, values of the index were roughly symmetrically distributed, and most species detection rates were at intermediate values: the interquartile range spanned 0.50-0.56. While our index of detection probability is biased high relative to true detection probability, due to the use of data for which each species had a minimum probability of 0.4 of being detected at each individual site, this bias should be roughly equal for all species."}, {"section_title": "Spatial foraging niche characters", "text": "Co-occurring songbirds usually vary in traits that include foraging height, foraging substrate, and nest location (e.g., MacArthur 1958 , Lack 1971 , Robinson and Holmes 1982 , Morse 1989 , Richman and Price 1992 , Martin 1998 , suggesting that within-site niche partitioning is pervasive in these communities. There is also strong evidence that some closely related woodwarblers compete antagonistically in sympatry (Martin and Martin 2001 ). MacArthur's 1958 paper spawned a large number of subsequent studies of wood-warbler niche segregation in traits such as foraging behavior, habitat strata, nest locations, and prey types, but methodological differences among studies in different local communities make it difficult to integrate these measures into a common index of niche differentiation. Instead, we coded a fundamental and unambiguously categorizing attribute of the foraging niche of woodwarblers, designating each species as either terrestrial (mean foraging height ,1 m; 10 species) or arboreal (mean height .1 m; 33 species) based on quantitative foraging studies conducted during the breeding season (Poole and Gill 2004) . Each pair of taxa could therefore comprise species that forage primarily in similar (terrestrial-terrestrial and arboreal-arboreal pairs) or separated (terrestrial-arboreal) strata. This categorization allowed us to determine whether species pairs that are predicted to interact more intensively (because they occur in the same stratum; MacArthur 1958 , Morse 1989 :293, Wiens 1989 show a different association between phylogenetic relationship and co-occurrence than do species pairs with a higher degree of spatial separation."}, {"section_title": "Taxon sampling", "text": "We included 43 Parulidae species that breed within the BBS region in the continental United States and Canada, excluding only six rare or geographically peripheral species that were recorded on few ( 10) BBS transects; all included species were recorded on !41 transects. Excluded species were Colima Warbler (Vermivora crissalis), Tropical Parula (Parula pitiayumi), Goldencheeked Warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia), Kirtland's Warbler (D. kirtlandii), Red-faced Warbler (Cardellina rubrifrons), and Painted Redstart (Myioborus pictus). We excluded two additional species, the Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) and the Olive Warbler (Peucedramus taeniatus), because, although these morphologically aberrant lineages have traditionally been placed in the Parulidae, more recent phylogenetic analyses (Sibley and Ahlquist 1990 , Klicka et al. 2000 , Lovette and Bermingham 2002 have shown unambiguously that they fall outside the Parulidae and that they are more closely related to species in other families."}, {"section_title": "Genetic distances", "text": "As indices of phylogenetic similarity, we generated two matrices of genetic distances among the 43 woodwarbler species based on the complete DNA sequences of the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome oxidase I, cytochrome oxidase II, NADH dehydrogenase II, ATPase 6, and ATPase 8 genes (4116 nucleotides/taxon; GenBank accession numbers AY650182-AY650224). Noncoding spacer regions and tRNA sequences situated between these coding genes were sequenced, but they were excluded from distance calculations owing to their different underlying pattern of molecular evolution. These sequences are substantially longer than the mitochondrial alignments typically generated for species-level avian phylogenetics; by basing our distance metric on this robust mtDNA data set, we minimize the stochastic error in our estimates of pairwise distances. Laboratory methods used to generate these sequences have been described elsewhere (e.g., Lovette 2004) .\nWe calculated the first matrix of pairwise distances using the maximum likelihood (ML) method implemented in PAUP*4.0 (Swofford 2002) under the general time reversal plus gamma plus invariant sites (GTR-g\u00feI) model. Because these ML distances could be biased if mitochondrial divergence is not constant across lineages, as would be the case if a subset of the taxa included here had a higher or lower mutation rate than the remaining taxa, we also calculated pairwise distances using the summed branch lengths connecting each pair of termini in an ultrametric tree. We derived this ultrametric tree from an analysis in which the Bayesian topology described below was imported into PAUP* as a constraint tree, the heuristic search algorithm was set to produce a clocklike (ultrametric) topology, and a maximum-likelihood analysis was conducted using mean GTR-g\u00feI parameters derived from the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. Hereafter, we use the term ''ML distances'' to refer to the nonultrametric distance matrix, and ''ultrametric distances'' to refer to the ML distance matrix derived from the ultrametric branch lengths in the topology with an enforced molecular clock. For all statistical analyses involving genetic distance matrices, we report the results from the ML distances followed by the ultrametric distances (hence these summaries each have two successive P values, etc.). As the results from the two alternative distance metrics were highly congruent (see Results and Discussion), the figures printed here illustrate only the ML distance-based comparisons; the Appendix depicts the alternative figures based on the ultrametric distance matrix.\nWe reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among the 43 species using the same sequences employed for the genetic distance calculations. We generated these phylogenetic analyses via the Bayesian MCMC approach implemented in MrBayes 3.0b4 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001) under the GTR-g\u00feI model of sequence evolution. The search was run for 5 3 10 6 generations and sampled every 2500 generations; the initial 1000 samples were discarded as burn-in. An important assumption in our use of mtDNA-based distances as a measure of species relationships is that the mtDNA gene tree reflects the overall organismal ''species tree'' for these taxa. This assumption would be violated if past hybridization resulted in interspecific mitochondrial transfer (introgression), as has been documented in a few avian groups in which closely allied species breed in sympatry (e.g., Gala\u00b4pagos finches; Sato et al. 1999) , or between species with active hybrid zones. In the paruline warblers several lines of evidence-including long, species-specific mtDNA lineages Bermingham 1999, 2002) and the very high congruence between the mtDNA gene tree and independent trees from DNA sequences from six unlinked nuclear loci (I. J. Lovette, unpublished data)-suggest that the mitochondrial tree is not highly biased by past introgression. The relative constancy of mitochondrial substitution rates is also apparent in this phylogram, in which there are no conspicuously long or short terminal branches or clades."}, {"section_title": "Quantile regression", "text": "Conventional regression analyses describe changes in mean response, which might not be biologically meaningful information under some circumstances, including our examination of the relationships between phylogenetic and ecological distances. While the potential for high ecological overlap could change with greater phylogenetic distance between warbler species, this potential might not be realized for all pairs of species. Thus, on average, ecological overlap could vary little with changes in phylogenetic distance, even if some proportion of species pairs that are more distantly related do have greater ecological overlap; i.e., a regression through the mean could show no relationship between phylogenetic distance and ecological overlap, but a regression through data from the most highly overlapping species (e.g., the 95th percentile of highest overlap at each value of phylogenetic distance) would exhibit a relationship between phylogenetic distance and ecological overlap. Thus, we needed to analyze our data using statistical techniques that could provide us regression lines through percentiles (quantiles) of our choosing, if we wanted to detect the patterns that we expected.\nWe did not simply select the data points from the quantiles of our choosing and run conventional regression lines through these. This approach would have required us to arbitrarily divide the continuous variation in phylogenetic distance into discrete intervals, in which to determine the appropriate value of co-occurrence for each quantile used. Such arbitrariness would have meant that regression lines, and thus biological conclusions, would be dependent on the rules used to divide data into groups with differing ranges of phylogenetic distance. In order to avoid these complications in interpretation of results, we used a statistically justifiable and repeatable analytical technique, linear quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett 1978, Cade and Noon 2003) , to quantify the relationship between phylogenetic distance and quantiles of the distribution of co-occurrence. Instead of describing a single line through the mean, as is done in conventional linear regression, a linear quantile regression describes linear changes in the shape of the entire distribution of the response variable at all values of a predictor variable, allowing a user to request production of regression lines through one or several arbitrarily chosen quantiles of the response variable's distribution. Regression equations for any arbitrary quantiles of this distribution can be calculated.\nIn our analyses, we examined changes in median and 5% quantiles of our co-occurrence measures as a function of changes in phylogenetic distance. Remember that our indices of co-occurrence were defined so that high numbers correspond to lower co-occurrence; thus a 5% quantile denotes the 95th percentile of high cooccurrence. Regressions through the median inform us as to whether pervasive changes in co-occurrence were seen along the gradient of phylogenetic distances. A median-quantile regression line and a conventional linear regression line would be essentially identical for data with normally distributed errors. Slopes from the 5% quantiles, in contrast, indicate whether the extent of co-occurrence varied only for a small proportion of species pairs with greater than median co-occurrence. The 5% quantile reflects variation in the relationship between co-occurrence and phylogenetic distance when only a small proportion of species pairs have actually realized the potential for greater co-occurrence with changing phylogenetic distance. Note that, as mentioned above, changes in the 5% quantile reflect changes in the shape of the entire distribution of co-occurrence, and should not be interpreted to mean that only the 5% of most highly co-occurring species varied in co-occurrence with changes in phylogenetic distance. We do not present results for 95% quantiles, as the 95% quantile of co-occurrence did not vary with changes in phylogenetic distance. In all cases the 5% of species pairs with the lowest co-occurrence (i.e., the 95% quantile) abutted the hard boundary of complete non-co-occurrence at point or transect (i.e., had a co-occurrence of zero and hence an ecological distance of 1.0)."}, {"section_title": "Randomizations and statistical analyses", "text": "Two attributes of the data require the use of randomization tests for exploring the association between ecological co-occurrence and phylogenetic distance. First, the underlying comparisons between pairs of species are not independent: owing to differences in abundance, each pair of species was represented twice in calculations of ecological co-occurrence (A with B, and B with A), and a given species was also represented in all pairwise associations with co-occurring species. Each species was similarly represented multiple times in the matrix of pairwise genetic distances. As a result, a nonzero slope for the relationship between phylogenetic distance and co-occurrence could be generated by chance alone. This nonindependence would also cause true Type I error rates to differ from the nominal rates calculated by more conventional statistical tests, another problem that is dealt with by randomization tests.\nFor our examination of local (within-BBS-transect) patterns, we generated null distributions against which to compare the observed relationships between phylogenetic and ecological co-occurrence by randomly shuffling species identities among points within each BBS transect. The algorithm used in the randomizations was to randomly reorder the values within the species name column in the input data table, with the reordering done separately and independently for data from each BBS transect. The input data table for this randomization had one line for each species and census point on a BBS transect on which that species was observed, with each BBS transect being represented by only one year of data. The result of the randomization was to maintain the same number of warbler species being recorded at each point on a transect, maintain the number of points at which each species was reported, and maintain the same species composition on a transect as was present in the actual data. The randomization procedure was designed to break up local ecological associations between species, but still (1) maintain the identities and relative abundances of all species within each transect and (2) maintain information on the proportion of points within a transect that were suitable for any species of wood-warbler, for example, ensuring that points with no reported warblers continued to have no warbler species after the randomization. This randomization procedure is similar to a Mantel's test in which cells in a matrix of similarity values are randomly rearranged to produce null distributions. Our procedure differed from that in a Mantel's test by (1) constraining the randomization as explained and (2) employing a different test statistic, in our case slopes from quantile regression.\nIn our analyses of among-transect associations between phylogenetic and regional co-occurrence, we used a similar randomization procedure. Both the number of warbler species per transect and the total number of times each species was found in the data table remained identical to the values in the real data. Only the associations between species pairs were broken up by the randomization procedure. Mechanistically, the randomization was done on an input data table that contained a column identifying each transect uniquely, and another column containing species' names. Each transect appeared 43 times in the file, one time for each warbler's name. A third column in the input data was a Boolean variable that indicated whether each species in the real data was reported on that specific transect. Each transect was represented by a single year's data in the input data file. The randomization was accomplished by randomly reordering the warbler species' names relative to the rest of the information in the input file; this reordering was done separately for species that were listed as having been seen, and those listed as having not been seen on a specific transect in the real data. These two separate reorderings were needed to keep the number of transects on which a species was present in the randomized data at the same value as in the real data. Although the transect-level results are interesting in comparison to the within-transect results that include only species pairs with demonstrated regional sympatry, it is important to note that the transect-level randomization brings together species that never occur together in nature, because they have nonoverlapping geographic distributions.\nThe second reason for using randomization tests was to incorporate replication across multiple years for each transect, as occurrences may differ among years for biological reasons (e.g., demographic productivity in the previous year) and as sampling artifacts. We accounted for this interannual variation by generating multiple data sets, each of which contained a single, randomly selected year's data for each transect. We combined the two levels of randomization by (1) randomly selecting one year for each transect and (2) creating a null data set by randomizing species' distributions for that transectyear as we have described. This two-stage randomization was repeated 1000 times each for the withintransect analyses and the among-transect analyses, and we separately performed the quantile regression analyses for each iteration on the true and randomized data.\nWe investigated whether the patterns found in our analyses were substantially influenced by single species through analyses that tested individually for the influence of each species on the overall results. In these influence analyses, all species pairs containing data from a target species were removed from the data set, and quantile regressions were calculated for each of the 1000 randomly sampled years of true data, as just described. We used the differences between regression slopes with and without the target species as our metric of influence of this species on the overall results. We treated each of the 43 species in turn as the target species and compared their influences by examining median changes in regression slopes, from the 1000 data sets, when that species' data were excluded.\nWe calculated probabilities from our regressions of the relationships between phylogeny and ecological overlap as the proportion of randomizations in which the regression slope from the true data was greater than the slope from the randomized data. Counts of steeper positive and negative slopes were tallied separately, and the proportion of steeper slopes in one direction gave a one-tailed probability. The two-tailed probabilities that we report in the text were calculated by doubling these one-tailed probabilities. The confidence intervals depicted in the figures are the range of the central 95% of all regressions. Plotted results from quantile regression analyses are not derived from median regression coefficients, but are lines that connect a series of predicted values, with the median predicted values representing the regression line and the range of the central 95% of predicted values representing the 95% confidence limits at each point. As a result of plotting lines connecting point estimates, it is possible for plotted lines to show deviations from perfect linearity even though linear quantile regressions were used.\nWe used the SAS statistical software to generate random data sets for analysis and the quantreg library (Quantreg package, 2004, version 3.35 "}, {"section_title": ", by R. Koenker [available online])", "text": "2 for the R statistical software (R Development Core Team 2004) to conduct all quantile regression analyses. Conclusions did not change qualitatively between analyses based on 500 and 1000 randomization iterations, indicating that 1000 iterations were sufficient to describe variability in null associations among taxa."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patterns of association within local areas (BBS transects)", "text": "Three features are immediately obvious in comparisons of ecological dissimilarity with phylogenetic distance (Fig. 2a) . First, although pairwise genetic distances varied within 1-18%, the majority of pairwise distances were clustered at intermediate levels of divergence owing to several periods of rapid cladogenesis during the diversification of this group Bermingham 1999, 2002) . This temporal clustering of nodes is visible in the phylogenetic reconstruction for these taxa (Fig. 3) . Second, there is a notable lack of taxa that are both phylogenetically similar and have high local co-occurrence. This is seen in the empty lower left quadrant in Fig. 2a . Third, across the full gradient of genetic divergence, most species pairs detected on the same Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) transect were rarely detected at the same transect points, leading to the majority of pairwise comparisons of ecological dissimilarity being clustered near the upper boundary in Fig.  2a . A smaller number of species pairs co-occur at higher frequency, with a median (of 1000 random subsamples of BBS data) of only 0.085% of the 1184 pairwise comparisons involving taxa with .50% detected cooccurrence. On a historical note, the five ''spruce-woods warblers'' featured in Robert MacArthur's 1958 study all have median (of 1000 random subsamples of BBS data) pairwise dissimilarity values .0.83, suggesting that these species are not usually detected in local sympatry.\nOur interpretation of the conspicuous absence of species pairs in the lower left quadrant of Fig. 2a is that closely related taxa effectively exclude each other at a local scale, even when they occur in geographic proximity. Some wood-warbler species pairs separated by greater phylogenetic distances had high likelihoods of local co-occurrence, although across all phylogenetic distances the majority of species pairs had relatively high local ecological dissimilarity. We contrasted these observed patterns with a null model of randomized species occurrences. When all pairs of taxa are considered, the median co-occurrence does not change significantly with phylogenetic distance relative to the null distribution (P \u00bc 0.192 for differences in slopes compared to the null model, based on maximumlikelihood distances; P \u00bc 0.164, based on ultrametric distances). However, maximal co-occurrence significantly increases as ML distance increases (P \u00bc 0.03 from the fifth-quantile regression slope), although the FIG. 2.

In panels (b) and (d), regression lines are only plotted across the range on the xaxis of actual data points used to derive the regressions. In these panels, the background points represent the relevant subset of data from the full distribution in panel (a). pattern only approached statistical significance when ultrametric distances were used (P \u00bc 0.066). These results suggest that a subset of the pairs of more distantly related species is capable of higher local association than expected by chance.\nFurther analyses suggest that the increased cooccurrence of some more distantly related species pairs requires divergence in foraging niche in order to reduce potential competition. Adding each species pair's foraging strata information (in the form of a categorical variable with two categories) to the quantile regression analyses revealed a nonrandom relationship at the lower (fifth-quantile) boundary for the mixed-strata pairs (P \u00bc 0.026 for ML distances, P \u00bc 0.000, for ultrametric distances), for which fifth-quantile co-occurrence increased with greater phylogenetic distance (Fig. 2b) , but not for same-stratum pairs, for which the slopes of the real and randomized regressions do not differ significantly (P \u00bc 0.526 for ML distances, P \u00bc 0.736 for ultrametric distances) (Fig. 2c) . Results from analyses using ultrametric distances even suggested the possibility of higher co-occurrrence with greater phylogenetic distance from the median regression for mixed-substrate pairs (P \u00bc 0.070), although this pattern was not reflected in the median regression when ML distances were used (P \u00bc 0.236). No hint of nonrandom associations were found from the median regressions from same-substrate pairs (P \u00bc 0.556 for ML distances, P \u00bc 0.478 for ultrametric distances). Thus, in spite of already having a greater average genetic distance associated with their differing foraging substrates (compare the ranges of genetic distances in Fig. 2b,  c) , only the mixed-stata pairs showed changes in cooccurrence with phylogenetic distance. This result suggests that differences in or associated with foraging substrate are a necessary but not sufficient precondition for co-occurrence to vary with phylogenetic distance.\nTo explore which taxa were driving the fifth-quantile relationship between phylogeny and ecological overlap (Fig. 2b) , we repeated these analyses and serially removed comparisons involving each of the 43 taxa. These influence analyses were only conducted on the fifth-quantile regressions for mixed-strata pairs, as this was the only case in which a clear effect of phylogenetic distance on ecological co-occurrence was detected. Median changes in the fifth-quantile slope, with removal of data from a single species, almost all clustered between \u00c00.5 and 0.5 for the analyses based on ML phylogenetic distances, and between \u00c00.2 and 0.08 for analyses based on ultrametric distances. The only exceptions were for Ovenbirds, in whose absence the median increase in slope was 2.9 (2.7 with ultrametric distances) (Fig. 2d) and Palm Warblers (Dendroica palmarum), for which the median change in slope was \u00c01.6 \u00c01.2 for ultrametric distances). Only the increase in regression slope in the absence of Ovenbirds is relevant to explaining the increased ecological association with increasing phylogenetic distance, and for analyses based on ML phylogenetic distances only for Ovenbirds was the inner 95% of changes above zero, with none of the 1000 data sets showing a lower slope when Ovenbirds were excluded from the quantile regressions. With ultrametric phylogenetic distances, the slope of the 5% quantile line was always higher in the absence of data from Ovenbirds and always lower in the absence of data from Palm Warblers. The effect of Ovenbirds is not surprising because of the Ovenbird's placement as the earliest branch within the entire Parulidae (Lovette and Bermingham 2002; I. J. Lovette, unpublished data) (Fig. 3) . If ecological differentiation is associated with time, this relatively ancient lineage is expected to exhibit the highest ecological differentiation (and concomitant spatial association) relative to the more derived species within the radiation.\nA nonrandom increase in the potential for ecological co-occurrence of distantly related species was one of two patterns evident in our data. We also find evidence of consistent phylogenetic niche conservatism in the ubiquitous vertical offset between the actual and null quantile regression lines (Fig. 2b-d) . This phenomenon is present in all quantile regressions and is particularly evident in the lower fifth quantiles. The consistently lower position of the regression lines based on the real data, relative to the lines from the corresponding null models, indicates that, regardless of phylogenetic distance, similarly related sympatric species choose a larger number of similar habitats than expected by chance. This pattern is consistent with a growing body of evidence showing that phylogenetic relationships sometimes explain substantial variation in how related species are distributed across habitat types, bioclimatic regions, and other niche-related environmental variables (e.g., Latham 1992, Peterson et al. 1999) . The historical legacy in ecological niches is not surprising, given that phylogenetic effects are usually apparent in organismal traits with a genetic basis, from molecular pathways to complex behaviors (Harvey and Pagel 1991, Ackerly 2003) . In a different context, niche conservation is also apparent in the distribution of arboreal vs. terrestrial foraging among these 43 wood-warbler species (Fig. 3) : evolutionary switches among these strata are uncommon, and no pairs of very closely related species have diverged across this level of spatial segregation.\nAre patterns driven by differences in species' detection probabilities?\nThe data presented in Fig. 2 are based on detections of individual birds, which require both that a given species is actually present and also that this species has been detected by the censusing observers. Actual presence, and hence ecological co-occurrence, is thereby systematically underestimated by the inevitable missed detections. As a result, the percentages of co-occurrence presented here are not direct quantifications of ecological co-occurrence, but instead comparable indices of relative co-occurrence. Nevertheless, examination of patterns in our index of detection probability (see Methods) leads us to believe that the general patterns of ecological co-occurrence that we have summarized would be essentially impossible to create as a result of among-species variation in detection probability alone.\nWe expect that relatively low ecological co-occurrence for the majority of species pairs is a biologically real phenomenon, because creation of this pattern through variation in detection probability would require at least one member of the majority of species pairs to have an anomalously low detection probability. As long as the distribution of species' detection probabilities has a mode at some intermediate value (as our index of detection probability does; see Methods), the observed distribution of ecological co-occurrence would be extremely unlikely to be produced as a result of interspecific variation in detection rates. The products of detection indices for all observed species pairs are, as expected, distributed with a peak at intermediate values, which indicates that the generally low local co-occurrence of species pairs (Fig. 2a) is a biologically real phenomenon.\nFor reasons similar to those we have discussed, increasing ecological co-occurrence with increasing phy-logenetic distance (Fig. 2b ) also appears highly unlikely to be an artifact of systematic variation in detection probabilities among species as a function of their phylogenetic distance. For variation in detection probabilities to have caused this pattern, we would need to find detection probabilities of some proportion of species pairs to increase with increasing phylogenetic distance. However, we found no evidence for this, and in fact a significant tendency in the opposite direction using a fifth-quantile regression of minimum detection index (within each of the 903 species pairs) against phylogenetic distance. In this fifth-quantile regression, confidence intervals around the estimated slope did not come close to overlapping zero (slope \u00bc \u00c00.45, 95% confidence limits of \u00c00.50 to \u00c00.41). Thus, we believe that the increasing ecological co-occurrence with greater phylogenetic distance is a biological phenomenon and not an artifact of limitations of data collection.\nInterspecific variation in detection rates could only have caused the significant influence of Ovenbirds on the results (Fig. 2b, d ) if increasing genetic distance from Ovenbirds were correspondingly correlated with increasing detection probability (e.g., by louder and more persistent vocalization) for arboreally foraging woodwarblers. While there was an increase in detection probability of arboreally foraging species paired with Ovenbirds as their phylogenetic distance from Ovenbirds increased, the result was not statistically significant (r 2 \u00bc 0.05, P \u00bc 0.19, N \u00bc 33, slope \u00bc 0.76). Even were this increase in detection probability real, it still would translate to an average change in the detection index of only 8% across the full range of phylogenetic distances between Ovenbirds and arboreally foraging warblers found on the same transects. In contrast, the presence of species pairs with Ovenbirds leads to a roughly 135% change in ecological co-occurrence at the fifth quantile (Fig. 2d) . This contrast of effects suggests that, while systematic variation in detectability contributed slightly to the closer measured ecological co-occurrence of arboreally foraging warblers more distantly related to Ovenbirds, the effect of this measurement artifact was trivial.\nFinally, the lower position of the real vs. null regression lines that we interpret as indicating higher than expected niche conservatism could only be an artifact of varying detection probabilities if the actual species pairs were composed of pairings in which both members had higher detection probabilities than was typical of randomly selected pairs of warbler species. The median product of the detection probabilities of the actual species pairs was 0.281, and products ranged from 0.198 to 0.375 in the 903 observed species pairs. From 1000 iterations of an equal number of random species pairings, the median product was 0.281 (95% confidence limits 0.279-0.282). There is no evidence to suggest that phylogenetic niche conservatism is a sampling artifact.\nContrasting local and regional relationships between phylogenetic distance and spatial co-occurrence\nAt the broader spatial scale involving comparisons among transects, there was a greater range of variation FIG. 4 . Regional co-occurrence of wood-warbler species pairs across a gradient of phylogenetic divergence (maximumlikelihood distances). In each panel the background of plotted points depicts the same random sample of real census transect-years that is representative of patterns observed across all 1000 such iterations. (a) Distribution of pairwise associations between phylogeny and regional co-occurrence among taxa that forage at similar (green) or different (black) habitat strata. (b) Median (thick lines) and lower fifth quantile (thin lines) relationships between phylogenetic distance and regional co-occurrence for all species pairs combined. Regressions through the true data (red) and randomized null-model data (blue) are both plotted. For each of the four lines, the median from the 1000 iterations is plotted with the inner 95% of predicted values forming the confidence intervals (dashed lines).\nin species co-occurrence (Fig. 4a) than was found for local, ecological co-occurrence (Fig. 2a) . However, the higher values of co-occurrence may largely be accounted for by the higher probability of detection of a given species on a transect as a whole, relative to a single point on that transect. Nevertheless, we found a predominance of species pairs with little or no overlap in occurrence on transects, as we would expect given that at maximum 23 of the 46 North American wood-warblers ever occur on the same transect, and most transects support substantially fewer species (Fig. 1) . This real geographical separation among many species pairs drives much of the pattern in the transect-level analyses and demonstrates the value of the point-based comparisons we describe, in which we are able to restrict analyses to only those transects where both members of a given pair of species occur.\nAt the transect level, the fact that many pairs of warbler species have largely to fully nonoverlapping ranges is evidenced in the y-axis offsets between actual median regional overlap and the overlap expected by chance (Fig. 4b) . Here, the median regional overlap was lower (rather than higher, as in the point-based analyses) than expected by chance, as indicated by the complete displacement of the median-quantile regression line above the null-model regression line. The opposite pattern was found in the fifth-quantile regressions, for which the observed level of regional co-occurrence was higher, for the 5% of most overlapping species, than that expected by chance alone, regardless of phylogenetic distances. This fifth-quantile result is likely a function of some species pairs having very similar habitat associations, and thus ranges.\nThe final pattern to emerge from analyses of regional association is that variation in regional overlap with phylogenetic distance is different from that expected by chance alone, when analyses were based on ML distances. If warbler species were randomly distributed across North America, the randomization suggests that there would be a slight decrease in regional cooccurrence with increasing phylogenetic distance (as indicated by the positive slope of the blue medianquantile regression line in Fig. 4b ). What we actually found for the real data is no relationship between regional co-occurrence and phylogenetic distance (as represented by the flat red median-quantile in Fig. 4b ), a statistically significant difference from the null slope (P \u00bc 0.000). For analyses based on ultrametric distances, the slope of the line through the real data did not differ from zero, although in this case the result was not a departure from the null regression line (P \u00bc 0.110), the slope of which also did not differ from zero. This comparison suggests that there is only a weak signature of phylogeny on the overall geographic ranges of these North American warbler species. Previous studies of other taxa have sometimes reported stronger (and usually positive) correlations between phylogenetic distances and the overlap of species' geographic ranges (e.g., Barraclough and Vogler 2000) , but the lack of such an association in our analyses is the result predicted for groups of organisms-such as these warblers-in which species' ranges must have been shifted repeatedly by large-scale climate cycles, thereby scrambling most geographic patterns associated with their initial speciation events .\nIn summary, when comparing point (Fig. 2) and transect (Fig. 4) scales, there are clear differences in both the general magnitude of species' co-occurrence, and in the relationship between phylogenetic distance and species co-occurrence. Broadly speaking, these differences reinforce the notion that the factors that are determining local ecological co-occurrence are different than those biogeographic influences that have created the varying distributional ranges of North America's parulid warblers."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Phylogenetic niche conservation has most often been observed in allopatric species that occupy similar niches despite a period of evolutionary isolation (e.g., Peterson et al. 1999 ); in such cases, niche conservation may even enhance the probability of continued isolation if it lowers the likelihood that one or both populations evolve ecologically to occupy the previously unsuitable habitat that separated them (Wiens 2004) . Stabilizing selection on niche attributes is one potential cause of phylogenetic niche conservation (Harvey and Pagel 1991, Ackerly 2003) , but stabilizing selection leading to phylogenetic niche conservatism may be more likely in allopatry because it is less likely to be opposed by divergent selection among closely related sympatric taxa. The analyses here suggest that niche conservation is evident in a large group of species, even with substantial sympatry. In the wood-warblers, divergent selection stemming from interspecific competition has not been sufficient to completely erase the phylogenetic legacy of habitat specialization.\nThe majority of our comparisons address only the component of ecological differentiation that is associated with species' spatial co-occurrences, or their lack thereof. For example, these comparisons are much more likely to detect patterns related to fundamental differences in species' selection of habitats than they are to the more subtle ecological differences that likely allow coexisting species to partition ecological resources within habitats. The contrasting quantile regressions for pairs of warbler species that forage in similar vs. mixed vegetation strata (Fig. 2b, c) demonstrate that behavioral differentiation contributes to patterns of local community composition, but we were unable to further address this level of ecological niche differentiation. Another important limitation of our approach is that both present and past competition might cause species to be spatially segregated, and our analyses do not distinguish between the effects of ongoing species interactions and differentiation in site selection caused by competition in the past. Similarly, at an even broader spatial scale, it is possible that competitive interactions feed back to influence species' ranges, particularly if species with highly similar ecological niches tend to exclude one another at this broad scale. The influence of competition on the regional species pool has been termed the Narcissus Effect in the ecological literature (Colwell and Winkler 1984) , but has received less attention in a phylogenetic context. Because the comparisons presented here are most biologically informative at the site-within-transect level, we are unable to provide a robust test for any patterns at the broader regional level.\nConsidered in concert, our results suggest that woodwarbler community assembly is constrained by ecological similarity among closely related species, with subsequent local co-occurrence of more distantly related lineages mediated in part by divergence in ecology and behavior. Considerable evolutionary time appears to be required for high levels of spatial overlap. This interpretation challenges the classic depiction of the North American wood-warbler adaptive radiation as one in which many species have quickly evolved substantial behavioral differences that allow extensive coexistence (Lack 1971 , Morse 1989 , Price et al. 2000 . Phylogenetic niche conservatism (Ricklefs and Latham 1992 , Peterson et al. 1999 , Webb et al. 2002 appears to play a continuing role in structuring even these highly spatially and temporally dynamic communities, and the relatively few pairs of taxa that consistently co-occur with high frequency are both distantly related and ecologically differentiated. At the most general level, this new phylogenetic perspective on the community ecology of the parulid warblers reinforces the idea that for most groups of sympatric species, the relationship between phylogeny and community structure likely involves simultaneous stasis and differentiation along many ecological niche axes."}]
