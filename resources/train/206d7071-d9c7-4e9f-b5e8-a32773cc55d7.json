It is important to note that the DPA certification has been 3 renamed as Physical Activity Leader (PAL), which we use in this article, but at the time of the 4 survey, the DPA acronym was used. 5 PE teaching load was assessed with one item, worded \"Currently, how many physical 6 education teachers are employed at your school? Please provide a response as percentage full-7 time equivalents (i.e., one full-time teacher = 100% FTE; one full-time and one half-time teacher 8 = 150% FTE).\" This was used to create a measure indicating teacher workload, calculated as the 9 total number of students at each school, divided by the FTE of PE teachers. This is similar to the 10 calculation of \"number of students per PE teacher FTE\" in other research on human resources for 11 PE (Bevans et al., 2010)."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "\nFinally, it is worth considering whether assessment is a crucial aspect of PE. In this study, 13 we have conceptualized in-class practices-such as the assessment of student knowledge, 14 physical fitness, and physical activity-as valuable practices, but some may not agree on this 15 point. According to SHAPE America (2015), the formative and summative assessment of student 16 progress is an important part of PE. However, it is crucial to remember that while such 17 assessment provides useful information for tailoring instruction, it should not be used for 18 assigning grades, but only to teach students about how to set goals and monitor their progress practices. We find an inverse association between workload and PE practices. In other words, 4 when teaching loads are too high, PE practices are not optimal. Most likely, this is a result of 5 districts and schools trying to preserve PE programming by stretching their limited financial 6 resources-either by hiring fewer teachers, or by having their existing teachers cover more 7 students. Our point is not to criticize school districts; the past decade's financial recession has 8 been devastating to many districts. Educational funding to schools declined in nearly all states in 9 the first part of this decade (Leachman & Mai, 2014), and many schools are taking measures that 10 impact all students and content areas or academic subjects, such as increasing class size, cutting 11 extracurricular activities, reducing staff, and cutting professional development expenses (Hull, 12 2010). This has compromised the quality of educational opportunities in a variety of content 13 areas, including \"core subjects\" such as mathematics and English language arts, as well as the 14 other crucial elements of well-rounded education. However, given abundant evidence that 15 healthy children are better learners (Basch, 2011; CDC, 2010), allocating resources to PE 16 programs supports teachers, and provides important benefits to students, not only for their 17 physical health but also for their academic performance. Financial support is essential for schools 18 to be able to employ a sufficient number of well-trained PE professionals, and to provide 19 instructional resources such as PE equipment. We urge administrators to prioritize students' 20 current and future health and academic outcomes by supporting PE teachers in providing PE 21 programming that teaches children the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to be active for a "}, {"section_title": "PE continuing education (PE-CE)", "text": "was assessed with an item asking \"are physical 13 education teachers at your school required to earn continuing education credits on physical 14 education topics?\" Response options were yes, no, and don't know. Affirmative responses were 15 followed with two additional items: PE-CE amount was assessed with one item asking \"how 16 many hours of continuing education (professional development) on physical education topics do 17 physical education teachers receive each year?\" and PE-CE financial support was assessed 18 with one item drawn verbatim from the S-PAPA, worded \"does your school or school district 19 provide financial support for physical education teachers' professional development\" (i.e., CEU 20 registration, conferences). Response options were yes, no, don't know.\nAnnual PE budgets at each school were assessed with one item based on the S-PAPA, 1 asking \"is there a school budget specifically for physical education equipment and supplies, and 2 if yes, how much is allocated annually?\" If there was no budget allocated, this was coded as zero. pertaining to frequency and dosage of PE were anchored to third-grade students.

This coding was chosen to allow the use of logistic 18 regression models to calculate the percentages of schools meeting these guidelines."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "PE assessment practices. Several PE assessment practices were also examined.

First, the sample characteristics were tabulated ( Table 1 ). Then the prevalence of school 10 resources was examined. We were also interested in examining the prevalence of PE 11 programming characteristics, while accounting for covariates (i.e., school characteristics) that 12 might account for differences in these characteristics. Therefore, a series of multivariate logistic 13 regressions were calculated, with one separate model for each of the PE outcomes. In these 14 models, all predictors were entered simultaneously, including controls for school characteristics.\nThis study attempted to obtain a deeper understanding of PE teaching loads at elementary 1 schools, defined as the number of students divided by the FTE of PE teacher(s) at each school. The current study demonstrated that while 45% of elementary schools have one full-time 11 PE specialist (1.0 FTE) and 32% have more than that, 22% of schools across the country have 12 lower levels of staffing, either because they do not have PE specialists or because these 13 individuals are part-time or shared across schools. In small schools, shared staffing arrangements 14 can be adequate, but if one teacher is expected to provide PE instruction at two or more large 15 schools within a district, this will reduce students' opportunities to receive PE instruction. 16 Indeed, our analyses indicate a consistent linear association between teaching load and PE 17 practices. Teaching load-conceptualized here as the total number of students at each school for 18 whom one full-time PE teacher must provide instruction-was inversely associated with 19 providing students with daily PE, with providing students either 60 minutes or 150 minutes of PE about the role of PE teachers, but it may also be due to feasibility issues, given that many 8 teachers already have a lengthy list of responsibilities at their school, often without the resources 9 necessary for success. A detailed study of ten in-service teachers with DPA/PAL certification 10 found that all had successfully reshaped their roles as teachers to include a broader leadership 11 role in the school, and that such efforts resulted in benefits for the school and the students 12 (Centeio, Erwin & Castelli, 2014). However, a key element of that study was the conclusion that 13 teachers continue to focus on quality PE first, and then on implementing and sustaining other 14 CSPAP components, as they are suitable within the context of each school.\nThe results regarding CE in this study are novel in several ways. First, these data provide 1 new information about how much CE in-service teachers are receiving, specifically on PE-2 related topics. Often, due to the organizational structure of educational agencies and a lack of 3 economies of scale for providing PE-specific professional development for multiple teachers, CE 4 opportunities may not be PE-specific, yet it is one of the crucial elements of effective 5 professional development for in-service PE teachers is that it should be based within a 6 community of physical educators (Armour & Yelling, 2004). We found that 50.4% of schools 7 required CE on PE-related topics. This is lower than earlier estimates also using a national 8 survey in 2009-12, where 69.7% of schools required CE on PE topics. Although we used the 9 same sampling approach (i.e., mailback surveys of a nationally-representative sample), the item 10 wording was different. Previously, researchers had asked whether newly hired PE teachers are 11 required to earn CE credits on PE topics (Author citation, 2014). In the current study, the item 12 pertained to all PE teachers, and was embedded within a set of items about PE staffing and 13 resources; it is possible that the PE teacher was more involved in helping with this survey, 14 resulting in more-accurate responses. Furthermore, respondents at 12.5% of these schools 15 indicated that they did not know the answer to the item about CE-PE. Because most respondents 16 were principals who should-presumably-know about the supports available to and expected of 17 their teachers, the high rate of unawareness on this topic is troubling. combined with our results, it appears that it is far from the norm that in-service PE teachers are 23 expected to continue their professional development on PE topics, or are provided support to do 1 so. With regard to the extent of CE-PE, we found a wide range of hourly CE-PE, with a median 2 of 12 hours annually. Notably, most schools that require CE-PE did provide financial support, 3 but 18% of schools that require CE-PE indicated that financial support is not provided. In other 4 words, many PE professionals are expected to obtain CE, but to pay for it from their own 5 salaries, which may reduce the willingness of teachers to participate in CE-PE. Participating in 6 CE can improve the success of all teachers; specific to PE, it has been shown to help teachers to 7 maximize student learning opportunities, teach diverse learners, and improve classroom safety time to allow them to utilize these devices in class. We found that respondents at 29% of schools 18 reported that pedometers are used in PE class. This area of practice could be expanded, given the 19 potential value of providing students with objective information about their activity levels."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "Control variables were dummy coded, with referent categories selected based on preliminary 16 analyses examining associations between school characteristics and the outcome variables. For 17 example, daily PE is most common in the South versus other regions, so the control variable for 18 region was coded as 1 = South versus 0 = other regions. These models were then re-computed 19 with the addition of the school resource predictors, to examine whether resources were 20 associated with outcomes. Among the resource variables, only teaching load was statistically 21 significant in these models and showed a reliable and noticeable pattern of association with PE Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of participating schools. Schools were 11 distributed across all regions of the country, with a variety of racial/ethnic student compositions, 12 and approximately half served a majority of lower-income students (>50% eligible for FRPL).\nAs research continues to grow on the elements of effective professional development for with high teaching loads and obligations to-first and foremost-ensure an optimal PE 20 experience for students, adding leadership expectations to their role might not only be 21 unrealistic, but it could contribute to burnout and departure from the profession, which must be 22 avoided.\nThe survey items regarding how frequently and how much PE students receive is 16 relatively objective information that can also be derived from a school's master calendar. The 17 items could have been misinterpreted as a question about when PE classes are taught, rather than 18 how often students have PE class; however, pre-testing showed no problems, the items have been 19 used and the frequencies are similar to other studies that assess how often third grade students 20 have PE class (Chriqui, Eyler, Carnoske, & Slater, 2013; CDC, 2015). In addition, we 21 acknowledge that principals may lack knowledge about which specific assessment tools (e.g.,"}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "Next, we examined the variables that we conceptualized as representing PE resources. 14 PE teacher staffing. At 10.2% of schools, respondents indicated that the school had no 15 PE teachers; however, PE was offered in these schools, but presumably by non-specialists (e.g., 16 classroom teachers). In other words, PE was taught by specialists at 89.8% of elementary 17 schools. In terms of PE teacher staffing capacity, the modal response (at 44.7% of schools) was a 18 1.0 FTE PE teacher; 12.1% of schools had a part-time (i.e., less than 1.0 FTE) PE teacher; 11.8% 19 of schools had more than 1.0 but less than 2.0 FTE PE teachers; 13.8% of schools had 2.0 FTE 20 PE teachers; and the remaining 5.8% of schools had more than 2.0 FTE PE teachers. 21 PE teaching load.

Perhaps not surprisingly, it was 19 evident that schools that have higher levels of PE staffing-that is, where each full-time PE 20 teacher provides instruction for a total of fewer than 550 students-were more likely to provide 21 students more time in PE class, and to assess some types of PE outcomes.
