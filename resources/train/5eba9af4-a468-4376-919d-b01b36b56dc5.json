Meridional transport in the surface mixed layer is due to northward Ekman transport and mostly southward eddy transport. In seasonal ice-covered areas near Antarctica, a significant (14 6 14 Sv) southward transport was found. The southward eddy transport is largest north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and decreases poleward because of the poleward decrease in the eddy diffusivity.

Recently accumulated evidence (e.g., Toggweiler and Samuels 1998; Speer et al. 2000; Webb and Suginohara 2001; Hallberg and Gnanadesikan 2006) points to another central role of the Southern Ocean as a return pathway of bottom water to the surface (Marshall and Speer 2012) . Upwelling of deep waters in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean is largely driven by the westerly winds over the ocean. Some of this upwelled water flows equatorward to evolve into mode and intermediate waters, while the rest flows poleward to become bottom water.\nBox inverse models have been used to estimate the volume transport of this upwelling (Macdonald and Wunsch 1996; Ganachaud and Wunsch 2000; Sloyan and Rintoul 2001b; Lumpkin and Speer 2007) . The hydrographic data used in these inverse models are mainly from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP). The estimated circulations agree grossly but exhibit some differences (e.g., these studies estimate the southward temperature flux across the Indian Ocean at 328S to be 1.3, 1.5, 0.87, and 1.55 PW, respectively), reflecting the different assumptions and constraints of the models. Since the WOCE occupation, some of these hydrographic sections have been reoccupied to elucidate long-term variabilities in water masses and circulation (e.g., Rintoul and Sokolov 2001; Johnson et al. 2007; Katsumata and Fukasawa 2011) . In this paper, we update previous Southern Ocean circulation estimates by combining these two sets of hydrographic data. Since 2000, the hydrographic sections account for only a small portion of increased data from the Southern Ocean; Argo profiling floats have dramatically increased the total amount of hydrographic data (0-2000 m) from the Southern Ocean (Roemmich 2007) . In this work, we also use the velocity estimates derived from the Argo drift data (Katsumata and Yoshinari 2010) to constrain velocity across hydrographic sections (Wijffels et al. 2001; Hern andez-Guerra et al. 2010) . We also compare the estimated circulation determined by the box inverse model with three ocean general circulation models (OGCMs).\nThe observation-based inverse models and OGCMs both show a middepth upwelling branch of the meridional overturning circulation. The overturning circulation is closed by buoyancy loss or gain either in the ocean surface mixed layer or ocean interior. The relative importance of surface or interior processes in closing the overturning circulation is difficult to quantify, largely because of the paucity of data. Nevertheless, quantitative description of these mixing processes is important for understanding the complex physics of the Southern Ocean and answering the closely linked and long-standing question as to what drives the global meridional overturning circulation (Kuhlbrodt et al. 2007; Naveira Garabato et al. 2007 ). Idealized models of Southern Ocean meridional circulation (e.g., Marshall and Radko 2003; Olbers and Visbeck 2005) often assume that the interior Southern Ocean, below the surface mixed layer, is adiabatic and that all diapycnal fluxes are concentrated near the surface. Recent in situ observation (Naveira Garabato et al. 2004 ) and some numerical simulations (Iudicone et al. 2008a,b) suggest that these idealistic assumptions may not be justified. A goal of this work, therefore, is to estimate diapycnal transport in both the surface mixed layer and interior ocean.\nThe convergence and divergence of diapycnal transport in the surface mixed layer drive water mass subduction and upwelling, respectively. Sall ee et al. (2010) estimated subduction/upwelling as well as diapycnal transport in the surface mixed layer and determined the relative importance of Ekman and eddy transports on mixed layer processes, but the southern limit of their estimate was the seasonal ice edge. Here, we attempted to extend the southern limit of mixed layer subduction/ upwelling estimates by using hydrographic data. An advantage of this study is that our estimate is free from assumptions about the mixing process, such as horizontal eddy-mixing coefficients, sea ice processes, and poorly constrained (Cerove cki et al. 2011 ) air-sea flux data. On the other hand, the hydrographic sections in the Southern Ocean were observed during summer, and possible seasonal biases have to be accounted for by large uncertainties. Also the spatial resolution of box inverse models is much lower than that of Argo-or satellite-based analyses (Sall ee et al. 2010 (Sall ee et al. , 2011 ."}, {"section_title": "Box inverse model", "text": "Eight hydrographic sections define the horizontal extent of the boxes ( Fig. 1 0, 26.1, 26.2, 26.3, 26.4, 26.5, 26.6, 26.7, 26.8, 26.9, 27.0, 27.1, 27.2, 27.3, 27.4, 27.5, 27.6, 27.72, 27.8, 27.9, 28.0, 28.11, and 28.2 , and the sea floor, where g n denotes the approximate neutral density of (1000 1 g n ) kg m 23 calculated by the method of Jackett and McDougall (1997) .

The velocity correction at these initial zero-velocity surfaces and the diapycnal fluxes were then determined such that the volume, temperature, and salinity in each box were conserved. Details of the inverse box model are described in the appendix.

Mixed layer box", "text": "We included a surface ''mixed layer'' box in the inverse model that is separate from the interior boxes (Fig. 2) . Each large basin box, defined by the hydrographic sections, is divided into a surface and interior boxes, and volume and tracers can be exchanged between the surface and interior boxes in the same basin as well as with adjoining basin surface boxes. The separation of the surface and interior ocean is motivated by theoretical models of the Southern Ocean meridional circulation (e.g., Marshall and Radko 2003; Olbers and Visbeck 2005) , in which it is assumed that the overturning circulation is driven by near-surface momentum and buoyancy fluxes from the atmosphere whereas the interior is adiabatic, and by observational studies suggesting that the interior ocean mixing is an important component of the Southern Ocean meridional circulation (e.g., Sloyan and Rintoul 2001a,b; Naveira Garabato et al. 2004) .\nBy defining a separate mixed layer box and interior ocean box, we can distinguish the near-surface diapycnal fluxes driven by surface buoyancy forcing and eddies from the interior diapycnal fluxes driven by diapycnal mixing from breaking gravity waves and nonlinear effects of the seawater equation of state. Subduction and upwelling through the base of the mixed layer are estimated as part of the inverse solution. The thickness of the mixed layer is defined by density; the bottom of the mixed layer box is at the depth where the density is 0.03 kg m 23 heavier than the surface density defined as the average density above the 20-dbar depth (Dong et al. 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "FORMULATION", "text": "To define the mixed layer box in the inverse model, we consider the volume budget of the mixed layer (Sall ee et al. 2010)\nwhere S is the rate at which water crosses the mixed layer base (positive is upwelling into the mixed layer), FIG. 1.

Proceeding northward, the transports across the isopycnals are estimated.\nIt is technically possible to add salt and temperature constraints to the mixed layer box similar to (8); however, surface fluxes have large uncertainties and addition of salt and temperature constraints did not improve the uncertainty of the solution. We also note that the freshwater flux into the surface layer is negligibly small [e.g., the average freshwater flux into the Pacific box 26.9 , g n , 27.0 is 0.04 Sv based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reanalysis (Kanamitsu et al. 2002) ], so the volume conservation can safely ignore the air-sea flux. In the interior boxes, however, salt and temperature (and silicate in the Indian Ocean, see the appendix) are conserved such that salt and temperature fluxes between the mixed layer box and interior boxes are determined to satisfy the interior conservation conditions."}, {"section_title": "b. Two hydrographic datasets", "text": "In this study, we have combined two hydrographic observation datasets: the first was obtained by the WHP between November 1987 and October 1998 and the second was obtained during revisits by the CLIVAR/ Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigation Program (GO-SHIP; Revisit) between August 2003 and May 2009 (Table 1) . We assumed that the WHP and Revisit data were statistically independent. As discussed by Tziperman (1988) , there are two possible ways to combine the datasets. We call the first method the direct method, as the ocean circulation is directly estimated by first averaging the two hydrographic datasets and then applying the inverse model to the averaged section data.\nWe call the second method the merging method because the ocean circulation is estimated by applying the inverse model to the two hydrographic datasets separately and then averaging the resultant solutions.\nIn the direct method, the time variability, particularly the barotropic response to the wind, is expected to contribute most to the uncertainty (Ganachaud 2003) , so it is not realistic to apply the same velocity correction to both WHP and Revisit data. Therefore, the conservation equation for the direct method applied to a box with two hydrographic sections is 1 2\nwhere y \u00c1A ij is the geostrophic shear calculated from the hydrographic data along section A at station i and depth j, b \u00c1A i is the velocity correction along section A at station i on the assumed zero-velocity surface, W j is the diapycnal volume flux across the surface at depth j, and superscripts W and R indicate the WHP and Revisit occupations, respectively. Ganachaud (2003) has confirmed that different hydrographic sections can be consistently combined as long as the time-mean Ekman transport is used for all sections. We use the Ekman transport averaged from August 1987 to July 2009 for the direct method calculated from NCEP-DOE reanalysis wind stress (Kanamitsu et al. 2002) . The Ekman layer is assumed to have an exponential horizontal velocity profile with an e-folding scale of 60 m. We also constrained the upwelling transport between g n 5 26.2 and g n 5 27.3 by using estimates from Sall ee et al. (2010), which we considered to be long-term averages.\nFor the merging method, we note that the best estimated mean of a quantity x a with uncertainty 6s a and another quantity x b with uncertainty 6s b is given by\nso that the combined uncertainty is\nThe Ekman transport was calculated separately for the WHP period (November 1987 -October 1998 and Revisit period (August 2003 -July 2009 ) and used in the respective inversions. Tziperman (1988) shows that these two estimates of the velocity correction and fluxes agree where the eddy transport across the hydrographic section is small. Although the zonal eddy transport across meridional hydrographic sections is not well known, there have been a few attempts to estimate the meridional eddy transport. The meridional component of eddy heat flux estimated from the satellite altimeter data ( Fig. 1 of Wunsch 1999) suggests that the eddy heat flux is small near 308S except for the western boundary of the South Atlantic Ocean. Indeed, estimates by the direct and merging methods (Table 3) generally agree with each other except in the Atlantic and Indian sectors where eddies are active.\nc. Velocity at 1000 dbar estimated by float drift Finally, the horizontal velocity across the hydrographic sections was constrained by the horizontal velocity estimated at 1000 dbar from subsurface float data. The float data consist of trajectory data from the WOCE subsurface floats (Davis 1998 (Davis , 2005 and Argo floats (Lebedev et al. 2007 ). In the merging method, the WOCE data were used for the WHP inversion and the Argo data for the Revisit inversion. In the direct method, both data were combined before mapping. The WOCE data were downloaded from the WOCE Subsurface Float Data Assembly Center (http://wfdac.whoi.edu) and the Argo trajectory data are available online (YoMaHa07; http://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/yomaha/). We used an objective mapping method of Davis (2005) , where the mapped field are not only statistically optimal but also in perfect geostrophic balance ( Fig. 1) and satisfy the no-normal-flow condition at the boundary. The number of trajectories is 67 649 from the WOCE subsurface floats and 638 171 from the Argo floats (Davis 2005; Katsumata and Yoshinari 2010) . The application of the float constraints increased number of constraints applied to the model from 399 to 1628 [rank of the inversion matrix E in (A4) from 387 to 573]. Because, as discussed in section 2b, the eddy transport across the meridional sections crossing the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is not known, we applied velocity constraints only across zonal sections (P6, I3/4, I5, and A10) by using the low-pass-filtered geostrophic pressure (Wijffels et al. 2001 ) with a cutoff length of 600 km. For the direct method inversion, 88% of the float constraints were satisfied within one standard deviation."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "a. Isopycnal transports across hydrographic sections", "text": "As previously noted, the only volume constraint imposed in the inverse model was the Pacific-Atlantic interbasin exchange via Bering Strait, other wellobserved transports and interbasin exchanges (Drake Passage and Indonesian Throughflow) therefore can be used to assess the performance of the box inverse model (Table 3) . Under the steady-state assumption, the southward transport across I3/4 (direct, 10 6 8 Sv; merging, 17 6 7 Sv) is equal to the Indonesian Throughflow transport (15 Sv) (Gordon et al. 2010) . The transport across the meridional sections, the ACC transport, differed among the OGCMs: the average transport across Drake Passage (SR1, 688W) was estimated to be 114 Sv (K7), 142 Sv [the OGCM for the Earth Simulator (OFES)], or 151 Sv [Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA)]. The transports estimated by the inverse models (direct, 160 6 6 Sv; merging, 157 6 6 Sv) are slightly larger than but not inconsistent with recent estimates of 153 6 5 Sv (Mazloff et al. 2010) , 154 6 38 Sv (Firing et al. 2011) , and 152 Sv (Forget 2009 ), but notably larger than two observations made in January/February 2006 [Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP)-referenced geostrophic transport, 136.6 6 7 and 129 6 7 Sv; LADCP-measured transport, 145 6 8.8 and 137.9 6 10.5 Sv] by Renault et al. (2011) , who also discussed possible reasons for the differences in the transport estimates.\nWe also compared the horizontal water mass transports across hydrographic sections with outputs from the three OGCMs (Fig. 3 , see Table 4 for detailed information about the OGCMs) and Sloyan and Rintoul (2001b) for common zonal sections. Across zonal sections (A10, I3/I4, I5, P6), the estimated transports are mostly consistent with the OGCMs within error bars. Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (i.e., LCDW) transport across P6 is northward and the OGCMs have smaller and either northward or southward transports.

Mixed layer subduction/upwelling", "text": "The novel incorporation of the mixed layer box in the inverse model enables us to estimate the isopycnal subduction and upwelling into and from the interior ocean for each ocean basin and circumpolarly (Fig. 4) . The subduction/upwelling estimates, direct and merging, were almost the same for the Pacific, Australia regions, and circumpolar total (Figs. 4c,d ,e) but differed for the Atlantic and Indian sectors (Figs. 4a,b) . As discussed by Tziperman (1988) , the direct and merging results differ where eddies are active. The Atlantic region is bounded by two sections that cross rich eddy fields: the Agulhas retroflection south of Africa (I6S, 308E) (section 7 of Lutjeharms 2006) and the Benguela Current (A10, 308S) that transports Agulhas eddies into the South Atlantic. Indeed, Katsumata and Fukasawa (2011) in the revisit A10 section found a large eddy near 28W that affected all density ranges with a recirculation transport of more than 40 Sv. The difference in the Indian region between the two methods most likely stems from the I5 section-the WHP and Revisit sections followed slightly different paths in the eastern half of the section over the Perth and South Australian Basins (not shown). The LCDW and BW differences in layer thickness and transport are ''correlated,'' and these difference are largely accounted for in the different subduction/ upwelling transports between direct and merging.\nCircumpolar total water mass subduction/upwelling estimates (Fig. 4e) are consistent between the two methods and clearly show the two-cell structure of the Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation: Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (27.4 , g n , 28.0) upwells and diverges northward and southward to form the subducting Subantarctic Mode and Antarctic Intermediate Waters and Antarctic Bottom Water, respectively. A significant amount of the bottom water (direct, 8 6 7 Sv; merging, 12 6 5 Sv) is produced in the Atlantic sector, followed by the Indian sector (direct, 2 6 7 Sv; merging, 2 6 5 Sv upwelling) and the Pacific (direct, 0.4 6 7 Sv; merging, 1 6 5 Sv). Within the uncertainties, these estimates are consistent with the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) production rate estimated from the chlorofluorocarbon inventory (Orsi et al. 2002 , who defined AABW as the water with g n . 28.27): 4.9 Sv in the Atlantic sector and 3.2 Sv in the Indian-Pacific sector.\nThe upwelling of UCDW has been recognized as a key component of the global meridional overturning "}, {"section_title": "NOVEMBER 2013 K A T S U M A T A E T A L .", "text": "circulation (e.g., Sloyan and Rintoul 2001b; Marshall and Speer 2012) . The upwelling is large in the Atlantic sector (direct, 15 6 11 Sv; merging, 8 6 8 Sv) and in the Indian sector (direct, 4 6 11 Sv; merging, 12 6 8 Sv). In the Australian and Pacific sectors, the UCDW is either only weakly upwelling (direct, 0.3 6 10 Sv; merging, 0.4 6 8 Sv) or subducting (direct, 4 6 11 Sv; merging, 4 6 8 Sv). The difference between the upwelling Atlantic and Indian sectors and the subducting Pacific sector is attributable to the upper part (27.4 , g n , 27.7) of UCDW (Figs. 4a-d) . This density range is captured near the southern edge of the subduction/upwelling map (their Fig. 8 ) of Sall ee et al. (2010) , which shows subduction in the Pacific and upwelling in the Atlantic and Indian sectors. The upwelling is largely driven by the Ekman transport and the subduction is driven by southward eddy transports (see section 3c and Fig. 6) .\nCompared with the horizontal transports, the mixed layer transports in the Southern Ocean are much less constrained, with the result that uncertainties for subduction and upwelling are large (Fig. 4) . Although the formal uncertainties are large, the actual error might be smaller because the constraints are much better satisfied than the formal a priori covariances (the appendix, section c). We note that the uncertainty estimates shown in Fig. 4 are based on the assumption that we have only two pieces of information regarding the diapycnal transports in this system: 1) mixed layer subduction/upwelling in the density range 26.2 , g n , 27.3 based on estimates by Sall ee et al. (2010), and 2) the magnitude of the diapycnal transport is about 10 Sv (the appendix, section b). The slight (;2 Sv) reduction of uncertainty in the density range 26.2 , g n , 27.3 shows that the information 1) does not effectively constrain the subduction/upwelling. In the future, as observations accumulate and OGCMs are improved, it will be possible to prescribe each mean diapycnal transport in an inverse model such that we can solve for diapycnal transport anomalies from the expected mean with much reduced covariances R xx , which will result in much reduced uncertainties. Given our current knowledge of the Southern Ocean circulation, however, we have to accept the uncertainties shown in Fig. 4. c. Diapycnal transport in the surface mixed layer\ncontour, the surface hydrographic data at the density range g n . 27.5 are probably not reliable. The contribution from the H i y i term appears large on monthly data. Between February and August, the g n 5 27.4 contour, For example, if we assume H ; (1 2 cos vt) and y ; sin vt (v is the annual frequency with the time origin as February), hHyi 5 0. By definition, the residual of hH i y i i is incorporated into the eddy component. Figure 6 shows the surface mixed layer geostrophic, Ekman, and residual ''eddy'' components. Reflecting the difference in the direct and merging estimates of subduction/upwelling (Fig. 4) , the total and eddy transports in the Atlantic and Indian sectors (Figs. 6a,b) differ between the direct and merging estimates, but the circumpolarly integrated estimates (Fig. 6e) are similar.\nThe diapycnal transports at 26.2 , g n , 27.3 agree with Sall ee et al. (2010): northward Ekman transport peak at g n ' s u 5 26.9, and southward eddy transport compensates for the Ekman transport (Fig. 6e) . The difference in magnitude of each component between this study and previous studies can be attributed to different wind stress, hydrography, and geostrophic velocity data used in the calculation. Farther poleward at 27.3 , g n , the Ekman transport decreases and becomes almost negligible at 27.6 , g n , which agrees with the seasonal sea ice distribution (Fig. 5) . In spite of the absence of the Ekman and geostrophic components, significant meridional transport exist at 27.6 , g n , which is mostly under winter sea ice (Fig. 5) . By definition (10), this southward transport is explained as by ''eddies.'' Closer to the Antarctic coast, however, we note that the isopycnals deepen southward to support the Antarctic Slope Current (e.g., Rintoul and Bullister 1999) , where a parameterization [see (11)] gives a northward eddy transport. We therefore speculate that the H i y i (i 5 n, s) terms (i.e., water mass modification due to surface buoyancy flux and interior mixing) become important closer to the Antarctic coast (27.6 , g n ).\nFIG. 6. Surface mixed layer meridional transport across isopycnals for Ekman (red), geostrophic (green), eddy (blue) and total (black, from inverse model). Positive is toward lighter density (i.e., northward). The gray lines show the uncertainties for the sum of the components from the horizontal axis provided by the inverse model. The solid lines show the direct estimates and dashed lines the merging estimates.\nThe diapycnal transports estimated by the box inverse model are largely consistent with the results of an iceocean coupled model (Iudicone et al. 2008a ). In the surface mixed layer, which Iudicone et al. (2008a) called a ''bowl,'' the ice-ocean coupled model showed mode waters losing buoyancy for g n , 26.8, buoyancy gain for 26.8 , g n , 28.0, and buoyancy loss for 28.0 , g n . Considering the coupled model's tendency to overestimate the density of the intermediate waters, and the large uncertainties in our estimate, the agreement between the studies seems reasonable. The analysis of Iudicone et al. (2008a) showed that buoyancy gain at 26.8 , g n , 28.0 results from a surface buoyancy flux and opposite mixing by eddies. Also the density gain at 28.0 , g n is mainly explained by surface forcing and eddy fluxes. The agreement of the interior mixing between the box inverse model and the coupled model is not as good; the coupled model predicts two density-gaining flux peaks at g n ' 27.6 and g n ' 28.1 (Iudicone et al. 2008a) , whereas the box inverse model peaks are at g n ' 26.6, 27.0, and 28.1 (Fig. 8e) . We attempted to estimate a mean interior diapycnal diffusivity similar to (12), but the estimates are found very sensitive to assumed density structure of the upwelling/subduction transport, which is not known accurately from the hydrographic observations, particularly under the ice (g n . 27.6) where the large diapycnal transports are found. At this density range, the large density-gaining flux, both in the mixed layer and in the interior (Fig. 8) , emphasizes the importance of data collection efforts under sea ice (e.g., Charrassin et al. 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "1) EKMAN, GEOSTROPHIC, AND EDDY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "COMPONENTS", "text": "As shown, the inverse model (6) estimates the isopycnal subduction/upwelling transport between the mixed layer and interior ocean.

More physical insights can be gained if we decompose the meridional transport T Y into the Ekman transport T Ek and horizontal transport in geostrophic flow T G ,\nwhere we define T* as the residual.

From the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) atlas of regional seas (CARS), hereafter CARS2009, climatological data (Ridgway et al. 2002) , referenced to the absolute geostrophic pressure at 1000 dbar obtained from the Argo drift data (Katsumata and Yoshinari 2010) , and the NCEP-DOE monthly reanalysis (Kanamitsu et al. 2002) , we estimated the geostrophic transport T G and Ekman transport T Ek across isopycnal surfaces. Here, we assume that the residual in (10), T*, represents ''eddy'' transport in the mixed layer. The location of the isopycnals as well as the depth of the mixed layer necessary for the calculation of T G and T Ek was determined from the CARS2009. As the temporal resolution of our climatological data is monthly, we evaluate the time average as h\u00c1i 5 1 12\nwhere m is month. Accordingly the isopycnals used in (6) and (8) are the monthly mean isopycnals. The transport across these monthly mean isopycnals can give rise to a net diapycnal transport provided that it is followed by water mass modification owing to interior mixing or surface fluxes (Tandon and Garrett 1996) . On the other hand, the monthly mean isopycnals can move without any horizontal movement of water masses if the water masses change densities by interior mixing or surface fluxes (Walin 1982) . This latter effect is represented by the H i y i (i 5 n, s) terms in (6). Although CARS2009 provides monthly data as far south as the Antarctic continent, the Austral winter and early spring (June-September) data, particularly under seasonal ice, are extrapolated from summer data. The number of data under sea ice is very limited (Fig. 5) . As the ice edge approximately coincides with the g n 5 27.5 FIG. 5 . Data density at the surface (color), ice edge (black lines), and surface isopycnals (thick contours). The number of surface salinity data were counted in the World Ocean Database 2009 (Boyer et al. 2009 ) in a 18 by 18 grid and the number is shown by background color. Monthly ice concentration was calculated from daily data as the maximum concentration in the month. The daily sea ice concentration map was retrieved from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (EOS) (AMSR-E) (Spreen et al. 2008) . The black lines are the 90% sea ice concentration contours of the month from 2003 to 2010. The surface isopycnals were estimated from the CARS2009 temperature and salinity data (Ridgway et al. 2002) .

In an attempt to explain this difference, we calculated a mean eddy diffusivity. Following Treguier et al. (1997) and Sall ee et al. (2011), geostrophic eddies resulting from baroclinic instability can be parameterized as\nwhere the left-hand side is the cross-isopycnal eddy transport within the surface mixed layer box, k is thickness diffusivity, and dz/dy is the slope of the isopycnal in the direction perpendicular to the isopycnal, evaluated at the bottom of the mixed layer (z 5 H). By analogy, we can define a mean thickness diffusivity K as\nThe isopycnal slope was estimated from the CARS2009 climatology. The mean diffusivity increases from about 2000 to 3000 m 2 s 21 across the ACC between equivalent latitudes of 558 and 508S (Fig. 7) . This increase is similar to the latitudinal distribution of the diffusivity estimated by Sall ee et al. (2011), using Lagrangian particle dispersion. Sall ee et al. (2011) attributed this variability to the combination of changes in the eddy length scale and suppression of the length scale in the advecting mean flow (Ferrari and Nikurashin 2010) . Our results, derived from hydrographic data, are thus consistent with the latitudinal variability of the eddy diffusivity within the ACC latitudes indicated by theoretical considerations."}, {"section_title": "d. Interior diapycnal transports", "text": "In theoretical treatments of the Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation, it is often assumed that the interior diapycnal transport is negligible compared to the diapycnal transport within the surface mixed layer. The diapycnal transports estimated by the inverse model show that this is not the case for circumpolarly integrated transports (Fig. 8e) . The interior diapycnal transport is toward lighter water at 26.1 , g n , 26.5 and 27.2 , g n , 27.9 and toward denser water for 26.5 , g n , 27.2 and 27.9 , g n . Breaking internal waves can explain the positive (upward) flux and the nonlinear effects in the equation of state (Klocker and McDougall 2010) can explain the negative (downward) transport. Indeed, the Klocker and McDougall (2010) estimates of the diapycnal transport owing to the nonlinearity in the equation of state are about 5 Sv at g n ' v 5 27.4 and approximately 10 Sv at g n ' v 5 28.0. The transport to denser water masses at g n . 27.9 may be explained by entrainment of slightly less dense water to denser Antarctic Bottom Water as dense shelf water flows down the continental slope. We note that the box inverse model only provides estimates of area-integrated quantities and the weak interior transport at 27.4 , g n , 27.8 does not contradict the estimate of Klocker and McDougall (2010) because upwelling (mixing) of a similar magnitude can offset the downward diapycnal transport.\nAlthough the diapycnal transports in the surface mixed layer and ocean interior are comparable when integrated circumpolarly (Fig. 8e) , mixed layer diapycnal transport is generally larger than the interior diapycnal transport in the individual ocean basins (Figs. 8a-d) . This means that the basin diapycnal transports within the surface mixed layer tend to cancel, but the interior diapycnal transports do not. Temporal variabilities in the mixed layer across the meridional sections (I6S, I9S, SR1, SR3; see Table 1) can explain the large surface diapycnal transport estimated using (6), as these variabilities cancel out when integrated circumpolarly.

Reflecting the paucity of data, the estimated subduction/ upwelling across the base of the mixed layer and interior ocean were accompanied by uncertainties of similar magnitude to that of the transports themselves. Use of the FIG. 8 . Comparison of mixed layer diapycnal transport (thick solid, same as the black lines in Fig. 6 ) and interior ocean (i.e., below the mixed layer) diapycnal transport (thick dashed). The uncertainties from the horizontal axis are shown for the interior diapycnal transport for direct (dark gray) and merging (light gray) inverse models. Positive is toward lighter densities. merging method, in which two inverse solution sets were averaged for combining the data from the two occupations, resulted in lower uncertainties than the direct method, in which the two sets of hydrographic data were averaged before inversion.\nThe estimated meridional overturning circulation is summarized in Fig. 9 . The estimated upwelling/ subduction at the base of the mixed layer is consistent with the general picture of the Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation obtained by previous studies. The Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (27.4 , g n , 28.0) upwelling of 16 6 15 Sv estimated by the merging method (17 6 21 Sv by the direct method) reaches the surface and diverges equatorward and poleward. The equatorward branch transports 3 6 16 Sv (3 6 21 Sv) of Subantarctic Mode and Antarctic Intermediate Water (26.0 , g n , 27.4). On the continental shelves around Antarctica, the upwelling UCDW increases in density to become 5 6 13 Sv (6 6 18 Sv) of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (28.0 , g n , 28.2) and 8 6 9 Sv (8 6 13 Sv) of Antarctic Bottom Water (28.2 , g n ).\nWe have provided an indirect estimate of diapycnal transports, including the density range under sea ice in wintertime (mostly g n . 27.5). The meridional diapycnal transport in the mixed layer is largely southward and largest at g n ' 26.7 and decreases poleward; this decrease can be explained by a poleward decrease in eddy diffusivity, which is consistent with cross-isopycnal eddy diffusion estimated from particle dispersion experiments (Sall ee et al. 2011) .\nA novel aspect of the inverse model is the explicit separation of the surface mixed layer from the interior ocean. This has shown that interior diapycnal transportsbuoyancy loss or gain-are comparable in magnitude to the horizontal diapycnal transports within the surface mixed layer. Resolution of both interior ocean mixing and mixed layer dynamics is vital for accurate representation of the Southern Ocean overturning circulation.\nThe southward transport under ice and significant interior diapycnal transports have been simulated in numerical models (e.g., Iudicone et al. 2008a; Urakawa and Hasumi 2012) but have never been observed. The box inverse model shows that these simulations are consistent with the observed hydrographic data; however, results from the box inverse model are accompanied with large uncertainties. Increased high-latitude observations, particularly in austral winter, will result in a more reliable quantitative description of ocean circulation from both inverse box models and sophisticated assimilation models [e.g., four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-VAR) methods]. Accurate uncertainties estimated by these models would be of great use, too. collected as contribution to World Ocean Circulation Experiment and GO-SHIP (www.go-ship.org).

For horizontal transport across hydrographic sections, time variability dominates other uncertainties such as internal tides, ageostrophic flows, and treatment of the bottom data on slopes. Applying n , 27.3. We used their estimates to constrain the subduction/upwelling between the surface boxes and the interior boxes with an a priori uncertainty of (5 Sv) 2 . Subduction and upwelling of densities heavier than 27.3 were not constrained. The South Indian box between I3/4 (208S) and I5 (348S) does not have a surface box and outcropping layers there receive a volume flux from heat and freshwater forcing estimated by using the NCEP-DOE reanalysis (Kanamitsu et al. 2002) . The uncertainty of Thermocline Water conservation is also applied to the volume budget of the surface boxes. The volume budget variances calculated using these a priori covariances are of the same order as the temporal variances of the volume budget calculated by the K7 model. In fact, the inverse transport estimates are not very sensitive to the choice of the a priori covariances. We tested the sensitivity of the box inverse model by using the temporal variances from the K7 model as a priori covariances. The difference in transport from the standard case (Table 3 ) was no greater than 3 Sv and was mostly less than 1 Sv.\nSeveral deep closed basins, forming cul-de-sacs, are found in the subtropical zonal sections: in the Tasman Sea in the South Pacific Ocean (P6); in the Mozambique, Mascarene, Crozet, and Central Indian Basins and Natal Valley in the Indian Ocean (I3, I5) ; and in the Namibia Abyssal Plain in the Atlantic (A10). Deep ocean transport into these basins was constrained to be 0 6 2 Sv.
