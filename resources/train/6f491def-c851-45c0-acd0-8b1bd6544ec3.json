[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Although abnormally folded tau protein has been found to selfpropagate from neuron to connected neuron, similar propagation through human brain networks has not been fully documented. We studied tau propagation in the left hemispheric syntactic network, which comprises an anterior frontal node and a posterior temporal node connected by the white matter of the left arcuate fasciculus. This network is affected in the nonfluent variant of primary progressive aphasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with tau accumulation. Methods: Eight patients with the nonfluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (age, 67.0 \u00b1 7.4 y; 4 women) and 8 healthy controls (age, 69.6 \u00b1 7.0 y; 4 women) were scanned with 18 F-AV-1451 tau PET to determine tau deposition in the brain and with MRI to determine the fractional anisotropy of the arcuate fasciculus. Normal syntactic network characteristics were confirmed with structural MRI diffusion imaging in our healthy controls and with blood oxygenation level-dependent functional imaging in 35 healthy participants from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Results: Language scores in patients indicated dysfunction of the anterior node. 18 F-AV-1451 deposition was greatest in the 2 nodes of the syntactic network. The left arcuate fasciculus had decreased fractional anisotropy, particularly near the anterior node. Normal MRI structural connectivity from an area similar to the one containing tau in the anterior frontal node projected to an area similar to the one containing tau in the patients in the posterior temporal node. Conclusion: Tau accumulation likely started in the more affected anterior node and, at the disease stage at which we studied these patients, appeared as well in the brain region (in the temporal lobe) spatially separate from but most connected with it. The arcuate fasciculus, connecting both of them, was most severely affected anteriorly, as would correspond to a loss of axons from the anterior node. These findings are suggestive of tau propagation from node to connected node in a natural human brain network and support the idea that neurons that wire together die together.

Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain the network pattern of spreading. Neurotrophic factors normally secreted by neurons in one node may fail, inducing neuron loss in the connected node (2) . Alternatively, dying neurons in the epicenter node may release substances that damage the neurons in the downstream node. Among these substances, prime candidates are the misfolded proteins typically found in these neurodegenerative disorders (3) . Misfolded tau, characteristic of AD and several variants of FTD, acquires a b-sheet-rich structure that polymerizes into amyloid fibrils. These fibrils may behave as prions (3, 4) . Like other prions, tau prions would multiply by self-propagation, in which the b-sheet is a template for nascent prion formation (3, 4) . Tau prions would build up in impaired epicenter node neurons and propagate from sick neuron to healthy neuron connected through natural brain networks, thereby spreading damage across the brain. Evidence supporting this postulate comes from tissue culture experiments (5, 6) ; from mouse models of tau spreading (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) ; and, with the shortcoming of partial brain sampling (12) , from the pattern of tau deposition in postmortem brain (13, 14) . PET tracers for aggregated tau are now available to quantify in vivo tau in humans (15) . Using these tracers, tau has been found to be associated with network brain characteristics in AD (16) (17) (18) . However, the complexity of the default network affected in AD (19) , and the confounding overlap in AD of tau with another misfolded protein, amyloid-b, which also alters functional connectivity (19, 20) , have hindered the conclusive demonstration of network tau propagation in humans.\nWe addressed this issue by studying tau spreading in a simpler model, the syntactic language network ( Fig. 1) (21) . This network is affected in the nonfluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), an unusual variant of FTD associated with tau pathology in more than 80% of cases (22) . We hypothesized that abnormal tau would preferentially localize in the 2 nodes of the network, an anterior node (Broca area) devoted to language production and a posterior node in the middle temporal gyrus devoted to syntactic processing during comprehension ( Fig. 1 ; Supplemental Fig. 1 [supplemental materials are available at http://jnm.snmjournals.org]). These nodes are widely separated in the cortex but are connected by the arcuate fasciculus white matter pathway (21) . As the disease progresses, neurons containing tau die but tau remains in the tissue (23) . Thus, if the tau prion propagation hypothesis is true, tau would accumulate in the anterior node, which is affected first, and in the posterior node, infected by tau prions from neurons in the anterior node (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Additionally, neuronal death would cause axonal loss in the arcuate fasciculus (Supplemental Fig. 1 ), which would be abnormal, with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), a marker of axonal integrity, in the affected left hemisphere."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Participants were recruited from 2015 to 2017 at the Houston Methodist Nantz National Alzheimer Center and consisted of 8 patients meeting the diagnostic criteria (24) for nfvPPA and 8 healthy controls matched to the patient group by age and sex (Table 1 ). Patients were diagnosed by board-certified neurologists and underwent a thorough clinical history and a neurologic, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric evaluation, together with a detailed speech and language evaluation (25) . To facilitate network specificity and avoid the amyloid-b confounder, we excluded patients with AD-related language deficits by means of the clinical phenotype and a negative amyloid-b PET scan with either 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B or 18 F-florbetapir (24, 26) . Healthy volunteers had clinical and neuropsychologic screening, normal MRI results, and absence of neurologic, psychiatric, or other major medical illnesses. Procedures were approved by the Methodist Hospital Research Institute Committee on Human Research, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nTo determine the normal functional connectivity of the syntactic network (Fig. 1C) (27) . The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biologic markers, and clinical and neuropsychologic assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and early AD. MRI data from ADNI were preprocessed using a standard method (28) . With MATLAB software (version 2018a; MathWorks), a 4-mm-radius spheric seed was drawn in the left inferior frontal gyrus, centered on the voxel (coordinates: x, 239; y, 30; z, 29) where peak values for syntactic-task activation and syntactic disruption by lesions has been described in the literature (Fig. 1C ) (21) . The average blood oxygenation level-dependent time-series signal within the seed was extracted for each subject. Functional connectivity with the rest of the brain was calculated as previously described (28) . (25) , which rates the presence and severity of impairment across 10 domains ( Fig. 2A ; Supplemental Table 1 ). Impairment in each domain was assessed by integrating information from patient test performance in the office and a structured questionnaire that was completed by the primary caregiver. (21) .)

The 4 frames were motion-corrected, averaged, and smoothed via a gaussian filter of 6 mm in full width at half maximum (version 3.906; PMOD Technologies LLC). Then, each subject's PET image was coregistered to the corresponding T1-weighted structural MR images with SPM12 software. After segmentation of the T1-weighted MR images with FreeSurfer software (version 6.0.0; Athinoula A.

The protocol included a 3-dimensional T1-weighted turbo field echo sequence for PET anatomic coregistration and DTI echo planar imaging (EPI) processing. Because enrollment had been through different institutional review board-approved protocols, the parameters of the 3-dimensional T1-weighted structural MRI for the patients differed slightly from the parameters for the controls (patients: 1 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 1.2 mm voxels, 7.4-ms repetition time, 3.4-ms echo time, 8\u00b0flip angle; controls: 1 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 1 mm voxels, 8.2-ms repetition time, 3.7-ms echo time, 8\u00b0flip angle).

Only 4 controls underwent both tau PET and DTI. Another 3 controls matched in sex and age to the patients and studied with the same DTI EPI sequence were used to complete the analyses."}, {"section_title": "DTI Processing", "text": "With some minor modifications, we used the method described by Takaya et al. (33) to isolate the arcuate fasciculus in each subject and compare FA across groups. To perform tractography of the arcuate fasciculus, the seed region in the Broca area (anterior node of the syntactic network) was defined by the white-gray matter boundary of the pars opercularis and the pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Fig. 3A) (33) . For a separate analysis, we used a seed region, largely coincident with the previous one, that colocalized with the area of significantly increased tau in the patients (Fig. 2C; Supplemental  Fig. 2 ). The target region was defined liberally as the white-gray matter boundary of the entire temporal lobe, including the banks of the superior temporal sulcus (Fig. 3A) . For the right hemisphere, we selected the homologous seed and target regions.\nTo increase sensitivity and specificity, the gray matter associated with the seed regions was used as an exclusion mask to exclude tracks that propagated exclusively toward the gray matter. Similarly, the gray matter of the target regions was used as a stop mask to avoid tracks that terminate in the target through the gray matter as well as tracts merging within the gray matter and being extended by the tracking algorithm. To further isolate the arcuate fasciculus, we used as exclusion masks 2 subcortical structures that border the arcuate fasciculus, namely the thalamus and striatum, and a midline mask to exclude interhemispheric tracks (Fig. 3A) . As a final step, to restrict tractography to the known anatomic distribution of the arcuate fasciculus (33) , in Montreal Neurological Institute space in each hemisphere we defined an inclusion mask through which all fibers had to pass, the coordinates of which are given below: n \u00f0x; 28; z\u00de x 2 \u00f0248; 228\u00de [ \u00f028;48\u00de; z 2 \u00f016;36\u00de\no As all DTI analysis was performed in each subject's native DTI space, masks defined in Montreal Neurological Institute space were transformed to the anatomic space of each individual subject using the SPM12 coregistration algorithm. The structural MRI was then coregistered (again via SPM12) to the first frame of each subject's diffusion series, which was acquired without any diffusion weighting (B 0 ), and all masks were transformed from the anatomic space to diffusion space using the resulting transformation matrix. The rest of the procedure followed the method described by Takaya et al. (33) . To further restrict our FA analysis to voxels most likely containing arcuate fasciculus fibers, we included only voxels that contained at least 3.08 \u00b7 10 25 percent of the total streamlines sent out from the ROI masks used to trace that tract (34) . The average value of FA (also produced via the software library of the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain) was then extracted for each subject using the entire arcuate fasciculus mask. In addition, to determine differences in FA between the anterior and posterior arcuate fasciculus, we divided the arcuate fasciculus into 2 segments in Montreal Neurological Institute space. The anterior segment was defined by all coronal slices anterior to slice y 5 224 (y . 224), and the posterior segment was defined by slice y 5 224 and all coronal slices posterior to it (y # 224). Both regions were transformed first into each subject's anatomic space and then, using the resulting transformation matrix, into each subject's diffusion space. Then, the average value for FA along the anterior and posterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus was computed.\nTo generate the projections of the arcuate fasciculus in the temporal lobe of healthy controls, each subject's probabilistic tractography results were intersected with the target mask of the temporal lobe white-gray boundary, thresholded to consider only the top 10% of endpoints and binarized. The resulting images were coregistered via each subject's B 0 image to the anatomic MRI and then normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute space with SPM12. A group average over all controls was then computed and projected onto the FreeSurfer average white matter surface for display."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Tau PET Analysis. 18 F-AV-1451 tau PET data were obtained in SUV ratio units for each brain voxel.

For screening and display, we used a cluster threshold of P , 0.001 uncorrected and a 150-voxel extent threshold.

By contrast, single-word comprehension, reading, and auditory comprehension were normal or only mildly impaired ( Fig. 2A ).\nBrain Tau Load in nfvPPA 18 F-AV-1451 PET showed increased tau in nfvPPA compared with controls (Fig. 2B) , and 3 clusters survived multiple-comparison correction: 2 contiguous clusters were in the anterior node and the other one was centered on the posterior node of the syntactic network (Fig. 2C) .

Additionally, there was a trend toward increased tau levels in the anterior node to correlate with lower FA in the anterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus; a similar correlation was not found for the posterior node and the posterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus (Supplemental Fig. 3 )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our finding of an abnormal tau load in the anterior and posterior nodes of the syntactic network suggests that network arrangement determines tau deposition in nfvPPA. The location of the posterior node, known from blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI activation studies (Fig. 1A) (21) , coincided with the temporal lobe area where the arcuate fasciculus projects most heavily (Fig. 1D ) (33) and with the area most structurally connected to the frontal lobe area-the anterior node-where our nonfluent PPA patients had increased tau (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). Because the disease begins with impairment of functions such as verbal fluency ( Fig. 2A) , mediated by the anterior node, it is logical to postulate that the anterior node is the epicenter of damage (37, 38) and that tau buildup starts there. Clinically detectable impairment, as we found in our patients, begins when anterior node neurons become dysfunctional or die. By contrast, although there was tau buildup in the posterior node, functions mediated by this node were less impaired ( Fig. 2A ), suggesting that tau-containing neurons in the posterior node were still functional and therefore likely to have been affected later than those in the anterior node. As predicted by the tau-as-prion hypothesis, the arcuate fasciculus, connecting both nodes, was affected on the left hemisphere and more so anteriorly, where there was a trend for FA to correlate with the amount of tau in the anterior node ( Fig.  3; Supplemental Fig. 3 ). These findings suggests that the axons of anterior node neurons were the most heavily affected (Supplemental Figs. 1 and 3) .\nExplanations other than tau propagation might be posited for our findings. Neuronal loss and dysfunction in the anterior node may decrease postsynaptic neuroprotection, provided by trophic factors and other constituents required by posterior node neurons to function normally. Abnormal function may then induce the production of tau in posterior node neurons. However, this is unlikely, because aggregated tau, which is the type that 18 F-AV-1451 binds (39) , has not been reported after cortical infarction causing extensive necrosis, even when the brain was examined years after a stroke (40, 41) . A more nuanced form of the same explanation may postulate that a loss of neuroprotection, combined with a milieu prone to tau production by neurons caused by genetic and other factors, may yield the findings we obtained. Still, tau propagation explains our findings most parsimoniously.\nAlthough in our nfvPPA sample we did not find significant tau deposition in other regions of the brain connected with the anterior node of the syntactic network, such as the supplementary motor area or anterior cingulate area, which is connected to the anterior node through the aslant tract (37) , these other regions could show abnormal deposition with lower thresholds or in other samples. In nfvPPA, another group has found increased tau deposition in the supplementary motor area, but the sample showed heterogeneous findings (42) , which suggests that this unusual and still poorly understood syndrome may have various underlying neuroanatomic substrates loading differently in different patient samples.\nThe uptake of 18 F-AV-1451 is known to be considerably lower in FTD than in AD (39) . However, 18 F-AV-1451 is an adequate tracer to study tau deposition in nfvPPA, a FTD variant most often associated with the 4-repeat tau isoform (22) . 18 F-AV-1451 uptake correlated well with quantitatively measured 4-repeat tau burden, as determined post-mortem in the brain of a patient presenting with nfvPPA (43) . Furthermore, unlike other tau PET tracers, 18 F-AV-1451 is not appreciably blocked by monoamine oxidase B inhibitors (44) , ruling out the possibility that the increased 18 F-AV-1451 signal may simply correspond to an increase in monoamine oxidase B induced by the pathologic process (45) . In FTD, small but detectable and accurate 18 F-AV-1451 binding has been found in most studies (39, 43) , and its regional distribution corresponds well to the clinical syndromes (46) . The lower 18 F-AV-1451 signal in FTD than in AD could be related to lower 18 F-AV-1451 binding to FTD tau but also reflects the lower tau load in FTD, which is about 10% of that in AD (47) .\nOur cross-sectional imaging study provided only a snapshot of the neurodegenerative process. It would have been ideal to image first the first stage of the disease, likely with tau only in the anterior node (Supplemental Fig. 1A) , and then, sometime later, the stage documented in this paper. However desirable that may be, it may not be realistically possible: our patients were imaged shortly after presentation, when the functions of the anterior node faltered ( Fig.  2A) , causing them to seek medical attention. At the other temporal end of the process, imaging these patients again later could yield additional useful information by documenting increasing tau in the posterior node. However, as the disease progresses, local spreading through shorter pathways may actually obscure the network effect (48) detected at this stage in the evolution of nfvPPA."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Our data, obtained in vivo from the entire human brain, support a mechanistic model in which abnormal tau buildup starts focally and spreads via a neuron-to-connected-neuron pattern in natural brain networks.
