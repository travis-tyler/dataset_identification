While loss of independence in everyday functional abilities is a core feature of AD dementia, there is increasing recognition that mild functional changes occur early in the disease, including within Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) [1] [2] [3] . New evidence suggests subtle functional changes may be detected in individuals who are still considered cognitively normal [4] . Early detection of functional decline has prognostic value in predicting future disease progression [5] .\nPast research on functional changes in preclinical AD has been hindered by a lack of instruments sensitive to early and subtle functional problems. The Everyday Cognition (ECog) is a newer instrument designed to assess functional abilities linked to specific cognitive abilities and it has been shown to be sensitive to early disease [2, 6] . While the utility of selfreport on the ECog has not yet been specifically evaluated, previous studies have suggested that early self-reported changes in everyday functioning may be associated with development of MCI or dementia [7, 8] .\nApproaches to assessing the validity of self-report include comparing self-and informant-reports, and evaluating associations between self-report and objective measures of disease. In general, the degree to which individuals with early disease, such as MCI, can accurately report cognitive and functional problems remains unclear. Some studies report a lack of difference between self-and informant-ratings in MCI [3, 9, 10] , suggesting that individuals may retain the ability to accurately report functional status. Other studies, however, have questioned the usefulness of self-reported functional change in MCI due to its discrepancy with informant-ratings [11, 12] . In dementia, self-reported functional status is often inaccurate due to loss of awareness/insight [10, 13] .\nSelf-and informant-ratings of everyday functioning in MCI and prodromal AD have been compared with objective cognitive tests. The correspondence between self-reported everyday function and cognition is inconsistent; some studies show no relationship [14, 15] while others have found that subjective everyday cognitive complaints among elderly individuals are associated with cognitive performances [16, 17] . More consistent associations have been reported between informant-ratings of reduced everyday function and cognition [1, 5, [18] [19] [20] . When selfand informant-ratings were concurrently compared with neuropsychological performance, the latter ratings have been more strongly associated with objective cognitive testing [10, 21] .\nRatings of everyday functioning have also been compared with other biomarkers of disease. For instance, informant-reports of functional decline have been associated with structural abnormalities on imaging, including decreased cortical gray matter [22] and smaller hippocampal volume [1] , and neuropathological abnormalities in MCI, such as elevated concentrations of total tau (t-tau) [23] , reduced Ab 1-42 in CSF [23] , and increased amyloid deposition on Pittsburgh compound B positron tomography (PiB-PET) [24] . Considerably less work has examined selfreported functional decline and associated disease biomarkers. There is some evidence that elderly individuals with subjective cognitive complaints and normal cognitive test performances exhibit reduced medial temporal and frontotemporal gray matter volumes similar to individuals with MCI [14] and increased amyloid-b deposition on PiB-PET imaging [7, 25] . Such findings suggest selfappraisals may be sensitive to underlying early neuropathologic changes when objective cognitive impairments are be less apparent.\nIn sum, informant-reported everyday function has been previously associated with a number of disease related outcomes in MCI and dementia. The validity of selfreported functional decline across the full disease spectrum, particularly among older adults with normal cognition or MCI, is less clear. The present study used a variety of approaches to examine the relative validity of self-and informant-reported functional status among individuals defined as Normals, early MCI (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI), or AD. Specifically, we investigated [1] the degree of agreement between informant-and self-reported everyday functioning at different disease stages [2] , the utility of informant-and self-reported functional status in discriminating between diagnostic groups, and [3] the relationships between informant-and self-reported functional ability and multiple objective markers of disease. Generally, we hypothesized that while informantreported functional status would be superior to selfreport in all of these regards, self-report would have some demonstrable validity particularly in early disease."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a consortium of university and medical centers in the United States and Canada aimed to study changes in cognition, function, brain structure, and biomarkers in cognitively normal and subjects with MCI and AD [26] . The present study included 1080 subjects with self-rated and/or an informant-rated ECog (see Table 1 ).\nSubjects were diagnosed based on the following criteria: MCI was diagnosed based on subjective memory complaints, objective memory impairment measured by education-adjusted scores falling at least 1.5 standard deviations below the normative mean on delayed recall of the Logical Memory test (Story A), essentially independent for activities of daily living, global score of 0.5 on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 24. These subjects were subsequently characterized as LMCI and differentiated from a new group of EMCI subjects recruited during the second phase of ADNI (ADNI-GO/ADNI-2). EMCI was characterized by milder episodic memory impairments with scores on delayed recall of the Logical Memory test falling between 1.0 and 1.5 standard deviations below an educationadjusted normative mean [27] . By design, the ADNI MCI cohort is memory impaired compared with Normals, but with better memory performance than those with AD, and are more similar to Normals in nonmemory domains than they are to those with AD [26] . These MCI groups represent the transitional stage between normal aging and clinical criteria for probable AD [26] . Subjects with AD had MMSE scores between 20 and 26 (inclusive), CDR global scores of 0.5 to 1.0, and met criteria for probable AD according to the National Institute of the Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke-Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) [28] ."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of everyday function", "text": "The Everyday Cognition (ECog) questionnaire measures cognitively-relevant functional abilities across six domains: Everyday Memory, Language, Visuospatial abilities, Planning, Organization, and Divided Attention. The present study used a global score reflecting a composite of all six domains [7] .

Higher scores indicate greater functional impairment. To allow for missing data, an average was calculated by summing scores of completed items and dividing by the number of completed items.\nThe ECog was designed to capture relatively mild functional changes that likely predate loss of independence in major activities of daily living (ADLs). The ECog has been shown to be sensitive to early functional changes seen in MCI and dementia [2, 4, 6] . The ECog has been shown to have excellent internal reliability (Cronbach's a 5 0.97) and good test re-test reliability (r 5 .82, P , .001) [6] . Various aspects of validity have been demonstrated via its correlation with other well-known measures of daily function [6] , and cognitive and neuroimaging indicators of disease [6, 29] .

Memory was assessed using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) [34] . The RAVLT is a 15-word list-learning task, administered for five consecutive trials, followed by presentation of an interference list, and recall of the original list. A 20-minute delayed recall trial is also administered. The RAVLT memory variables used in the current analyses included total recall from the five learning trials and from the 20-minute delay.

Post hoc pairwise comparisons for specific group differences were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. To address the first goal of this study, the signed rank test was used to compare self-reported to informant-ratings of the ECog across all subjects and within diagnostic groups. Furthermore, to compare the ECog across diagnostic groups within a rating type, the ECog was first transformed using the natural log. Due to the restricted range (1-4 on the raw scale and 0-ln(4) on the transformed scale) and high frequency of values near the lower bound, a tobit regression model with a lower bound of zero was used adjusting for age, gender, and APOE \u03b54 status. Contrasts were constructed to compare the different diagnostic groups and P-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and the nonparametric estimate of the area under the ROC (AUC) based on the trapezoidal rule were used to evaluate the accuracy of predicting diagnostic groups using the ECog informant and self reports (the second goal of the study). Particular comparisons of interest were structured in a hierarchical manner, comparing groups with more impairment to groups with no or less impairment. Specifically, Normals were compared with each of the other diagnostic groups (EMCI, LMCI, AD), EMCI were compared with each of the more impaired groups (LMCI, AD), and LMCI was compared with AD. In addition, any impairment (EMCI, LMCI, or AD) was compared with Normals. For each analysis, the specificity corresponding to a sensitivity of 80% is reported as the optimal cut-off score for that same sensitivity. To address the final goal of the study, partial Spearman rho correlations were computed, partialing out age, gender and APOE \u03b54 status, to analyze the relationships between the ECog ratings (self-and informantratings) and neuropsychological measures, structural neuroimaging measures, and CSF variables across the entire group (all diagnoses combined) and within diagnostic groups. Due to the large number of correlations, False Discovery Rate, a method that controls the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses [42] , was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.

The AD group rated themselves as less functionally impaired (lower scores) than did their informants (corrected P , .001; Cohen's d 5 1.4).

Greater functional impairment was reported with increased disease severity. This pattern may suggest some preserved recognition of functional difficulties. The same pattern held true for informant ratings. When examining informant-rated ECog, all group comparisons were significantly different (corrected P ,.0001). Normals had better everyday function than all other groups, EMCI had less functional impairment than LMCI and AD, and LMCI had less functional impairment than AD.

Utility of informant-and self-report to discriminate diagnostic groups Table 3 summarizes the ROC curve analysis with specificity (at 80% of sensitivity) for each diagnostic comparison. Informant-report consistently provided better group discrimination than self-report. Self-report was not much better than chance in distinguishing AD from EMCI (AUC 5 .53) or LMCI (AUC 5 .52). Informant-or selfreport methods were also not very good at discriminating between the LMCI and EMCI groups, although informant-report was slightly better than self-report (informant-report: AUC 5 .62; self-report: AUC 5 .51).

Unique to the current ADNI cohort, the heterogeneous category of MCI has been further subdivided into early and late MCI based on degree of memory impairment. This allowed us to assess everyday function at varying stages of MCI/memory impairment.\nFirst, we assessed the validity of self-report by comparing it to reports of other raters familiar with the participant. Dementia participants rated themselves as less functionally impaired when compared to their informants' ratings, which is consistent with previous literature [10] . Taken together with stronger correlations between informant ratings and objective measures of disease, these results likely reflect decreased insight in individuals with dementia [10] . A more complex pattern emerged when we examined rater differences across the MCI groups. There was also a tendency for individuals within the LMCI group to report less functional impairment than informants. Alternatively, the EMCI and cognitively normal participants rated themselves as having slightly more problems with everyday function compared with their informants. Interestingly, the EMCI group showed a similar pattern of reporting to Normals and different from LMCI and dementia, possibly suggesting that individuals in the early part of MCI may be more reliable in assessing their functional capacities. As disease progresses into later stages of MCI, individual's report of functional abilities may become more tenuous. Previous studies comparing self-and informant-reported functional capacities among individuals with MCI have been mixed [3, 9, 10, 31] , and the present results may help explain some of this variability in that reporting may depend on the degree of memory impairment in MCI. However, when we formally compared the ability of informant and self-reported functional ability to discriminate between clinical/diagnostic groups, informant-ratings are clearly superior. Overall, such findings highlight the importance of informant report in clinical and research settings. In particular, informant report is highly effective in differentiating normal older adults from those with dementia. Informant ratings also fairly strongly discriminated between traditional MCI (LMCI) and normal elderly-an important objective. Importantly, informant ECog ratings compare favorably with the other cognitive and biomarkers examined in terms of discriminating diagnostic groups. However, informantreport of functional status is limited in making more fine group discriminations, such as distinguishing Normals from EMCI, and EMCI versus LMCI. Self-and-informant reports of everyday functions were also examined with respect to various objective markers of disease. In terms of cognitive functioning, our finding that informant-ratings of everyday function had consistently stronger relationships with memory and executive functions (e.g. cognitive flexibility, switching) than self-reports is consistent with previous studies [18] [19] [20] . Self-ratings of everyday function had weaker and mostly, non-significant associations with neuropsychological test scores within diagnostic groups.\nIn contrast to what we expected, self-reported functional status was not more related to neuropsychological performance in Normals or EMCI as compared with the LMCI and AD dementia groups. It is worth noting that among Normals, the magnitude of associations between the ECog and neuropsychological function (e.g. delayed recall), albeit weak, was similar between raters, perhaps suggesting that self-report of subtle functional changes in this subgroup may be associated with cognitive performance. Emerging research examining the relationships between subjective cognitive and functional complaints and objective cognitive measures among normal elderly individuals has also yielded mixed results or similarly weak relationships [43, 44] . However, longitudinal studies suggest early cognitive complaints may help to predict subsequent decline in cognition or otherwise help identify a high risk group [45] .\nWith regard to structural neuroimaging, worse informantrated functional ability was associated with both global brain atrophy via larger ventricular volume and greater hippocampal atrophy, with the latter relationship being somewhat stronger. Results are consistent with other studies, indicating correlations between functional impairments and widespread brain atrophy [20, 22, 46] and regional atrophy in the hippocampus [1, 9] . Hippocampal atrophy is an early sign of AD [47] , suggesting a link between early brain changes and early functional consequences. Examination of the diagnostic groups suggested that informant reported everyday function is most strongly associated with atrophy among those with MCI. The lack of relationship between self-reported everyday function and structural neuroimaging is consistent with the previously mixed findings with regard to associations between everyday cognitive complaints and structural brain imaging [14, 17] . Taken together, weak and inconsistent associations with self-report seem to be the case. There is considerable interest in determining whether novel biomarkers of AD-related pathology relate to everyday cognitive/functional reports, particularly among those still cognitively normal [44] . In the present study, we examined beta amyloid measured from CSF and [\n18 F] AV45 PET imaging. Lower CSF Ab 1-42 concentrations and higher [ 18 F]AV45 retention, reflecting higher amyloid accumulation in the brain, were associated with worse everyday functioning within the entire sample using informant and self-report, although informant-report consistently demonstrated a more robust association. Within diagnostic groups, analyses did not reveal significant associations between CSF Ab 1-42 and everyday functioning for either rater. Informant-rated, but not self-reported, everyday functioning was significantly related to [ 18 F]AV45 retention among the EMCI and LMCI groups. Previous research using PiB retention also showed similar findings [24] .\nWhen the association between everyday function and ptau was examined, self-reported ECog scores were not associated with p-tau in the entire sample or within diagnostic groups. Informant-report of worse functional status was related to higher levels of p-tau in the whole sample, and particularly within the LMCI group. A previous study also found significant associations of p-tau, t-tau, and Ab 42, with informant-rated functional decline in MCI but not in AD [23] . Those authors speculated that once CSF biomarkers become abnormal, they tend to remain stable for several years, which may reduce variability in CSF biomarkers.\nTo our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study to date examining self-versus informant-report in comparison to multiple objective cognitive and biological markers of disease in a moderately large sample of wellcharacterized individuals, representing a wide spectrum of disease. However, there are a number of limitations to this study. The ADNI cohort is predominantly Caucasian (88%), more highly educated than the general U.S. older adult population, and is comprised of self-selected participants who have a higher genetic risk for the development of AD (e.g. higher prevalence of APOE \u03b54) than the general population [26] . As such, results may not generalize to other population-based samples. Given that the MCI sample was selected based upon their memory impairment, our findings may not generalize to other MCI subtypes. Additionally, we used ECog total scores, which may have masked subtle differences across domains of daily functioning. Informant and self-reports of everyday function are both subject to a number of biases as compared with performance-based measures. As already noted, limitations in awareness of deficits that occur in dementia and even MCI reduce validity of results. Factors, such as elevated caregiver burden and depression among caregivers, have also been shown to affect informant reports of patient functioning [48, 49] . Performance-based measures are subject to their own limitations and are often impractical to use, but there is some evidence that they may be more sensitive to discriminating diagnostic groups that subjective ratings [50] .\nIn summary, the primary finding of this study is that informant-reported everyday function is consistently more strongly related to multiple indicators of disease-including brain atrophy, neuropathologic abnormalities, and neuropsychological test performance-than self-report. Such findings highlight the importance of obtaining collateral report, and suggest that when discrepancies across raters occur, strong weight should be placed on the ratings made by knowledgeable informants. It is important to note that group-level findings often present challenges when attempting to apply them to individual cases where insight and reliability of self-report can sometimes be preserved, even in individuals with clear cognitive impairment. In clinical settings where maintenance of autonomy is a high priority, one approach that could be employed when discrepancies are observed between selfand informant/caregiver-report is to then administer more objective, performance-based measures of functional abilities. It is important to keep in mind that the present study does not address the degree to which self-report, particularly in those still cognitively normal or only minimally impaired (e.g. EMCI), is associated with increased risk for subsequent cognitive or functional decline/disease progress, which is an important avenue of further study."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH IN CONTEXT", "text": "1. Systematic Review: The accumulated knowledge in this area was evaluated via literature review on topics of daily functioning, biological markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and neuropsychological performance across the disease spectrum.\n2. Interpretation: Our findings contribute to the knowledge-base regarding the validity of self-and informant-rated daily functioning across the disease spectrum. Specifically, self-reported daily functioning may be valid early in the disease process. However, consistent with other studies, informantrated daily functioning was more strongly related to cognitive and biological measures of disease across the spectrum.\n3. Future Directions: To confirm these findings, future research should examine how these results generalize to a population-based sample, as Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants are more highly educated and carry a higher genetic risk for AD. Toward expanding our findings, future research should examine relationships between individual cognitive domains of daily functioning and disease pathology. Lastly, a longitudinal study would reveal how daily functioning predicts disease progression."}]
