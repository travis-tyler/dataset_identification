[{"section_title": "", "text": "knowledge generated by health research could have limited application. Therefore, it is imperative to understand factors related to diverse populations' research participation, willingness to participate, and opportunities to participate as a first step to developing strategies to facilitate their participation in health research. Prior research has shown that rural residents participate in research at lower rates than their urban counterparts. 5 Key issues that may detrimentally affect rural residents' participation in research include cultural sensitivity, geographic challenges (e.g., distance and isolation), misperceptions of research, and lack of opportunities to participate in research. [6][7][8] Furthermore, prior research suggests that participation in health research is disproportionate across races and ethnicities. While racial/ethnic minorities constitute a third of the US population, most published studies show that they remain largely underrepresented in health research. 9 For African Americans and Pacific Islanders, one consistent issue hampering research participation has been distrust and perceived discrimination, owing to a history of research abuse. [9][10][11] Hispanic community members have also cited discrimination, stigma, fear of immigration authorities, and cultural norms as factors undermining research participation. 12 A lack of cultural awareness from researchers and language barriers can also limit research opportunities by creating communication gaps between researchers and potential research participants. 13,14 While rural and minority populations are often cited as being underrepresented in research, population-based studies on health research participation have not been conducted. Furthermore, we do not fully understand the factors associated with their willingness or unwillingness to participate in research. Prior studies on research participation have focused on one study or one population and have been conducted without inclusion of a representative sample of minorities and rural populations. 15 This makes the extrapolation of findings to the general population particularly challenging. The current study investigated associations between key factors (rural/urban, race/ethnicity, age, education, poverty level, employment status, marital status, access to health care, and health status) and i) health research participation, ii) opportunities to participate in health research, and iii) willingness to participate in health research from a representative sample of adults in Arkansas. Furthermore, the study investigated the independent effects of predictors (sociodemographic characteristics, access to health care, and presence of chronic conditions) on: i) health research participation, ii) opportunities to participate in health research, and iii) willingness to participate in health research. This will be the first study of its kind to examine factors related to participation, opportunity, and willingness to participate in health research from a large representative sample in a rural and diverse state."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "This study used the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) conducted in Arkansas as its data source.

Rurality of respondents was captured by their residence status measured as a binary variable based on respondents' zip code and categories from the Rural Urban Continuum Codes. 17 Respondents answered (\"Yes\"/\"No\") regarding whether they had ever been told they had one or more of the following chronic health conditions: i) high blood pressure; ii) heart attack or myocardial infarction; iii) angina or coronary heart disease; iv) asthma; v) skin cancer; vi) other cancer; vii) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, or chronic bronchitis; viii) arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia; ix) depressive disorder, including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression; x) kidney disease; or xi) diabetes. A binary variable was  16 created to capture if respondents had a chronic disease or not. Perceived general health status was self-rated by respondents who reported whether their general health was excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. The last two items were combined due to small numbers of responses in each category. Four questions were used to define access to care 18 : i) \"Do you have any kind of healthcare coverage, including health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, government plans such as Medicare, or Indian Health Service?\"; ii) \"Do you have one person you think of as your personal doctor or healthcare provider?\"; iii) \"Was there a time in the past 12 months when you needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost?\";  and iv) \"About how long has it been since you last visited a doctor for a routine checkup?\" Statistical analysis SAS v. 9.4 19 (Cary, NC) was used to conduct statistical analyses. To describe the study population, weighted proportions for each dependent and independent variable were computed using PROC SURVEYFREQ to account for the complex sample design of the BRFSS. For unadjusted associations, each of the sociodemographic, rurality/urbanity, access to health care, perceived general health, and chronic conditions variables were cross-tabulated with each of the three dependent variables. To account for the complex sampling design of the survey, the Rao-Scott Chi-Square test 20 (\u03c7 2 R-S )-a modified version of the chi-square test-was used. Multivariable regression models were fitted to confirm associations between the predictors (i.e., sociodemographic characteristics, rurality/urbanity, access to care, perceived general health, general health status, and chronic conditions) and the three outcomes of interest. PROC SURVEYLOGIS-TIC was used to accommodate the complex survey design in these analyses and estimate adjusted associations. \"Ever participated in health research\" and \"Opportunity to participate in health research\" are dichotomous outcomes, thus a multivariable logistic regression was used.

This is the first study to examine factors related to research participation, opportunity, and willingness in a large representative sample in a relatively rural and diverse state. Therefore, it makes a significant contribution to the current literature on research participation. While only 8.5% of rural respondents had participated in health research, there was not a significant difference in participation rates, willingness to participate, or opportunity to participate for rural/urban. This is not consistent with prior literature that shows rural populations have lower opportunity and participation rates. 5,[22][23][24][25][26] This unexpected finding could be influenced by the extensive community-based participatory research capacity that the states only academic medical center (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences) had invested in to better engage rural and minority participants. One of the most encouraging findings is that among all respondents, 45.5% would be willing to participate if provided the opportunity and another 22.1% were undecided. Only 32.4% stated that they would not be willing to participate in health research. In fact, racial/ethnic minority participants (Black or Hispanic) were more likely to express their willingness to participate in health research if provided the opportunity than White respondents. There is no difference in participation rates between racial/ethnic minorities, yet among those who have not participated, racial/ethnic minorities report both more opportunity and more willingness. These findings are inconsistent with several nonpopulation-based studies that suggest racial/ethnic minorities are less willing to participate. 9,[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] However, the findings are consistent with a small number of more recent studies that document a willingness to participate among racial and ethnic minorities. [37][38][39] This study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting barriers beyond willingness. [37][38][39] Specifically, the paradoxical findings of this study, which showed no difference in the participation rates of racial/ethnic minorities, yet also showed racial/ethnic minorities report both more opportunity and more willingness, needs further exploration. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in participation rates, willingness to participate, or opportunity to participate among those with and without a chronic condition. This was somewhat surprising, as prior research has shown that those with chronic conditions are more likely to participate. 6,[40][41][42] Another unexpected finding was that those who have insurance were less likely to have had the opportunity to participate, and those who were uninsured reported greater opportunity. Furthermore, those who reported not being able to afford to go to the doctor, and those without a job reported greater willingness to participate. These findings are in contrast to other studies that have suggested persons with limited access to healthcare services and persons who are uninsured are less likely to participate in research. 24,[43][44][45][46][47] These unexpected findings may be due to the high proportion of uninsured patients who are treated by the academic medical center, which is also the primary health research organization in the state. Younger participants (<65 years) reported having participated in research at lower rates and also reported less opportunity to participate in research. However, they expressed a greater willingness to participate. This could be due to the length of their opportunity (i.e., those who are 65 or older have lived longer, and therefore have more years of opportunity). While the finding is not surprising, the increased willingness of younger age groups is encouraging. Consistent with prior literature, as education increased, so did rates of participation, opportunity, and willingness. Not surprisingly, those who had a previous opportunity to participate in health research, but had chosen not to participate, were less likely to be willing to participate in health research."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "This study is strengthened by the large representative sample of respondents in Arkansas who took part in the 2015 BRFSS. However, the study does have limitations. The study relied on self-reported responses and, therefore, is subject to response bias. Although the BRFSS data collection does include both land-line and cell phone interviews, it does not include those without access to a phone. However, weighting the survey data to be representative of the state's population should compensate for any potential selection biases in sampling. The majority of the weighted sample-like the majority of Arkansas residents-were Caucasian, insured, and living above poverty levels. Therefore, important insights may be gained via oversampling of rural, minority, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in future population-based surveys. Additionally, those who are participating in the BRFSS may be more likely to report willingness to participate in health research than those who refused the BRFSS interview. Despite these limitations, this is the largest study of its kind using a representative sample. The study adds key insights into the factors associated with research participation, opportunity, and willingness to participate."}]
