Given the key role of APP-A\u03b2 metabolism in AD pathogenesis, we selected 29 genes involved in APP processing, A\u03b2 degradation and clearance. We then used exome and genome sequencing to investigate the single independent (single-variant association test) and cumulative (gene-based association test) effect of coding variants in these genes as potential susceptibility factors for AD, in a cohort composed of 332 sporadic and mainly late-onset AD cases and 676 elderly controls from North America and the UK.

In the single-variant association analysis, the main hits, none of which statistically significant after multiple testing correction (1.9e -4 <p-value<0.05), were found to be rare coding variants (0.009%<MAF<1.4%) with moderate to strong effect size (1.84<OR<Inf) that map to genes mainly involved in A\u03b2 extracellular degradation (TTR, ACE), clearance (LRP1) and APP trafficking and recycling (SORL1).

First, the discovery of APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations showed that familial Alzheimer's disease is linked to A\u03b2 42 overproduction [2] [3] [4] . Second, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified several susceptibility loci associated with AD (APOE, BIN1, PICALM, CD33, ABCA7, CLU, MS4A6A, EPHA1, CR1, CD2AP, SORL1, CASS4) and regulating APP-A\u03b2 levels [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Third, next generation sequencing laid the ground for the discovery of TREM2 risk variants, highlighting the possible role of microglia in A\u03b2 clearance [13] [14] . Finally, although recent studies have shown that rare coding variability in PSEN1 may influence the susceptibility for apparently sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD) [15] [16] , increases in A\u03b2 production currently explain a minority of AD cases. By contrast, it is very likely that the majority of AD cases are caused by impaired degradation and clearance of A\u03b2, which is produced at normal levels throughout life [17] [18] . Despite the importance of APP-A\u03b2 metabolism in AD, the role of genes taking part in A\u03b2 production and catabolism as susceptibility factors for AD is still elusive and has not been extensively investigated. Therefore, in this study, we selected 29 genes known to be involved in APP and A\u03b2 processing: ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM17, MEP1B, BACE1, BACE2, NCSTN, PSENEN, APH1B, LRRTM3, APLP1, APBA1, SORL1, TTR, GPR3, ECE1, ECE2, IDE, CST3, CTSB, CTSD, LYZ, MME, ACE, MMP3, A2M, PLAT, KLK6 and LRP1.

Importantly, TTR was the main finding both in the SKAT and single-marker association analysis. Therefore, suggesting TTR as a promising potential candidate risk gene for AD."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The Amyloid cascade hypothesis is the main accepted hypothesis underlying AD pathology. Several genes within the APP-A\u03b2 metabolism pathway have been reported as potential candidate genes for AD. However, coding variability among these has not been extensively investigated. The vast majority of reported studies are based on candidate gene approaches using array-based SNP genotyping and are focused mainly on genes involved in A\u03b2 catabolism (http://www.alzgene.org/). Thus, leaving low frequency and rare coding variants and genes involved in A\u03b2 production largely unexplored. GWASs and chip-based candidate gene approaches have shown that common and generally non-coding variability within these genes does not play a critical role for AD development. The only exceptions to this general rule are represented by SORL1 and ABCA7, which have been reported associated with late-onset apparently sporadic and familial AD both with GWASs, candidate gene approaches and exome sequencing [25] [26] [27] [28] .\nIn this study, we report a screening of genes known to be involved in the APP-A\u03b2 metabolism (APP processing, A\u03b2 production, degradation and clearance). We applied single-marker and gene-based association analyses, to investigate the independent and joint effect of coding variability within these genes in a cohort composed of 332 apparently sporadic and mainly late-onset AD cases and 676 elderly controls from North America and the UK. In our cohort, genes involved in A\u03b2 degradation and clearance harbor the highest relative frequency of rare and predicted damaging variants (mean = 4.73 rare coding variants/Kbp of coding sequence and 3.16 damaging coding variants/Kbp of coding sequence, respectively). Conversely, genes encoding for proteins regulating A\u03b2 production presented the lowest relative frequency of coding and likely damaging variability (mean = 3.59 rare coding variants/Kbp of coding sequence and 1.5 damaging coding variants/Kbp of coding sequence, respectively) (S4 and S5 Tables), suggesting a higher degree of conservation.\nIn the single-variant association analysis, the main hits were very rare coding variants (MAF 0.009%< MAF<1.4%) with strong effect sizes (1.84<OR<Inf) mapping to genes involved in A\u03b2 extracellular degradation (ACE, TTR, CTSB, MMP3), APP trafficking and recycling (SORL1), and clearance (LRP1). Among the main single-marker hits only 2 genes (APH1B, NCSTN) were component of the \u03b3 secretase complex and therefore pivotal for APP processing. Our study was underpowered for the detection of rare and low frequency variants and these variants were nominally significant after Bonferroni correction (1.9e -4 <p-value <0.05). Importantly, in our cohort, TREM2 p.R47H, the second most common risk factor for sporadic AD, has been detected in 6 cases (1.8%) and 4 controls (0.59%) and, given our small sample size, with a MAF = 0.2%, was not significantly associated to AD (p-value = 0.09). Therefore, we suggest that the main variants detected in our study may be functional and warrant a follow up in an extended sample size.\nTransthyretin (TTR) is a 55-kDa protein, particularly abundant in the CSF and human plasma, where it transports thyroxin from the peripheral blood circulation to the brain. TTR has been already reported linked to AD dementia. Particularly, it has been hypothesized that TTR may act as a scaffold protein, binding to amyloid and preventing its deposition and aggregation in plaques [29] . Moreover, TTR is a well established biomarker for AD: 1) a decrese in the CSF and serum TTR levels has been associated to an increased AD severity and faster rate of disease progression and 2) 5 SNPs and different TTR haplotypes have been related to hippocampal atrophy [30] . By contrast, TTR overexpression decreases A\u03b2 deposition, protects against A\u03b2 plaques formation and improves the cognitive function in different AD mouse model strains [31] [32] . Finally, TTR, likewise other well conserved secreted proteins critically involved in dementia (PRP and PGRN), has no homologous proteins (http://string-db.org/), therefore implying that even subtle changes to its epitopes and/or domains may be functionally relevant and phenotypically manifest. In line with this hypothesis, TTR is the main hit both in the single-variant analysis and, with only 6 variants detected (4 coding and 2 3\u00b4UTR variants), in the gene-based analysis (SKAT). Thus, suggesting that either the joint effect of the coding and non-coding variability at the TTR locus is likely to be functional or that the signal is driven by TTR p.T139M, that has a very strong effect size (OR = 6.19, 95% CI = 1.099-63.091).\nThe second strongest signal in the single variant analysis maps to ACE (p.T916M), encoding angiotensin I converting enzyme 1 (ACE1), a zinc metalloprotease, which regulates blood pressure. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that ACE1 may ameliorate the cognitive decline either regulating the cerebral blood flow and/or converting A\u03b2 42 to A\u03b2 40 , a more soluble isoform and its activity is increased in AD brain, in proportion to the parenchymal A\u03b2 load [33] [34] [35] .\nSORL1 encodes for Sortilin related receptor (SORLA, also known as LR11), which binds to APOE and mediates several intracellular sorting and trafficking functions through a VPS10 (vacuolar protein sorting protein 10) domain [36] . SORLA is highly expressed in the brain and modulates APP recycling through the retromer complex, thereby influencing levels of A\u03b2 [37] [38] . A growing body of evidence suggested SORL1 as an excellent positional and functional candidate for AD [12, 25, [39] [40] [41] [42] [25] [26] . Moreover, decreased expression and DNA methylation changes at the SORL1 locus have been reported associated to AD [43] [44] . SORL1 harbors 3 of the top variants identified (p.E270K, p.D2065V and p.R11P). Importantly, p.E270K has been reported in 7 Carribean Hispanic families and in vitro studies showed that SORL1 p. E270K is a functional variant, leading to increased secretion of A\u03b2, when transfected in HEK293 cell lines and weakening the binding to APP [45] . Therefore, it is plausible that SORL1 (p.E270K) may increase the susceptibility also for apparently sporadic LOAD. Thus, this finding, with the other main SORL1 variants detected (p.D2065V and p.R11P) should be further investigated.\nFinally, four of the main hits map to the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) gene. Importantly, LRP1 is a major A\u03b2 clearance receptor in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells and disturbance of this pathway contributes to A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain [46] . In addition, LRP1 locus was identified as an AD candidate locus in consanguineous IsraeliArab community [47] .\nThe c-alpha and SKAT tests reported ECE1 and LYZ and TTR, respectively, as main genes associated with LOAD, although after the Bonferroni correction, the association was only nominally significant. Very interestingly, the main genes identified both with the single-marker and gene-based analysis play a pivotal role in the cardiovascular system and have been already signaled as potential risk factors for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) or vascular dementia [48] . First, ECE1 and ACE are key components of the renin-angiotensin cascade, that controls blood pressure [49] . Second, ECE1, ACE and TTR are mostly expressed by endothelial cells in the CNS (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html). Third, acute and chronic hypoxia, through the release of the hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), exerts a critical epigenetic regulation on APP processing and A\u03b2 catabolism key genes. Notably, HIF-1\u03b1 has been reported to increase \u03b3 and \u03b2 cleavage of APP and impair A\u03b2 degradation and clearance mainly through the down regulation of pivotal proteins such as MME, ECE1 and TTR [50] [51] [52] [53] .\nIn summary, our study shows that 1) common coding variability within genes involved in APP-A\u03b2 metabolism does not play a critical role for AD development; 2) genes regulating A\u03b2 production are more conserved than genes playing a key role in A\u03b2 degradation and clearance, thus less frequently involved in sporadic AD; 3) TTR, ACE, SORL1, CTSB and LRP1 harbor rare coding variants with strong effect size, likely to be functional and warrant further investigation in an extended cohort; 4) ECE1, LYZ and TTR play a critical role in the cardiovascular system and the joint effect of their variants may increase the susceptibility to AD. Finally, in concert with previous studies, our results support a potential overlapping biology with shared risk factors between CAA, vascular dementia and AD.\nSupporting Information S1 "}]
