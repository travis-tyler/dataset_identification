In childhood, externalizing behavior refers to a cluster of aggressive and disruptive behaviors including fighting, arguing, throwing tantrums, disturbing activities, or harming others (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1978; Campbell, 1995; Duncan & Magnuson, 2011; Hinshaw, 2002; Zachrisson, Dearing, Lekhal, & Toppelberg, 2013) . These behaviors emerge nearly universally in infancy, peak between ages 2 and 4, and then optimally decline (Keenan & Wakschlag, 2000; Shaw, Lacourse, & Nagin, 2005; Tremblay, 2010; Tremblay et al., 1999) . Yet, there is great variability in children's trajectories, with a concerning number leading to later antisocial and criminal activity (Campbell, Spieker, Burchinal, Poe, & NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2006; Moffit, 1993; Tremblay, 2010; Tremblay et al., 2004) . Approximately one third of children who display high levels of early externalizing behavior problems continue on a trajectory of problem behavior through adolescence (Loeber, Farrington, & Waschbusch, 1998; Losel & Bender, 2003 . Young children who display high levels of early externalizing behavior problems are also at risk for a host of subsequent academic issues, including school retention, school dropout, and lower school engagement (Bub, McCartney, & Willett, 2007; Bulotsky & Fantuzzo, 2011; Duncan & Magnuson, 2011; Fantuzzo et al., 2007; Raver, 2002) . Furthermore, externalizing behavioral concerns in early primary classrooms take up significant portions of teachers' time and efforts, thereby undermining the learning experience for all students (Houts, Caspi, Pianta, Arseneault, & Moffitt, 2010) .\nIn response, a range of approaches for improving externalizing behavior prior to formal school entry have been developed and tested. These approaches have been heavily influenced by ecological models of development (Campbell, Shaw, & Gilliom, 2000) . Specifically, Bronfenbrenner's (1977) ecological model suggests that variability in children's developmental trajectories is the result of different interactions between a child and a complex web of settings that span from immediate contexts (e.g., family and school contexts) to more distal ones (e.g., neighborhood, cultural, and political contexts). During the early childhood years, the characteristics of these nested contexts and the connections among them are thought to influence whether or not children's behavior improves as they learn to engage in more positive and less negative ways of interacting with others, or alternatively persist into middle childhood and even later (Campbell et al., 2000; Moffit, 1993) . Indeed, within children's immediate environments, many theorists and empiricists have documented a link between early harsh, inconsistent, and coercive caregiver-child relationships and higher levels of externalizing behavior problems (e.g., Hirschi, 1969; Patterson, Debaryshe, & Ramsey, 1989; Smith et al., 2014; Tolan, Dodge, & Rutter, 2013) . At more distal levels, poverty, high-crime neighborhoods, and persistent discrimination have also been linked to externalizing behavior problems (Campbell et al., 2000) . In accordance with these findings, early prevention programs have operated in a number of different contexts, including families' homes, childcare and preschool centers, clinics, and communities (Losel & Bender, 2012) .\nOne prevention approach that deserves greater scrutiny is early childhood education (ECE), defined as center-based education for children from birth to age 5. The number of children attending ECE programs has grown rapidly in recent years (Burgess, Chien, Morrissey, & Swenson, 2014) , with programs reaching an unprecedentedly large proportion of low-income children, who are at an increased risk for displaying externalizing behavior problems (Huaqing Qi & Kaiser, 2003; Mattera, Lloyd, Fishman, & Bangser, 2013) . This growth makes widespread early prevention within an ECE context more feasible but also raises important questions about best practices. As policymakers, educators, and researchers increasingly consider the merits of ECE programs, the time is right to take stock of what we know about their capacity to address externalizing behavior problems and to identify which program features are associated with the most beneficial effects.\nIn this study, we employ meta-analytic techniques to conduct a systematic analysis of what we know about how ECE programs affect externalizing behavior problems in young children, and to better understand how externalizing behavior problems might vary as a function of ECE practices."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ECE and externalizing behavior problems: an overview", "text": "Despite several decades of evaluation research, it has been difficult to draw conclusions about ECE programs' effects on externalizing behavior problems. Theoretical and empirical research can be found to support both a positive and a negative relationship.\nOn the one hand, ECE programs theoretically offer a unique opportunity to target several early protective factors associated with lower externalizing behavior problems, including children's early cognitive abilities (particularly verbal abilities), self-regulation, and social skills; and caregiver warmth, responsiveness, and behavioral management techniques (Schindler & Yoshikawa, 2012; Yoshikawa, Schindler, & Caronongan, 2009 ). Some empirical studies have supported this view, finding that participation in ECE programs resulted in reductions in externalizing behavior problems. Perry Preschool is a well-known example of a high-quality ECE program for 4-and 5 year-olds implemented in the 1960s that successfully reduced externalizing behavior problems and later criminal and antisocial activity (Schweinhart et al., 2005) . In addition, two reviews of evaluations of center-based preschool programs for 3 to 5 year olds found small, positive effects on social and emotional outcomes, though neither included evaluations of programs for younger children or examined externalizing behavior problems separately (Camilli, Vargas, Ryan, & Barnett, 2010; Nelson, Westhues, & MacLeod, 2003) .\nOn the other hand, some theoretical perspectives argue for ECE increasing externalizing behavior. It is possible that ECE programs do not promote protective factors and instead may increase exposure to some risk factors, such as aggressive peers. The prolonged group interactions that are common in ECE settings may also increase children's physiological stress and thereby negatively impact their development, particularly for children under age 3 (Vermeer & van IJzendoorn, 2006) . Several empirical investigations have supported a positive association between ECE enrollment and higher levels of externalizing behavior problems. Coley, Votruba-Drzal, Miller, and Koury (2013) examined a nationally representative sample of 6000 children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. They found that center-based preschool for 4-year-olds predicted heightened externalizing behavior problems in kindergarten relative to children who had remained in parental care. ECE during infancy and toddlerhood showed no independent associations but did exacerbate the negative relationship between preschool and externalizing behavior problems. Two other studies came to similar conclusions about preschool using another nationally representative longitudinal dataset (Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Class of [1998] [1999] . One specifically examined participation in school-based and publicly funded prekindergarten programs and found that participation was associated with higher levels of behavior problems (Magnuson, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2007) . The other study examined the effects of any center-based care and found that, overall, center-based care predicted heightened behavior problems. These negative associations were larger the younger the children enrolled in centers (Loeb, Bridges, Bassok, Fuller, & Rumberger, 2007) .\nFinally, some studies have reported no association between ECE and externalizing problem behavior (Howes et al., 2008; Loeb, Fuller, Kagan, & Carrol, 2004) . Loeb, Fuller, Kagan, and Carrol compared outcomes for low-income children between 12 and 42 months who were in ECE programs to similar children cared for by kith or kin and found no effects on externalizing behavior problems. Howes and colleagues similarly found that enrollment in pre-kindergarten failed to predict any differences in children's externalizing behavior problems.\nThese studies, which have attempted to examine average impacts of a range of ECE programs, have come to quite different conclusions. Hence, our first research question is: What is the average treatment effect of ECE on children's externalizing behavior problems? Several of the aforementioned studies also examined whether various elements, such as timing and program duration, affected the relationship between ECE and externalizing behavior problems. However, to date, few studies looking across ECE programs have attempted to delineate program practices that may differentiate the programs that effectively reduce behavior problems and those that do not."}, {"section_title": "ECE and the prevention of externalizing behavior problems: three levels of practice", "text": "Our remaining research questions focus on understanding the relative effects of three levels of ECE practice for preventing externalizing behavior problems. ECE programs differ a lot in their approaches, including the extent to which the programs focus on improving or building children's social and emotional development. In our analyses, we examine three levels of emphasis on social and emotional development from no focus (level 1) to a clear and intensive focus (level 3). The framework guiding our analyses is presented in Fig. 1 and is described below. We use this framework to differentiate among common approaches to social and emotional practices in ECE programs."}, {"section_title": "Level 1: Programs without a clear focus on social and emotional development", "text": "Level 1 ECE programs operate without an explicit focus on social and emotional development. Even so, these programs may still be able to reduce externalizing behavior problems through the provision of an emotionally supportive environment that offers responsive and nurturing interactions (Gormley, Phillips, Newmark, Welti, & Adelstein, 2012) . In addition, difficulties with early cognitive and achievement skills, particularly verbal abilities, put children at risk for externalizing behavior problems. Hence, programs that place an emphasis on academic preparedness, even without a content focus on social and emotional development, may still have important benefits for these behaviors. Such programs, particularly in preschool, have become increasingly popular in recent decades as both researchers and policymakers have emphasized the importance of literacy and math skills for school readiness (NAEYC & NCTM, 2002; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998 ). In practice, a level 1 program might focus on promoting child-directed group and individual activities, in which a teacher follows a child's cues and responds with appropriate, language-rich interaction, without a specific instructional focus. A level 1 program may also incorporate particular instructional activities focused on pre-academic skills, such as literacy or math, without incorporating specific activities focused on social and emotional development.\n2.2.2. Level 2: programs with a clear but broad focus on social and emotional development Level 2 programs build on level 1 programs by incorporating components focused on social and emotional development; however, these programs do so in the context of activities promoting skills in a range of developmental domains. In other words, level 2 programs include goals both for improving cognitive and achievement skills and for improving social and emotional development. The idea behind this approach is that social and emotional needs are intertwined with cognitive abilities, all of which are important for healthy child development, successful school performance, and later adult productivity (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2007). Global curricula, which have a wide scope, fall into the level 2 category. For example, the High Scope model for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers pairs a focus on adult-child interaction with daily routines and suggested activities focused on building social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development (High Scope Educational Research Foundation, 2014 (Zigler & Styfco, 1995) . Though many level 2 programs have been evaluated relative to control groups, research has not yet been conducted to empirically compare effects on externalizing behavior problems of programs that include a broad focus on social and emotional development versus programs without such a focus. Hence, our second research question is: Are level 2 ECE programs that report a clear but broad focus on social and emotional development associated with fewer externalizing behavior problems than level 1 programs that do not articulate that focus?"}, {"section_title": "Level 3: programs with a clear and intensive focus on social and emotional development", "text": "In recent years, a third level of programs has emerged that places even more emphasis on social and emotional learning as well as positive behavior. These programs often supplement a global curriculum with program components that target social and emotional competencies more intensively than in typical ECE settings (Morris et al., 2014; Raver, 2002) . These additional program components are considered \"enhancements\" to the more standard level 2 practices (Mattera et al., 2013) . We classify level 3 enhancements into two categories: a) child social skills training, and b) caregiver behavior management training."}, {"section_title": "Level 3a: child social skills training", "text": "Deficits in social skills and competencies have been empirically linked to externalizing behavior problems and antisocial development (Farrington & Welsh, 2007; Losel & Bender, 2006) . Hence, social skills training has been recommended not just for improving social development in general but also specifically for preventing externalizing behavior problems. Level 3 social skills training enhancements assert that some children may need \"explicit instruction to ensure they develop competence in emotional literacy, anger and impulse control, interpersonal problem solving, and friendship skills\" (Fox, Dunlap, Hemmeter, Joseph, & Strain, 2003, p. 2) . This program enhancement is directly informed by the social information processing model of externalizing behavior problems, which assumes that individuals differ in how they interpret situations, read social cues, and initiate and evaluate reactions to situations, and that those differences are learned through experience (Crick & Dodge, 1994) . Hence, social skills training programs aim to prevent problematic trajectories through teaching children appropriate behaviors (e.g., making friends, accepting others' rights, expressing needs and emotions) and/ or targeting the basic cognitive skills needed for effective social problem solving (e.g., perspective taking, self-control, and anger management) (Losel & Bender, 2012) .\nSocial skills training programs that act as program enhancements in an ECE context often use a series of \"circle time\" structured group lessons to promote social skills and social competence in children. For example, preschool PATHS (\"Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies) is a 30-lesson curricular enhancement focused on teaching children about emotions and how to respond in social situations (Domitrovich, Cortes, & Greenberg, 2007; Morris et al., 2014) . Preschool PATHS was originally developed to supplement Head Start's typical programming. Thematic units include lessons on basic and advanced feelings, a self-control strategy, and problem solving. For example, in a lesson on \"feelings,\" the teacher instructs children to look at a drawing of faces. From there, the teacher discusses how the physical features of faces can provide clues for how someone is feeling on the inside. Then, the teacher asks children to think about the parts of a face that show when someone is happy and to identify pictures of people who are happy or not happy. The lesson ends with an activity in which children use a blank face template and cutouts of mouths, eyes, ears, and noses, and the teacher asks them to make a happy face and a sad face with the materials. Later in the day, the teacher asks children to try and identify how their peers are feeling (Mattera et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Level 3b: caregiver behavior management training", "text": "The second type of level 3 enhancement takes a different approach to preventing externalizing behavior problems. This program enhancement focuses on promoting caregivers' positive behavioral management techniques, which are known protective factors against behavior problems (Patterson, Reid, & Dishion, 1992; Schindler & Yoshikawa, 2012) . Caregiver behavior management trainings are informed by self-control theory (Hirschi, 1969 ) and a social-interactional perspective (Patterson et al., 1989) , both of which point to the importance of early interactions with caregivers. Techniques that are emphasized in this type of level 3 enhancement offered to teachers and/or parents include effective limit setting, appropriate discipline strategies, and rewarding positive behavior.\nThe impetus for offering behavior management training to teachers has come from the high frequencies of externalizing behavior problems that early childhood teachers report and from their identification of the ability to manage challenging child behavior as one of their top training needs (Snell et al., 2012; Yoshikawa & Knitzer, 1997; Yoshikawa & Zigler, 2000) . Parent behavior management training programs operating outside of the context of ECE have a longer history (Piquero & Jennings, 2012) , but they have only more recently been evaluated as enhancements within ECE settings.\nThe Incredible Years program is an example that has been used with both parents and teachers. In this enhancement to ECE services, parents participate in 12-week parent groups and are taught behavior management techniques through viewing video vignettes and having group discussions. Teachers participate in six workshops that employ the same video-vignette method to teach classroom-wide positive management and discipline strategies (Webster-Stratton, Reid, & Hammond, 2001) .\nThough individual level 3 programs have been evaluated and summarized by others, questions remain about the average benefit of these level 3 programs over level 2 programs, as well as whether the two conceptually different types of level 3 programs vary in their impacts (Mattera, Lloyd, Fishman, & Bangser, 2013) . In this paper, our third and fourth research questions attempt to address these gaps in the literature. Specifically, we ask: Are level 3 ECE programs with a clear and intensive focus on social and emotional development associated with fewer externalizing behavior problems than level 2 programs? and If so, is child social skills training or caregiver behavior management training more effective?"}, {"section_title": "Summary of research questions", "text": "This is the first meta-analysis to explicitly examine the relative effects of different practices used within ECE settings on externalizing behavior problems in young children. Specifically, we examine the relative benefits of three levels of practice, each with increasing specificity and intensity aimed at children's social and emotional development (see Fig. 1 ). To summarize, we address the following four research questions:\n1. What is the average treatment effect of ECE on children's externalizing behavior problems? 2. Are level 2 ECE programs that report a clear but broad focus on social and emotional development associated with fewer externalizing behavior problems than level 1 programs that do not articulate that focus? 3. Are level 3 ECE programs with a clear and intensive focus on social and emotional development associated with fewer externalizing behavior problems than level 2 programs? 4. If so, is child social skills training or caregiver behavior management training more effective?"}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "To answer our research questions, we draw upon a comprehensive meta-analytic database that includes evaluations of ECE programs implemented in the United States and published between 1960 and 2007. In this paper, we limited our analyses to evaluations of ECE programs for children from birth to five years old that included measures of externalizing behavior problems. Our metaanalytic approach transformed estimates of externalizing behavior problems into a common metric, an \"effect size,\" that represents the difference between a treatment group and a control group or a treatment group and an alternative treatment group. These effect sizes, which are expressed as fractions of standard deviations, were then used to estimate average effects across evaluations and to explore factors that might maximize or minimize a program's effectiveness. We followed standard procedures for conducting meta-analyses, which include (a) literature search, (b) data evaluation, and (c) data analysis (Cooper, Hedges, & Valentine, 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Literature search", "text": "In this study, we utilized a subset of studies from a larger meta-analytic database being compiled by the National Forum on Early Childhood Policy and Programs (http://developingchild.harvard.edu/activities/forum/meta_analytic_database/). The starting point for the Forum's database was a bibliography of evaluations of ECE programs for 3-to 5-year-old children conducted between 1960 and 2003, compiled by Abt Associates and the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) (Camilli et al., 2010; Jacob, Creps, & Boulay, 2004; Layzer, Goodson, Bernstein, & Price, 2001 ). The Forum's database updated Abt's list to 2007, added programs for children birth to age 3, and employed more rigorous methodological inclusion criteria (see Data evaluation section).\nThe Forum identified additional reports for inclusion by conducting keyword searches in ERIC, PsychINFO, EconLit, and Disseration Abstract databases; manually searching the websites of policy institutes (e.g., RAND Corporation, Mathematica, NIEER) and state and federal departments (e.g., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services); and collecting references mentioned in included studies and other key reviews. In total, the Forum's search resulted in 10,309 reports for possible inclusion, in addition to the reports identified previously by Abt and NIEER. It is important to note that in traditional bibliographic searches, the goal is typically to maximize efficiency by minimizing both false positives (identified evaluations that are irrelevant) and false negatives (relevant evaluations not identified). In meta-analysis, the main objective is to reduce the number of false negatives (relevant evaluations not identified); therefore, the meta-analyst must be willing to cast a wider net and examine more false positives (Cooper et al., 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Data evaluation", "text": "The next step in the meta-analysis process was to assess reports in order to identify high-quality evaluations with similar treatment and comparison groups (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009 ). To be included in the Forum's database, evaluations had to have: a) a comparison group (either an observed control or alternative treatment group); b) at least 10 participants in each condition; and c) attrition rates of less than 50% between the initiation of treatment and measurement. Included evaluations had to be experimental or quasi-experimental, using one of the following designs: random assignment, regression discontinuity, fixed effects (individual or family), residualized or other longitudinal change models, difference in difference, instrumental variables, propensity score matching, or interrupted time series. Quasi-experimental evaluations not using one of the former analytic strategies were also included if they had a comparison group and either a) pre-and post-test information on the outcome of interest or b) demonstrated adequate comparability of groups on baseline characteristics. Studies in which the intervention was designed for children with diagnosed behavioral, emotional, or medical disorders or learning disabilities were excluded. These methodological criteria are more rigorous than those applied by Abt Associates and NIEER. For example, the Forum's database excludes all pre to post only (no comparison group) evaluations, as well as regression-based studies in which the baseline equivalence of treatment and control groups was not investigated.\nThe majority (91%) of the 10,309 ECE reports identified by the National Forum on Early Childhood Policy and Programs' research team's search were excluded after reading the abstracts, indicating that they did not meet inclusion criteria for obvious reasons (e.g., they were not quantitative evaluations or did not have a comparison group). Of the evaluation reports that made it to the full-text screening phase, reasons for exclusion most often included not meeting the research design criteria, with a small number of reports being excluded due to other eligibility criteria (e.g., they only reported results for students with disabilities). The high percentage of excluded reports is typical in meta-analytic searches and reflects the need to cast a wide net (Cooper et al., 2009) , as discussed in our description of the literature search process. Once all reports were assessed, those that were screened-in were grouped into 273 studies.\nEach of the 273 studies was then coded by a team of nine doctoral-level research assistants in order to document information about study design, program and sample characteristics, and information needed to compute effect sizes. Prior to coding independently, the Forum's meta-analytic research team implemented a training process that included practice coding, assessing reliability, and holding regular meetings (Cooper et al., 2009) . Specifically, research assistants were trained during a 3 to 6 month process, during which time an overview of the project was provided; each item in the codebook was discussed; a manualized effect size training was completed; and a sample of studies was coded alongside an experienced coder. Trained coders were then required to achieve an interrater agreement of 1.00 for effect sizes and .80 for all other study information with a master set of codes, based on the procedure used in Abt's meta-analytic database (see Camilli et al., 2010) . The master set of codes was created by two original developers of the codebook. The range of interrater agreements for all study information was .87-.96 (M = .87).\nThroughout coding, discrepancies and questions were resolved through weekly meetings between coders and principal investigators, and decisions were kept in an annotated codebook to ensure that decisions made about any ambiguities during these meetings were followed throughout the coding process (Cooper et al., 2009) . Two additional steps were taken two ensure high-quality data. First, at the conclusion of the construction of the database, data entry was checked through systematic data exploration and cleaning. This process included checking outliers; confirming skip patterns, and examining missing values. Second, primary independent variables used in the present study were independently coded for all included studies by the first author. This agreement rate was nearly perfect (.97)."}, {"section_title": "Overall database and analytic sample", "text": "The resulting database of the National Forum on Early Childhood Policy and Programs is organized into a three-level hierarchy: study, contrast, and effect size. A \"study\" is defined as a collection of comparisons in which the treatment groups are drawn from the same broadly-defined pool of subjects (N = 273). Each study also produces a number of \"contrasts,\" defined as comparisons of groups that experienced different conditions within a study (N = 1242). For example, a study might provide one group of participants with level 2 ECE services, one group of participants with level 3 ECE services, and one group of participants with no services. This would represent three contrasts: level 1 ECE versus no services, level 2 ECE versus no services, and level 1 ECE versus level 2 ECE. The former two contrasts are labeled as \"treatment versus control\" contrasts since the measured difference is between a group who was offered services and a group who was offered no services. The latter contrast is labeled as a \"treatment versus alternative treatment\" contrast since the measured difference is between two groups who were offered different services. Finally, effect sizes are the standardized differences on a set of outcome measures (N = 15,804). Effect sizes (Hedges' g) were computed using the software package Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2005) and are expressed as a fraction of a standard deviation. A standardized mean difference is useful for making the different instruments used within and across studies comparable (Bushman & Wang, 2009 ). Hedges' g adjusts the standardized mean difference (Cohen's d) to account for bias when sample sizes are small.\nFor the present study, we used a subset of the Forum's database and only included studies that measured externalizing behavior problems. We included both treatment versus control contrasts and treatment versus alternative treatment contrasts. Each of the included treatment versus control contrasts compared a group of participants who was offered ECE services to a group who was not offered ECE services. These contrasts were used to answer our first two research questions (RQ1: What is the average treatment effect of ECE on children's externalizing behavior problems?; RQ2: Are level 2 ECE programs that report a clear but broad focus on social and emotional development associated with fewer externalizing behavior problems than level 1 programs that do not articulate that focus?). None of the treatment versus control contrasts included level 3 program enhancements (child social skills training or caregiver behavior management). To examine the effects of these types of programs, we turned to a sample of treatment versus alternative treatment comparisons, which were used to answer research questions 3 and 4 (RQ3: Are level 3 ECE programs with a clear and intensive focus on social and emotional development associated with fewer externalizing behavior problems than level 2 programs?; RQ4: If so, is child social skills training or caregiver behavior management training more effective?). Our resulting sample represented 143 effect sizes nested in 55 contrasts and 31 studies. Of the 55 contrasts, 39 were treatment versus control comparisons. The remaining 16 were treatment versus alternative treatment contrasts."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Dependent variable", "text": "We examined program impacts on 1) externalizing behavior problems, conceptualized as aggressive, disruptive, impulsive, or hyperactive behavior (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1978; Campbell, 1995; Hinshaw, 2002; Zachrisson et al., 2013) and 2) later measures of corresponding antisocial behaviors (e.g., ever committed purposeful injury; ever arrested for a violent offense). We excluded measures that combined reports of externalizing behavior problems with other social and emotional domains. For example, we excluded measures of the overall Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1992) because it assesses both internalizing and externalizing behavior. However, we included the Child Behavior Checklist's externalizing behavior problem measure and its subscales.\nAges of children at the time of measurement ranged from 18 months to 40 years. For children from 18 months to 3 years old, the most common instruments were subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist (13/23 effect sizes) and observations of behavior problems (e.g., having tantrums, throwing toys) in laboratory-based tasks (9/23 effect sizes). Instruments for children ages 4 to 5 were much more varied, but the most common instruments included subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist (13/76), the Social Skills Rating System (11/76), the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scale (6/76), and the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (4/76). For children older than 5 years of age, the most common instruments were counts of aggressive behaviors (22/44) and the presence of antisocial behaviors (11/44).\nEffect sizes were coded so that negative numbers represent lower levels of externalizing behavior problems. In other words, a negative effect size suggests that the intervention had a beneficial effect on externalizing behavior problems. For treatment versus control contrasts, the range of effect sizes was \u22121.09 to 1.01. For treatment versus alternative treatment contrasts, the range was \u22121.59 to .68."}, {"section_title": "Independent variables: three levels of practice", "text": "As part of our protocol, researchers coded the central stated purposes of each ECE program. Up to four goals could be coded, and only goals that were clearly stated in the reports were marked. All ECE programs used in our analyses included a stated goal to improve child cognitive or school outcomes. If a report failed to also include a stated goal to improve social and emotional development (including child behavior, emotional regulation, or relational skills), then the program was coded as a level 1 ECE program. If a report did include a stated goal to improve social and emotional behavior, but did not describe a level 3 enhancement, then the program was coded as a level 2 ECE program.\n2 Finally, if the report included a stated goal to improve social and emotional development and described child social skills training or caregiver behavior management training, then the program was coded as a level 3 ECE program. Within level 3 ECE programs, a variable was created to designate if the program included child social skills training. Programs were coded as including child social skills training enhancements if there was a program enhancement focused on teaching children appropriate behaviors (e.g., making friends, accepting others' rights, expressing needs and emotions) and/ or targeting the basic cognitive skills needed for effective social problem solving (e.g., perspective taking, self-control, and anger management). Another variable was created to designate if the program included caregiver behavior management training. Programs were coded as including caregiver behavior management training if they included an enhancement focused on giving teachers or parents techniques for behavior management, such as effective limit setting, appropriate discipline strategies, and rewarding positive behavior.

However, in order to answer research questions two (Are level 2 ECE programs that report a clear but broad focus on social and emotional development associated with fewer externalizing behavior problems than level 1 programs that do not articulate that focus?) and four (Is child social skills training or caregiver behavior management training more effective?), we included a set of covariates in our models.

Rather, our judgment of a program's broad focus on social and emotional development is based on the assumed relationship between stated goals and program content. This limitation is an important one in meta-analysis -the need to rely only on what is reported in prior studies.\nbetween program types. Rather, we utilized variability across evaluations, controlling for potentially confounding variables, to answer these research questions.\nWe included in our regression models a set of differences in program, participant, and study design characteristics based on the ECE literature and prior relevant meta-analytic studies (e.g., Shager et al., 2013) . As a program characteristic, we included a continuous variable indicating the total length of the program, measured in months for treatment versus control contrasts (which were longer, on average) and in weeks for treatment versus alternative treatment contrasts (which were shorter, on average). We also included a continuous measure indicating program dosage, expressed as hours per week. At the participant level, we included a continuous variable indicating the average age of participant children at the time of measurement and a dichotomous variable noting if the majority of participants were African American or Latino, with the omitted category representing participants that were majority non-Latino white or other non-reported groups."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "In order to control for variation in the quality of study design, we included an index ranging from zero to three, with higher values representing higher quality studies. The index was created by summing across three dichotomous measures: 1) the study used random assignment, 2) the study had less than 25% attrition in treatment and comparison groups at the time of follow-up, and 3) coders did not observe any evidence of systematic bias in the evaluation or study methods (i.e., attrited treatment subjects were excluded from analyses; degree of volunteering for the program was different for the experimental and control groups). We also included a dichotomous variable indicating if the study was published in a peer-reviewed journal to account for the possibility that larger and more significant findings are more likely to be published in such outlets. Similarly, a variable was included that identified studies with an active control group (sought out ECE services out of their own volition), a characteristic thought to be associated with smaller effect sizes. Finally, we included a set of dichotomous variables to describe if the measure was taken during treatment, at the end of treatment, or at follow-up (omitted)."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "In some cases, reports in our sample failed to provide the necessary information needed to code one or more of the following covariates: length of program, hours per week, average age of participant at time of measurement, and whether the majority of participants were African American or Latino. Rates of missing values for these four covariates ranged from 5.2% to 31.3%. Missing data on covariates is a common problem in meta-analytic studies because the conventions and norms regarding information reported in the evaluation studies varies so much across journals, disciplines, and time. Multiple imputation (MI) is generally the preferred method for accounting for missingness in studies based on individuals, families, and schools because each case with missing data on some variables typically has non-missing data on a number of correlated variables that can be used to generate the imputation. In contrast, meta-analytic studies, including our own, often lack sufficient observed characteristics that provide a strong basis for imputation. In addition, using MI in multi-level models can cause other problems (e.g., unstable estimates). Therefore, to indicate missingness in our analyses, we instead used dummy variable adjustments (Allison, 2002; Puma, Olsen, Bell, & Price, 2009 ). For example, if a contrast did not provide information on the length of the program, a code of zero replaced the missing value on this variable and a second dummy variable was created to indicate missingness on length of program. Both the length of program predictor variable (including new zero codes) and the dummy coded variable indicating missingness were included simultaneously in analyses. The same approach was used for the remaining covariates with missing data. This method has been recommended as an alternative to multiple imputation when covariates are missing in experimental studies and is superior to other common techniques, such as mean value imputation and case deletion (Puma et al., 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Analytic approach", "text": "We first examined contrast and effect size level statistics separately for our analytic samples of treatment versus control and treatment versus alternative treatment comparisons. Then, we conducted a series of multi-level HLM models to answer our four research questions. The nested nature of the effect-size data (i.e., effect sizes clustered within contrasts, which in turn are clustered within studies) gave rise to the need to adjust statistically for the non-independence of the effect size estimates. For the purposes of these analyses, we estimated a two-level model, with level 1 reflecting effect sizes and level 2 reflecting contrasts. We do this for both theoretical and practical reasons. First, the most typical circumstance giving rise to multiple contrasts is multiple treatment arms with separate groups of children. Therefore, we expected effect sizes to be more similar within contrasts than within studies. Indeed, the intraclass correlation for effect sizes within contrasts (ICC = .44) was slightly larger than the intraclass correlation for effect sizes within studies (ICC = .37). Second, more than half of the included studies included only one contrast, thus the data would not support a three-level model.\nUsing a multi-level HLM framework (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) , the level-1 model (effect size level) is:\n3 Since meta-analysis relies on information reported by prior studies, we were not able to capture more nuanced ethnic and racial group differences. 4 Some covariates were excluded in analyses to answer research question four because they weren't relevant when examining treatment versus alternative treatment contrasts. For example, the \"active control\" variable was no longer applicable. Other measures excluded from research question four analyses included hours per week (due to the lack of consistency in studies' reporting of this) and when the measure was taken (since nearly all of the measures were taken at the end of treatment).\nwhere effect size i in contrast j is modeled as a function of the intercept (\u03c0 0j ), which represents the average (covariate adjusted) effect size for all contrasts; a set of estimated effects of k independent variables measured at the effect size level (\u03c0 1j x 1ij + \u2026 + \u03c0 kj x kij ); and a within-contrast error term (e ij ). The level-2 equation (contrast level) models the intercept as a function of the grand mean effect size (\u03b2 00 ), p independent variables measured at the contrast level (\u03b2 01 x 1j + \u2026 + \u03b2 0p x pj ) and a between-contrast random error term (u 0j ):\n\u03c0 0 j \u00bc\u03b2 00 \u00fe\u03b2 01 x 1 j \u00fe\u2026\u00fe\u03b2 0p x p j\u00fe u 0 j :\nThis \"mixed effects\" model, which can also be expressed in one equation by substituting (2) into (1), assumes that there are two sources of variation in the effect size distribution, beyond subject-level sampling error: 1) the \"fixed\" effects of effect size and contrast level variables that measure key features of the program design, contrast-level study methods, effect size characteristics and other covariates; and 2) remaining \"random\" unmeasured sources of variation between (u 0j ) and within contrasts (e ij ), which are assumed to be homogeneous both within and between model levels. Similar to other meta-analyses with multi-level data, we conducted our analyses using the PROC MIXED Procedure in SAS and weighted effect sizes by the inverse of the variance of each effect size multiplied by the inverse of the number of effect sizes per contrast (Camilli et al., 2010; Cooper, Hedges, & Valentine, 2009; de la Torre, Camilli, Vargas, & Vernon, 2007; Kuppens, Laurent, Heyvaert, & Onghena, 2013; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) .\nWe began with an intercept-only multi-level regression model (no predictors) of treatment versus control contrasts in order to answer research question one (What is the average treatment effect of ECE on children's externalizing behavior problems?). In order to answer research question 2 (Are level 2 ECE programs that report a clear but broad focus on social and emotional development associated with fewer externalizing behavior problems than level 1 programs that do not articulate that focus?), we added in a variable designating if a program was a level 2 program (versus level 1), followed by a model with covariates. To answer research questions 3 and 4, we turned to the treatment versus alternative treatment contrasts. To answer research question 3 (Are level 3 ECE programs with a clear and intensive focus on social and emotional development associated with fewer externalizing behavior problems than level 2 programs?) we ran an intercept-only multi-level regression model (no predictors). To answer research question 4 (Is child social skills training or caregiver behavior management training more effective?), we ran intercept-only models separately for each type of approach to determine which approach(es) resulted in significant and meaningful benefits compared to ECE programs with more general approaches to improving behavior. We also ran a model with child social skills training as the predictor, followed by a model that added in covariates, in order to see if level 3 ECE programs with child social skills training enhancements resulted in significantly different effects than those with caregiver behavior management training enhancements.\nFollowing our primary analyses, we carried out several additional analyses to test the sensitivity of our findings to alternate model specifications. We also explored publication bias. First, we created two funnel plots: one for treatment versus control contrasts and one for treatment versus alternative treatment contrasts. Funnel plots are visual representations of the data in which mean effect sizes are plotted against some measure of sample size (e.g., standard error) (Sterne & Egger, 2001 ).

Note: Coefficients for missing data dummy variables are not displayed.\n5.6.1.1. Sample. In our primary analyses, we included ECE programs that varied in the number of hours per week and the length of the program, and controlled for this variation using covariates. However, since it is possible that low-intensity ECE programs (e.g., summer Head Start) might be substantively different from other programs in our sample, we also tested a model that limited the sample to programs that were more than 10 hours a week and a model that limited the sample to programs that were greater than 4 months in length. The pattern of results remained unchanged; however, in the latter model, level 2 programs were only significantly different from level 1 programs at a trend level (p b .10).\nWe were also concerned that our findings might be driven by the Perry Preschool study, which is a level 2 program and is often cited for its robust findings regarding reductions in delinquency and adult crime. Indeed, Perry Preschool's effect sizes included two of the largest in our sample. However, when we removed Perry Preschool from our sample, our pattern of results remained. We further excluded all studies conducted in the 1960's and again found a consistent pattern of results.\n5.6.1.2. Length of follow-up. In our main analyses, we display findings that included measures taken at any time point that was measured, including during treatment, at the end of treatment, and at follow-up. Our pattern of findings continued to indicate an advantage for level 2 programs over level 1 programs when we limited our sample to measures taken between two-thirds of the program and up to five years after program completion; taken between two-thirds of the program and up to three years after program completion; and taken between two-thirds of the program and up to 1 year after program completion.\n5.6.1.3. Measurement quality. For some measures in our sample, there was little information provided about their development or psychometric properties. Prior research has suggested that researcher developed measures and measures with low reliability can yield different effect sizes than reliable measures and measures that are standardized (Rosenshine, 2010; Shager et al., 2013) . To test whether our findings were sensitive to measurement quality, we restricted our sample to measures that were either highly reliable (reliability N .9) or nationally normed. Our pattern of results remained unchanged.\n5.6.1.4. Treatment vs. alternative treatment analyses. Our treatment versus alternative treatment comparisons had less variability in sample, length of follow-up, and measurement quality, rendering parallel robustness checks unnecessary. However, in our final presented analyses, we ultimately excluded three studies (including 5 contrasts and 60 effect sizes) because it was not clear whether or not their ECE counterfactual or comparison conditions were level 2 programs, and we were interested primarily in how level 2 programs could be further improved. This set-up provided the most coherent set of analyses. Yet, we were still interested in whether the addition of these three excluded studies would change our findings. The studies included an additional evaluation of the Incredible Years Basic Program; an evaluation of preschool with RECAP (\"Reaching Educators, Children, and Families\"); and the interpersonal and cognitive problem solving intervention developed by Spivack (1980, 1982) . With these studies added to analyses, child social skills training remained the only program enhancement that was significant relative to level 2 programs in interceptonly models. In the regression analyses comparing child social skills training to caregiver behavior management training, the coefficient for child social skills training became slightly larger and more significant (p b .01)."}, {"section_title": "Publication bias", "text": "The funnel plot for treatment versus control contrasts is presented in Fig. 4 , and the one for treatment versus alternative treatment contrasts is presented in Fig. 5 . Each plot produced reasonably symmetric funnel patterns, and no significant asymmetry was detected using Egger's regression test (t(37) = 1.70, p = .10 for treatment versus control contrasts; t(14) = 1.34, p = .20 for treatment versus alternative treatment contrasts). In computing fail-safe Ns, we found that 369 contrasts with non-significant effects would need to be added to the dataset to nullify the beneficial effect of level 2 programs over level 1 programs. Seventy-three contrasts with nonsignificant effects would need to be added to the dataset to nullify the beneficial effect of child social skills training. Both findings are robust against publication bias based on Rosenthal's guidelines that the fail-safe N is unlikely when it is greater than or equal to five times the number of contrasts plus 10. Note. The intercept represents the effect of level 1 programs relative to control conditions. The \"Level 2 program\" coefficient represents the difference in effects between level 1 and level 2 programs."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this meta-analytic paper, we set out to examine the relative effects of different practices used within ECE settings on externalizing behavior problems, using a meta-analysis of rigorously evaluated ECE programs over the last several decades. Since metaanalyses rely on information presented in existing studies, they are particularly well-suited for identifying overarching patterns that can help shape future work. Specifically, we examined three levels of ECE practice, each with increasing specificity and intensity aimed at children's social and emotional development. In short, we found that each successive level of programs did a better job than the prior level at reducing externalizing behavior problems (see Fig. 6 for a summary of key findings).\nLevel 1 programs, or those without a clear focus on social and emotional development, were not significantly associated with externalizing behavior problems relative to control groups. On the other hand, Level 2 programs, or those with a clear but broad focus on social and emotional development, were associated with significant, modest reductions in externalizing behavior problems relative to control groups. These findings suggest that under conditions aiming to actively support social and emotional development, ECE can be an effective mechanism for reducing externalizing behavior problems. Although it would be instructive to statistically untangle the mechanisms through which a broad focus on social and emotional development translated into improved outcomes in level 2 classrooms, only a few studies in our database explicitly delineated how this objective was infused into regular practices and processes. In many cases, level 2 programs utilized a global curriculum, such as High Scope or Creative Curriculum, that incorporated content across social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development. Our findings also suggest that level 2 ECE programs may be able to significantly and meaningfully build upon their impacts through the addition of program enhancements that more intensively target children's and emotional development. These benefits were largely driven by programs targeting children's social skills (what we refer to as Level 3a in our conceptualization). In our database, social skills training enhancements 1) focused on giving children skills for interacting with others, such as making friends, accepting others, or expressing individual needs, and 2) targeted basic cognitive skills for social problem solving, such as perspective taking and self-control. Child social skills trainings were implemented through developmentally focused and domain specific curricula, meaning they sought to build skills within the bounded realm of social skills rather than through a broader focus encompassing multiple domains of development (Clements, 2007; Yoshikawa et al., 2013) . The addition of a child social skills training enhancement to a level 2 program (making it a level 3a program), resulted in half of a standard deviation reduction in externalizing behavior problems relative to level 2 programs, which is nearly twice as large as the effect found in a previous study for high-quality social and emotional learning programs implemented in primary and secondary schools (Durlak, Dymnicki, Taylor, Weissberg, & Schellinger, 2011) .\nIn contrast to the findings just described, caregiver behavior management trainings (what we refer to as level 3b) were not significantly related to additional benefits for externalizing behavior problems relative to level 2 programs. These results are consistent with extensive research that has found that changing adult behavior, especially habitual patterns of caregiver-child interactions, is difficult (Halpern, 2000; Grindal et al., under review) . Furthermore, both parent and teacher behavior management training programs that are added onto ECE programs rest on the assumption that parents and teachers will be able to apply the skills they learn in their training sessions in a variety of situations and contexts after the trainings have ended. Child social skills training may be more effective than caregiver behavior management trainings in part because the former directly provide a vehicle for children to acquire a range of critical capabilities for learning how to calm down, how to recognize their own emotions and those of others, and how to negotiate conflict -all of which they may be more likely to be able to carry with them across settings. It may also be that early social skills are particularly salient factors in protecting children against heightened externalizing behavior problems, whereas behavior management strategies employed by parents and teachers are less powerful protective factors in the early childhood years. In sum, our findings largely support our initially proposed framework. At the third level, we find that child social skills training programs are particularly promising.\nStill, a number of limitations of our analyses warrant further discussion. First, we were only able to analyze data from programs that have been rigorously evaluated and that measured externalizing behavior problems as an outcome. Consequently our analyses only represent a subset of ECE programs. Second, although we found that child social skills training produced the most promising reductions in externalizing behavior problems, the limitations of using meta-analytic data precluded our ability to identify the features that were most effective. For example, recent research has shown that in-service, observation coaching and mentoring can boost the effects of a curriculum above and beyond didactic training alone (Neuman & Cunningham, 2009 ). Our database does not provide information concerning the specific levels of coaching versus didactic training provided to teachers in each program. Third, we focused on externalizing behavior problems as opposed to examining a broader set of behavior problems.\nOne recent large-scale study asking questions similar to the questions examined in our meta-analysis has attempted to address some of these limitations of the broader literature. Specifically, the Head Start CARES study simultaneously evaluated the effects of a child social skills training enhancement (Head Start plus Preschool PATHS) and a caregiver behavior management enhancement (Head Start plus Incredible Years) relative to Head Start as usual (see Domitrovich et al., 2007 and Webster-Stratton, Reid, & Hammond, 2001 for details on PATHS and Incredible Years). Both enhancements included comparable levels of coaching support, and the evaluation measured a broad set of social and emotional outcomes. In spite of examining similar questions, the Head Start CARES study came to somewhat different conclusions than our meta-analysis (Morris et al., 2014) . Neither enhancement had effects on externalizing behavior problems when measured in spring of the preschool year relative to level 2 programs. However, the enhancements did impact other social and emotional outcomes, including knowledge of emotions, social problem skills, and related social behavior, with the child social skills training enhancement producing a wider and more consistent set of impacts (Morris et al., 2014) . It is possible that this study came to somewhat different conclusions because of the challenges in scaling enhancements to larger populations. It is also possible that the early effects on social and emotional outcomes will translate into reductions in externalizing behavior problems as children get older. Future research should continue replicating our analyses with more contemporary national ECE studies, explore the circumstances under which child social skills trainings are more or less effective at preventing externalizing behavior problems, and examine how much implementation support and dosage is needed to achieve the greatest benefits at scale.\nIn spite of its limitations, the present study has the benefit of looking across a number of high-quality evaluations over several decades. As ECE programs continue to expand nationwide, our results suggest that strategies employed to reduce externalizing behavior problems should be given greater attention. Federal and state ECE programs should carefully consider whether chosen curricula include social and emotional development as an aim. Individual ECE preschool programs with concerns about externalizing behavior problems in children should also consider adopting an existing evidence-based social skills training program.\nThough social and emotional development has been given less attention than cognitive gains in the recent literature on ECE and school readiness, the early prevention of externalizing behavior problems is critical for promoting later school and life success. This meta-analytic study suggests that when ECE programs implement intentional interventions focused explicitly on social and emotional development, they can make a difference."}, {"section_title": "Role of funding source", "text": "We are grateful to the following funders of the National Forum on Early Childhood Policy and Programs: the Birth to Five Policy Alliance, the Buffett Early Childhood Fund, Casey Family Programs, the McCormick Tribune Foundation, the Norlien Foundation, Harvard University, and an Anonymous Donor.
