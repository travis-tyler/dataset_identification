Forty-six Connecticut public schools in 35 school districts participated. Over 900 students, or about three percent of the state's public school eighth grade population, completed cognitive tests and student surveys. The student survey requested information about basic demographic background variables and a range of additional topics including schoolwork, aspirations and social relations. Data on test results wili be presented in future bulletins as they become available. During 1990, the same students are again being surveyed and tested as tenth graders. These students will be followed biennially through 1994, as they graduate or leave high school and enter postsecondary education or careers."}, {"section_title": "ONE-THIRD OF CONNECTICUT EIGHTH GRADERS EDUCATIONALLY AT RISK", "text": "About )ne-third (36.3%) of the students were considered educationally at risk, as defined by one or more of 01(7 following: (a) from a single-parent family, (b) with parent(s) having no high school diploma, (c) of limited English proficiency, or (d) being a latchkey child left alone for more than three hours per weekday. The proportion of at-risk students (using the above definition) varies considerably by race. As Table 1 indicates, black and Hispanic students are more likely to have one or more of the identified risk factors. The most commonly occurring risk factor is being part of a single-parent family. Almost one in four of the Connecticut students (23.9%) was from a single-parent family; this is slightly higher than the percentage of students nationwide from single-parent families (22.3%). In Connecticut more than one-half (51.9%) of the black students and 40.9 percent of the Hispanic students were from single-parent families. Additionally, students from single-parent families were more a?t to be in families in the lowest socioeconomic quartile (48%), have NELS test scores in the lowest quartile( 43.2%) and have school grades in the lowest quartile (38.9%). About one in seven of Connecticut students (15.0%) reported being alone more than three hours per day; 8.5 percent had parents with no high school diploma; and less than one percent were of limited English proficienny."}, {"section_title": "SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF EIGHTH GRADERS HAVE REPEATED A GRADE", "text": "Seventeen percent of the Connecticut E ighth graders reported repeating at least one wade.

A large majority (86.5%) of the students indicated they planned to attend public high school following completion of eighth grade. The survey data were accurate, since actual data showed 86.7 percent entered public high school in the tall of 1988. One in 10 students planned to attend priv ate school (7.8% private-religious, and 2.2% private-nonreligious schools) and 3.5 percent didn't know their plans. This is roughly equivalent to students' plans nationwide: 88.1 percent of all eighth graders reported plans to aVend public high school; 9.3 percent private (7.5% religious, 1.8% nonreligious); and 2.5 percent indicated they did not know. In Connecticut, Hispanic and black students were slightly more likely to plan to attend public schools (92.4% and 88.4%, respectively) than white students (85.1%). Students from families with higher socioeconomic status and students whose parents attended college were more likely to plan to attend private high schools than other students.

About one of every five eighth graders in Connecticut (19.4%) and in the nation (20.8%) did no reading which was not part of their schoolwork.

Somewhat more suburban students in Connecticut reported drugs or alcohol as a serious problem than urban or rural Students.

Different behavior-related problems were considered serious t. students depending on the type of district they mare from. Students from urban districts were more likely to identify tardiness, absenteeism, class cutting, physical cooflict, robbery and verbal abuse of teachers as serious problems at their school.

When responses were aggregated, more students fell into a low self-concept category (38%) than either medium (27%) or high (35%). More males were considered to have a high self-concept (39%) than females (31%). By rate, blacks and Hispanics generally felt better about themselves than their white classmates.  Students were asked whether they agreed or disagreed (or strongly agreed or disagreed) with a series of statements about teacher response to their efforts. Black and Hispanic students were more likely than white students to report positive response by teachers (see Figure 9). Interestingly, students from families in the lowest socioeconomic quartile and with the lowest NELS test scores were more likely to hag,e a high self-concept. Conversely, students from families in the highest socioeconomic quartile and w;lh the highest test scores were likely to have low ;:elfconcept. However, school grades were positively correlated with self-concept: those who reported they usually received low grades generally had a low self-concept, while those with high grades felt good about themselves. This suggests that grades received in school were not highly correlated with NELS test performance. Urban students were more likely to have a high self-concept than rural or suburban students. A series of questions asked how much control students felt they had over their lives. About equal numbers of students felt a high external locus of control and a high internal locus of control. The remaining third of the students fell in the middle. There was no significant difference between males and females or by race. Students with low '1st scores, low grades and from families in the lowest socioeconomic quartile generally felt they had a low level of control over what happened to them, while students with high test scores, grades and socioeconomic status felt they had a high level of control over their lives."}, {"section_title": "THE NELS STUDY: BACKGROUND", "text": "In 1988, Connecticut began participation in the NELS study, which is sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics. It is designed to provide statewide trend data about critical transitions experienced by young people as they develop, attend school and embark on careers. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Connecticut State Department of Education funded an augmentation to the national sample so the sample data would be representative of public school students in the state. Like its predecessors, the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NELS-72) and High School and Beyond (HS&B), NELS has been designed to provide information on critical problems facing educators and educational policy makers at all levels. The study includes a cognitive fest battery as well as surveys completed by stuoents and school administrators. The initial focus of the study was on eighth graders and their schools in 1988. Efforts were made to ensure that the sample wouid be similar in composition to that of the state with regard to urban/suburban/rural district and by racial/ethnic group enrollment, and to ensure that the sample would be sufficIently !arge so responses of sample students could be generalized to the state eighth grade public school population. All geographic regions of the state were represented. As with all sampling, however, standard errors were calculated for use in considering the sample values as state population estimates. Only areas of the survey where standard errors were small and/ or differences in responses by subgroup were large are presented in this report. More detailed lformation about student characteristics and test scores, and more detailed comparisons between Connecticut students and students throughout the nation, will be presented in future Research Bulletins as data become available. The sample of Connecticut students had the following characteristics, as self-reported on the student survey. The sample was almost equally divided between males (49.1%) and females (50.9%), and consisted of relatively more minorities (25.4%) than the total state eighth grade public school population (20.9%). Because of small sample sizes, data for Asians and American Indians do not appear as subgroups in this report, but these students are included in totals. The racial composition of the state and NELS samples is shown in  "}]
