The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is an international comparative study designed to measure trends in mathematics and science achievement at the fourth and eighth grades, as well as to collect information about educational contexts (such as students' schools, teachers, and homes) that may be related to student achievement. TIMSS has been administered every 4 years since 1995, with the sixth and most recent administration, in 2015, providing a 20-year trendline. The United States has participated in every administration of TIMSS, which includes 1995TIMSS, which includes , 1999TIMSS, which includes , 2003TIMSS, which includes , 2007TIMSS, which includes , 2011TIMSS, which includes , and 2015 for the eighth grade and all but 1999 for the fourth grade (when it was not administered internationally). TIMSS is designed to align broadly with mathematics and science curricula in the participating education systems and, therefore, to reflect students' school-based learning. Because it is an international study, TIMSS provides valuable benchmarking information on how U.S. students compare to students around the world. What is TIMSS Advanced? TIMSS Advanced is an international comparative study designed to measure the advanced mathematics and physics achievement of students in their final year of high school who are taking or have taken advanced courses. TIMSS Advanced also collects information about educational contexts (such as schools and teachers) that may be related to advanced students' achievement. TIMSS Advanced was administered previously, in 1995 and in 2008, and most recently in 2015. The United States participated in the 1995 and 2015 administrations. Like TIMSS, TIMSS Advanced is designed to align broadly with curricula in the participating education systems and, therefore, to reflect students' school-based learning of advanced mathematics and physics. TIMSS Advanced can inform policymakers, researchers, educators, and the public about the degree to which students in the United States excel in advanced mathematics and physics and may be prepared to undertake more specialized study in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics compared to their international peers. TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced are both sponsored by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) and conducted, in the United States, by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the Institute of Education Sciences within the U.S. Department of Education. This report focuses on the U.S. results in an international context. For additional results and information, see the accompanying resources available at http://nces.ed.gov/ timss/, including more detailed descriptions of the assessments, key findings, data tables of results, and technical notes. An abbreviated version of the technical notes is provided in the appendix to this report. A New Approach to Reporting TIMSS results are now easier than ever to access, with tables, figures, reports, and more available on the TIMSS 2015 website, at http://nces.ed.gov/ timss/. The results from TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced 2015 that are highlighted in this report can be explored in more detail at the site above, or by using the International Data Explorer at http:// nces.ed.gov/surveys/ international/ide/ to create customized tables and charts using international data.

Which countries participated in TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced? A large and diverse group of education systems, spanning six of the world's continents, participated in TIMSS 2015 (see table 2). These education systems included 49 IEA member countries and six benchmarking participants 1 that participated in the fourth-grade assessment and 38 IEA member countries and six benchmarking participants that participated in the eighth-grade assessment. Nine education systems-all IEA member countries-participated in TIMSS Advanced 2015. 1 IEA member countries include both \"countries,\" which are complete, independent political entities, and non-national entities (e.g., England, Hong Kong, or the Flemish community of Belgium). Non-national entities are indicated in the tables and figures with the three-letter international abbreviation for their country following their name. Non-national entities that are not IEA member countries (e.g., Abu Dhabi or Buenos Aires) also may participate in TIMSS in order to assess their comparative international standing, and they are designated as \"benchmarking participants.\" Benchmarking participants are included in figures and indicated by italics. One U.S. state (Florida) administered TIMSS as a benchmarking participant. For convenience, this report uses the generic term \"education systems\" when summarizing results. For additional background on terminology, see the textbox in the \"About TIMSS 2015\" description available on the NCES website at http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss15.asp.  How are results reported in TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced? TIMSS results are based on nationally representative samples of fourth-and eighth-grade students. TIMSS Advanced results are based on nationally representative samples of students in their final year of secondary school who are taking or have taken either advanced mathematics or physics courses; in the United States, the samples consist of twelfth-grade students. Advanced mathematics and physics courses are defined as those that cover most of the topics outlined in the respective frameworks."}, {"section_title": "Scale scores and percentiles", "text": "Both TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced achievement results are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with a fixed scale centerpoint of 500 2 and a standard deviation of 100. 3 TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced provide average overall scale scores for mathematics and science (in the case of TIMSS) and advanced mathematics and physics (in the case of TIMSS Advanced), as well as subscale scores for the content and cognitive domains. This report focuses on the overall scales. Additionally, the report presents the distribution of student achievement-identifying the threshold (or cut) scores along the scale that correspond to the lowest 10 percent, lowest quarter, highest quarter, and top 10 percent of students (i.e., the 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles)."}, {"section_title": "International benchmarks", "text": "TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced international benchmarks provide a way to interpret the scale scores and to understand how students' proficiency varies at different points on the scales.

In each administration, the framework is reviewed and updated to reflect developments in the field and in curricula, while at the same time ensuring comparability in sampling procedures and assessment items so that TIMSS results can be placed on the same scale and compared across time. Additionally, each successive administration of TIMSS since 1995 has been scaled so that the mean of the achievement distribution is 500, as it was originally set in 1995, and thus comparable across years. This report compares the 2015 results with those from all previous TIMSS assessment years, including-for a long-term perspective-the first TIMSS assessment in 1995. TIMSS Advanced has been administered two times since the first assessment in 1995: in 2008 and 2015. However, the frameworks and sampling procedures changed after the first administration and thus this report focuses mainly on the results from 2015. Some data are provided-with cautions about their interpretation-about differences in performance between 1995 and 2015. (The United States did not participate in TIMSS Advanced 2008.) 2 The TIMSS scale centerpoint is referred to as the \"TIMSS scale average\" in previous reports. 3 All differences referenced in the text were tested using t tests and are significant at the .05 level.

U.S. fourth-and eighth-grade students have, on average, shown long-term improvement on the TIMSS mathematics assessments. Between 1995 and 2015, U.S. fourth-graders' average mathematics scores increased from 518 to 539 points (figure 2a, middle line). The fourth-grade average mathematics score in 2015 was also higher than in 2003 and 2007, but not measurably different from the most recent assessment in 2011. Improvements in fourth-graders' mathematics scores were seen across the distribution of achievement over these 20 years. This is observed by examining the threshold (or cut) scores for the lowest 10 percent, lowest quarter, highest quarter, and highest 10 percent of students (i.e., at the 10th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles). In 2015, the mathematics cut scores of students at all of the selected percentiles were higher than in 1995 and 2003, and the cut scores of higher-performing students (i.e., at the 75th and 95th percentiles) were also higher than in 2007 (figure 2a). However, the mathematics cut score of students at the 25th percentile was lower in 2015 than in 2011.  25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles: 1995, 2003, 2007, 2011 1995, 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015. MATHEMATICS U.S. eighth-graders' average mathematics score also increased between 1995 and 2015 from 492 to 518 points (figure 2b, middle line). The eighth-grade average mathematics score in 2015 was higher than in any prior administration of TIMSS (1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, or 2011). This was also true for students at the 75th percentile, for whom the 2015 mathematics cut score was higher than in any prior administration (figure 2b). The cut score of the highestperforming students (i.e., at the 90th percentile) in 2015 was higher than those in most prior administrations (1995, 2003, 2007, and 2011). However, among lower-performing students (i.e., at the 10th and 25th percentiles), there was no measurable difference from 2007 or 2011 to 2015, though the cut scores for the lower-performing students were higher in 2015 than in 1995 and 1999.

TIMSS defines four levels of student achievement, referred to as international benchmarks: Advanced, High, Intermediate, and Low. These international benchmarks provide a way to understand how students' proficiency in mathematics varies at different points on the TIMSS scale. Exhibit 1 describes what kinds of knowledge and skills students at each level would need to successfully answer the mathematics items at that level, as well as the score cutpoint for each level. (See chapter 2 of the international report, referenced below the exhibit, for example items at each level.) High 550Students can apply their knowledge and understanding to solve problems. They can solve word problems involving operations with whole numbers, simple fractions, and two-place decimals. Students demonstrate an understanding of geometric properties of shapes and angles that are less than or greater than a right angle. Students can interpret and use data in tables and a variety of graphs to solve problems. Students can apply their understanding and knowledge in a variety of relatively complex situations. They can use information to solve problems involving different types of numbers and operations. Students at this level show basic procedural knowledge related to algebraic expressions. They can solve a variety of problems with angles including those involving triangles, parallel lines, rectangles, and similar figures. Students can interpret data in a variety of graphs and solve simple problems involving outcomes and probabilities.\nIn 2015, at both the fourth and eighth grades, higher percentages of U.S. students reached each of the four TIMSS international benchmarks in mathematics than the international medians (figures 3a and 3b). 4 At the fourth grade, 14 percent of U.S. students reached the Advanced international benchmark in mathematics, 47 percent reached the High benchmark, 79 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark, and 95 percent reached the Low benchmark (figure 3a). At the eighth grade, 10 percent of U.S. students reached the Advanced international benchmark in mathematics, 37 percent reached the High benchmark, 70 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark, and 91 percent reached the Low benchmark (figure 3b). The percentage of fourth-graders who reached the Advanced international benchmark in mathematics was higher than the United States in 7 education systems; was not measurably different from the United States in 8 education systems; and was lower than the United States in 38 education systems. Singapore, Hong Kong-CHN, the Republic of Korea, Chinese Taipei-CHN, Japan, Northern Ireland-GBR, and the Russian Federation had higher percentages of students who reached the Advanced international benchmark in mathematics than the United States at the fourth grade. England-GBR, Kazakhstan, Florida-USA, Ireland, Norway, Hungary, Portugal, and Denmark had percentages that were not measurably different from the U.S. percentage. The percentage of eighth-graders who reached the Advanced international benchmark in mathematics was higher than the United States in 8 education systems; was not measurably different from the United States in 5 education systems; and was lower than the United States in 29 education systems. Singapore, Chinese Taipei-CHN, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong-CHN, Japan, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Israel had higher percentages of students who reached the Advanced international benchmark in mathematics than the United States at the eighth grade.

Five percent of U.S. advanced twelfth-graders reached the Advanced international benchmark in physics, 18 percent reached the High benchmark, and 39 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark. Higher percentages of students in Norway, the Russian Federation, and Slovenia reached each of the three international benchmarks in physics than in the United States. In three education systems-France, Italy, and Lebanon-lower percentages of students reached each international benchmark than the United States. 9 The international median is the median percentage for all IEA member countries (see table 2 for IEA member countries). Thus, the international median at each benchmark represents the percentage at which half of the participating IEA member countries have that percentage of students at or above the median and half have that percentage of students below the median. For example, the Intermediate international benchmark median of 46 percent indicates that half of the countries have 46 percent or more of their students who met the Intermediate benchmark, and half have less than 46 percent of their students who met the Intermediate benchmark.

In the United States, males scored 500 points, on average, in advanced mathematics, compared to 470 points for females ( figure 17a). This 30-percentage-point difference was at the high end of the range of male-female differences across education systems, which otherwise ranged from 9 percentage points in the Russian Federation to 27 percentage points in Slovenia-all favoring males. In three education systems (Italy, Lebanon, and Portugal), there were no measurable male-female differences in average advanced mathematics scores. U.S. males' average advanced mathematics score was higher than males' scores in six education systems (France, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, and Sweden), but lower than males' scores in Lebanon and in intensive courses in the Russian Federation. U.S. females' average advanced mathematics score was higher than females' scores in five education systems (France, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, and Sweden), but again lower than females' scores in Lebanon and in intensive courses in the Russian Federation.  In the United States and all other education systems except Lebanon, males scored higher than females, on average, in physics (figure 17b). In the United States, males scored 455 points in physics, compared to 409 points for females. This 46-percentage-point difference was again at the high end of the range of male-female differences across education systems, which otherwise ranged from 11 percentage points in Sweden to 35 percentage points in France. U.S. males' average physics score was higher than males' scores in France, Italy, and Lebanon, but lower than males' scores in Norway, the Russian Federation, and Slovenia. U.S. females' average physics score was higher than females' scores in France and Italy, but lower than females' scores in five education systems (Norway, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Slovenia, and Sweden).  TIMSS Advanced required participating countries and other education systems to draw probability samples of students in their final year of secondary school-ISCED Level 3-who were taking or had taken courses in advanced mathematics or who were taking or had taken courses in physics. In the United States, two samples of twelfth-graders were drawn to represent the nation-one for advanced mathematics and one for physics. (For additional information on ISCED levels, see http://www.uis. unesco.org/Education/Pages/international-standard-classification-of-education.aspx.) The courses that define the target populations had to cover most, if not all, of the advanced mathematics and physics topics that were outlined in the assessment frameworks. In the United States, this was defined as a calculus course for eligibility for the advanced mathematics population and an advanced physics course, such as Advanced Placement (AP) physics, for the physics population. The U.S. national samples included both public and private schools, randomly selected and weighted to be representative of the nation's advanced mathematics and physics students at the end of high school. (See the section on sampling weights and standard errors in this report for definitions.) In total, the U.S. national sample in 2015 consisted of 241 schools for advanced mathematics and 165 schools for physics (of the original sample of 348 schools for both subjects). The weighted school response rate for the United States for advanced mathematics was 72 percent before the use of substitute schools and 76 percent with the inclusion of substitute schools. The weighted school response rate for the United States for physics was 65 percent before the use of substitute schools and 68 percent with the inclusion of substitute schools. In terms of the number of students, the U.S. national sample consisted of 2,954 students in advanced mathematics and 2,932 students in physics. The weighted student response rate was 87 percent for advanced mathematics and 85 percent for physics. Student response rates are based on a combined total of students from both sampled and substitute schools. As indicated by footnotes in the cross-education system figures in this report, there were sampling or other issues in the United States and a number of education systems. For the current administration, these specific issues are detailed in table A1. For earlier administrations, these specific issues are detailed in table A2. Additionally, as required by NCES standards, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted because the U.S. school-level response rate for TIMSS at grades 4 and 8 and for both subjects in TIMSS Advanced fell below 85 percent of the sampled schools. The purpose of the analysis was to examine whether the participation status of schools was related to various characteristics and thus introduced the potential for bias in the results. The results suggested that there is some potential for nonresponse bias in the U.S. samples for grades 4 and 8 (prior to substitution) based on the characteristics studied. It also suggested that, while there was some evidence that the use of substitute schools at grade 4 reduced the potential for bias, it did not reduce it substantially. At grade 8, the use of substitute schools did not reduce the potential for bias nor did it add to it substantially. However, after the application of school nonresponse adjustments, there was no evidence of resulting potential bias in the final sample in either grade. Analyses of TIMSS Advanced suggest that there is little potential for nonresponse bias in the advanced mathematics sample based on the characteristics studied. It also suggests that, while there is some evidence that the use of substitute schools has not reduced the potential for bias, it has not added to it substantially. Moreover, after the application of school nonresponse adjustments, there is little evidence of resulting potential bias in the final sample. In physics, however, the results suggest that there is some potential for nonresponse bias in the sample based on the characteristics studied. It also suggests that, while there is some evidence that the use of substitute schools reduced the potential for bias, it has not reduced it substantially. Moreover, after the application of school nonresponse adjustments, there is some evidence of resulting potential bias in the final sample with the largest bias in locale.

Adjusted survey weights adjust for the probabilities of selection for individual schools and classrooms and for school or student nonresponse. As with any study, there are limitations that should be taken into consideration. Estimates produced using data from TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced 2015 are subject to two types of error: nonsampling errors and sampling errors. The sources of nonsampling errors are typically problems such as unit and item nonresponse, the differences in respondents' interpretations of the meaning of survey questions, and mistakes in data preparation. Sampling errors arise when a sample of the population, rather than the whole population, is used to estimate some statistic. Different samples from the same population would likely produce somewhat different estimates of the statistic in question. This uncertainty is referred to as sampling variance and is usually expressed as the standard error of a statistic estimated from sample data.
