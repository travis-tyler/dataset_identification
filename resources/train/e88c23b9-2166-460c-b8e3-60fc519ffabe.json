A cross-sectional study was conducted to test the hypothesis that behavioral processes and the interaction between the processes of change (POC) would predict physical activity (PA). To be eligible for the study participants had to be French speaking adults who documented their birthdate confirming that they were 18 years or older . Three hundred and ninety-four (n \u00bc 394) participants (mean age of 35, 62% female) completed Processes of Change, Stages of Change, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaires. Analysis of Covariance and multiple regression was used to analyze data. Results showed that only behavioral POC was a significant predictor of total PA (b \u00bc 0.261; p < 0.001) and vigorous PA (b \u00bc 0.297; p < 0.001). The authors concluded that behavioral processes are more strongly related to PA level than are experiential processes.

Sources evaluated include spouse, son, daughter, sibling, neighbor, church member, and friend. Regarding size of social network, participants were asked, ''In general, how many close friends do you have?'' Multivariable linear regression was used. After adjustment, there was no evidence of an association between the size of social support network and sedentary behavior. Spousal social support was associated with less sedentary behavior (b \u00bc 11.6; 95% confidence interval: 20.7 to 2.5), with evidence to suggest that this was only true for men. Further, an inverse association was observed between household size and sedentary behavior, with those having a greater number of individuals in the house having lower levels of sedentary behavior. These associations occurred independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, age, gender, race-ethnicity, measured body mass index, total cholesterol, self-reported smoking status, and physician diagnosis of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, cancer, hypertension, or diabetes.\nAmanda K.

Data were extracted from Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science between January 2005 and December 2015. Inclusion criteria were work site interventions, published in peer-reviewed journals, employing environmental modalities, targeting sedentary behavior, and using any quantitative design. Exclusion criteria were noninterventions and non-English publications. Data extracted included study design, population, intervention dosage, intervention activities, evaluation measures, and intervention effects. Data were tabulated quantitatively and synthesized qualitatively. A total of 15 articles were identified for review and 14 reported statistically significant decreases in sedentary behavior. Most studies employed a randomized controlled trial design (n \u00bc 7), used inclinometers to measure sedentary behavior (n \u00bc 9), recruited predominantly female samples (n \u00bc 15), and utilized sit-to-stand desks as the primary intervention modality (n \u00bc 10). The mean methodological quality score was 6.2 out of 10. Environmental work site interventions to reduce sedentary behavior show promise because work sites often have more control over environmental factors.\nStephen J. Hile Matthew B. Feldman Amanda R.

Participants included 42 individuals who had participated in The Positive Life Workshop-an HIV self-management intervention adapted and implemented by the NYC DOHMH. Purposive sampling was used to recruit study participants. The participants reported that relationships with family, a responsibility to protect others from HIV, and faith/spirituality supported the maintenance of health-promoting behaviors. Barriers to behavior maintenance included substance use and mental health issues. Meeting in small groups was also highlighted as a motivator to sustaining health behaviors, particularly in decreasing isolation and receiving affirmation from others. The authors concluded that the factors identified could be incorporated into an intervention to support HIV-related health-promoting behavior maintenance that could supplement existing HIV self-management interventions. "}, {"section_title": "Emotional Health", "text": "Forgiveness Working: Forgiveness, Health, and Productivity in the Workplace Two studies were conducted with the purposes of exploring the associations between forgiveness and perceived occupational outcomes (Study 1) and elaborating on the role of trait forgiveness and interpersonal stress as a possible mediator between trait forgiveness and work/health outcomes (Study 2). One hundred and eight (n \u00bc 108) employees and one hundred and fifty-four (n \u00bc 154) employees participated in study 1 and 2 respectively. Measures included data from the TransgressionRelated Interpersonal Motivations Inventory (TRIM), self-reports on workplace variables, the Heartland Forgiveness Scale (HFS) and an adapted version of the Interpersonal Stress Scale. Bivariate and multiple correlation/regression and structural equation models were used to analyze data. Results showed that forgiveness of a specific workplace offense was associated with higher productivity (r \u00bc .35, p < .001) and trait forgiveness was associated with higher productivity (b \u00bc .20, p \u00bc .016). The authors concluded that forgiveness can partly be associated with healthy outcomes. Since data collected from self-reports generalizability of results is limited. In this study, the authors used a prospective cohort study approach by analyzing the 2005 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to examine whether meeting sleep guidelines (7-9 hours/night) is associated with better health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and reduced all-cause mortality risk. Subjects included a total of 13 423 adults. A Cox proportional hazard regression and ordinal logistic regression were used to determine association. The results showed that after adjusting for age, gender, race-ethnicity, body mass index, education, smoking, white blood cell level, iron level, red blood cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, blood pressure, diabetes, coronary artery disease, physical activity, and depression, those meeting sleep guidelines had an 19% reduced risk of premature all-cause mortality (hazard ratio \u00bc 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.99; P \u00bc 0.04). After adjustments, those meeting sleep guidelines had better HRQOL (b\u00bc \u00c00.30; 95% CI: \u00c00.38 to \u00c00.21; P < 0.001). Results for the ordinal regression and Cox proportional analyses were similar in unadjusted and minimally adjusted models. Based on their findings, the authors concluded that obtaining optimal levels of sleep is associated with better HRQOL and reduced premature mortality risk, independent of demographic, behavioral, and biological conditions. These findings underscore the importance of achieving optimal levels of sleep. The purpose of the current work was to clarify levels of public support for required water access in schools and parks and perceived safety and taste of water in these settings to inform efforts to increase access to and consumption of tap water. A random telephone survey involving 1218 respondents from across 46 states was employed to obtain assessments of perceived safety and taste of water in schools and parks as well as support for required access to water in these settings. Results indicated that there was broad support for required access to water throughout the day in schools and parks while most participants believed water was safe in schools or parks. The authors conclude that there is evidence of public support for efforts to increase access to drinking water in schools and parks, including the perception that there are high levels of perceived taste and safety of water provided in these settings. . Every 1-meal/week increase in fast-food and sit-down restaurant consumption was associated with an increase in BMI by 0.8 and 0.6 kg/m 2 , respectively. Unavailability of healthy foods at shopping and eating venues and lack of cooking skills were both positively associated with consumption of fast-food and sit-down meals. Individuals who described their diet as healthy, who avoided high-fat foods, and who believed their diet was keeping their weight controlled did not visit these restaurants frequently. The authors concluded that obesity prevention efforts in non-large metro Wisconsin communities should consider socioeconomic/environmental and nutritional attitudes/behavior of residents when designing restaurant-based or community education interventions. This paper examines differences in students' access to school salad bars across sociodemographic groups and changes in availability over time. Nationally representative 2011 and 2014 YouthStyles surveys were used. 833 (2011) and 994 (2014) US youth aged 12 to 17 years were in the study.The major measure was youth-reported availability of school salad bars. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess differences in school salad bar availability by socio-demographics and changes in availability from 2011 to 2014. Youth-reported salad bar availability differed by age in 2011 and race/ethnicity in 2014, but not by sex, income, metropolitan residence, or region in either year. Salad bars were reported by 62% of youth in 2011 and 67% in 2014; the increase was not statistically significant (P \u00bc .07). Significant increases from 2011 to 2014 were noted among youth aged 12 to 14 years (56%-69%; P < .01), youth of non-Hispanic other races (60%-85%; P < .01), and youth in the Midwest (58%-72%; P \u00bc .01). These results suggest that youth-reported access to school salad bars does not differ significantly across most sociodemographic groups. The authors sought to determine the prevalence and correlates of missing meals among adolescents across the United States by conducted secondary analyses of an existing survey from 2010. The sample included 11,429 high school students and focused on frequency of consumption of breakfast, lunch, and dinner consumption; demographics; measured and perceived weight status; physical activity and sedentary behaviors; and fruit, vegetable, milk, sugar-sweetened beverage, and fast-food intake. Prevalence estimates for missing breakfast, lunch, or dinner on !1 day during the past 7 days were calculated. Associations between demographics and missing meals were tested as well as of lifestyle and dietary behaviors. The results revealed that of those participating in 2010, 63.1% of students missed breakfast, 38.2% missed lunch, and 23.3% missed dinner; the prevalence was highest among female and non-Hispanic black students. Being overweight/obese, perceiving oneself to be overweight, and video game/computer use were associated with increased risk of missing meals. Physical activity behaviors were associated with reduced risk of missing meals. They argue that, given limited resources, it would be useful for interventions and messages to target these specific atrisk groups and since missing breakfast was associated with the greatest number of less healthy dietary prac-tices, intervention and education efforts might prioritizebreakfast consumption. Over 2,100 (n \u00bc 2,101) adults employed outside the home were surveyed with the purpose of examining workplace food and physical activity environments and wellness culture. The survey contained demographic items on food environment, wellness, and physical activity. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests were used to analyze data. Results showed: (1) almost 20% (19.6%) reported that their employer provides opportunities to eat a health diet; (2) of those reporting accessibility to either a food or vending machine approximately 65% reported few or no healthy items for sale.; (3) 31% felt that their employer provided opportunities to be physically active; and (4) 53.2% of those employed by larger employers reported that worksite health promotion programs were available compared to 18.1% of those employed by smaller employers. The authors concluded that supports for healthy eating, physical activity, and wellness program supports were consistently reported more frequently among employees of larger employers than smaller employers. Since only perceptions of the presence of worksite supports were measured generalizability is not possible. ) was analyzed used to assess the cumulative effect of socio-ecological factors on (1) objectively measured physical activity, (2) the cumulative socio-ecological risk on all-cause mortality and (3) the potential interaction effects of social risk factor on physical activity and mortality and whether physical activity mediates the relationship between social risk and mortality. Negative binominal regression and Cox Proportional Hazard Model was used to analyze data. Results showed those with 1 and 2 or more risk factors engaged in 11% and 10% less MVPA respectively. Also, those with 2\u00fe social risk factors had a 2.3 fold increase in mortality risk. The authors concluded that cumulative social risk is associated with less MVPA. Since this was a cross-sectional study generalizability is limited. In this study, the authors used a randomized controlled pilot study to assess the feasibility of measuring changes in gene expression associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment using emotional freedom techniques (EFT). Participants were sixteen veterans with clinical levels of PTSD symptoms randomized into an EFT group receiving EFT and treatment as usual (TAU) throughout a 10-week intervention period and a group receiving only TAU during the intervention period and then receiving EFT in a community clinic and a research institute in California. Pre-, posttreatment, and follow-up mean scores on questionnaires were assessed using repeated measures 1-way analysis of variance. Student t-test and post hoc analyses were performed on gene expression data. The results indicated that PTSD symptoms declined significantly in the EFT group (\u00c053%, P < 0.0001). Participants maintained their gains on follow-up. Significant differential expression of 6 genes was found (P < 0.05) when comparing the expression levels before and after the intervention period in participants receiving EFT. The authors concluded that candidate gene expression's correlation of successful PTSD treatment provide guidelines for the design of further studies aimed at exploring the epigenetic effects of EFT. The authors sought to explore the location and extent of exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among nonsmokers, seven years after a statewide smoke-free policy. The data were collected statewide using a random digit dial telephone survey. The final sample included 7,887 nonsmoking adults who provided information regarding locations of SHS exposure and opinions on smoke-free restrictions. Overall, the results indicated that 35.5% of nonsmokers reported SHS exposure in the past 7 days with the greatest proportions of exposure in community settings followed distantly by cars (6.9%) or in the home. Young adults reported they were more likely to be exposed in a home or car than older adults. Nonsmokers living with a smoker have far greater exposure levels. The authors conclude that significant levels of SHS exposure continues after comprehensive smokefree policies restrict it from public places. The majority of men were current smokers (n \u00bc 46) and were interested in reducing and/or quitting. The three hour focus groups involved asking semi-structured, open-ended questions on perceived benefits of quitting smoking, motivators for changing smoking behaviors, the usefulness of various strategies to support cessation and suggestions for designing smoking cessation resources. All sessions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and using coding frameworks to identify themes. Results showed four interconnected themes: the fight to quit takes several rounds; the motivation of supportive competition; challenges and benefits of smoke-free peers and financial gains. The authors concluded that gain-famed and benefit-focused messaging should be considered in men's tobacco cessation. A key limitation is the small sample size making generalizability difficult. This study used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) guided message design and evaluation for focus group-tested messages that were adapted to the context of complying with a tobacco-free policy to detail the persuasive message development for a theory-based campaign designed to increase compliance with a university's tobacco-free policy. Participants were undergraduate focus group participants (n \u00bc 65), mostly male (69%), white (82%), and freshman (62%) who smoked at least 1 cigarette in the last 30 days; on-campus smoking percentages were never/rare (60%), occasionally (23%), and often/frequently (16%). The analysis used a theoretical thematic approach to identify how the TPB constructs related to perceptions of message effectiveness. The results showed that participants responded favorably to attitudinal strategies about health, respect, and university figures and they rejected approaches they considered juvenile and offensive. They also discussed the impact of noncompliance and avoiding overgeneralized statements for addressing subjective norms, suggesting shortening text, adjusting picture location, and emphasizing the importance of compliance to increase perceptions of behavioral control. The authors concluded that their results offer health promotion suggestions for designing messages aimed at improving undergraduate smokers' willingness to comply with tobacco-free campus policies."}, {"section_title": "Kelvin Choi Naomi Taylor Jean Forster 153", "text": "Smoking Control Sources and Number of Coupons for Cigarettes and Snus Received by a Cohort of Young Adults Data from participants (n \u00bc 2384) in the Minnesota Adolescent Community Cohort (MACC) study was used to examine the sources of tobacco use coupons and their influence on susceptibility to use of snus. Variables included demographics, tobacco behaviors, exposure to advertisements and receipt of coupon(s), or gift(s) for tobacco products in the past 6 months. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the associations between demographics, smoking status, snus, and e-cigarette use and receipt of coupons. Results showed 11% received coupons for cigarettes, 5% for snus, 3% for smokeless tobacco products. Racial/ethnic minority young adults received more cigarette and snus coupons (p < 0.05) and snus coupons was positively associated with susceptibility to snus use (p < 0.05).

The data included a nationally representative sample of 19,395 low-income US households from 2005 through 2012. A maximum likelihood model was used to predict the probability of smoking given participation in SNAP. The results indicated that SNAP participation among low-income households was associated with a 30% (P < 0.01) increase in the likelihood of a household containing at least 1 smoker, relative to low-income non-SNAP households. Among smokers, SNAP households do not spend more money on tobacco products than non-SNAP households. Based on their findings, the authors concluded that connecting program participants who smoke to effective smoking cessation programs could be an effective tool in reducing the prevalence of smoking among the low-income population. States have a unique opportunity to use SNAP-Education programs to integrate tobacco prevention and cessation into curriculum for direct client impact. The authors used a randomized trial to test the effects of employer subsidies on employee enrollment, attendance, and weight loss in a nationally available weight management program. The subsidies included 100%; 80%, 50%, and a hybrid 50% subsidy that could become a 100% subsidy by attaining attendance targets. Participants included 23,023 employees of 2 US companies. The results showed that enrollment differed significantly by subsidy level (P < 0.0001). The 100% subsidy produced the highest enrollment (7.7%), significantly higher than each of the lower subsidies (vs 80% subsidy: 6.2%, P \u00bc 0.002; vs 50% subsidy: 3.9%, P < 0.0001; vs hybrid: 3.7%, P < 0.0001). Enrollment in the 80% subsidy group was significantly higher than both lower subsidy groups (vs 50% subsidy: 3.9%, P < 0.0001; vs hybrid: 3.7%, P < 0.0001). Among enrollees, there were no differences among the 4 groups in attendance or weight loss. Based on their findings, the authors concluded that this pragmatic trial, conducted in a real-world workplace setting, suggests that higher rates of employer subsidization help individuals to enroll in weight loss programs, without a decrement in program effectiveness. Future research could explore the cost-effectiveness of such subsidies or alternative designs. This paper examined the concurrent relationship between obesity incidence and normal weight status incidence and pre-valence in children between 9 months and kindergarten. The paper used multistage, probability samples from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth cohort. This is a representative sample of US preschool children (n \u00bc 9950) followed from birth through kindergarten. From direct, anthropometric measures, the study reported prevalence and incidence rates across 4 follow-up periods. In addition to prevalence and incidence rates, we reported risk ratios based on multiple definitions and estimated predicted probabilities of obesity and normal weight status using clinically meaningful body mass index (BMI)-for-age percentiles. Obesity prevalence (13%-20%) was much smaller than normal weight status prevalence (66%-70%). Lower socio-economic status, Hispanic, and nonHispanic black children had greater risk of obesity. During 9 months to kindergarten, obesity incidence decreased two-thirds (15.6%), while normal weight status incidence decreased almost one-half (44.6%). Coincidently, normal weight status incidence (ranged from 23% to 45%) was consistently and substantially higher than obesity incidence (ranged from 5% to 15%). During 4 years to kindergarten, the obesity risk for overweight children was 13 times higher than that for normal weight status children. This mansucript sought to examine the characteristics of voluntary online commitment contracts that may be associated with greater weight loss. The authors conducted retrospective analysis of weight loss commitment contracts derived from a company that provides web-based support for personal commitment contracts. They examined whether whether percentage weight loss differed between participants who incentivized their contract using monetary deposits and those who did not among 3,857 participants who voluntarily signed up online in 2013 for a weight loss contract in which they specified their own weight loss goal, time period, and self-reported weekly weight. Deposits were could be made to 3 categories: charity, anticharity (a nonprofit one does not like), or donations made to a friend. The results indicated that controlling for several participant and contract characteristics, contracts with anticharity, charity, and friend deposits had greater reported weight loss than nonincentivized contracts and those without a weight verification requirement claimed more weight loss than those with verification. The authors caution that it is not clear whether those who choose to use monetary incentives reported more weight loss.

Participants were 21,479 college students from forty-four distinct campuses. Data were analyzed by conducting both independent samples t-tests and a multiple regression model. The results indicated that participants who reached legal intoxication used PBS less frequently (P < 0.001; d \u00bc 0.80). Frequency of PBS use had the strongest unique contribution to the regression model (b \u00bc \u00c00.315, P < 0.001), such that participants with higher BAC reported less frequent use of PBS. Based on these results, the authors concluded that interventions should seek to develop strategies that encourage college student use of PBS prior to, and during drinking episodes. More frequent use of PBS can reduce intoxication as well as occurrence of alcohol-associated consequences.
