[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Oregon's coastal wetlands, estuaries and forest lands are some of the most beautiful, yet threatened, landscapes in the state. These fragile areas provide critical habitat for many of Oregon's most at-risk species that include coho salmon, brown pelicans, bald eagles, marbled murrelets, sea-run cutthroat trout, and steelhead. While the Yaquina Estuary and watershed have been identified previously as an important conservation area, limited information is available about specific opportunities, threats, targets, or actions and methods needed to address conservation needs. Since 1989, the Yaquina Estuary has been identified as a priority conservation area in more than ten federal, state, and local agency and non-profit fish, wildlife, and wetland assessments and prioritizations. In addition to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's State Wildlife Action Plan, three other state agencies (Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, Oregon Department of State Parks, Department of State Lands) have funding programs that support natural area protection, conservation and restoration within the Yaquina watershed. The MidCoast Watersheds Council's \"Yaquina River Basin Estuarine Wetland Site Prioritization\" was the basis for several property acquisitions by The Wetlands Conservancy. Despite these important efforts, there is still a shortage of information about specific opportunities, threats, targets, or actions and methods to address estuary processes and related conservation needs. The Yaquina Estuary Conservation Plan provides an estuary-focused framework and recommendations for successful conservation. This larger-context analysis prioritizes conservation needs and opportunities for the Lower Yaquina watershed from an ecological perspective, and promotes selection of acquisition and restoration projects that will improve basin-wide watershed and estuary processes, functions, and restoration opportunities. While previous plans for the estuary have focused mostly on water quality and fish, the Yaquina Estuary Conservation Plan provides an ecologically-based landscape analysis of lands currently under conservation, an analysis of estuary processes and functions, and detailed recommendations for future conservation actions within the Lower Yaquina watershed. Brophy (1999Brophy ( , 2004Brophy ( , 2007 reviewed previous work in the Yaquina Estuary, and focused on prioritization of important tidal wetlands, as well as the design, implementation, and monitoring of restoration and reference sites. Lee and Brown (2009) compared characteristics of 103 estuaries in Washington, Oregon, and northern California, and created new datasets for the Yaquina on hydrodynamics, water quality, water chemistry, and distributional data for native and exotic seagrasses and macroalgae."}, {"section_title": "Previous work", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Future plans", "text": "The Yaquina Estuary Conservation Plan is Phase 1 of a long term, multi-partner effort to conserve and restore the lower Yaquina Estuary.

(2008): identification of key ecological processes, measures of indicators that best represent these processes, and threats to processes. The framework enables monitoring of estuary health and responses to restoration and conservation activities in the basin. We compiled available information on various measures of ecological processes in the estuary and watershed, and present the findings by theme June 2011 in this report and the accompanying Yaquina Estuary Conservation Plan Atlas. The Atlas conveys visually the many factors that affect the health and viability of the estuary. Although we focus on the tidal portion of the estuary, some of our analyses are done at sub-watershed scales in order to illustrate basin-wide influences on certain key ecological processes. The Atlas can be downloaded from: http://twc.oregonwetlands.net/index.php/publications/yaquinaestuary Atlas maps are organized into themes, using Aldous et al. (2008) as a framework: \"Estuary study area\" frequently appears as a backdrop on many of the maps in the Atlas. The outline of the study area includes all current and former tidally-influenced areas, and adjoining floodplains. The \"estuary study area\" also includes non-developed areas below 15 feet elevation that may be subject to tidal influence in the future, given projections for sea level rise. It does not include former estuarine areas that have been converted to upland and deemed to be irreversibly altered because of intensive infrastructure. The outline of the study area is primarily used as a backdrop, but occasionally it is used to derive summary statistics."}, {"section_title": "Use of Indicators", "text": "Indicators quantify ecological processes. We mapped indicators proposed by Aldous et al. (2008), often at the scale of sixth-field watersheds (HUC6).

For each theme in the report and Atlas, we provide a brief overview of why it is a key component of estuary health, and we summarize methods and findings for the study area."}, {"section_title": "EXISTING CONDITIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Biophysical and Land Management Context (Map Series CXT)", "text": "The 252-square mile Yaquina watershed is divided into three 10 th -field watersheds and eleven 12 th field watersheds (Map CXT-1). Big Elk Creek and Upper Yaquina River, which converge at Elk City, provide about two-thirds of the freshwater input into the estuary. Most of the basin receives between 60 and 70 inches of annual precipitation, and marine sedimentary lithology dominates the watershed (MAP CXT-2). The Yaquina Estuary shows a clear salinity gradient extending from its mouth to its major river tributaries (MAP CXT-3). In winter, when elevated seasonal precipitation causes high freshwater inputs, mesosaline to euhaline water extends only to Boone and Nute Sloughs. In contrast, reduced summer precipitation allows saline water to penetrate upriver well beyond Toledo. Tidal influence extends upstream of Elk City, with minor salinity observed to head of tide (MAP CXT-3), but no salt marshes, swamps, mudflats, or tidallyinfluenced wetlands have been observed upstream of Elk City. Thirty species of conservation concern occur in the Yaquina Basin (Appendix A). Taxa include one amphibian, seven birds, one bryophyte, four fish, four fungi, four invertebrates, one mammal, one marine alga, and seven vascular plants. Five taxa are federally-listed, and six are state-listed. Of the 30 species of conservation concern, six (green sturgeon, chum salmon, coho salmon, steelhead, Gmelin's saltbush, and Point Reyes bird's beak) occur in the estuary and are the taxa most affected by the estuarine processes, indicators, and threats outlined in this report. Bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is no longer a federally-listed species, but remains on state lists as a threatened species. Anadromous fish, particularly coastal coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), have been the focal species for riparian and wetland habitat restoration projects throughout the basin. Usage of the estuary and freshwater streams by anadromous salmonids varies by species and their life stages (MAP CXT-4). Critical habitat for four of the five listed species (green sturgeon, Oregon Coast coho ESU, northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet) has been designated by US Fish and Wildlife. The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) and marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) have been focal species in upland forests managed by federal, state, and private land owners, and their combined designated critical habitats is shown in MAP CXT-5. Critical habitat designation for green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) was primarily based on heads of tide (Oregon Division of State Lands 1989), and thus the inclusion of Depot Slough as critical habitat for green sturgeon (MAP CXT-4) is likely in error (see note on Map EC-5D). Commercial forestry dominates much of the upland areas, but is limited in the estuary study area (MAP CXT-5). Land use zoning (MAP CXT-6) indicates that 87% of the basin is managed for forestry, but management differs by land ownership. In general, private forest land is managed on shorter rotations than on federal and state land, and has less stringent regulations protecting riparian zones and older age classes. Agriculture occupies only 6% of the basin, while aquaculture in the form of oyster farming occurs in the Yaquina River mainstem between Oneatta Point and Oysterville. Road networks in the basin are extensive, with higher road densities occurring on private lands managed for timber production (MAP CXT-7)."}, {"section_title": "B. Estuarine Circulation (Map Series EC)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The health of an estuary and the types of services it provides are in large part determined by estuarine circulation and hydrology. Estuaries contain a complex mix of salt and fresh water. Winds and tides, along with the relative amounts of freshwater and saltwater inputs, cause mixing in the estuary. The resulting salinity gradients create a variety of habitats. In addition, water gradients and flow volume affect sedimentation and water quality. The amount of freshwater entering the estuary changes seasonally. Peak flows occur during the winter, and during this time freshwater dominates the lower estuary. Changes in the timing and magnitude of peak flows can be useful indicators of the health of estuary circulation processes. Impervious surfaces increase surface water runoff, which can impact the timing of freshwater inflow by increasing the amount of water reaching streams during peak winter precipitation, and decreasing the amount stored as groundwater for release during non-peak periods. Although the total amount of impervious and semi-pervious surfaces (e.g. recent areas of timber harvest) is low for the basin, localized impacts to freshwater input may exist near areas of development, or in sub-basins like Simpson Creek that have relatively high acreages of recent timber harvest. Tidal inputs and circulation within the estuary are another indicator of estuarine health. Barriers to tidal circulation include tide gates, dikes, causeways, and riprap. These barriers can restrict the amount of area that is tidally inundated, and alter healthy water flow and mixing patterns. These changes can result in habitat loss and fragmentation (e.g. habitats used by salmon at different life stages), as well as changes in sedimentation and water quality.\nClean water is essential element for healthy biological communities in the estuary, as well as for human health. Particular chemical parameters such as nutrient levels, temperature, and pH, are required for all biota in the estuary and tributary streams. Human land and water uses can have profound effects on these parameters and alter water quality.\nIt is now generally acknowledged that climate change is causing gradual warming and thermal expansion of ocean waters, and the melting glaciers and polar ice. The combined effects of these changes are causing a sea level rise (SLR) that is documented globally and locally. Measuring sea level rise is complicated by the small size of annual increments, imprecision in existing benchmarks and tidal data, and subduction-zone upwarping or downwarping that is occurring along different reaches of the Pacific coast. EPA and partners are currently developing a Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) for the Yaquina Estuary, but the model is still under development. Preliminary results, based on a projected 3-foot rise by 2100, indicate a 74% reduction of tidal flat area, 94% reduction of irregularly flooded marsh, and an 85% increase in regularly flooded marsh (Ruggiero et al. 2010). It is still unknown whether accretion of sediment and organic material on estuary marsh surfaces can keep pace with SLR, or whether they will be inundated. EPA is currently measuring accretion rates in salt marshes in seven estuaries along the Oregon coast."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Findings", "text": "The timing and quantity of freshwater into the Yaquina Estuary are mostly unaltered. Late season flow input from the Yaquina River may be a concern, with cumulative water rights for irrigation purposes accounting for more than half of the median late season flow. Recent restoration efforts have resulted in improved tidal circulation in large areas of intertidal and salt marsh habitat. However, large portions of the estuary remain cut off from tidal influence because of tide gates, impoundments, or dikes.\nOur analysis did not uncover any threats to the sediment delivery process in the Yaquina Estuary. However, we were limited in some analyses by data availability, and have received several suggestions that would improve our methodology. We found no factors that suggest a cause for the sediment 303(d) listing for Big Elk Creek.\nAlthough overall water quality is believed to be high in the Yaquina Basin, DEQ has identified particular threats to water quality such as elevated stream temperatures in Olalla Slough and Big Elk Creek (Map WSQ-1). Unfortunately, water quality of streams and rivers in the lower estuary is not monitored extensively on an ongoing basis (Map WSQ-2).\nEmergent intertidal wetlands, primarily salt marsh, have been most heavily impacted by human development. While the overall loss of wetlands in the estuary is less than 15%, large portions of salt marsh have been converted to farmed wetlands. Invasive species have slightly degraded estuarine quality.\nLimited landward migration zones exist in the lower Yaquina basin, due to the relatively steep topography. Several relatively small areas will allow plant community upslope migration with little human intervention. However, to enable landward migration for larger areas in the estuary, current infrastructure (levees and tide gates) will need modification."}, {"section_title": "Freshwater Inflow: Impoundments and Diversions (Map EC-1)", "text": "Inputs of freshwater into the basin are compromised by several features. An inter-basin transfer of fresh water for industrial purposes from the Siletz River to Olalla Slough would appear to increase the amount of water being introduced into the estuary. However, most of the transferred water is used by the Georgia Pacific mill, and effluent is piped overland directly into the Pacific Ocean. Some fresh water passes through fish ladders at the Olalla Slough impoundment, and during high water events a spillway releases water into lower Olalla Slough. The net water balance was not firmly quantified. Based on feedback from other reviewers, we believe that the volume of fresh water entering lower Olalla Slough is significantly reduced compared to a natural condition. The ecological effect may be limited to localized increase in salinity in lower Olalla Slough, compared to a natural flow, because of the lack of dilution. Mill Creek Reservoir stores water for City of Toledo municipal use during November -April. An examination of the hydrograph at the stream gage just below the reservoir (Gage 14306036) suggests that the freshwater release from the reservoir reasonably resembles a natural flow condition. Late season summertime flows are maintained in Mill Creek, averaging 1.0 cfs. Given the overall contribution of fresh water to the Yaquina Estuary from Olalla Slough (less than 5%, based on area), hydrologic alterations likely do not increase salinity levels across the entire estuary. Other minor impoundments in the basin have negligible impact on freshwater input into the estuary. Impoundments also alter sediment delivery into an estuary, and are discussed later."}, {"section_title": "Freshwater Inflow: Impervious and Semi-pervious Surfaces (Map EC-2)", "text": "We examined the potential for altered freshwater peak flow conditions into the estuary caused by large areas of impervious surface. Booth et al. (2002) suggested a 7.5% to 10% threshold, above which timing and impact may become ecologically significant. A LANDSAT-derived impervious surface layer (USGS LCI 2011) was analyzed at the 6th field watershed level, with no sub-watershed having total impervious surface greater than 3%. Localized concentrations of impervious surfaces occur in urban areas (Map EC-2). The impact of large areas of impervious surface may be seen at a local stream level, but is not believed to impact timing of freshwater delivery into the estuary at the estuary scale. We also included recent clearcuts in the analysis, regarding them as semi-pervious surfaces. Timber harvest records are not in a convenient GIS form. Instead, we processed the LANDSAT-based landcover change geodata, generated by NOAA Coastal Services Center's Coastal Change Analysis Program (NOAA CSC 2006). The geodata were filtered to detect timber harvest activities from 1996-2001, and from 2001-2006, which we then combined into a single coverage. An informal visual comparison to NAIP imagery indicated that such an approach was a suitable method for empirically determining harvested timber areas. Timber harvest area as a percentage of total area was summarized at the 12 th field sub-watershed level. Total clearcut area did not exceed 15% in any of the sub-watersheds over the 10 year period (Map EC-2). In recently cutover areas, increased surface runoff will occur until vegetation becomes re-established, but we do not have an \"equivalent impervious area\" conversion factor. However, we assume the overall relatively small area of clearcuts (6.8% of total area), even if regarded as an impervious surface, does not significantly alter the timing of freshwater delivery to the estuary."}, {"section_title": "Freshwater Inflow: Late Season Inputs (Map EC-3)", "text": "As observed previously, winter flows deliver large amounts of freshwater to the estuary, and restrict the upriver intrusion of salt water. Reduced late-season flows caused by summer drought and extensive irrigation withdrawals upstream enable ocean-derived salt to penetrate farther up the estuary. We quantified irrigation withdrawals using Oregon Water Resource Department's Water Rights database (OWRD 2010). The database includes spatial information on point of withdrawal and point of use. To overcome the paucity of stream gage data in the basin, we used the methodology of Risley et al. (2008), which establishes a p50 (median) flow rate for all 12 calendar months for western Oregon streams. For the low flow months of August and September, the regression equations developed by Risley et al. only require the catchment area and the catchment's annual precipitation. Accordingly, both August and September p50 (median) flows were computed, with the minimum value used for comparison. 1 The USGS StreamStats tool (USGS SS 2007) was used to quantify a catchment area and annual precipitation. Our goal in this in this analysis was to determine the impact of cumulative upstream water withdrawals on freshwater entering the estuary. Basins of interest (Map EC-3) were grouped primarily by a major tributary drainage point into the estuary. Most basins have about a 20% ratio of irrigation water withdrawals to median late season water flow. Several exceptional cases were noted: \u2022 Mill Creek: the water rights appear to be extreme relative to the basin size, but the water rights are for City of Toledo municipal usage, are used only between November and April, and are taken from the reservoir. As mentioned previously, a preview of the hydrograph at the stream gage resembled an unregulated stream hydrograph. The measured low season flow median value (i.e., \"p50\") at the Mill Creek gage (Period of Record: 1960Record: -1973) was 1.0 cfs, slightly less than the predicted unregulated late-season flow of 1.31 cfs. \u2022 Wright Creek: this large water right was for a fish hatchery that has ceased operation, and is probably an abandoned water right (Oregon Aqua Foods, Inc). \u2022 East Olalla Creek: Bio-Surveys & Sialis (2003) noted very low flows in East Olalla Creek (0.5 cfs), and suggested that unpermitted withdrawals may contribute to its low flow. Our analysis indicated that half of the median late-season flow is already allocated to permitted withdrawals. The estuary effect may be minimal, however, because this is a sub-watershed upstream of the Olalla Dam. \u2022 Upper Yaquina Basin: Perhaps the biggest concern for freshwater estuary input is the allocation of more than half of the median late season flow for irrigation purposes. The stream gage at Chitwood was maintained by USGS from 1972-1991, then by the Oregon Water Resources Department to the present. The measured late season median flow of 9.6 cfs at the Chitwood gage is in agreement with the predicted late season median flow (16.9 cfs), minus the gage's upstream consumptive water right allocations (10.9 cfs). In the low precipitation years of 1992 and 2006, the Chitwood gage has recorded flows as low as 2.2 cfs. The reduced late-season flow in the upper Yaquina basin may contribute to elevated late-season salinity levels in the upper estuary, but no measurements are available (Map CXT-7). It may also contribute to the DEQ summertime temperature listing for the Yaquina River between RM 15 and RM 27 (Map WSQ-1)."}, {"section_title": "Hydrologic Connectivity (Maps EC4, EC5 series, EC6)", "text": "We categorized wetland area hydrologic connectivity as 'natural' or 'disrupted'. A 'natural' rating was given to areas with no known barriers to tidal interchange, no barriers to drainage, and no artificial drainage. Disrupted hydrologic connectivity includes areas with artificially restricted or blocked tidal exchange, compared to an unaltered condition, and may also include impediments to tidal sheet flow. Dredged areas are considered to have altered hydrologic connectivity. Categorization was done by synthesizing information from several sources: Map EC-4 shows locations of detailed maps (Maps EC-5A through EC-5E). Areas of fill, as identified by Scranton (2004), are shown for reference, emphasizing the historic extent of the estuary and current barriers to tidal exchange. Hardened shorelines as inventoried by EPA (1997) are combined with the \"man made levees\" from the dikes and levees inventory. NOAA navigation charts outline shipping channels, not necessarily areas that were dredged. Dredging likely has extended beyond these areas. We used a bathymetry dataset for the Yaquina Estuary compiled from various sources by EPA (2007). It was not possible to interpret the bathymetry map and determine specific areas that have been actively dredged as opposed to natural channels. While 19th century navigation charts for the lower Yaquina Estuary are available (NOAA COA), past efforts to reconstruct pre-dredged bathymetry and compare it to modern bathymetry (e.g., Bernert and Sullivan 1998) have pointed out significant technical challenges and data limitations. We were not able to quantify the amount of modified subtidal area or volume relative to pre-settlement conditions. We have included the shipping channel shown on 1940s navigation charts, and known dredging activity (such as the dredging in Depot Slough during 2010) to emphasize modifications to the tidal prism. Intertidal and subtidal barriers are shown as pink lines on Maps EC-5A to EC5E. The barriers were based on interpretation of NOAA navigation charts and photointerpretation of the 2009 NAIP imagery, which was flown at low tide. We did not quantify areas impacted by such barriers, but include them to highlight modifications to estuarine hydrology. While levees impact hydrologic connectivity in large areas, especially upstream of Toledo, three tide gates and one dam have had the greatest impacts: Boone and Nute Sloughs, Depot Slough, and Olalla Slough are completely cut off from tidal influence, with former tidal wetlands converted to upland or freshwater wetland. Tidal exchange is restricted at several small inlets along the Yaquina River, primarily because of small culvert size. Flesher Slough is the largest area impacted by inadequate culverts."}, {"section_title": "C. Sedimentation (Map Series SED)", "text": "Background Sediment is delivered to estuaries from both riverine and marine sources. Accumulation or loss of sediment can directly affect the shape and structure of estuaries. Biological communities also are determined, in part, by sedimentation patterns because the habitats of certain species, such as those of benthic invertebrates and fish, are characterized by sediments of particular sizes. Sedimentation and hydrology are highly interactive processes. Estuary circulation patterns can determine where sediments accumulate, while accumulation or depletion of sediments can alter the way water moves in the estuary. Changes to natural sedimentation patterns can occur because of land use practices in the watershed. Lands that have been cleared of vegetation have higher surface erosion, particularly on steep slopes and unstable soils (high K factor). Similarly, roads that are in close proximity to streams and rivers can increase the amount of sediment delivered to these water bodies and, ultimately, to the estuary. Mass wasting (landslides and debris flows) is also a major source of sediment to the estuary. Landslidevulnerable areas that have been cleared recently or that are intersected by roads are particularly susceptible to failure. Under natural conditions, some of the sediment that is delivered to streams and rivers would be deposited in floodplains. However, many streams have been artificially disconnected from their floodplains by bank hardening, diking, channel incision (downcutting), and channelization. When sediments are not deposited on the floodplain, greater amounts of these materials are delivered to the estuary. Loss of large woody debris and other physical features of streams also reduce the amount of sediment deposited within streams and rivers, increasing the amount of sediment delivered to the estuary. Much of our sedimentation analysis focused on comparing metrics between the Upper Yaquina and the Big Elk sub-watersheds, in order to better understand the latter's 303(d) sedimentation listing by DEQ (Map WSQ-1)."}, {"section_title": "Interruption of Sediment Delivery: Impoundments (Map EC-1)", "text": "Impoundments can limit watershed delivery and type of sediment into an estuary (Wang et al 2008). In the Yaquina Basin, 5.7% of the watershed is impounded, with the largest impoundment located upstream of the dam on Olalla Slough. Anecdotal evidence cited in Husing (1994) suggested that siltation had increased in portions of Olalla Slough since construction of the dam. Using area as a surrogate for determining an impact, as we did in the analysis for freshwater inputs, we conclude that impoundments in the basin have not had much effect on restricting sediment delivery to the estuary because of the relatively small area that has been impounded. As with freshwater inputs and salinity, the dam on Olalla Slough may influence sedimentation in the lower Olalla Slough downstream of the dam, but not in the main estuary."}, {"section_title": "Sedimentation: Watershed Surface Erosion (Maps SED-1, SED-2)", "text": "We analyzed recent timber harvests for their potential to increase surface erosion and accelerate delivery of sediment to the estuary. The timber harvest dataset (see discussion in Freshwater Inputs) was overlaid onto a 10-meter DEM-derived slope layer and a \"highly erodible map soil unit\" layer derived from the NRCS SSURGO data for Lincoln County, Benton County, and Polk County (primarily Survey OR638, from NRCS 1997). Following the guidelines in Aldous et al. (2008), and documented on Map SED-1, only a fractional amount of timber harvest has occurred on areas at high risk for increased surface erosion. Most 'highly erodible' map soil units in the Yaquina Basin occur on valley floors, and only a small portion of the watershed has slopes in excess of 65%. None of these steep slopes in the basin have had recent timber harvests. Using the thresholds established in Aldous et al. (2008), we do not see increased surface erosion from timber harvests as a current or future threat. Surface erosion from logging roads frequently has been cited as a major source of sediment delivery to fish-bearing streams (e.g., Beshta 1978) and, ultimately, to the estuary. Using available GIS data sets, and following the guidelines in Aldous et al. (2008), we quantified the percentage of river mile segments near roads (Map SED-2). The data were further broken into perennial and intermittent streams, using the attributes supplied in the NHD high-resolution dataset (USGS NHD 2011). Data are categorized by 12 th field watersheds, and summarized in Table 1.  1972; amended in 1983, 1987) may present less of a threat than older or non-conforming roads. However, available road datasets do not distinguish between types of roads, and thus for our analysis we treated all roads as equivalent. We are not aware of any published \"stream-near-road\" percentage thresholds, above which increased sediment delivery has been demonstrated to be a problem.  -8), may be a significant source of sediment in Big Elk Creek. This observation has not been rigorously investigated, however. If it is a significant sediment contributor, one solution is to pave the road (Reid and Dunne 1984)."}, {"section_title": "Mass Wasting (Map SED-3)", "text": "Slow-moving landslides deliver limited amounts of sediment over time, but rapid landslides and debris flows often deliver large, catastrophic pulses of sediment directly into stream channels. Given the relatively similar geology between the upper Yaquina River and Big Elk sub-basins (Map CXT-2), similar road densities (Map CXT-8), and other landscape factors, we concluded that a modeling approach as suggested by Aldous et al. (2008) would not yield a meaningful indicator, particularly one that might account for the DEQ 303(d) listing in Big Elk Creek (Map WSQ-1). Instead, we analyzed empirical data from the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industry's landslide information geodatabase (DOGAMI SLIDO 2011, V2). The landslide areas shown in Map SED-3 originate primarily from an analysis of topographic maps by Schlicker et al. (1973). While the authors suggested the need to classify the relative ages of the landslides (pre-settlement, modern, etc.), unfortunately they did not do so. The points in the Statewide Landslide Information Database for Oregon (SLIDO) often, but not always, indicate if a landslide impacted a 2 nd order or higher-order stream. Summary statistics at the 10 th field watershed (Map SED-3) show more landslides in the Big Elk Creek drainage, with most recorded landslides occurring during the Jan-Feb 1996 floods. The data suggest an increased landslide hazard in the Big Elk watersheds, but the causative or correlative factors are unclear. As with any empirical database, we must consider the potential for observer or sampling bias. For example, the apparent concentration of landslides along the Hwy 20 corridor reported by ODOT probably reflects the agency's focus on areas adjacent to state highways. Sampling bias also may be present because of more intensive on-ground inventories conducted on federal lands in the Big Elk watersheds, versus a lack of such inventories on private lands that dominate the other watersheds. DOGAMI has an established methodology for systematically processing lidar data for landslide mapping (DOGAMI 2010), and will apply these methods in the Siletz watershed for better understanding of the river's sediment issues (ODEQ 2011). However, currently there are no plans to create lidar coverage for the eastern two-thirds of the Yaquina watershed, so there is no opportunity to develop a similar analysis for the Yaquina."}, {"section_title": "Sediment Delivery to Estuary (Map SED-4)", "text": "Aldous et al. 2008identified length of stream bank hardened or disconnected from the floodplain as a potential indicator of increased sediment delivery to estuaries. In the Yaquina Basin, historical floodplains may have been disconnected not as much by infrastructure such as levees, but by downcutting of stream channels caused by historical logging and agricultural activity. However, there has been no attempt to systematically evaluate where downcutting of streams or hardening of streambanks has occurred in the study area. A database developed by Miller (2010) begins to address this indicator. She reviewed previous splash dam and logging drive databases (primarily USFS 1985), and assembled a geodatabase showing the locations of these features. In the Yaquina Basin, several log drives and one splash dam (Depot Slough) was documented. Log drives, which may have contributed to downcutting of the mainstem or its tributaries, occurred in the Yaquina Basin but were not as extensive as in other coastal watersheds (Map SED-4)."}, {"section_title": "D.

Estimating the extent of past habitat sub-types can be challenging, and we chose to generalize to broader habitat types. For example, the extent of historical tidally-influenced wetlands in areas that no longer have tidal connections (e.g., Olalla Slough) was based observation of nearby areas with unimpeded tidal exchange, and their lidar-derived elevation (mostly from Brophy 2010). Because of the subtle nature and gradients in plant community assemblages, we did not distinguish between historical salt marsh and tidally-influenced wetlands, and instead lumped them together. Similar to other Oregon estuaries, 69% of the emergent tidal wetlands in the Yaquina Estuary have been impacted by post-settlement development (69%). Many of the tidal wetlands were converted to freshwater non-tidal, most of which are now farmed wetlands. Some wetland types now occur on previously filled wetlands. Such type conversions make the overall estuary wetland loss appear minimal (14%). While our estimates of historical and current acreage are higher than those reported in Good (2000), the percent loss of salt marsh is about the same (69% versus 71%). Current wetlands habitat composition is a mix of several types (Map HAB-3, summarized in Table 2). In the Yaquina, green crab is present but not abundant. Its introduction in the Yaquina in the 1990s initially caused some concern because it has been problematic in other estuaries in the Pacific Northwest, but to date its population levels in the Yaquina remain relatively low (Behrens Yamada and Gillespie 2008). Japanese eelgrass (Zostera japonica) is abundant in the lower estuary, and may compete with native eelgrass (Zostera marina). However, some researchers think Japanese eelgrass creates usable habitat for native species where native eelgrass is absent (Mach et al. 2010, Fisher 2011. Parrotfeather is listed as a Class B noxious weed by the Oregon Department of Agriculture, and is generally a good indicator of eutrophic water. Currently, no mapping is available for invasive reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) that is widespread in the Yaquina basin, as well as several introduced clams and the parasitic isopod Orthione griffenis. The isopod is of particular concern because it threatens native mud shrimp."}, {"section_title": "PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE CHANGE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Sea Level Rise (Map Series SLR)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise: Potential landward migration zones (Maps SLR1 -SLR9)", "text": "To visualize the potential effects of sea level rise (SLR), we employed a bathtub model that incorporates variations in tidal datums within the estuary. More sophisticated models such as SLAMM are under development for the Yaquina Estuary, which account for barriers, specific habitat types, and sediment accretion. Until the SLAMM modeling is completed, we present here a straightforward 'bathtub' model that can be effective in long-term conservation planning and complement other more in-depth analyses. Bathtub models make no assumption on rates of accretion of either sediment or organic material, or whether accretion will keep pace with SLR. From a worst-case planning scenario, we need to consider the possibility of significant areas of current salt marsh habitat converting to intertidal mud flats. For conservation planning purposes, we have identified potential landward migration zones (LMZs), their current zoning and use, and evaluate these areas within a broader conservation strategy. We used recent lidar-derived bare-earth models developed for the Oregon coast (DOGAMI 2008), which provide elevation data using an orthometric datum. To relate the orthometric elevation to a tidal datum, we used NOAA's VDatum tool (NOAA NGDC 2009). However, VDatum's coverage is limited to the lower portions of the Yaquina Estuary. Increases in Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) in upper portions of the estuary were initially documented by Goodwin et al. (1970), with Brophy et al. (2011) providing further refinement. Where VDatum or other data sources are not available, we provide an estimate on a local current MHHW elevation. A Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) contour does not form a crisp, clearly visible ecotone. However, it is a convenient reference point to use because it is the upper limit in a well-established local tidal datum. In this analysis, we show potential impacts on estuary habitats, including mud flats, salt marsh, freshwater tidal, and freshwater/non-tidal. The overview Map SLR-1 highlights the relatively limited availability of migration areas within the Yaquina basin, and identifies specific areas for further examination. The 15 foot (NAVD88) elevation contour shown in red on Map SLR-1 represents current MHHW (7.6 feet (NAVD88) at South Beach, plus 6.4 feet of projected sea level rise (MHHW at upper portions of the estuary are about +1.0 foot above the MHHW established at South Beach). The +6.4 foot estimate for SLR represents the upper end of current modeling estimates (Jevrejeva et al. 2010, Vermeer andRahmsdorf 2009). Detail maps (Maps SLR-2 to SLR-9) show current generalized habitat type (mud flat, salt marsh, freshwater-tidal, freshwater-non tidal) relative to the current MHHW, and to three distinct increases in MHHW at 2 foot intervals (MHHW + 2 feet, 4 feet, and 6 feet). The maps are intended to qualitatively evaluate the potential of a particular area as a migration zone. Wright Creek (Poole Slough drainage, Map SLR-9) shows a typical narrowing of the bottomlands as one ascends the stream. Given its relatively unaltered history, the area may form a good reference when analyzing other highly-altered portions of the estuary. The area is currently protected (Map CXT-3), and will provide some opportunity for landward migration of salt marsh and freshwater tidal wetlands. Likewise, Mill Creek (Map SLR-5) offers some opportunity for upland migration of estuarine habitat, although the potentially impacted areas are currently in private ownership. Because of diking and subsequent soil oxidation, the surfaces of Boone and Nute Sloughs have subsided (Maps SLR-2, SLR-3). If the tide gates on these sloughs are removed and tidal exchange reestablished, current elevation data suggest that much of the drainage will be frequently inundated, with possible conversion to mud flat. Some higher-elevation areas that extend into the main slough (e.g., Map SLR-2) may provide some LMZ. Depot and Olalla Sloughs have gentle gradients and fairly wide floodplains (Maps SLR-4, SLR-6, SLR-7), and appear to provide the best opportunities for LMZs in terms of area. However, these sites are the most complex logistically because of their current road infrastructure and impoundments. "}, {"section_title": "B. Seismic hazards", "text": "The effects of a great earthquake on the Yaquina Estuary cannot be predicted, but the potential exists for sudden, catastrophic subsidence of estuary surfaces, and deposition of sediments from tsunamis and landslides that will affect existing habitats. These effects will override current restoration projects, planning, and existing infrastructure."}, {"section_title": "Sedimentation from tsunamis", "text": "Depending on wave direction and velocity, sediments carried inland by tsunamis will be deposited where wave energy begins to dissipate. Tsunami deposits in the Yaquina Estuary extend at least 8.7 mi upstream to the vicinity of Cannon Quarry County Park, and probably further (Peterson and Priest 1995). Much of the deposition will occur in shallows currently occupied by low and high tidal marsh. Some marshes may be completely buried by deep sediments, eliminating current vegetation structure, while others will receive only a thin layer. Thickness of the deposits will determine whether low marsh converts to high marsh, low marsh to upland, or high marsh to upland."}, {"section_title": "Sedimentation from mass wasting", "text": "A great earthquake presumably will cause landslides and debris flows of varying sizes at locations scattered throughout the Yaquina Basin. These slides will increase sediment loads in the river, which will affect intertidal and subtidal habitats in the estuary."}, {"section_title": "Coseismic subsidence", "text": "Tectonic inactivity since 1700 has caused the central coast of Oregon to warp upwards. A great earthquake could correct warping along part of the coast by lowering the surface elevation. Recent estimates for coseismic subsidence in estuaries along the Oregon coast range from 1.3-3.9 ft, and estimates specific to the Yaquina Estuary range from 0.8-1.8 ft (Peterson et al. 1994, Leonard et al. 2010, Hawkes et al. 2011. Lowering of the surface will cause sudden inundation resembling the projections envisioned for a gradual sea level rise of ca. 2 ft (Map SLR-1), and head of tide could migrate upstream by several miles (e.g., Kelsey et al. 1998). Low tidal marsh, nearshore infrastructure, and diked lands will be the most affected. Low marsh may be inundated, high marsh may convert to low marsh, and high marsh may extend into what is currently upland. Tectonic subsidence of diked surfaces will amplify the existing effects of soil subsidence that has occurred behind dikes because of oxidation and compaction."}, {"section_title": "Habitat conservation and restoration", "text": "High salt marsh, tidal Sitka spruce swamp, and nontidal Sitka spruce swamp remain the highest priorities for habitat conservation. Low salt marsh, currently the most abundant wetland habitat in the estuary, may also need attention if sea level rise becomes problematic. The most logical conservation activities in the lower estuary are reconnection of Boone Slough to tidal circulation, and enhancements to existing conservation projects on McCaffery and Poole Sloughs. Opportunities to improve tidal circulation by removing or breaching tide gates, dikes, and other barriers will occur and should be pursued wherever feasible, because restoring tidal connections will improve fish habitat and nutrient deposition. Good places to start would be upper Poole Slough and Flesher Slough, which are adjacent to ongoing conservation work. Breaching barriers adjacent to existing fills along the river would enhance restoration or creation of low or high tidal marsh in areas otherwise compromised by previous industrial activity. "}, {"section_title": "Landward migration zones (LMZs)", "text": "Projections envisioned for sea level rise (Map SLR-1) identify the need for zones where low and high tidal marsh may self-perpetuate by migrating inland (see discussion under Sea Level Rise). Many areas with narrow strips of marsh adjacent to steeply rising hills will not provide enough room for landward migration of marsh habitats. It remains to be seen if marsh surfaces can accrete at the same rate as sea level rise. If they cannot keep pace with sea level rise, they will be inundated. The need for landward migration zones for high marsh is particularly acute, because it is the rarest type with the greatest historical impacts, but low marsh may also be at risk because of diminished surface area in the estuary. Areas suitable for landward migration zones are limited to those in elongated valleys with relatively flat alluvial surfaces typical of drowned river mouths. Reconnection of Boone Slough and Nute Slough would provide surfaces for transition from mud flats low to high tidal marsh, with high marsh or spruce swamp on the low divide between the two streams. Depot Creek, Little Beaver Creek, and Poole Slough also provide opportunity for inland migration of marsh and swamp, but many of the other short sloughs and creeks lack adequate space for a migration zone. Olalla Creek could provide similar opportunities if barriers at Toledo were removed. Restoration planting in areas projected for a sea level rise of 6 feet could probably focus on Sitka spruce, Hooker willow, red alder, bigleaf maple, and twinberry, while areas below 6 feet could be planted to tufted hairgrass and meadow barley after suitable site preparation. These species would most likely be sufficient to self-sort into communities adapted to changing hydrology and salinity. Spruce, willow, alder, maple, and twinberry would survive on freshwater bottomlands with seasonal to perennial water, while spruce and twinberry would be able to tolerate limited salt intrusion even though the other species would die. Higher salinities would kill all woody species but favor tufted hairgrass and meadow barley, which could create favorable conditions for high to intermediate tidal marsh. Lower sites with greater salinity would self-establish low salt marsh, which does not need planting."}, {"section_title": "Invasive species", "text": "Most invasive species highlighted in this report are marine invertebrates, which often disperse as planktonic larvae and are impossible to control. Unlike unwanted fish, invertebrates cannot be screened from tributary bays and streams, and their presence remains problematic. The best action for these species is, therefore, to prevent further introductions such as by encouraging boaters to clean boats when traveling from other areas. Similarly, Japanese eelgrass is difficult to control because of its subtidal habitat. It is probably more widespread than shown in Map HAB-4, because sampling did not occur in all nearshore areas of the estuary. For example, sampling covered only part of McCaffery and Poole Sloughs, and did not extend past Depot Slough. Parrotfeather, a freshwater aquatic plant in Boone Slough, would fairly easy to control by mechanical removal and spraying. Alternatively, opening Boone Slough to tidal circulation and salt intrusion would probably eliminate parrotfeather without any need for further control methods.

It is important to understand the topography and hydrology of a site, and to set clear restoration goals and targets prior to choosing or implementing any one or more of these techniques."}, {"section_title": "Estuary restoration techniques", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Table 4.

No basin-wide stream reach level inventory exists, however. Aerial photography cannot be used in this context. Lidar, if available, may identify reaches in larger (wider) streams, but not in smaller streams. A consistent protocol for field site visits would be necessary, as well as the cooperation of numerous private landowners (Map CXT-5).
