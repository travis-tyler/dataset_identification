All rights reserved Keywords: attachment, temperament, meta-analysis, social competence, psychopathology Within the Bowlby-Ainsworth attachment framework (e.g., Ainsworth, 1982;Bowlby, 1969Bowlby, /1982, individual differences in early attachment security are expected to have enduring implications for children's socioemotional development but are not expected to be shaped by child temperament characteristics (see e.g., Weinfield, Sroufe, Egeland, & Carlson, 2008). However, as early evidence for the predictive significance of attachment security began to emerge, questions arose concerning precisely what individual differences in infant attachment reflected. Whereas some scholars maintained that individual differences in infant temperament were of little import in determining attachment classifications (Sroufe, 1985), others contended that infant attachment security was the product of temperamental characteristics (Chess & Thomas, 1982;Kagan, 1982). This decades-long debate led to numerous investigations that have produced mixed findings on the link between attachment and temperament. Accordingly, this study presents a meta-analytic review of this literature aimed at addressing enduring questions about the empirical overlap of infant attachment and temperament. The present review also extends a series of meta-analyses on the developmental significance of early attachment security. Findings from these meta-analyses indicate that early attachment security is positively associated with children's social competence with peers (d = 0.39; Groh et al., 2014) and negatively associated with children's externalizing (d = 0.31;Fearon, Bakermans-Kranenburg, Van IJzendoorn, Lapsley, & Roisman, 2010) and (to a lesser extent) internalizing (d = 0.15; Groh, Roisman, Van IJzendoorn, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & Fearon, 2012) psychopathology, suggesting that establishing a secure attachment relationship in infancy promotes children's interpersonal functioning and mental health. Although these metaanalyses provide insight into the implications of early attachment security for children's socioemotional development, without a comparable meta-analysis on attachment and temperament, questions remain concerning the developmental origins of early attachment variation. To be sure, given claims made by attachment scholars that children's endogenous characteristics play little role in shaping the quality of the parent-child attachment relationship (Sroufe, 1985), it would be expected, from an attachment perspective, that attachment and"}, {"section_title": "Author Manuscript", "text": "This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved temperament would be weakly associated developmental constructs and that early attachment security would be more strongly related to children's subsequent developmental adaptation than it would to infant temperament. This latter point is critical because if attachment-temperament associations were of comparable magnitude to attachment-outcome associations, this could cast doubt over the extent and specificity of attachment's role in children's adjustment. Here, we present a meta-analytic review of the literature on early attachment and infant temperament to empirically evaluate these claims. Because this meta-analysis is the fourth in the series, it is uniquely positioned to address this latter claim, as we are able to compare the meta-analytic association between attachment and temperament with the recently reported meta-analytic associations between attachment and children's social competence, externalizing symptomatology, and internalizing symptomatology. Central to attachment theory is the idea that individual differences in infant attachment security originate in the early caregiving environment (Ainsworth et al., 1978), a point that has been strongly contested by temperament scholars (Chess & Thomas, 1982;Goldsmith, Bradshaw, & Rieser-Danner, 1986;Kagan, 1982). Although diverse theories of temperament have been more recently unified under one psychobiological theory of temperament (e.g., Rothbart, 2011), temperament scholars have over time proposed several distinct theories of temperament (see, Shiner et al., 2012). Vaughn and his colleagues (Vaughn & Bost, 1999;Vaughn & Shin, 2011) have characterized these theories as falling into one of four main theoretical perspectives on temperament, including (1) temperament as behavioral style (Thomas & Chess, 1977), (2) temperament as emergent personality (Buss & Plomin, 1975, (3) temperament as a social co-construction of the infant's endogenouslyorganized attributes and the caregiver's perception of the infant's attributes (Bates, 1980), and (4) temperament as emotional reactivity and regulation (Rothbart, 1989). Despite differences between these perspectives in terms of the characterization of dimensions of temperament, each of these perspectives includes dimensions reflecting negative (e.g., fussy, inhibited, fearful) and positive (e.g., sociable, adaptable, rhythmic) affect. Common to these perspectives is the notion that such temperamental characteristics are biologically-based, endogenously organized traits that emerge early in the life course. Importantly, scholars from these theoretical traditions have asserted that individual differences in infant attachment are the result of temperamental variation, rather than characteristics of the specific parent-child relationship (Chess & Thomas, 1982; Author Manuscript This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved Goldsmith et al., 1986;Kagan, 1982). For example, Kagan (1982) argued that infant attachment security can be attributed to variation in specific aspects of infant negative temperament, such as infants' proneness to distress when confronted with novelty or when separated from the parent. Attachment scholars have provided a decidedly different perspective on the relation between attachment and temperament. Specifically, according to Sroufe (1985), infant temperament and parent-child attachment security are orthogonal constructs situated at different levels of analysis. According to this view, infant temperament is construed as a set of individual constructs determined by endogenous factors, whereas infant attachment is a relational construct with its origins in the history of the parent-child relationship. Within the parent-child relationship, parents' sensitive responsiveness to infant attachment signals is believed to be the principal organizing force shaping the quality of the early attachment relationship. Thus, from an attachment perspective it should be possible, and indeed expected, that infants develop different patterns of attachment to different caregivers depending on the quality of care received from a specific caregiver. Although this prediction would be considered paradoxical from a temperament perspective, it is entirely compatible with attachment theory. In short, infant temperamental characteristics are considered of little consequence to determining individual differences in the quality of the parent-child attachment relationship. Despite these theoretical arguments concerning the relation between attachment and temperament, findings from studies examining the empirical overlap of temperament and attachment have not clearly distinguished between these two opposing perspectives. For example, in support of the argument that infant attachment classifications are determined by infant temperament, scholars have highlighted evidence from studies demonstrating that neonatal behavior predicts subsequent attachment classification (e.g., Grossmann, Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, & Unzner, 1985;Waters, Vaughn, & Egeland, 1980). Conversely, to refute claims that attachment security is essentially redundant with infant temperament, other scholars have drawn on evidence from studies demonstrating that parental reports of infant temperament are not significantly associated with attachment classifications (Belsky, Rovine, & Taylor, 1984, Egeland & Farber, 1984. Attempts have been made to reconcile views on the relation between attachment and temperament, and at the broadest level, such rapprochements contend that attachment and temperament might be related, but in an oblique manner (Van IJzendoorn & Bakermans-\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved Kranenburg, 2012). For example, some have suggested that although temperament does not directly determine infant security status, it might shape the type of insecure relationship an infant establishes with an insensitive parent (e.g., Vaughn, Bost, & Van IJzendoorn, 2008). Specifically, because insecure-resistant infants typically become emotionally overwhelmed and insecure-avoidant infants exhibit minimal overt distress during the Strange Situation procedure (SSP), an infant with a more negative temperament might be more likely to establish a resistant attachment relationship whereas an infant with a less negative temperament might be more likely to establish an avoidant attachment relationship in the context of insensitive caregiving. Similarly, Belsky and Rovine (1987) have suggested that infant temperament might shape emotional reactivity, but not the organization of attachment behavior, in the SSP. Importantly, in addition to being classified into one of the three organized categories (i.e., secure [B], avoidant [A], resistant [C]), infants are usually assigned to sub-classifications (Ainsworth et al., 1978). As originally noted by Frodi and Thompson (1985), the emotional reactivity of secure B1 and B2 infants is comparable to that of avoidant A1 and A2 infants in that they exhibit minimal separation distress during the SSP, whereas the emotional reactivity of secure B3 and B4 infants is similar to that of resistant C1 and C2 infants, as they exhibit relatively high levels of separation distress. Belsky and Rovine (1987) hypothesized that this distinction in emotional reactivity might be attributed to temperamental differences, with A1-B2 infants expected to have a less negative temperament and B3-C2 infants expected to have a more negative temperament. Despite efforts to reconcile the attachment-temperament debate, these alternative interpretations of the relation between attachment and temperament have received mixed empirical support. Whereas some studies have found that temperament distinguishes patterns of attachment insecurity (e.g., Fagot & Kavanagh, 1993;Susman-Stillman, Kalkoske, Egeland, & Waldman, 1996), others have not (e.g., Emery, Paquette, & Bigras, 2008;Nachmias, Gunnar, Mangelsdorf, Parritz, & Buss, 1996). Moreover, the initial empirical support provided by Belsky and Rovine (1987) for their proposed link between temperament and emotional reactivity in the Strange Situation has been followed by replication (e.g., Susman-Stillman et al., 1996), as well as failures to replicate (e.g., Seifer, Schiller, Sameroff, Resnick, & Riordan, 1996). Further obscuring a clear understanding of the relation between attachment and temperament, many studies differ methodologically in key ways. Beyond the more obvious differences between studies in terms of the type of attachment and temperament assessments\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved administered, there are more subtle research design-related differences that might influence the link between attachment and temperament. For example, some studies have attempted to assess temperament within the context of the SSP (e.g., Crugnola et al., 2011). Such studies might overestimate the association between attachment and temperament by conflating the measurement of these constructs. Studies have also differed in terms of the temporal order of the assessment of attachment and temperament. Timing of the temperament assessment relative to the attachment assessment is important to consider because, according to attachment theory, infants' emotional reactivity and regulation is shaped by parent-child relationships (Cassidy, 1994, Sroufe & Fleeson, 1988. Thus, it might be expected that measures of attachment and temperament would not be closely related in the first year of life but would overlap increasingly over time, a prediction that has garnered some empirical support (Sherman, Stupica, Dykas, Ramos-Marcuse, & Cassidy, 2013;Vaughn et al., 1992). In addition to such methodological variation, studies have differed with respect to how temperament has been operationalized. For example, although many studies have focused on negative temperamental characteristics, some have developed sample-specific composites of negative temperament based on aggregated item analysis (e.g., principal component analysis) from parental reports of temperament, whereas others have operationalized negative temperament with respect to one of the four main temperament theoretical traditions (i.e., Thomas and Chess' [1977] difficulty dimension, Plomin's [1975, 1984] emotionality dimension, Bates' [1980] fussy/difficult dimension, Rothbart's [1989] negative affectivity dimension). Such idiosyncrasies might undermine the consistency and replicability of findings across the literature. Furthermore, in many studies researchers cast a wide net, examining a large variety of individual temperament dimensions in relation to attachment absent a priori hypotheses, which might ultimately increase the risk for identifying spurious associations between attachment and temperament. Despite these complexities, several cogent narrative reviews of the literature on attachment and temperament have been produced (Mangelsdorf & Frosch, 1999;Vaughn & Bost, 1999;Vaughn et al., 2008;. These reviews have served to advance thinking regarding the relation between attachment and temperament. Notwithstanding such contributions, these narrative reviews did not attempt to provide a precise estimate of the association between attachment and temperament. Although an\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved estimate of the association between temperament and attachment does not ultimately provide direct evidence regarding whether there is a causal relation between temperament and attachment, as has been suggested by some temperament scholars (Chess & Thomas, 1982;Kagan, 1982), it does provide evidence regarding the extent to which attachment and temperament empirically overlap, which might ultimately shed light on this central question in the attachment-temperament debate. To be sure, if temperament and attachment are only weakly associated, it would suggest that although temperament and attachment share some common variance, attachment quality is not determined by temperamental variation or vice versa. An estimate of the association between attachment and temperament is also crucial for testing the assumption that early security is more strongly related to children's subsequent adaptation than to infant temperament that is implied by attachment scholars' claim that attachment and temperament are distinct developmental constructs, as the comparison of the association between attachment and temperament with previously established meta-analytic associations between early attachment and children's socioemotional outcomes can be made. Meta-analysis provides a structured methodology for addressing these outstanding questions. To date, one meta-analysis specifically focused on the relation between temperamental proneness to distress and resistant attachment has been published (Goldsmith & Alansky, 1987). Findings from this meta-analysis of 18 samples (N = 1,127) provided evidence for a significant, yet modest, association between proneness to distress and resistance (d = 0.32). In addition, within the context of a broader meta-analysis examining the reliability and discriminant validity of disorganized attachment, the relation between temperament and disorganization was examined (Van IJzendoorn, Schuengel, & Bakermans-Kranenburg, 1999). Consistent with the idea that the origins of disorganization are not constitutionally based, the combined meta-analytic association across 13 samples (N = 2,028) was almost precisely zero. Although these findings are informative, due to the specific focus of these reports on particular dimensions of temperament or patterns of attachment, important questions remain concerning the extent to which attachment security more broadly, and avoidant attachment more specifically, are related to temperament, and the extent to which potential moderators, such as those referred to above, influence the association between attachment and temperament. In addition, without a broad meta-analysis of all patterns of attachment, the relative associations between each pattern of attachment and temperament compared to each pattern of attachment and children's\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved socioemotional outcomes cannot be examined. Thus, the field awaits a more comprehensive and updated meta-analytic review of the literature on attachment and temperament. Toward that end, we conducted a meta-analysis of 131 samples (N = 13,018) that estimated the association between early negative temperament including dimensions of temperament reflective of negative (vs. positive) emotional reactivity and attachment using standardized observational procedures of attachment quality in early childhood. In doing so, we set out to test four inter-related hypotheses. First, we tested the competing hypotheses that negative temperament and attachment (in)security are substantially overlapping versus relatively independent constructs with the expectation that early attachment insecurity would be weakly associated with negative temperament. Second, we tested the hypothesis that temperament is associated with specific patterns of insecurity, with the expectation that negative temperament would be weakly negatively associated with avoidant attachment and positively associated with resistant attachment. Third, we hypothesized that negative temperament would be trivially associated with infant disorganization. Fourth, we tested Belsky and Rovine's (1987) hypothesis that temperament would be associated with attachment sub-classifications according to infants' expression of emotion during the SSP (i.e., A1-B2 vs. B3-C2), with the expectation that negative temperament would be associated with the B3-C2 (vs. A1-B2) grouping of sub-classifications. We also examined several methodological factors that might moderate the association between attachment quality and negative temperament, including: (1) type of measure and identity of the rater used to assess attachment, (2) type of temperament assessment, (3) measurement of temperament in relation to attachment (temperament assessed within versus independent of the attachment assessment), and (4) temporal relation of attachment and temperament assessments (attachment before temperament, concurrent, attachment after temperament). We also studied the potential moderating role of several demographic factors, including: (1) child sex, (2) country in which the study was conducted, (3) child ethnicity, (4) socioeconomic status of the cohort, and 5 \nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved and temperament varied according to the theoretical tradition used to operationalize temperament. Regarding dimensions of temperament, we included those hypothesized to be relevant to attachment variation, including fearful distress (hypothesized to be negatively associated with security and avoidance and positively associated with resistance; e.g., Kagan, 1992), irritable distress (hypothesized to be positively associated with resistant attachment; e.g., Goldsmith et al., 1986), and positive emotionality (hypothesized to be positively associated with security; e.g., Lewis & Feiring, 1989), and then compared the magnitude of the associations between attachment and each of these temperament dimensions. To test assumptions about the association between attachment and temperament relative to associations between attachment and children's subsequent socioemotional outcomes, we compared the magnitude of meta-analytic associations tested here with estimates established in our prior meta-analyses on attachment and social competence (Groh et al, 2014), externalizing behavior (Fearon et al., 2010), and internalizing symptoms (Groh et al., 2012), with the hypothesis that early insecurity would be more strongly associated with lower levels of social competence and greater levels of externalizing and internalizing symptomatology than with negative temperament. As in those prior meta-analyses, where there was sufficient data, we examined the association between father-child attachment and temperament, with the hypothesis that-similar to mother-child attachment-insecure father-child attachment would be weakly associated with negative temperament.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The abstracts of these articles that were written in English or another language understood by the authors or their collaborators (French, German, Japanese, Spanish, Korean) were reviewed and a large number of irrelevant articles were discarded (e.g., non-empirical papers, studies of adults), resulting in a total of 249 remaining articles. The authors examined each of these articles according to the criteria described below. Additionally, 30 relevant articles were obtained by searching the reference lists of the obtained empirical articles and narrative reviews of the literature (e.g., Mangelsdorf & Frosch, 1999;Vaughn & Bost, 1999;Vaughn et al., 2008).\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Behavioral inhibition, shyness, and sociability are core temperament dimensions that are assessed via several temperament questionnaires and observational procedures, and thus, were included in this meta-analysis. Temperament was assessed using questionnaires completed by parents and observations rated by trained observers, nurses, and pediatricians. In two cases, temperament questionnaires were completed by teachers in addition to mothers (Badanes, 2010;Kemple, 1990). Because these were the only two studies employing teacher-reports, only the mother-reported temperament data were included in analyses. Articles were only included if they used observational assessments of attachment security, such as the SSP (Ainsworth et al., 1978), the Cassidy and Marvin Preschool Attachment system (Cassidy, Marvin, & \nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved Susman-Stillman et al., 1996). The same procedure was followed for studies that reported longitudinal data in which temperament was assessed several times over the course of development (e.g., Planalp & Braungart-Rieker, 2013). If more than one type of temperament assessment was administered at the same time point (e.g., questionnaire and observation; Mangelsdorf, McHale, Diener, Goldstein, & Lehn, 2000), these data were combined. Some studies reported results separately for boys and girls. In these cases, we calculated separate effect sizes for each sex, and the subsamples were treated as independent samples in analyses. Some studies reported on data from twins (e.g., Bokhorst et al., 2003). For these studies, one member of the twin dyad was selected to ensure independent data. Seven papers also reported on outcome data for father-child attachment security. These articles were included in a separate meta-analysis on the association between father-infant attachment and temperament. In total, after excluding reports involving overlapping samples, 129 studies were identified yielding 131 independent samples comprising 18,968 children that could be included in the meta-analyses, with sample sizes ranging from 10 to 6,850 (see Table 1). We winsorised (Tabachnik & Fidell, 2001) the sample size of the largest study (Rispoli et al., 2013) to N=900 to avoid excessive influence of this study, resulting in an effective total of 13,018 children included in the meta-analyses. Some studies used the AQS to measure attachment, which does not yield data on the different sub-types of insecurity. As a result, these studies only appear in the metaanalyses involving the overall contrast between security and insecurity. In addition, some studies only reported on data for specific attachment classifications (e.g., resistant versus not-resistant attachment; Fagot & Kavanagh, 1993). In such cases, data from these studies are only represented in analyses for which relevant data were reported.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved (observer, mother) was coded, since the mother-reported AQS has been shown to be problematic in terms of validity (Van IJzendoorn, Vereijken, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & Riksen-Walraven, 2004). In addition, to test the claim that emotional responding, but not attachment security, within the context of the SSP might be associated with temperament, when available, coders extracted data at the level of attachment sub-classifications grouped according to the Belsky & Rovine split (i.e., A1-B2 vs. B3-C2). In some cases, either the mean, standard deviation, or number of children in attachment categories was not reported. To obtain such crucial data, authors were contacted for fifteen studies. In eleven cases, the authors were able to provide the relevant information.

The agreement between the coders across the moderator variables was 97%.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved temperament (scores on positive dimensions were reversed before being combined with negative dimensions). A set of moderator analyses were conducted to determine whether variables listed above increased or attenuated the association between attachment and temperament. In these meta-analyses, we compared temperament of the children in each attachment classification with all other classifications combined (e.g., insecure-avoidant vs. not-avoidant), parallel to our previous meta-analyses (Fearon et al., 2010;Groh et al., 2012;Groh et al., 2014). As a follow-up, we also compared the secure classification with each insecure classification (e.g., secure vs. insecure-avoidant) as the most 'pure' reference category and each insecure classification with each of the other insecure classifications (e.g., insecure-avoidant vs. insecureresistant) in a separate set of analyses on a smaller set of studies with pertinent data. To examine the link between emotional reactivity expressed within the context of the SSP and temperament, a meta-analysis on the relation between attachment sub-classifications categorized according to the Belsky and Rovine (1987) split (A1-B2 vs. B3-C2) and temperament was conducted. Following up this main set of meta-analyses, we also examined whether the association between attachment and temperament varied according to temperament theoretical tradition and temperament dimension. These meta-analyses focused on (partially) overlapping groups of participants. For example, some studies reported data from multiple temperament dimensions (e.g., Seifer et al., 1996). Thus, 85% confidence intervals were reported to allow for exploratory comparisons (see below). Concerning the analyses on temperament theoretical tradition, we divided the overall negative temperament composite into studies that differed in theoretical approach to the operationalization of temperament. Studies that employed questionnaire assessments of temperament were characterized as pertaining to one of four main theoretical orientations and separate meta-analyses for the dimensions of negative temperament from each of these theoretical traditions (Thomas & Chess difficulty, Buss & Plomin [negative] emotionality, Bates fussiness/difficulty, Rothbart negative affectivity) were conducted in relation to attachment security, avoidance, resistance, and disorganization. Concerning temperament dimensions, temperamental fearful distress (e.g., behavioral inhibition, distress to novelty, approach [reverse scored], shyness), irritable distress (e.g., general fussiness, anger, distress to limitations), and positive emotionality (e.g., general positive affect, sociability) were examined in relation to attachment security, avoidance, resistance, and disorganization. These three dimensions were specifically examined in the current report because\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved of relevant theoretical arguments in the literature concerning their potential relation to attachment (e.g., Goldsmith et al., 1986;Kagan, 1992;Lewis & Feiring, 1989) and because sufficient numbers of studies were available to conduct these meta-analyses. To facilitate comparisons across temperament dimensions, the direction of all positively-valenced temperament dimensions (e.g., positive emotionality) were reversed for analyses. Thus, higher scores on all temperament dimensions reflect greater levels of negative temperament. The meta-analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) program (Borenstein, Rothstein, & Cohen, 2005, Version 2). For each study, an effect size (d) was calculated as the standardized difference between the two pertinent groups (e.g., secure vs. insecure). In studies using continuous attachment scores (e.g., studies reporting on the AQS) associations were re-expressed as Cohen's d (see Mullen, 1989, andMullen andRosenthal, 1985, chapter 6, for the formulae for transformation of various statistics into Cohen's d). Effect sizes indicating a negative relation between negative temperament and attachment security and avoidance (e.g., lower levels of negative temperament in the secure group compared to the reference group) were given a positive sign. Effect sizes indicating a positive relation between negative temperament and attachment disorganization and resistance (e.g., greater levels of negative temperament in the resistant group compared to the reference group), were also given a positive sign. Thus, a positive combined effect for the set of studies comparing resistant children with non-resistant children on negative temperament would mean that across studies the level of negative temperament in resistant children was higher, on average, than among other children. Using CMA, combined effect sizes were computed. Significance tests and moderator analyses were performed using random effects models, as this approach is considered to be most widely applicable and conservative (Borenstein et al., 2005). Random effects models allow for the possibility that there are random differences between studies that are associated with variations in procedures, measures, and settings, that go beyond subject-level sampling error, and thus point to different study populations (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). To test the homogeneity of the overall and specific sets of effect sizes, we computed Q-statistics (Borenstein et al., 2005). In addition, we computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the point estimate of each set of effect sizes. Q-statistics and p-values were also computed to assess differences between combined effect sizes for specific subsets of studies grouped by moderators. Again, the more\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved conservative random effects model tests were used. Contrasts were only tested when at least two of the subsets consisted of at least four studies. When the children in two sets of studies (partially) overlapped (e.g., some studies reported on multiple types of temperament assessments, and we wanted to compare the combined effects for these sets), it was impossible to directly compare effect sizes across these sets. We computed 85% confidence intervals for the point estimates of the combined effect sizes in the two sets; non-overlapping 85% CIs indicate a significant difference between combined effect sizes. This approach of comparing 85% CIs serves as a conservative significance test (Goldstein & Healy, 1995;Van IJzendoorn, Juffer, & Klein Poelhuis, 2005). For each study, Fisher's Z scores were computed as well-distributed equivalents for the effect size d, and the Z scores were standardized to test for outliers. For the main analyses, no outliers (standardized Z-values smaller than -3.29 or larger than 3.29; Tabachnik & Fidell, 2001) were found for study effect sizes. observer-AQS), was found to significantly impact the association between attachment and temperament. Specifically, in the 69 studies using the SSP, the combined effect size for attachment security and negative temperament decreased to d = 0.08 (see Table 2), which was\nThis article is protected by copyright.

In 51 studies involving N = 5,950 children and their mothers, the insecureavoidant attachment classification was differentiated from the other classifications, and in these studies the combined effect size was not significant, d = 0.10 (see Table 3). The set of studies was heterogeneous, and we found two moderators explaining some of this heterogeneity. The temporal relation between attachment and temperament assessments was a significant moderator, Resistance. The largest combined effect size for the association between attachment and negative temperament was found for mother-child resistant attachment, with a significant d = 0.30 across 55 studies including 6,268 children (see Table 3). The temporal design of the study was a significant moderator, and concurrent assessments of negative temperament and attachment resistance yielded the highest effect sizes (d = 0.47). Furthermore, using behavior observed in the context of the attachment assessment (e.g., within the SSP) as an index of temperament inflated the association from a combined association of d = 0.23 in studies assessing temperament independently of attachment to a combined association of d = 0.77 in studies assessing temperament within the context of the attachment assessment.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved Only a small set of studies on father-child attachment and temperament were available. Accordingly, we were only able to conduct meta-analyses on negative temperament in relation to father-child attachment security, avoidance, and resistance.

All rights reserved insecurity (vs. security) and infant negative temperament was d = 0.14. According to conventional criteria established by Cohen (1992), an effect of d = 0.20 is considered small in magnitude. Thus, although the combined association between attachment insecurity and negative temperament reached statistical significance, the magnitude of this effect falls below the conventional criteria of being considered small in magnitude. Moreover, this combined effect decreased to d = 0.08 in the set of 69 studies using the SSP, providing no support for the claim that the SSP is in essence a measure of infant temperament (Kagan, 1982). Similarly, in a smaller set of studies comprising seven independent samples (N = 647) on the association between father-child attachment insecurity and infant negative temperament, the combined association was non-significant (d = 0.15). Thus, these meta-analytic findings provide little empirical support for the idea that temperament and attachment are essentially overlapping constructs. Rather, they are aligned with conclusions from some narrative reviews of the literature (Mangelsdorf & Frosch, 1999;Vaughn & Bost, 1999;Vaughn et al., 2008;Vaughn & Shin, 2011) that temperament and attachment security are different and weakly related constructs. We also examined the empirical support for potential rapprochements to the traditional attachment-temperament debate that have claimed that attachment and temperament might be associated in an oblique manner . For example, it has been contended that temperament plays a role in helping determine the pattern of insecure attachment that an infant develops with the caregiver. Findings from the current metaanalysis provide mixed support for this idea. Specifically, avoidant attachment was not significantly associated with lower levels of negative temperament (d = 0.10). However, similar to findings from Goldsmith and Alansky's (1987) \nThis article is protected by copyright.

That said, the association between resistance and temperament is noteworthy, especially when considering that to date twin studies have not had adequate power to examine genetic contributions to infant resistance. Thus, given current evidence, some genetic influence on resistant attachment cannot be ruled out, which in turn may be explicable in terms of temperamental negativity. Testing such a hypothesis would require large twin samples given the modest associations involved and the relatively low prevalence of resistant attachment. In addition, there might be methodological reasons to expect some relation between temperament and resistant attachment. For example, reports of temperament include affective items pertaining to parent-child interactions and standardized observational assessments of temperament (e.g., LAB-TAB; Goldsmith, Reilly, Lemery, Longley, & Prescott, 1999) are often conducted with the parent present, which might confound the assessment of temperament with attachment. It is also important to note that the hallmark of resistance is hyperactivation of the attachment system. Accordingly, when confronted with attachment-relevant challenges, resistant infants exhibit heightened distress in addition to strong levels of proximity seeking (combined with either anger or inconsolability) and little independent exploration (Ainsworth et al., 1978;Cassidy & Berlin, 1994). Thus, the modest association identified here between temperament and resistant attachment might in part be due to overlap between aspects of the behavioral definitions of temperament and attachment. The current meta-analysis did not provide support for another potential rapprochement to the traditional attachment-temperament debate offered by Belsky and Rovine (1987) that infant temperament is reflected in emotional reactivity distinguished by the grouping of A1-B2 versus B3-C2 attachment sub-classifications. Despite some similarity between the heightened levels of distress exhibited by securely attached children receiving the B3 and B4 sub-classifications and resistant children (C1-C2), this similarity is typically restricted to the beginning of the reunion episodes of the SSP during which B3 and B4 children do indeed display heightened levels of distress. Importantly, however, in contrast to resistant children, B3 and B4 children's separation distress is relieved upon the caregiver's return and these children typically resume exploring the environment with or without their caregiver by the end of the reunion episode (Ainsworth et al., 1978;Van IJzendoorn, Goossens, Kroonenberg, & Tavecchio, 1985). Taken together, the absence of a significant meta-analytic association between the Belsky and Rovine (1987) split\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved and negative temperament might be taken as indirect evidence for the difference between highly distressed secure children (B3-B4) and resistant children, ultimately providing further evidence that the SSP is not an appropriate context in which to assess infant temperament. Following-up findings from a prior meta-analysis published over 15 years ago (Van IJzendoorn et al., 1999), we also examined the meta-analytic association between infant disorganization and temperament. In the current meta-analysis, the dataset was almost twice as large, yet similar to findings from the prior meta-analysis in which the combined association between disorganization and negative temperament was found to be almost precisely zero, the combined effect size in the current, updated report was also found to be non-significant, d = 0.11. In another meta-analysis on parenting precursors of disorganized attachment, Madigan and her colleagues found that infant disorganization was rather strongly associated with frightened, frightening, or anomalous parental behaviors, amounting to a combined effect size of r = .34 (d = 0.70; Madigan et al., 2006). Taken together, evidence from the current meta-analysis, in combination with findings from Madigan and colleagues' meta-analysis (2006), suggest that disorganized attachment is more strongly rooted in parental interactive behavior than in a temperamental basis of infants' general negativity. Importantly, some methodological factors moderated the meta-analytic association between attachment and temperament. Specifically, converging with findings from a prior metaanalysis on the validity of the AQS (Van IJzendoorn et al., 2004), the magnitude of the association between attachment and temperament was inflated in studies employing the motherreported AQS. Because parents are not trained observers of infant behavior, they might be at a disadvantage in terms of their ability to differentiate negative temperamental characteristics from dyadically-grounded insecure attachment behaviors. Similarly, associations between attachment and temperament were inflated when temperament was assessed within the context of the attachment assessment (e.g., fear of stranger, distress at separation). These findings indicate that although using a parental assessment of attachment or assessing temperament and attachment within the same procedure might be an appealing strategy to reduce assessment costs and participant burden, there is sufficient evidence to advise against such practices. As this is the fourth in a series of meta-analyses on early attachment, it is well-positioned to evaluate the association between attachment and temperament within the context of evidence for the broader developmental significance of early attachment. Specifically, in addition to being\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved presumed to be independent of temperament, early attachment is thought to have the strongest implications for children's interpersonal relationships and important, yet weaker, implications for children's behavioral and emotional problems (Belsky & Cassidy, 1995). Thus, the association between attachment and temperament would be expected to be not only weak in magnitude, but also weaker in magnitude than associations between attachment and children's social competence and to a lesser extent, attachment and externalizing and internalizing symptomatology. Providing some support for the expected relative associations with attachment across developmental domains, findings indicated that the association between early security and temperament was weaker in magnitude than the associations between early security and children's social competence and externalizing behaviors, yet comparable in magnitude to the association between security and internalizing symptoms. Such evidence indicates that early attachment security has the strongest associations-at least with regard to 'main effect' associations-with children's subsequent social interactions with peers and the weakest associations with children's internalizing symptoms and negative temperamental reactivity. Similarly, in contrast to meta-analytic evidence that early avoidant and disorganized attachment significantly heighten children's risk for psychopathology and undermine their peer competence, neither of these attachment classifications were significantly associated with negative temperament. However, the association between resistant attachment and negative temperament was comparable in magnitude to the modest association between resistant attachment and social competence and both of these associations were significantly stronger than the association between resistant attachment and internalizing symptomatology. These findings provide evidence of a non-trivial association between early resistant attachment and temperament, although the nature of the association, as already discussed, is open to a range of interpretations.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved temperament and attachment differed according to how temperament was operationalized. Interestingly, no significant differences in the strength of the associations between temperament and attachment quality were found according to whether negative temperament was operationalized with respect to the four main theoretical traditions of temperament. Moreover, for the most part, these more \"pure\" operationalizations of temperament were not significantly associated with attachment quality. A similar pattern of findings was obtained when examining the meta-analytic associations of attachment classifications with the more specific temperament dimensions of fearfulness, irritability, and positive emotionality. Taken together, despite the potential drawbacks of summarizing across various aspects of temperament, findings from analyses using the negative temperament composite largely converge with those from analyses in which more homogenous dimensions of temperament were used. That said, it is important to note that several other dimensions of temperament have been examined in relation to attachment, but the limited number of relevant studies reporting on the same dimension of temperament did not permit meta-analytic examination of these other temperament dimensions. Another potential limitation of meta-analysis is that publication bias might lead to an imprecise estimation of the true effect size in the population. Although this is a valid concern that warrants attention when conducting meta-analyses, publication bias does not seem to be a serious concern in the current dataset for several reasons. First, the temperament-attachment literature is characterized by contrasting theoretical perspectives and thus contrasting expectations. There was and is, to our knowledge, no consensus about what to expect for the associations between attachment and temperament: some researchers would predict finding a significant association, others would not. Thus, publication bias favoring significant results seems less of an issue for this particular literature. Second, in many studies the test for the association between temperament and attachment was a secondary analysis for a project designed to test other hypotheses, and was reported to describe the sample involved or to justify covariates in primary analyses. It simply was not the central topic of many papers, which arguably lowers the chance that researcher-and publication-biases play a role. Third, the combined effect size we found for attachment security and negative temperament was small, which means that the empirical effect sizes must be distributed to the positive as well as the negative direction of this estimate, with not much room for publication bias or correction thereof (Sutton, Duval, Tweedie, Abrams, & Jones, 2000).\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved In conclusion, the current meta-analysis provides evidence for a significant, yet weak association between attachment security and temperament, suggesting that attachment and temperament are relatively independent developmental constructs. However, this study also yielded evidence of a somewhat larger association between one sub-type of insecurityresistance-and temperament. Both these lines of evidence suggest, albeit in different ways, that an important goal for future research is to develop novel approaches for integrating research on attachment and temperament that, as a result of the attachment-temperament debate, has historically been conducted in separate, parallel literatures. Toward that end, the differential susceptibility framework (Belsky, 1997;Ellis, Boyce, Belsky, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & Van IJzendoorn, 2011) provides a theoretical model for how to integrate these two important developmental constructs . Specifically, infant temperamental characteristics (e.g., distress proneness) have been conceptualized as susceptibility factors that serve to heighten children's sensitivity to environmental factors, such as attachment, for better and for worse. Recent research has provided some support for this idea (Gilissen, Koolstra, Van IJzendoorn, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & Van der Veer, 2008, McElwain, Holland, Engle, & Wong., 2012Stupica, Sherman, & Cassidy, 2011;c.f. Lickenbrock et al., 2013; see Vaughn & Bost, in press), but further research is necessary to determine whether the differential susceptibility framework might serve as a rigorous theoretical framework for bridging attachment and temperament perspectives on child development.

The purpose of the current meta-analysis was to provide a comprehensive quantitative review of the literature on attachment and temperament. For that reason, all dimensions of temperament that have been examined in relation to attachment were included in this meta-analysis. An additional goal of the current meta-analysis was to compare the meta-analytic association between attachment and temperament with the meta-analytic associations in our prior work between attachment and (1) social competence with peers-defined as social skills, peer interaction quality, and social status (see, Groh et al., 2014); (2) externalizing symptomatologydefined as aggression, oppositional problems, conduct problems, and hostility (see, Fearon et al., 2010); and (3) internalizing symptomatology-defined as depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, and somatic complaints (see, Groh et al., 2012). To ensure that outcomes included in these prior meta-analyses were not included in the current meta-analysis, the following outcomes were excluded from the current meta-analysis: (a) peer competence (e.g., positive affect expressed within interactions with peers), (b) externalizing behavior (e.g., aggression), or (b) internalizing symptoms (e.g., social withdrawal).

This study was included in the meta-analysis because similar to other observer-reported AQS studies, trained observers completed sorts after two or more hours of in-home observations and attachment security as measured with this version of the AQS has been found to be associated with maternal sensitivity (Roisman & Fraley, 2008). In cases where more than one attachment assessment was used (e.g., SSP followed by AQS at a later age) the earliest assessment was selected. In cases when the SSP or a modified version of the SSP was administered at the same time point as the AQS (e.g., Stevenson-Hinde & Shouldice, 1990), the SSP or modified SSP was selected because they provide information on insecurity sub-types and the AQS does not.
