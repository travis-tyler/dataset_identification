Women who had radiation before surgery or intraoperative radiation therapy were excluded. Women who did not have hysterectomy, or whose performance of nodal assessment was unknown were excluded. Women who had stage IV cancer or unknown stage were also excluded. Patients were classified based on nodal assessment codes as having undergone sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping, lymphadenectomy (LND), or no nodal assessment (no LND). Among patients who had a code for SLN mapping, additional non-sentinel nodes could be taken and discovered by the pathologist. We determined if they had a concurrent lymphadenectomy when review of the operative report confirmed that a regional lymph node dissection followed the SLN. In cases of failed SLN mapping, lymphadenectomy was usually performed and patients were classified as having SLN with concurrent lymphadenectomy. If no further regional lymph nodes were dissected, patients were classified as having SLN mapping only. The number of nodes removed was recorded for each group of patients. Demographic data included age (<50, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, \u226580 years), race (white, black, Hispanic, other, unknown), year of diagnosis, and insurance status (private, Medicaid, Medicare, uninsured, other governmental/unknown). Income was measured by median household income in the patients' zip code and was classified as <$38,000, $38,000-$47,999, $48,000-$62,999, $63,000+, or unknown. Education was measured by the percentage of adults in a patient's zip code who did not graduate from high school, and classified as \u226521%, 13-20%, 7.0-12.9%, <7%, or unknown. Location was estimated by matching the patients' state and country FIPS code to rural-urban continuum codes from the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, and classified as metropolitan, urban, rural, and unknown. Comorbidity was measured using the Deyo adaptation of the Charlson's comorbidity score, and grouped as 0, 1, or \u22652 comorbid conditions (15). Tumor stage was derived from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) pathologic staging groups, and classified as IA, IB, I NOS, II, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, and III NOS (not otherwise specified). Other tumor characteristics included histology (endometrioid, serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, sarcoma, and endometrial cancer not otherwise specified [NOS]/ other) and grade (well, moderate, poorly, unknown). Hospital characteristics included facility region (northeast, midwest, south, west, unknown) and facility type defined by the American Cancer Society's Commission on Cancer Accreditation program (academic/ research, community cancer, comprehensive community cancer, integrated network cancer, other/unknown). Radiation therapy was classified as combination, external beam, brachytherapy, or none/unknown."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Frequency distributions between demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients and the scope of lymph node dissection were compared using \u03c7 2 tests. The number of lymph nodes removed in the SLN group was reported descriptively as means (standard deviation [SD]), and medians (interquartile range [IQR]). To examine predictors of having undergone SLN mapping, we fit mixed-effect models adjusting for age, race, year of diagnosis, insurance status, income, location, comorbidity, facility type, region, stage, histology and grade to compare patients who underwent SLN mapping to those who underwent lymphadenectomy and to compare patients who underwent SLN mapping to who had no nodal assessment. The treating facility was included as random effect to account for hospital-level clustering. To examine predictors of any type of radiation (external beam, brachytherapy or combination) among stage I patients who had SLN mapping or LND, we fit mixed-effect models adjusting for all demographic and clinical characteristics and scope of lymphadenectomy. A similar model was fit for predictors of external beam or combination radiation. To account for the data quality concerns in the accuracy of treatment data collected from more than one hospital in the NCDB, sensitivity analyses were performed limiting to patients who were reported from only one CoC-accredited hospital. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). All hypothesis testing was two-sided and a P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "A total number 54,039 women were identified including 38,453 (71.2%) who underwent lymphadenectomy, 1929 patients (3.6%) who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and 13,657 (25.3%) who did not undergo nodal assessment ( Figure 1, Table 1). Among women treated in 2013, 2.8% underwent SLN biopsy, while 4.3% of those treated in 2014 underwent SLN biopsy (P<0.001). When limited to women who underwent some form of nodal assessment, either SLN biopsy or lymphadenectomy, 3.8% in 2013 and 5.8% in 2014 underwent SLN biopsy. In the cohort of women who had SLN biopsy, 863 (45.4%) were coded as having only undergone SLN biopsy while 1038 (54.6%) underwent concurrent lymphadenectomy ( Table  2). The median number of lymph nodes removed was 3 (IQR, 2-4) in those who underwent SLN biopsy alone and 14 (IQR, 9-21) in patients who had a concurrent nodal dissection. Among women who underwent nodal assessment (either SLN biopsy or lymphadenectomy), a patient treated in 2014 was 60% more likely to undergo SLN biopsy than if that patients had been treated in 2013 (aRR=1.60; 95% CI, 1.46-1.76) ( Table 3). Likewise, a patient treated at a community cancer center was 72% more likely to undergo SLN biopsy than if she was treated at an academic center (aRR=1.72; 95% CI, 1.04-2.86). In contrast, women with more advanced stage disease, sarcomas or carcinosarcomas, and those with poorly differentiated tumors were less likely to undergo SLN biopsy (P<0.05 for all). Similarly, compared to women treated in the northeast, those who received care in the Midwest and south were less likely to undergo SLN biopsy (P<0.05 for both). When the analysis was limited to women who either underwent SLN biopsy or no nodal evaluation, women with 2 or more comorbidities (versus none) and those in the south (versus northeast) were less likely to undergo SLN biopsy (P<0.05 for both) ( Table 3). Patients with moderate and poorly differentiated neoplasms (versus well differentiated) were more likely to undergo SLN biopsy. Among women with stage I tumors who underwent nodal assessment, there was no association between use of SLN biopsy (compared to lymphadenectomy) and use of radiation (aRR=0.92; 95% CI, 0.82-1.05). Likewise, SLN biopsy was not associated with either external beam radiation alone or in combination with brachytherapy (aRR=0.98; 95% CI, 0.70-1.36) use. These results were unchanged in models limited to patients who received all care at only one facility."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study suggests that the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy for women with endometrial cancer is increasing. While a number of non-clinical factors contribute to uptake of SLN biopsy, women with non-endometrioid, poorly differentiated, and more advanced stage tumors are less likely to undergo SLN biopsy and are still more likely to have lymphadenectomy. Performance of SLN biopsy in lieu of lymphadenectomy is not associated with a higher rate of use of adjuvant radiation. Sentinel lymph node biopsy techniques have been developed to reduce the morbidity of nodal assessment for a variety of solid tumors and the procedure has recently been utilized for endometrial cancer. Initial data for the procedure was largely based on institutional case series, but more recently, multicenter prospective clinical trials have also reported the performance characteristics of SLN biopsy (9,16,17). The SENTI-ENDO study included 133 patients and reported a sensitivity of 84% and negative predictive value of 97% for sentinel lymph node biopsy (18). More recently, the FIRES trial enrolled 385 patients with endometrial cancer and reported successful sentinel lymph node mapping in 86% of subjects. The sensitivity for detection of nodal metastases was 97% with a negative predictive value of over 99% (19). The role of any form of nodal assessment in endometrial cancer remains controversial. Two large, randomized trials both demonstrated that lymphadenectomy was not associated with improved survival (6,7). However, proponents of lymphadenectomy argue that the procedure allows not only prognostication but also allows more tailored adjuvant therapy (4,20). In the United States, many practitioners have shifted from universal lymphadenectomy to performance of the procedure in women with higher risk features (21). In 2014, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (22) included SLN biopsy as part of their accepted algorithm for staging. We noted that women with lower risk tumors (grade 1, superficially invasive) were more likely to undergo SLN biopsy and those with higher risk features preferentially underwent lymphadenectomy. While the value of nodal assessment in such low risk patients is questionable, surgeons may have been hesitant to apply a new technology to women at higher risk for nodal disease. While based on limited data, some studies have suggested that SLN mapping may also be used in higher risk histologic subtypes (23)(24)(25). Encouragingly, these findings suggest that there was no association between use of SLN mapping and use of radiation in women with stage I tumors. A concern with implementation of SLN mapping is that clinicians may lack confidence in the ability of the technique to detect metastatic spread and prescribe adjuvant radiation therapy (4,26) These findings suggest that this is not the case. Women with stage I tumors who underwent SLN biopsy were no more likely to receive radiation therapy than those who underwent full lymphadenectomy. In addition to clinical factors, we noted substantial regional variation in performance of SLN biopsy; patients in the northeast were much more likely to undergo the procedure than women in other parts of the U.S. Prior work has also demonstrated that patients undergoing robotic-assisted surgery are substantially more likely to undergo SLN mapping (27). SLN mapping is not unlike other new techniques and technologies in which non-clinical factors influence diffusion (28). While the study benefits from the inclusion of a large cohort of patients, we recognize several important limitations. First, coding for sentinel lymph node biopsy for endometrial cancer in the NCDB is relatively new. As such, we cannot exclude the possibility of misclassification of a small number of women. Second, we are unable to capture women who had an attempted sentinel node biopsy but for technical reasons underwent only full lymphadenectomy. Technical considerations are an important consideration for any new surgical technique. Third, while we can account for a number of clinical and demographic characteristics, there are undoubtedly unmeasured confounding factors that influenced treatment choice and outcomes. Lastly, given the favorable prognosis of endometrial cancer, our study is underpowered to detect small differences in survival or use of radiation. Further work is clearly needed to further monitor the association between sentinel lymph node biopsy and use of adjuvant therapy and survival. In conclusion, the use of sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer is increasing rapidly. There does not appear to be an association between use of sentinel lymph node dissection and use of adjuvant radiation. To date, the majority of the patients who underwent SLN mapping had low risk, early-stage tumors and more data is clearly needed among women with higher risk cancers. With increasing surgeons experience, improvements in detection rates and developing technology, SLN mapping will likely play a more prominent role in lymph node evaluation.
