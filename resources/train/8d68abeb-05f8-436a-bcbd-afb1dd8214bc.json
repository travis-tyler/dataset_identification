The increased use of agricultural contracts is one of these significant structural changes in organizing the production and marketing of crop and livestock commodities. For instance, in 2003 producers used marketing and production contracts to market 39% of the value of U.S. agricultural production, up from 28% in 1991 and 11% in 1969 (MacDonald and Korb, 2006 . According to USDA statistics, the concentration of the food manufacturing industry has also been increasing with the mean industry four-firm concentration ratio increasing from 35% in 1982 to 46% in 1997. An important policy question is whether the increased concentration in the processing industry and the increased use of agricultural contracts are a desirable result of cost efficiencies in production or the undesirable effect of market power from the agribusiness processors (Ahearn, Korb, and Banker, 2005) .\nAgricultural contracting is typically studied using the principal-agent economic framework. In this framework, using contracts instead of spot markets can include improved risk management and reduced production and transaction costs. Despite these benefits, the increased use of agricultural contracts raises concerns that contractors may exploit market power by deterring other contractors from entering a local market or by reducing the prices paid for agricultural commodities, especially when there is little competition from other local buyers.\nContracting in the livestock industry is particularly controversial where a few meatpackers handle most of the livestock purchases while quantities sold on the spot markets continue to decrease. In response to these concerns, Congress has passed laws and considered proposals in an effort to regulate livestock contracts and require mandatory price reporting.\nThe literature examining agricultural contracts is relatively small mostly due to the fact that data on commodity contracts are scarce. Most empirical studies examining marketing and production contracts have explained the factors affecting the adoption of various types of contracts (e.g. Katchova and Miranda, 2004; Davis and Gillespie, 2007) or have made comparisons between contract and independent producers (e.g. Key, 2004; Key, 2005; Wang and Jaenicke, 2006; Xia and Sexton, 2004; Zhang and Sexton, 2000) . Many studies have examined market power in the processing industries, finding that processors exercise market power but the price distortions are small in magnitude. These studies have typically estimated the new empirical industrial organization (NEIO) structural models with aggregate industry-level data (for an overview see Sexton, 2000) . However, because of the spatial nature of agricultural production, transportation costs, and commodity perishability, many farmers are restricted to selling their production within their geographic areas. Therefore, instead of examining competition among the largest processors, this study proposes a new approach to examine price distortions due to processor concentration, where competition from local buyers such as other contractors and spot markets play an important role. In other words, this study examines agricultural contracting from a farmers' perspective rather than a processing industry's perspective.\nThe objective of this study is to examine whether agricultural processors exercise market power by testing for significant price differences in absence of competition from other local buyers. The propensity score matching method is used to compare contract prices, after first matching contracts on their propensity score to ensure comparisons of contracts with similar 3 characteristics. The empirical models are estimated with contract data for several crop and livestock commodities using a farm-level national, representative survey. The analyses are conducted from a farmers' perspective by examining agricultural contracts and comparing their price competitiveness based on alternative marketing options available to farmers. The main contribution of this study is evaluating the consequences of increased processor concentration on agricultural contract prices using an innovative methodology of propensity score matching. The results reveal important insights into the price competitiveness of agricultural contracts and market power exercised by commodity processors."}, {"section_title": "Propensity Score Matching Method", "text": "The propensity score matching method was first suggested by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) .\nWhile this method has been extensively used in other fields, this is one of the first studies in agricultural economics to apply it to study the price competitiveness of agricultural contracts. The method is designed to estimate the average effects of a program, treatment, or regime, between treated and control units. When data come from observational studies as opposed to experimental studies, the assignment of units to treated and control groups is not random, and therefore the estimation of the effect of treatment may be biased due to the existence of confounding factors. The propensity score matching method reduces the bias in comparisons between the treated and control groups. This is accomplished by comparing outcomes for treated and control units that are as similar as possible. Treated and control groups are matched to eliminate the effects of the confounding factors. Because it is infeasible to match units based on a multi-dimensional vector of characteristics, these characteristics are summarized using a 1 Only two other agricultural economics studies were found that used the propensity score matching method to examine farmland price differences (Lynch, Gray, and Geoghegan, 2005) and the impact of food aid (Gilligan and Hoddinott, 2007). single-index variable, called a propensity score. After the propensity score is calculated, the units from the treated and control groups are matched based on their propensity score in order to compare the differences in outcomes between the two groups.\nThe goal is to estimate the difference between the prices received for agricultural contracts that have competition from other local buyers (the treated group) and those that do not (the control group), accounting for the effects of exogenous factors influencing the assignment of contracts into one of these two groups. In order to evaluate the effects of the availability of alternative marketing options on contract prices, all analyses are conducted with data at the contract level for various commodities. For each commodity, we observe n contracts, indexed by i = 1\u2026n. In our context, the outcome variable Y is the price received for an agricultural contract of a particular commodity, and the treatment D is whether the farmer has alternative More formally, the price outcome Y can be expressed as:\nThe propensity score is defined by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) to be the conditional probability of receiving treatment given pre-treatment characteristics,\n( )\nThis propensity score is used to match treated and control units in order to estimate the difference in outcomes, also known as the Average Treatment on the Treated (ATT):\nMore specifically, the ATT is the difference between two terms with the first term being the outcome for the treated group which is observable and the second term being the outcome for the treated group had it not been treated, representing a counterfactual situation which is unobservable and needs to be estimated. Here, we are interested in the difference between the prices for contracts with alternative marketing options and the prices they would have received have they not had alternative marketing options.\nThe propensity score p(X i ) is used to match treated and control units as closely as possible based on their characteristics X i . However, the probability of two units having exactly the same propensity score is zero, since the propensity score is a continuous variable. Various \nwhere n T is the number of treated units, p i is the propensity score of unit i, ( ) G \u22c5 is a kernel function, and h n is a bandwidth parameter.\nWith nearest neighbor matching, each treated unit i is matched with one control unit j that has the closest propensity score. The nearest neighbor matching set of control units is given by:\nThe method is applied with replacement, i.e., a particular control unit can be a best match for several treatment units. After matching treated and control units, the difference between the outcome of the treated units and outcome of the matched control units, ATT NN , is calculated as follows:\nwhere the weights\nThe quality of the matches can also be improved by imposing a common support restriction, when control units are included in the analysis only when their propensity scores fall within the range of propensity scores for the treated units. A drawback of the common support is that high quality matches near the boundaries of common support may be lost and the sample size may be considerably reduced. Analyses with and without common support are used to test for the sensitivity of results.\nTwo key assumptions are employed by the propensity score matching method. According to the balancing property assumption, observations with similar propensity scores p(X) must have the same distribution of observable characteristics X, independent of the treatment D, or formally:\nIn other words, for a given propensity score, exposure to treatment is random, which implies that treated and control units are observationally identical and therefore the outcomes for these two groups can be directly compared. The balancing property assumption is tested and confirmed that it is satisfied after the propensity score matching models are estimated.\nThe unconfoundedness assumption states that if the assignment to treatment is unconfounded, i.e.,\nthen the assignment to treatment is unconfounded given the propensity score, i.e,\nPut differently, the unconfoundedness assumption asserts that characteristics that may affect the outcomes are observable and included in the model. This is an implicit assumption used in the estimation of all economic models."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "The propensity score matching method has two major advantages. First, the method compares prices for contracts with similar characteristics, after first matching on their propensity scores. Second, unlike the traditional Heckman approach, the propensity score matching is a non-parametric approach and therefore does not assume a particular functional form for the price variable. Price comparisons for treated and control contracts are first analyzed using simple ttests without controlling for exogenous factors. Then propensity score matching models are estimated, after matching contracts on their propensity scores. (1) none, (2) both cash sales and other contractors, (3) only cash sales, and (4) only other contractors. These four codes were regrouped into contracts having other local contractors versus those that do not, and contracts having local spot markets versus those that do not."}, {"section_title": "Data and Simple Comparisons", "text": "of farms in the U.S. that each farm in the survey sample represents. All estimations are weighted so that the results are representative of all marketing and production contracts used by U.S.\nproducers.\nSeveral commodities are considered depending on whether there were a sufficient number of contracts in the data to support the estimations. The criteria for inclusion were commodities that had at least 200 contracts in the data set over the three years 2003-2005 and that the contracts were of the same type (production or marketing) and the same measurement unit for the quantity marketed. Based on data availability, the study includes marketing contracts for corn for grain, soybeans, winter wheat, upland cotton, and milk and production contracts for broilers. Table 1 shows the number of contracts included in the ARMS data for each commodity, the number of \"treated\" contracts with alternative marketing options (other contractors or spot markets), the number of \"control\" contracts without alternative marketing options, and the proportion of contracts with alternative marketing options. There are over a thousand contracts in the sample reported for corn, soybeans, milk, and broilers for [2003] [2004] [2005] . The availability of alternative marketing options differs based on the commodities farmers produce. Most farmers producing crops have both other local contractors and local spot markets. About two-thirds of the marketing contracts for corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton were located in areas with other contractors, and even higher proportion of these contracts (about 83-95%) had local spot markets. About 77% of milk marketing contracts had other local contractors, but only 23% had local spot markets. About half of the contracts for broilers were located in areas with other contractors, while only 3% of them had local spot markets. Because poultry producers have almost nonexistent spot markets, comparisons based on the availability of local spot markets are not done for this commodity.\nBefore applying the propensity score matching approach, simple t-tests are used to compare contract prices for the treated group of contracts with alternative marketing options and the control group of contracts without other local buyers. In order to eliminate the effects of price outliers, contract prices for each commodity are censored at the 1st and 99th percentiles.\nThe qualitative results are similar without price censoring. Table 2 shows for each of the commodities the average price for all contracts, the average prices for the treated and control groups of contracts, the price differences between the two groups, the price differences expressed as a percent of the average price for all contracts, and ttests for the significance of these price differences. The simple t-tests show that most commodities do not have significant contract price differences depending on the availability of alternative marketing options. Significant differences are found for corn contracts which have 3.8% higher prices when there are other local contractors and 7.4% higher prices when there are local spot markets. These simple t-test results for groups of contracts with and without alternative marketing options provide evidence that most contractors do not exercise market power by offering lower contract prices in absence of competition from other local buyers.\nThe results from the simple t-tests may be biased because the assignment of contracts into the treated group (with other local buyers) and the control group is not random. If confounding factors, such as the geographic location and farm and contract characteristics, affect both the contract's propensity for having alternative marketing options and contract prices, then such factors need to be incorporated in the analysis before contract prices are compared."}, {"section_title": "Propensity Score Matching Results", "text": "The propensity score matching methodology involves a two-step estimation. The first step is to estimate a probit model for the contract's propensity to have alternative marketing options depending on contract and farm characteristics. The predicted probabilities from the probit model, also called propensity scores, are used to match each treated contract (with alternative marketing options) to one or more control contracts (without alternative marketing options).\nTwo matching techniques are used: kernel matching and nearest neighbor matching. The second step is to estimate the ATT (average treatment on the treated) price differences between treated and control contracts. T-tests are used to conclude if these differences are statistically significant.\nThe first step of the propensity score matching models is to estimate a probit model for the propensity of a contract to have other local buyers based on contract and farm characteristics.\nSeveral factors are hypothesized to affect the contract's probability of having alternative marketing options and/or contract prices. The geographic region where the farm is located and the year the commodity is marketed may determine the availability of access to other buyers as well as the prices received for the commodities. Five regions are considered: the South, chosen as the reference dummy variable, the Midwest, the Plains, the West, and the Atlantic region.\nIndicator variables for different years are also included in the models. Contract characteristics such as the quantity marketed with each contract, whether the contract specified premiums tied to commodity attributes, contract length, and whether the contractor is a cooperative or a privately owned processor may affect access to markets and contract prices. Finally, farm characteristics such as farm size and farmer age and education are included in the models. The overall results and conclusions turned out to be robust with respect to several alternative specifications of the propensity score models. contract quantity, premiums tied to commodity attributes, contract length, and type of contractor also affect the access to other local buyers for some commodities. Estimated coefficients and independent variables from the probit models are used to calculate a propensity score (the predicted probability from the probit model) for each contract to have alternative marketing options."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "Each treated contract (with alternative marketing options) is matched to one or more control contracts (without alternative marketing options) using kernel matching or nearest neighbor matching. With kernel matching, each treated contract is matched with a weighted average of all control contracts with weights that are inversely proportional to the distance between the propensity scores of the treated and control contracts. With nearest neighbor matching, each treated contract is matched with one control contract that has the closest propensity score. After establishing a group of control contracts with as similar as possible propensity scores to the treated contracts, the contract prices in the two groups can be statistically compared.\nThe second step of the propensity score matching analysis involves estimating the average treatment on the treated (ATT) effects, calculated as the difference between the contract prices for the treated group (with alternative marketing options) and the prices for the control group of contracts without alternative marketing options but with similar propensity scores of having other local buyers. Table 4 presents the results from the ATT price comparisons using kernel matching and nearest neighbor matching procedures. The top portion of the table compares contracts with and without other local contractors whereas the bottom portion compares contracts with versus without local spot markets. The table shows the number of all treated contracts, the number of control contracts that are used as matches for the treated contracts, ATT price differences, ATT price differences expressed as a percent of the average prices, and t-statistics for the price comparisons. Kernel matching uses all of the control contracts, whereas the nearest neighbor matching procedure only uses a subset of these contracts that have the closest propensity scores to the treated contracts.\nThe ATT price differences in table 4 are measured in dollars and are also expressed as a percent of the average contract price for all contracts. The estimated ATT percent price differences for most commodities are relatively small in magnitude (less than 4% of the average commodity price) and not significant. These findings provide evidence that most processors do not exercise market power by offering lower prices on agricultural contracts in absence of competition from other local buyers.\nA few commodities exhibit significant ATT price differences. Cotton contracts tend to receive significantly higher prices if located in areas with other contractors. The ATT price difference for cotton is 3.5% of the average price using both matching methods and significant at the 5% and 10% levels using the kernel and nearest matching methods, respectively. These results suggest that cotton processors may be exercising market power by offering lower prices on contracts when there are no other local contractors present.\nCorn contracts located near spot markets receive 3.9% higher prices than comparable corn contracts without access to spot markets, and this difference is significant at the 5% level using both matching methods. Spot markets for corn are the most prevalent markets among commodities, with 95% of farmers having access to spot markets in addition to contracting in their areas. Therefore, corn producers with weaker bargaining positions who do not have alternative marketing options at harvest may be willing to enter contracts with lower prices. In summary, agricultural contracts for most commodities receive similar prices even if there are alternative marketing options available to farmers, indicating that most processors do not exercise market power.\nSeveral sensitivity analyses are conducted to ensure robustness of the results. Similar overall results are found for different comparison methods (simple t-tests and propensity score matching analysis), matching techniques (kernel matching and nearest neighbor matching; with and without the common support restriction for the range of propensity scores of treated and control contracts), data censoring (with and without price outliers), aggregation levels (at the contract level, using clusters for contracts belonging to the same farm, or averaging contract characteristics at the farm level), alternative categories (other contractors and spot markets in two categories or combined into one category), and alternative specifications of the propensity score models. Therefore, this study provides strong evidence that the increased contracting in U.S.\nagriculture likely is not associated with the exercise of market power by processors."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Policy Implications", "text": "This study examines the price competitiveness of agricultural contracts depending on the availability of alternative marketing options. Specifically, prices for marketing and production contracts are compared for farmers located in areas where other contractors and spot markets are present with prices that farmers would have received in absence of competition from other local buyers. This study addresses the important question of whether processors exercise market power by testing if prices on comparable agricultural contracts are significantly lower when other marketing channels are not available.\nThe propensity score matching method is used to estimate price differences after matching on the contract's propensity to have alternative marketing options. The two-step method includes estimating a propensity score as a first step and then calculating the average treatment on the treated (ATT) effect on prices for contracts with similar propensity scores.\nContract data for six commodities (corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, milk, and broilers) are obtained from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey. The findings from the first-step models show that the propensity for access to alternative marketing options depends on the geographic region, year, and contract and farm characteristics. The second-step estimation results presenting the ATT differences in prices indicate that the presence of other local buyers does not lead to significant differences in contract prices for most commodities. The exceptions are significantly higher prices received for cotton contracts if other local contractors are present and higher prices for and corn contracts with local spot markets. Overall, the results show lack of significant price distortions in agricultural contracts depending on access to alternative marketing channels. These findings are consistent with the explanation that the upward trend in contract use is likely not due to the exercise of market power by processors but may be due to other factors such as increased efficiency associated with the vertical coordination in the production and marketing of agricultural commodities.\nThe increased use of contracting and processor concentration represents key trends in the industrialization of agriculture. For example, commodities such as tobacco and hogs moved rapidly toward more contracting over the last decade. Contracts now dominate the exchange of several commodities such as tobacco, cotton, rice, broilers, and hogs. Other commodities such as corn, wheat, and soybeans continue to be sold predominantly on the spot markets. This study provides evidence that the absence of local spot markets does not lead to lower contract prices for the commodities considered in this study, except for corn which has prevalent spot markets.\nFrom a government policy perspective, the shift away from spot markets toward contracting facilitates the traceability of food and food ingredients in the agri-food chain. The increased vertical coordination in the production and marketing of agricultural commodities is typically associated with ensuring food safety and delivering quality assurances to consumers, especially when commodity attributes are not easily observable.\nThe shift from spot markets to contracting also raises concerns about whether spot markets will be a viable option in the future. As more quantities are marketed with contracts, the lower traded volume on the spot markets may induce a tipping point where the thinness and uncertainty of spot markets may force independent producers to accept contracts (MacDonald et al., 2004) . This study shows that the absence of spot markets does not lead to the exercise of market power by the processing industry, which means that additional regulations regarding the increasing concentration of processors may not be needed at this time. Even so, government intervention is still necessary to ensure that there is no loss in price information because of contracting. The Congress and USDA have recently proposed to reauthorize the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 to ensure transparency of commodity prices when the sector undergoes structural changes toward more contracting. Price transparency is of crucial importance for farmers since the consolidation in the processing industry may lead to a decreasing bargaining power for producers.\nPrevious studies have examined market power with using the NEIO structural models and aggregate industry-level data and have concluded that the processing industry is exercising market power but it is small in magnitude (for overview see Sexton, 2000) . In contrast, this study used farm-level contract data to examine imperfect competition among local processors uniquely from a farmers' perspective by taking into consideration the spatial nature of agricultural production and marketing. Using different approach, models, and data, the findings here are also consistent with the limited evidence for market power in the processing industry found in other studies. While the absence of local competition from other buyers currently does not lead to lower prices, the bargaining power of farmers will likely continue to weaken as more production shifts to contracting with larger processors. Therefore, policy makers need to "}]
