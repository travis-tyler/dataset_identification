As hurricane patterns change, it can be expected that hurricane damage risks and costs may change as a result. This indicates the necessity to develop hurricane risk assessment models that are capable of accounting for changing hurricane hazard patterns, and develop hurricane mitigation and climatic adaptation strategies. This thesis proposes a comprehensive hurricane risk assessment and mitigation strategies that account for a changing global climate and that has the ability of being adapted to various types of infrastructure including residential buildings and power distribution poles. The framework includes hurricane wind field models, hurricane surge height models and hurricane vulnerability models to estimate damage risks due to hurricane wind speed, hurricane frequency, and hurricane-induced storm surge and accounts for the timedependant properties of these parameters as a result of climate change. The research then implements median insured house values, discount rates, housing inventory, etc. to estimate hurricane damage costs to residential construction. The framework was also adapted to timber distribution poles to assess the impacts climate change may have on timber distribution pole failure. This research finds that climate change may have a significant impact on the hurricane damage risks and damage costs of residential construction and timber distribution poles. In an effort to reduce damage costs, this research develops mitigation/adaptation strategies for residential construction and timber distribution poles. The costeffectiveness of these adaptation/mitigation strategies are evaluated through the use of a Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis. In addition, a scenario-based analysis of mitigation strategies for timber distribution poles is included. For both residential construction and timber distribution poles, adaptation/mitigation measures were found to reduce damage costs. xxi Finally, the research develops the Coastal Community Social Vulnerability Index (CCSVI) to include the social vulnerability of a region to hurricane hazards within this hurricane risk assessment. This index quantifies the social vulnerability of a region, by combining various social characteristics of a region with time-dependant parameters of hurricanes (i.e. hurricane wind and hurricane-induced storm surge). Climate change was found to have an impact on the CCSVI (i.e. climate change may have an impact on the social vulnerability of hurricane-prone regions).  . This is a significant increase from the annual average of $6 billion, recorded from 1989-1995, and an even more significant increase from the average recorded from 1950-1989 of $1.6 billion in damages annually . Furthermore, it is projected that insures in the U.S. have paid more than $110 billion in losses due to hurricane events . Despite these increases in damage costs, the coastal population of the U.S. continues to grow. For example, insured coastal property values in Florida have increased by 55% from the year 1988 to 1993, from $566 billion to $872 billion . In 2003, approximately 153 million people reside in counties along the U.S. coastline . This is an increase in population of 33 million since 1980, and it is estimated that the U.S. coastal population will increase by 12 million in 2015 (W&PE 2003). The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) has stated that rising sea surface temperatures (SST) are a direct result of the changing global climate. Increased hurricane activity has been recorded in the Atlantic Ocean since 1995 ). However, whether this increased activity can be directly tied to the rising SST of the Atlantic Ocean is a matter of debate. Studies ,  do show that there is an apparent connection between the two increases. On the other hand, studies  attribute the increased hurricane activity to the natural variability of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. Whether or not climate change is the driving factor, it cannot be disputed that hurricane activity has increased significantly in the Atlantic Ocean in recent years. Hurricane risk assessment models must be able to account for the potential effects of climate change on hurricane damage costs, by incorporating the non-stationary aspects of various hurricane parameters. However, existing models, such as  and , that estimate hurricane damage costs as a function of wind speed, assume that the wind speed does not change with time. Hurricane damage costs within a region are not solely affected by the intensity of the hurricanes that make landfall. Hurricane frequency and hurricane-induced storm surge can also account for a portion of damage costs. For instance, four hurricanes made landfall in Florida during a six week period in 2004 , and it is estimated that hurricane-induced storm surge cause about 60% of damage costs due to Hurricane Katrina in (NWS 2006. These facts indicate the necessity of accounting for hurricane frequency and including hurricane-induced storm surge in a comprehensive hurricane risk assessment. Because climate change has the potential to result in more devastating hurricane events and coastal populations continue to grow, a descriptive index that considers the effects of climate change could be invaluable in the assessment of the social vulnerability of hurricane-prone areas. Social vulnerability is a combination of a region's capacity to respond and recover from a natural hazard, with minimal damage . Therefore, it is important to identify the societal factors that have the greatest affect on hurricane vulnerability and combine them to create an index which describes the hurricane risk for the region . The purpose of this paper is not to examine whether there is a direct relationship between climate change and changing patterns of hurricane hazard, nor to endorse any specific scenario of climate change (or lack thereof). Instead, a framework is proposed for a comprehensive hurricane risk assessment to account for the potential impact of climate change.\nThis paper presents a probabilistic-based framework to assess the potential hurricane Retrofit; Risk assessment; Uncertainty; Vulnerability."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review and Critical Appraisal", "text": "The following provides a comprehensive literature review on Climate Change, "}, {"section_title": "Climatic Change and its Impact of Natural Hazard Patterns", "text": "Rising sea surface temperatures (SST) are accepted as a direct result of the global climate change as stated in a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007). Studies have suggested a relationship between the rising sea surface temperatures and hurricane intensity (Webster et al. 2005). Emanuel (2005) concluded that for every increase in SST of 1\u00b0C the peak wind speed of hurricanes could increase by approximately 5%. Elsner (2006) confirmed findings that climate change results in higher SST, and higher SST translates to more energy that can be converted to stronger hurricane winds. If SST increase by 2.2\u00b0C,  and  estimated that hurricane intensity may increase by 5% to 10%.  added that increases in hurricane intensity of this magnitude may result in the increase of the destructive power of hurricanes by approximately 25%. Knutson et al. (2010) estimates that in the 21st century hurricane wind speeds may increase by 2% to 11% around the world. The CCSP (2008) found that the frequency of hurricanes may increase as hurricane wind speeds increase. In contrast,  and Knutson et al. (2010) estimate that globally the average number of hurricanes will decrease by -6% to -34% as a result of global climate change, but Knutson et al. (2010) also states that the occurrence of higher intensity hurricanes (Category 4 and 5) may increase.  verifies these findings by stating that due to the changing global climate the frequency of hurricanes in general will decrease, but that the number of very intense hurricanes may increase. Climate change might not only affect the wind speeds and frequency associated hurricanes, but also the storm surge produced by hurricanes. The IPCC (2007) estimates that global sea levels have increased by 10 to 20 cm over the last 100 years, and predicts that in the 21st century the global average sea level may increase by an additional 40 cm as a direct result of climate change. For example, it is estimated that the sea level along Florida's Atlantic coast may increase at a rate of 2 mm per year over the next 100 years. This increase in sea levels translates to hurricane-induced storm surges that are riding on higher sea levels that are capable of travelling farther inland .  found that the vulnerability of coastal communities in the U.S. to flooding will increase as a result of higher sea levels due to climate change. The New York City Panel  Larsen et al. (2007) conducted a study which concluded that between now and 2030, the changing weather climate, could potentially add $3.6 to $6.1 billion to public infrastructure costs. If a larger time frame is assumed, between now and 2080, it could add $5.6 to $7.6 billion, assuming that government agencies adapt infrastructure to changing conditions."}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty, Risk, and Probabilistic Analysis", "text": "There is a great uncertainty in hurricane risk assessment , in particular under the impact of climate change . Despite the uncertainty on the possible change of wind speeds in the U.S., information is available from other locations. Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO) (2007) and  suggest that there will be an increase in wind speed of 5% to 10% by 2050 in Queensland, Australia. A recent study by  indicates that 5% to10% increase in wind speeds in the U.S. may be possible. Two groups of uncertainty, i.e. aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty, can be identified within hurricane risk assessment. Aleatoric uncertainty arises because of the unpredictable, random nature of the physical system under study. On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty is due to the lack of knowledge of the system in respect to quantities and processes within the system. Aleatoric uncertainty cannot be reduced only identified and quantified, while epistemic uncertainty can be reduced through more comprehensive study. Epistemic uncertainties can be quantified through a thorough sensitivity analysis. Within the research, the aletoric uncertainties include the frequency and intensity of hurricane wind speeds and the magnitude of hurricane-induced surge, because of the inherent randomness within these parameters. The epistemic uncertainties are found where assumptions are made within this research, such as increase in annual maximum wind speed in 50 years, increase in surge heights, the vulnerability functions, annual house growth rate, building inventory within a region, assumed discount rate, and nonuniform housing prices of a region. There is also uncertainty with regards to the potential changes in storm surge height. As previously stated, the IPCC (2007)  On the other hand, using IPCC predictions (i.e. increase of 20 cm over 50 years), the surge height of Hurricane Andrew would increase by 4%. Epistemic uncertainties are not limited to the effects of climate change on various parameters of hurricanes (i.e. wind speed and surge height), but are also present where assumptions are made in modeling residential construction and power systems Huang 2008, Ellingwood and. These epistemic uncertainties should be identified and addressed within a comprehensive hurricane risk assessment, and ultimately, reduced if possible through a more detailed study or survey. Epistemic uncertainties relating to the modeling of residential construction include the number of single-family units, annual growth rate, the distribution of houses, the median house value, etc. Similarly, epistemic uncertainties are identifiable within the modeling of the power system, and these include the spatial distribution of distribution lines, the median replacement cost of a distribution pole, the number of customers, etc. Epistemic uncertainties can also be identified within the vulnerability models utilized within the framework for both the hurricane intensity and hurricane-induced surge, as these are often simplified models that are based on assumptions of the housing population. Current hurricane risk assessment models assume that wind speeds are stationary with time, meaning that the past is representative of the future (Stewart et al. 2003, Li and. Climate change effects, by definition, must take into account nonstationary aspects of wind climatology. Some studies have been conducted exploring the effects climate change may have on residential construction in Australia. Li and Stewart (2009) proposed a risk-based framework for assessment of economic damage risks and costs caused by tropical cyclones in Queensland, Australia due to the possible change in wind speeds resulting from climate change.  evaluated the costeffectiveness of adaptation strategies in Queensland, Australia for cyclone damage risks due to climate change. Similar research is needed to investigate the potential effects of climate change on hurricane risk assessments in the U.S."}, {"section_title": "Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)", "text": "A Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) can be used to estimate the damage risk to incorporate the epistemic uncertainty in change in hurricane wind speed, i.e. the wind increase is a variable. How climate change will affect regional climates and pertinent variables (epistemic uncertainty) is not well known, limiting the ability to predict consequential effects. This figure is for illustration purposes only, as significant refinement is required to estimate probability distributions for future mean temperatures or other climatic variables (e.g. the COV for changes in wind speed) when new information is available (IPCC 2007). A presentation like this figure can also be modified to represent the cumulative damage of a region to allow making statements with certain confidence level, such as \"I am 95% confident that the wind damage for this region will be under $1.0 billion for an increase in wind speed of 5% over 50 years\". Such statement can be very useful in risk communication for decision making.

As stated previously, climate change may result in increased hurricane activity. Therefore reliability analyses should be capable of accounting for time-dependent changes to resistance (R) and applied load (S). For example, in some cases it can be expected that applied load may increase (e.g. increased hurricane wind speed due to climate change) while the resistance may decrease (e.g. degradation of strength in timber poles due to decay). In general, the time-dependent limit state function of a structural member or structural system is given as: where R(t) is the actual capacity at time t and S(t) is the actual load at time t. The limit state between failure and not failure is defined as G(t)=0. If the variables result in G>0, then the system has fulfilled its performance criteria, but if G<0, then the system has failed. The P(G>0) is defined as the reliability of the system, and the probability of failure is defined as P(G<0). In order to estimate the probability of failure, a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) will be utilized. A MCS involves repeated random sampling of R and S, where R and S are the resultant of various statistical distributions. The probability of failure can be estimated by counting the number of times G<0. where N is the number of times the Monte Carlo simulation was run."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Fragility Analysis", "text": "Hurricane fragility is defined as the conditional P f of a structural member or structural system as a function of wind speed . The structural fragility of infrastructure systems is often modeled as a lognormal cumulative distribution function (CDF) . where V is the 3-sec gust wind speed, m R is the median capacity or resistance, \u03be R is the logarithmic standard deviation of the capacity or resistance, and \u0424(\u2022) is the standard normal probability integral. Fragility curves are developed by plotting the conditional failure probability for an increasing wind speed.  investigated the vulnerability of distribution systems to winter storms and strong wind events. The study defined the fragility of distribution systems as the probability of damaged line length given a wind speed, plotting actual damage data from winter storms accompanied with strong winds against a lognormal curve. Because of the lack of data available, the study could not conclude that the fragility curve for distribution systems given wind speed follows a lognormal distribution similar to that of seismic damage .  plotted damage data due to wind speed from Hurricane Rita in order to assess the fragility of the distribution to hurricane winds. The analysis found that the damage data for Hurricane Rita due to wind speed follows a lognormal distribution. Hurricane fragility curves show the probability of failure of a structural member or structural system for a range of wind speeds. The probability of failure for the fragility curves is estimated with a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), as stated previously, which involves counting the number of times the load (S) exceeds the resistance (R). When creating the fragility curves, the wind speed (3-sec gust wind speed, V) is assumed to be a deterministic value which increases monotonically.\nHurricane fragility is defined as the conditional probability of failure of a structural member or structural system as a function of wind speed .

The most acceptable approach to estimating hurricane wind speeds is mathematical simulation , and this approach is used in developing design wind speed maps for the U.S., which are used in structural design (e.g. ASCE 1996). The simulation technique was first proposed by Russell (1968), and has been improved upon by , , , Neumann (1991), , and . The underlying approach is similar for these studies. The first step is identifying and obtaining statistical models of several site-specific key parameters (i.e. central pressure deficit, radius to maximum winds, heading, translation speed, and the coast crossing position). A Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) then samples the parameters generating a mathematical representation of a hurricane. The hurricane wind speeds are then recorded as the simulated hurricane passes through the site . As stated previously, the fundamental approach to the models is similar, but differences lie within the physical models of the hurricane, e.g. filling rate model and wind field Twisdale 1995, Vickery et al. 2000). In addition, other differences between the models include the size of the region in which the hurricane climatology is assumed to be uniform and the use of a coast segment crossing approach versus a circular subregion approach . The models do not model the entire track of the hurricane; therefore  pioneered the empirical track method (ETM) to simulate the full track of hurricanes from formation to dissipation. Recent research in the field (e.g. Lee and Rosowsky 2005, Powell et al. 2005, Rumpf et al. 2007 has improved upon the ETM approach. The ETM approach involves modeling the central pressure deficit as a function of sea surface temperature. As the storm evolves, the key parameters (listed above) are updated at pre-determined intervals, and at each interval the wind speed is recorded at all locations within the region. The ETM approach therefore allows for the modeling of larger areas, while previously wind speeds could only be modeled at specific locations where the statistical models of the key parameters were valid. However, a disadvantage of the ETM approach is that it results in an excessive amount of simulated hurricane events, from which it may be difficult to estimate regional damage risks within hurricane risk assessments. Despite the variations between hurricane wind field models, there is some consensus that hurricane wind speed in the U.S. can be modeled with a Wiebull distribution . Therefore, to estimate damage risks due to hurricane wind speed, the framework developed herein will employ the Wiebull distribution. Site-specific Wiebull distribution parameters will be estimated from the latest wind contour maps available for the U.S.  to estimate hurricane wind speed. Unfortunately modeling hurricane wind speeds with the Wiebull distribution does not account for hurricane occurrence rates. Therefore, the hurricane risk assessment framework developed herein will also model hurricane wind speeds with a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). The GPD allows for the inclusion of hurricane frequency in estimations of hurricane wind speed. In the following, a brief description of the GPD and its applications within wind modeling are provided. The \"peaks-over-threshold\" method involves the analysis of events that exceed a given threshold. The events above the given threshold can be described with the GPD ). An adequately chosen threshold will result in only true peaks, and these peaks have a Poisson arrival rate. Therefore, it is possible to model the occurrence rate of the events that exceed the threshold with a Poisson distribution )."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Wind Vulnerability Models", "text": "The most common approach for hurricane wind damage prediction models (i.e. hurricane vulnerability models) is to develop vulnerability curves for structures. A hurricane vulnerability curve presents the most likely mean damage a structure may sustain as a function of mean wind speed. For the development of vulnerability curves, the level of damage of the structure must be defined, e.g. whether looking at damage states (e.g. roof failure) or the percentage of overall damage as a function of wind speed. Vulnerability curves for structures are often derived from post-disaster damage data (e.g. claims data or damage surveys). This method however requires a large data set. In order to circumvent the need for large post-disaster damage data sets, probabilistic models have been developed to generate vulnerability curves for structures by making assumptions on the structures and environment. The generated curves can be validated with pre-existing data. This method can aid in generating damage curves for structures that have not yet experienced hurricane damage, but it is limited to the engineering judgment of the individual creating the model. For instance,  and  produced one of the first hurricane vulnerability models, creating vulnerability curves for various structures in Australia based on cyclone damage surveys.  established the relationship between the gradient wind speed and damage ratio, by utilizing insurance data. Mitsuta et al. (1996) utilized insurance claim information from Typhoons Mireille and Flo to establish a relationship between wind speed and damage. Similarly, Bhinderwala (1995) used insurance data from Hurricane Andrew to develop a vulnerability function as a percentage of loss as a function of mean wind speed at gradient height. Unfortunately, the direct applicability of these functions is limited, because these models are not equipped to take into account how building codes, materials, etc. have changed over time. Furthermore, these models are limited to application within the location from where the insurance information was obtained to create the vulnerability model (e.g. Mitsuta et al. (1996) in Japan and Bhinderwala (1995) in Southern Florida).  used a probability based simulation model to generate the vulnerability curve for a fully engineered building, assuming that the resistance capacity of the building is lognormally distributed; therefore, this model is solely applicable to fully engineered structures not residential construction. Sill and Kozlowski (1997) estimated damage as a function of various hurricane parameters (i.e. gradient wind speed, gust factor), mean house value, and two empirically derived values that determine how the rate of damage increase with wind speed. Because the empirically derived values were based on the experience and judgment of the researchers and not defined explicitly, this study is difficult to replicate.  developed a hurricane damage model for single family housing units using Southeastern U.S. insurance data from Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew. This particular model predicts the damage ratio which is the total amount paid by the insurer versus the total insured value. To develop the vulnerability model, the damage ratio is related to the recorded average mean surface speed of the hurricane. This model is limited in that it was derived from only two hurricane events; a much larger data set is required to more accurately predict future losses expected due to hurricane events.  broke the vulnerability curve into several curves to represent individual building types, translating known vulnerabilities for one region to another region by combining actual data and building inventory information for the region. This model is relatively simple, but as it is based on claims information, it is limited to the type of construction the claims data pertains to. Hurricane vulnerability models developed from regressive curve-fitting methods often have the capacity to estimate damage to only one specific type of construction (e.g. residential or timber), whereas the building inventory of most regions is comprised of many different types of construction. Hurricane damage prediction models should, ideally, be capable of accounting for potential changes within building inventory due to, for example, new codes, evolving building practices, and retrofit measures to reduce the vulnerability of existing structures. This has led to the development of component based hurricane vulnerability models, in which the vulnerability of individual components are combined.  set forth a model based on how different building components perform and their corresponding relative importance. Unanwa and McDonald (2000) developed a similar model that can be applied to an even larger area. Because current models assume that vulnerability is constant over time,  provide a way to model how the hurricane wind vulnerability of the building inventory of a region changes, due to ageing, upgrading, construction, new technology and new building codes. Pinelli et al. (2004) set forth a component based hurricane damage prediction model for residential structures, focusing on low-rise residential structures of different types that are common in Florida. The model uses Venn diagrams to illustrate the probability of damage for damage modes and sub-damage modes.  proposed a vulnerability model for wood-frame housing. This is an \"over-time\" model that focuses on the changes that take place within the building inventory. The HAZUS-MH Hurricane Model was developed to estimate the damage a hurricane event can cause. The track and wind field of a hurricane is modeled using a hurricane hazard model, which has been validated with historic hurricane data , FEMA 2008. The wind speed is calculated as a function of central pressure, translation speed, and surface roughness. The model classifies the building inventory of a region by the characteristics of the building envelope and frame, and is capable of calculating damage loss to building interior and contents (FEMA 2008). This model is component-based, accounting for the resistance capacity of building components, giving this model an advantage over previous curve-fitting models (Pinelli et al. 2004)."}, {"section_title": "HAZUS-MH Hurricane", "text": "Model is a vital tool in assessing the hurricane risk in a region, but it has its shortcomings as well  The model is restricted to only certain building types and may not be completely representative of a region. HAZUS-MH Hurricane Model calculates only direct economic loss and not the loss anticipated because of business interruption. Vickery et al. (2006)  The Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model (FPHLM) is capable of estimating both annual and scenario-based insurance costs to residential structures in Southern Florida (Pinelli et al. 2004). Like the HAZUS model, the FPHLM is component based; however it is not as complex as the HAZUS model. The model utilizes a component-based Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate the probability of damage to various components of a single family house. The model incorporates 217 combined damage states to estimate the percentage of damage given a specific wind speed for a residential structure. This model is comprehensive, and it utilizes a MCS engine that has compiled data for typical residential construction in Florida (e.g. building type and info on the various components: Openings, Shingles, Sheathing, Connections, and Walls). The MCS engine is used to estimate the percentage of damage for each combined damage state. From the damage estimated for each damage state, the mean overall damage for a structure is estimated (Pinelli et al. 2004). Unfortunately, the MCS engine is not available for public use at this time. In addition, proprietary damage prediction models have been developed within the private sector. Engineering firms were contracted by insurance companies in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. The purpose was to gain a better understanding of the vulnerability of structures to damage as the result of hurricane hazards. Unfortunately, not a lot of information on these proprietary models is available in the public domain. Despite the limitations of regressive curve-fitting models, the Huang model (2001) is implemented into the framework developed herein. The model was chosen for a number of reasons, including the fact that it was developed for single-family residential construction in the Southeastern U.S. which is the focus of the framework. Since the framework developed herein is not currently applied to other types of construction, this model is sufficient in estimating damage risks; however, the framework can be modified for other types of construction by modifying the hurricane vulnerability model. Huang's model is also relatively simple in its application. For the purposes of the analysis performed within this research, Huang's model provides an adequate estimate of hurricane damage as a function of wind speed. As more post-disaster data becomes available, models such as , can be modified to more accurately predict hurricane damage costs."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane-Induced Storm Surge Height Models", "text": "Hurricane-induced storm surges are difficult to predict due to the numerous variables that intertwine to create the storm surge. However, throughout the years studies have developed methods in an effort to predict future storm surge heights. The first numerical algorithms of storm surge began emerging in the 1960's (e.g. Harper 1969), and evolved with subsequent research (Wurtele et al. 1971, Mastenbroek et al. 1993). These early models used structured grids that are not capable of accurately portraying complex coastlines. This limitation prompted the development of unstructured grids throughout recent years that are able to more accurately represent complex coastlines. SPLASH was developed in 1972 to estimate storm surge along the east coast of the U.S. . It has since been replaced with the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH), which is a computerized model developed by the National Weather Service (NWS). SLOSH estimates surge height based on historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes by utilizing certain parameters (i.e. storm pressure, size, forward speed, forecast track, wind speeds, and topographical data) . A disadvantage of the SLOSH model is that it implements a structured grid which reduces the accuracy of surge height estimations along complex coastlines. The Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model is a finite element method used to simulate the circulation in coastal waters, and for forecasting storm surge height and propagation (Luettich et al. 1992). The ADCIRC model uses an unstructured grid for more accurate representations of complex coastlines. For example,  used the ADCIRC model to estimate hurricane surge along the coast of Mississippi. More recently, Westerink et al. (2008) used the ADCIRC model to develop a storm surge model for the Gulf of Mexico and part of the Western Atlantic Ocean. The particularly high resolution of the model allows for the prediction of surge heights with an absolute error that is less than 0.3m. The development of storm surge estimation models has been conducted around the world. After the destructive storm surge in the Bay of Bengal in 1970, extensive research has been developed (e.g. . For example,  found that the shape of the coastline affected the surge height. In addition,  used a fine grid model to estimate storm surge heights in the North Sea.  used an inundation algorithm to create a surge model for Australia.  suggested that storm size has an impact on surge height, and developed a storm surge model that combines the central pressure deficit, storm size, and storm forward speed to estimate surge height. This model is chosen to be implemented within the framework developed herein mainly because of the relatively simple regressive format of the model; furthermore, this model does not require the use of complex computerized models and the input parameters are readily available, therefore it is convenient for the nature of the developed framework."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane-Induced Surge Vulnerability Models", "text": "The National Flood Insurance Act (NFIA) of 1968 led to the creation of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP made it possible for homeowners to purchase insurance to protect against the potential losses caused by flooding . After the implementation of the NFIA, flood damage prediction has become increasingly important. Structural damage due to surge is not solely dependent on water depth, but factors such as duration, possible contamination, and flood velocity also contribute to the level of damage experienced by the structure. Because the lack of consistent data available and difficulty in integrating the various factors together, surge damage is generally related solely to water depth (e.g. , Van der Sande et al. 2003. As with hurricane wind vulnerability models, hurricane-induced surge vulnerability models involve the development of vulnerability curves, i.e. depth-damage curves, that plot the level of damage versus the surge height (i.e. water depth). The level of damage is often expressed as a percentage of the replacement cost of the structure or component of structure. Furthermore, depth-damage curves are often provided separately for components (e.g. structural components and contents). It is assumed that componentbased vulnerability curves (i.e. providing separate curves for components) are particularly essential in estimating flood damage as the location of components will significantly impact the level of damage experienced. Depth-damage curves have been developed by the U.S. Army Corps of America (USACE 1970) and the Flood Insurance Administration (FIA 1970). These damage curves are most often used to estimate potential damage as a result of flooding.  compared the USACE and FIA damage curves and found that the FIA curves are more reasonable. The USACE has since improved the FIA damage curves (USACE 2000(USACE , 2003. FEMA (2003) developed the Residential Substantial Damage Estimator (RSDE) to estimate substantial damage (i.e. more than 50% damage), but this approach is highly biased to the individual assessing damage. Skinner (2006) found that the depth ranges within the RSDE were too broad when the methodology was compared to claims data from Hurricane Katrina. Since, FEMA (2006) has developed HAZUS-MH Flood Model to estimate flood losses. The model estimates water depth as a function of the flood frequency, discharge, and ground elevation. The HAZUS-MH Flood Model includes over 900 depth-damage curves to estimate loss to various types of construction (Scawthorn et al. 2006). The model estimates direct damages, i.e. repair and replacement costs, to infrastructure. Current studies are not available on how accurately the HAZUS-MH Flood Model estimates losses due to hurricane-induced surge height, and this could be attributed to the fact that there is a lack of consistent post-disaster data on losses due to surge height ). However, as with the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Model, this model has the potential to become a vital tool in assessing the hurricane-induced surge vulnerability of a region. Studies have been conducted in an effort to identify and quantify relationships between water depth and other factors that contribute to surge damage. Pistrika and Jonkman (2010) implemented the depth-damage curves from the HAZUS-MH Flood Model to investigate the relationship between water depth and flow velocity and damage estimates using information available post-Hurricane Katrina. The study concluded that there is not enough information available to identify a clear one-to-one relationship between water depth and flow velocity. In addition,  concluded that both water depth and flux speed have a role in flood damage estimates for typical buildings in England. This framework will implement the flood loss methodology developed by . The flood loss methodology estimates flood damage to residential construction as a result of hurricane-induced storm surge, by using an assembly-based vulnerability (ABV) approach developed by Porter (2000). The methodology accounts for flood duration in addition to water height. The ABV approach involves dividing a building into components, and generating loss fragilities for each component based on building details and a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) for a range of flood depths and durations. From the loss fragilities, damage costs can be generated for each damaged component of the building. Finally, the total damage cost due to hurricane-induced storm surge is obtained by summing the damage costs of the components. This model is chosen because it is component-based, which is essential in flood depth estimations.  also provides default input values for the methodology for typical single-family residential construction which further underlines why this methodology was chosen to estimate damage risks due to hurricane-induced storm surge within the framework developed herein."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Risk for Power Distribution Poles", "text": "The power systems include three main components: the generation, the transmission, and the distribution. The generation plants produce power and are generally large facilities, located in a centralized location. The transmission system transports large, city-sized amounts of power long distances from the generation plant to the distribution substations. Transmission systems are comprised of lines that are approximately 150 ft high, strung between steel, lattice patterned towers that are 850 ft apart. The transmission lines carry power at voltage level greater than 34.5 kV and the network is typically parallel (i.e. there are two or more routes between two points for power to flow). The distribution system transports neighborhood-sized amounts of power several miles to individual customers. The distribution system includes lines that are 30 to 50 ft high, strung on timber poles, located 100 to 200 ft apart. The power carried by the distribution lines is at 34.5 kV or lower voltage levels, and the network is radial (i.e. one route between two points for power to flow) (Saadat 2002). The vulnerability of these three components to potential damage due to hurricane winds varies. As generation plants are few in number and are often designed to withstand high wind speeds, damage to the plants is rare. Damage to the transmission system is also rare because these lines and towers are designed to withstand high wind intensities, and they usually have large tree setbacks. The parallel network of the transmission lines also insures against lengthy or costly loss of power supply to communities ). The distribution systems (lines and poles), on the other hand, are the most susceptible to damage due to high wind intensities. This is mainly because more distribution lines and poles are exposed to hurricane winds than transmission systems, the distribution poles are not often designed to withstand high wind speeds )."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1.2: Generalized Schematic of Power System", "text": "Current hurricane risk assessments of the power system consider only current climate conditions , but studies are suggesting that the hurricane intensity/frequency may change as a result of the warming global climate; therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to explore the effects a changing climate may have on the failure rates of the power system.

As there are a large number of interconnected distribution poles within a distribution system, it is necessary to explore the reliability of the system as a whole. Furthermore, current hurricane risk assessments do not account for the effects degradation may have on the strength of timber poles. Climatic loads may change as a result of climate change, meanwhile the structural capacity of timber poles deteriorates as a distribution pole ages. Hurricane risk assessments of distribution poles must account for both the potential impacts of climate change and the effects degradation may have on distribution pole failure. In the following, an overview of distribution pole design is provided, including the degradation function implement to account for the effects of ageing."}, {"section_title": "Design of Timber Distribution Poles", "text": "Historically, distribution poles were designed using the deterministic method prescribed in the NESC standard (NESC 2002). The Allowable Stress Design (ASD) method is based on specific load factors and strength factors that are combined with zonal loading maps . The load and strength factors are determined based on the grade of the construction of the distribution poles. In order to maintain consistent (or uniform) reliabilities for distribution poles, the Load Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) method was developed by the ASCE Li 2006, Dagher 2001), and is now typically used in distribution (utility) pole design (ASCE-111 2006). LRFD is used to assess the performance of a distribution pole at various limit states. Limit states are used to describe a condition at which a structure stops fulfilling its intended purpose. Limit states are categorized as: Strength and Serviceability. Strength limit states define load-carrying capacity and include fracture, buckling, and excessive yielding,. Serviceability limit states define performance and include deflection, cracking, and vibration (McCormac 2008). The two design methods vary as they are based on different design principles. The following formulation can be used for both methods. where R n is the design (nominal) strength of the poles (e.g. design bending moment) and identified using design standards, \u00f8 is the strength factor, S n is the design (nominal) load, and \u03b3 is the load factor. When designing distribution poles, the design method should be specified and the corresponding load conditions identified (i.e. values for \u00f8 and \u03b3). Then the design load (S n ) is determined, and consequently the required design strength is determined by using Eq. (1.5). By means of the required design strength, the circumference of the pole at ground line can be estimated. Finally, from the circumference the class of the distribution pole can be established, from which the design strength (R n ) can be obtained from design standards (ANSI 2002). The two methods recommend different values for the strength (\u00f8) and load (\u03b3) factors. ASCE-111 (2006) recommends that the strength factor (\u00f8) be 0.79 for a ground line bending moment with a coefficient of variation (COV) of 20%, and that the load factor is \u03b3=1.0 for wind load. In addition, ASCE requires that the dead load should be adjusted with a factor \u03be= 1.1 when including the P-\u0394 effect. The NESC method also uses strength and load factors for the design of distribution poles (NESC 2002). Both factors are determined based on the grade of construction of the poles and the type of load being designed for. Distribution poles are defined as Grade C construction. The strength factor is \u00f8=0.85 when wind load is considered (NESC 2002). There has been much discussion on what the value of the load factor should be.  recommended a load factor of \u03b3=2.2 for transverse wind loading, while  suggested a value of \u03b3=1.75. Furthermore, Brown (2008) stated that distribution poles are typically designed with a load factor of \u03b3=2.2, but that the design load is reduced by half."}, {"section_title": "Design (Nominal) Load (S n )", "text": "A typical distribution pole system consists of a solid pole, three conductors, one neutral wire, and one communication wire; therefore, the design load of the distribution poles is affected by all these components, and adjusted with an amplification factor to account for the P-\u0394 effect: where S n is the design load (lb-ft), amp is the amplification factor (discussed below), F i is the wind force (N) on component i (Eq. 1.7), and h i (m) is the height of component i.

However, the strength of a pole degrades with age . Fungal attacks are the main contributor to the deterioration of strength in timber poles, because timber is an organic material . The key concern with fungal decay is referred to as in-ground decay, because the pole is in direct contact with the soil creating, in many cases, optimal conditions for fungal attacks . In order to ensure the integrity of the distribution pole, how the strength of the pole decays with time must be identified.  expressed the degradation of the strength of utility poles in the U.S. as an exponential decay function of the age of the poles. Similarly,  found that the degradation due to the ageing of utility poles in Norway can be represented with an exponential decay function. To model the degradation of the strength of distribution poles, the resistance within the limit state function (e.g. Eq. 1.1) of the pole must be modified to represent how strength deteriorates over time. The modified resistance (Eq. 1.13) is estimated for a specific age of pole, and used in Eq. 3to estimate the probability of failure after a specific time frame. where R(t) is the resistance after time t, a(t) is the degradation function, ME is the model error to take into account that the design values are not equal to the actual values, and R n is the design strength of the pole.

A more detailed appraisal is found within the literature review. Another step in a comprehensive hurricane risk assessment is to adapt the proposed framework to other vital infrastructure, such as the power systems. The power system often experiences failure because of extreme weather events (such as hurricanes) that cause loads that exceed the criteria of the power system design (Peters et al. 2007). With the potential increases in the intensity and frequency of hurricanes, it can be expected that the system may experience more failure; thus, resulting in an increased repair and/or replacement cost. This research has applied the proposed hurricane risk assessment framework to include power distribution poles, in an effort to produce a comprehensive hurricane risk assessment. Furthermore, this research will explore the cost-effectiveness of various adaptation/mitigation strategies for residential construction and distribution poles. Finally, a comprehensive hurricane risk assessment may include the social vulnerability of a region to hurricane hazards. As hurricane intensity and/or frequency may change as a result of climate change, it can be anticipated that the social vulnerability of a region may change as well. Therefore, in an attempt to quantify social vulnerability, this research has developed an index of vulnerability.

From the period 1950-1989, the US averaged $1.6 billion dollars annually in hurricane damage; this figure has increased dramatically for the period 1989-1995, to $6 billion dollars annually in hurricane damage [1]. It is estimated that the damage caused by Atlantic hurricanes in 2004 to 2005 was more than $150 billion dollars [2], mainly due to the devastating effect of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The population in hurricane prone areas of the US is increasing steadily; for example, insured coastal property values in Florida have increased by 55% from the year 1988 to 1993, from $566 billion to $872 billion [3]. With this steady increase in population and wealth to the coastal areas of the US, there is an evident increase in risk of potential hurricane damage. Due to the increase in sea surface temperature (SST), hurricane intensity and frequency may be affected, as indicated in the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [4]. However, whether a rising SST as a result of climate change alters hurricane (cyclone) intensity or/and frequency is still a matter for debate, mainly due to the lack of consistent data [5]. Some studies [6,7,8,9] show a direct connection between climate change and hurricane intensity. For example, it was suggested that every increase in temperature of 1\u00b0C could result in an increase of the peak wind speed of a tropical cyclone by 5% [7]. The destructiveness of hurricanes, defined by an index based on the power dissipation of hurricanes, has significantly increased since the 1970's due to an increase in SST [7]. On the other hand, some have suggested that the increased hurricane activities in recent decades is a result of a natural cycle in Atlantic cyclone activity, rather than a long-term trend due to climate change [10,11,12,13]. Current hurricane risk assessment models [e.g. 3,14] assume that wind speeds are stationary with time, meaning that the past is representative of the future. Climate change effects, by definition, must take into account non-stationary aspects of wind climatology. There are storm parameters other than wind speed that are subject to change due to sea surface temperature changes, for example, average translation speed (i.e. wind speed duration on structures), radius to maximum winds (i.e. size of the wind field and impact zone), trajectory, probability of impacting land, rate of inland decay, rainfall rates, etc.It has been suggested that the destructive potential of tropical cyclones could be indexed by a tropical cyclone Integrated Kinetic Energy scale [15]. However, the National Hurricane Center [16] believes that such scales will be ineffective in communicating the storm surge threat, as these scales do not consider the local factors that are critical in determining the actual impacts of the storm surge. The HAZUS-MH Hurricane Model was developed to estimate hurricane building damages. The track and wind field of a hurricane is modeled using a hurricane hazard model, which has been validated with historic hurricane data [19]. The wind speed is calculated as a function of the following parameters: central pressure, surface roughness, and translation speed. The model classifies the building inventory of a region by the characteristics of the building envelope and frame, and has the capabilities to calculate damage loss to the building interior and contents [20]. However, the model assumes that wind speeds are stationary over time, which cannot be used to estimate of hurricane losses when climate change is possible. The purpose of this paper is not to examine whether there is direct relationship between climate change and wind hazard, nor to endorse any specific scenario of climate change (or lack thereof). Instead, we aim to refine the process of hurricane risk assessment to account for the potential impact of climate change using scenario-based analyses, and to explore the cost effectiveness of various adaptation strategies that take the potential effects of climate change into account, including the cost-effectiveness of adaptation strategies when there is no change in wind field statistics. As the vulnerability model and wind contour map use wind speed, this paper focuses on using wind speed as the control variable for wind intensity as a starting point to look into this complex problem. The economic losses can be determined by convolving the hurricane wind model and the hurricane vulnerability model. There is a great uncertainty, both aleatoric and epistemic, in the hurricane risk assessment [17], in particular under the impact of climate change. Despite the uncertainty on the possible change of wind speeds, the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO) [21] suggests that there will be an increase in wind speed of 5% to 10% by 2050 in Queensland, Australia, and Vickery et al. [22] indicates that 5% to10% increase in wind speed. It is also important to explore the scenario of regional decrease in wind speed to account for the high variation in wind speed and a shift the regions of strong surface winds towards the poles. Pryor et al. [23] analyzed wind speed trends over the US for the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. They suggested that decrease in annual mean wind speeds is possible. In the paper, increases of -5% to 10% in mean annual maximum wind speed over 50 years are considered to account for the uncertainty in investigating the potential impact of climate change.\nStorm related power outages cause approximately $270 million in repair costs, annually, in the U.S. . Hurricane Rita in 2005 left 500,000 customers without power in Louisiana (LPSC 2005) and 1.5 million customers without power in Texas (PUCT 2006). After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, approximately 82% of customers in the Gulf Coast region lost power , and approximately 50% of customers in New Orleans, Louisiana were without power for six weeks after the hurricane made landfall . In 2004, during a six week period, four hurricanes made landfall in Florida, causing over $1 billion in damages to power systems, making it the most destructive hurricane season in Florida for utility companies . In 1992, Hurricane Andrew caused the failure of approximately 10.1% timber distribution poles, resulting in the loss of power to 44% of Florida Power and Light Company's customers (FP&LC 2006.  investigated damage to power systems as a result of winter storms that were accompanied by strong wind flows. The study found that hurricanes and winter storms produce similar failure probabilities to power systems.  also found, through an analysis of the damage to the infrastructure of the power system after Hurricane Rita, that high hurricane winds caused the majority of the damage. Despite the evident vulnerability of the power system to hurricane damage, approximately 53% of the U.S. population lives in coastal counties (Crosset et al. 2008). Florida utility companies have experienced a 20% increase in customers from 1994 to 2004 . The distribution systems (lines and poles) are the most susceptible to damage due to high wind. Reliability-based design methods for distribution poles were introduced in 1990, and have since been integrated into design standards . However, the performance of the distribution poles remained unknown, resulting in non-uniform reliabilities in time and space (Bhuyan and . Furthermore, the effect of pole strength degradation on hurricane risk assessment for distribution poles is not clear. Windborne debris and trees can also cause a considerable amount of damage to the power system . Debris includes anything that has been broken or destroyed. Debris and fallen trees combined with intense hurricane winds can be a serious problem to surrounding infrastructure. However, debris will not be included in the proposed framework, but it will be incorporated into this framework at a later time. Lastly, current hurricane risk assessments of the power system consider only current climate conditions , but various studies (e.g.  are suggesting that the hurricane intensity/frequency may change as a result of the warming global climate, which may result in an increased repair and/or replacement cost of distribution poles. For example, Peters et al. (2006) found that elevated CO 2 levels due to enhanced greenhouse conditions could result in an increase in hurricane wind speeds of 10%, which could in turn result in loads on power distribution lines that are 15% to 20% higher than the design criteria. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to explore the effects a changing climate may have on the failure probability of the power system. A typical distribution pole will be designed considering both design methods taking into account various loading conditions. Fragility curves will be developed for the distributions poles considering both new poles and existing distribution poles that have been subjected to degradation. Finally, both design methods will be used to assess the impacts climate change may have on the annual structural failure probability of the distribution pole. The purpose of this paper is not to examine whether there is a direct relationship between climate change and changing patterns of wind hazard, nor to endorse any specific scenario of climate change (or lack thereof). Instead, we aim to propose a framework for hurricane risk assessment of power distribution poles to account for the potential impact of climate change.\nEvery year power outages due to wind storms cause an estimated $270 million in repair costs in the United States (U.S.)   (LPSC 2005, PUCT 2006.

Furthermore, Florida utility companies have experienced a 20% increase in customers from 1994 to 2004 . It can be anticipated that more power systems will be needed to provide power to the increasing coastal population, and therefore, more power distribution systems may be exposed to hurricane hazards.  found that if building codes had been enforced, approximately 25% to 40% of insurance losses from Hurricane Andrew could have been avoided. Furthermore,  found that if buildings are retrofitted to comply with ASCE-7 1988, the hurricane vulnerability can be significantly decreased.

The Weibull distribution is an appropriate model of the 3-sec gust wind speed, at a height of 10m on open terrain for hurricanes in the US [14]. When non-stationary wind speed is assumed due to climate change, probability density function (PDF) of the distribution is: where v is the 3-sec gust wind speed, \u03b1 and u are time dependent parameters for the Weibull distribution. Miami-Dade County, Florida is the eighth largest county in the US, with a population of 2.4 million, making it the most populous county in Florida. It was chosen to illustrate the potential impact of enhanced greenhouse gases. In this study, wind contour maps from Vickery et al. [19] were used to calculate the parameters of the Weibull distribution. The parameters were found to be u(1)=27.36 and \u03b1(1)=1.77, corresponding to a mean maximum annual wind speed of 24.3 m/s, which is assumed to be the stationary wind speed if there is no climate change. The coefficient of variation (COV) of the maximum annual wind speed is 0.584. As there is no projection on how the change of wind speed will occur over time, it was assumed that the wind speed over a 50 year time period changes linearly regardless of climate change scenario. If wind speed increases by 10% in a 50 year time period, the mean maximum annual wind speed by year 50 is 26.7 m/s. The corresponding Weibull parameters are u(50)=30.0 and \u03b1(50)=1.77. The COV of 0.584 in year 1 was assumed to be constant for all the years in the 50 years time period. The Weibull parameters and the maximum annual wind speed for each year in the time period can be determined accordingly. Wind speed change between -5% to 10% in 50 years due to different climate change scenarios were explored in this study A hurricane vulnerability model estimates the building damage caused by hurricanes and various vulnerability models have been developed [27,28,29]. Huang et al. [30] developed a damage model for single family housing units using Southeastern US insurance data from Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew. This particular model predicts the damage ratio which is the total amount paid by the insurer versus the total insured value. To develop the vulnerability model, the damage ratio is related to the recorded average mean surface speed of the hurricane. Huang's damage ratio model is: where v is the mean surface wind speed . Huang's damage model and the Weibull distribution of maximum annual wind speeds are used to illustrate the probabilistic framework of estimating the damage hurricanes with the potential impact of climate change. Huang's model is relatively simple. There is a source of epistemic uncertainty associated with the fact that this model is used for both old and new construction, as new construction could be built to withstand higher design wind speeds. However, when more sophisticated vulnerability models become available, they can be incorporated into the framework developed herein to update loss estimates. Moreover, the analyses conducted herein are primarily aimed at assessing the comparative effects of possible climate change scenarios, such as percentage change in wind damages. This suggests that although the wind field and vulnerability models may be relatively simple, their use for comparative analyses is instructive and suitable for initial climate impact and adaptation screening."}, {"section_title": "Annual and Cumulative Damage", "text": "The expected annual damage can be determined by convolving the vulnerability function and the PDF of wind field model [14].

[30] was developed based on the mean surface wind speed with a 10-min duration. The wind contour maps in ASCE-7 are for 3-sec gust and a conversion factor of c 2 =0.7 was used to adjust the 3-sec gust stipulated in wind speed maps to surface wind speed for all the exposure categories, according to ASCE-7 [31]. To take into account the effects of exposure on wind speed, the location of houses was identified within this study. Huang et al. [30] identified three exposure categories: Foreshore (within 1 km from coast), with a gradient-to-surface conversion factor of c 1 = 0.90, Locations within l0 km inland, with a gradient-to-surface conversion factor of c 1 = 0.80, and all other locations further inland, with a gradient-to-surface conversion factor of c 1 = 0.72.

The expected annual damage remains constant for each exposure category when no increase in wind speed is assumed, and decreases and increases accordingly when decreases and increases in wind speed are assumed. The expected cumulative damage was calculated for all three exposure categories over a 50 year time period. When it is assumed that there will be no change in wind speed, the expected cumulative damage is 97.5% for foreshore locations, and 48.5% and 24.6% for locations within 10 inland and locations further than 10 km inland, respectively. Under an assumed increase in wind speed of 5% over a 50 year time period, the expected cumulative damage for foreshore locations is 113%.

Reports have stated that the majority of hurricane damage occurs to single-family units [33]. Therefore, within this study, damage is calculated for singlefamily units within each exposure category. According to [34], 20% of residential houses are located within 1 km of the shore, 60% of houses are located within 10 km from the shore, and the remaining 20% are located further than 10 km from the shore. The annual rate of new housing construction is calculated from information from the US Census Bureau for years 2000 and 2006 [35]. The annual growth rate was found to be 1.97%, or approximately m=2%. Therefore, the number of single-family units will increase from approximately 452,000 in 2000 to 1,216,000 units by the year 2050 if the annual growth rate is assumed to be constant at m=2%. These assumptions are used to perform a comparative risk analysis. The approximate median value of a single-family unit is $196,000 in Miami-Dade County [36]. The land price is assumed to be approximately 50% of the median value [37]. Therefore, the replacement house value is $98,000. Huang et al. [30] found that because homeowners often hold contents insurance, the insured value of a household is 50% greater than the house replacement value. Therefore, it is assumed that the insured value is 150% that of the replacement value, so the median insured value is C I = $147,000 in 2009 US dollars.   Figure 2.4 shows the expected damage costs L c (1,T) for wind speed change scenarios ranging from -5% to 10% and various time periods. If there is no change in wind speed, it can be estimated that damage costs will be $38 billion over 50 years. This value changes to $33, $44, and $51 billion for a change in wind speed of -5%, 5%, and 10%, respectively. The potential economic impacts of climate change are clearly significant if the wind speed increases with time. The figure also shows that total regional damage accelerates over time. wind speed of 5% with COV of 0.50 in year 50. This figure is for illustration purposes only, as significant refinement is required to estimate probability distributions for future mean temperatures or other climatic variables (e.g. the COV for changes in wind speed) when new information is available [38]. A presentation like this figure can also be modified to represent the cumulative damage of a region to allow for make statements with certain confidence level, such as \"I am 95% confident that the wind damage for this region will be under $1.0 billion for an increase in wind speed of 5% over 50 years\".

In comparison, using the framework proposed in this paper, it was found that in year 0, the annual regional damage to single family housing is about $966 million when calculating with the current median house value of $196,000. For comparison purposes, the annual regional damage is calculated again with data from 2000, and found that the annual regional damage is $613 million. The difference between the estimated value and the prediction found in HAZUS is approximately 8%, which is not unreasonable given the large uncertainty associated with regional hurricane loss estimation [17]. In addition, for the comparative purposes of this study and the assumption that the mean annual wind speed is applied to the whole region, the estimation using the proposed framework can be viewed as acceptable. Chen et al. [40] used the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model (FPHLM) to estimate the damage hurricanes may potentially cause in Miami, Florida. The FPHLM is an interdisciplinary online tool designed to estimate hurricane losses in Florida. The model estimates that a category 4 hurricane could potentially cause $12.8 billion in damages and a category 3 could cause $3.1 billion in damages to the city of Miami, using 2003 data. In comparison, the framework of this study was modified with demographic data for the city of Miami for 2003, and found that a category 4 hurricane, with wind speeds ranging from 58.3 m/s to 69 m/s, could cause up to $12.9 billion in damage, and a category 3 hurricane, with wind speeds ranging from 49.4 m/s to 58 m/s, could cause up to $3.2 billion in damage.

The retrofit case involves combining the reduction in structural vulnerability and the cost associated with strengthening construction [3]. After the LCC has been calculated with a reduced vulnerability factor R and the cost of retrofit has been established, the costeffectiveness of the retrofit scenario can be identified by comparing LCC to the case of \"do nothing\", i.e. existing vulnerability without retrofit. In Miami-Dade County, there are currently 452,000 single family housing units, with an annual growth rate of 2% (approximately 9,000 per year) [35]. According to [34], about 42% of buildings were built before 1970, about 30% built 1970-1985, about 17% built between 1986 and 1997, and 11% were built after 1998, which represent 189,800, 135,600, 76,800, and 49,700 houses, respectively.

The cost of retrofit (C st ) is assumed to be 1% to 50% [18] of the median insured house value, C I , for this analysis, which is assumed to be an additional cost, and the discount rate is set as 3% as before. The net benefit is: where the 'do nothing' L c (t,T) is given by Eq. (A2.4). The cost of retrofitting (C st ) depends on the required reduction in vulnerability, structural configuration, current design and construction practices, and local labor cost and availability of retrofit material; therefore it is difficult to estimate costs accurately [43]. is a relatively wide range of retrofit costs (C st ) for retrofitting existing housing construction. For example, according to Pinelli et al. [42], the mitigation cost for existing gable roof timber residential construction built before 1970s in Florida is around 15% to 25% of replacement value, depending on the region and retrofit details (e.g. shingle, roofto-wall connection, impact class, etc).

Every year a percentage (n=1% to10%) of construction built before 1970 (R=-15%) and located in foreshore locations was assumed to be retrofitted to the standards of construction built after 1998 (R=30%). Figure 2.6 shows that this strategy is cost effective for n=1 to 10% and C st =1 to 25%. This strategy is not cost effective if the cost of retrofit is greater than 26%. For example, if 5% of construction built before 1970 is retrofitted annually to after 1998 standards and the cost of retrofit is 15%, the net benefit is about $500 million. If only 2% of construction is retrofitted annually but the cost of retrofit is still 15%, the net benefit drops to $233 million. The cost of retrofit for existing houses is very unpredictable, and the cost of retrofitting is likely to be greater than 15% of the house replacement value [48].

The net benefit for n=5% and C st =15% could be potentially $650 million over 50 years. For strategy 4, all construction within the whole region built before 1986 was retrofitted to post-1998 standards. Figure 2.9 shows the net benefit considering n=1% to 10% and  Figure 2.11 shows adaptation strategy 5 when there is no change in wind speed. This figure shows that adaptation strategy 5 can be cost effective if wind speed characteristics in Miami-Dade County remain constant over a 50 year time frame. This strategy is not cost effective for R=50% if the cost of strengthening is greater than C st =15% and for R=80% when the cost of strengthening is greater than about 36%. The reduction of vulnerability in new construction by 50%, with a cost of strengthening of 5%, could reduce potential damages by $350 million even though there is no change in wind speed.

This implies that this adaptation strategy could result in a \"winwin\" situation for society. shows the cost effectiveness of the four adaptation strategies if there is no change in wind speed over 50 years. In this case, the maximum cost of retrofit is reduced by up to 5% for the adaptation strategies to be cost effective. It is not a straightforward process to rank the cost effectiveness of these adaptation strategies, but the following observations can be made. Adaptation strategy 2 is predicted to be the most economical, because it focuses on the retrofit of all pre-1970 construction within the region, or 42% of the housing units, even though strategy 4 has a greater net benefit. Strategy 4 is perhaps less practical The adaptation strategies considered herein were all cost effective if the cost of retrofit is less than 10%, when a 5% increase in wind speed is assumed. An adaptation strategy that entailed strengthening pre-1970 construction within the whole region proved to be more cost effective than focusing solely on the foreshore locations, decreasing the expected cumulative damage to the region by an average of 4.0%. An adaptation strategy involving strengthening new construction at foreshore locations also proved to be very cost effective and to cause the least disruption because it did not require the retrofit of older buildings. These adaptation strategies were found to be cost effective even if there is no change in wind speed, which implies that the strategies could result in a \"win-win\" situation. In comparison, similar adaptation strategies may not be economical for building in Queensland, Australia, mainly due to the relatively low hurricane intensity in the area."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank Yuejun Yin, doctoral candidate at MTU, for his assistance in performing some of the analyses.

Approximately 50% of the population of the U.S. lives in coastal regions (Cullition 1998), and it is estimated that the populations of these coastal regions will increase by about 25% in the next 25 years . Increases in sea surface temperatures (SST) are acknowledged to be a result of global climate change (IPCC 2007). Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean has increased in recent years ). However, whether or not the increasing SST are affecting hurricane patterns is a matter of debate. Some studies (e.g.  show that there is a connection between increasing hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and the rising SST of the Atlantic Ocean. On the other hand, , , , and Pielke et al. (2005) find that this altered hurricane activity is due to the natural climate variability of the Atlantic Ocean. Emanuel (2005) found that the peak wind speeds of tropical cyclones could increase by 5% for every increase in SST of 1\u00b0C. Elsner (2006) stated that climate change causes higher SST; warmer SST results in more energy which is converted to stronger hurricane winds.  and  estimated that hurricane intensity may increase by 5% to 10% if SST increase by 2.2\u00b0C. Increases in hurricane intensity of this magnitude could translate to an increase in the destructive power of hurricanes by approximately 25% . Knutson et al. (2010) found that hurricane wind speeds may increase by 2% to 11% in the 21st century globally. Furthermore,  found that annual mean maximum wind speeds with a return period of 50 years may experience increases of up to 2.3% as a result of climate change. As hurricane wind speeds increase, the CCSP (2008) stated that the frequency of hurricanes may increase as well. However,  and Knutson et al. (2010) predict that hurricane frequency will decrease as a result of global climate change; finding that the frequency of hurricanes globally may decrease by -6% to -34% as a result of climate change (Knutson et al. 2010). Although, Knutson et al. (2010) also states that the frequency of higher intensity hurricanes (Category 4 and 5) may increase.  confirms the finding that there may be an increase in very intense hurricanes, while the overall number of hurricanes may decrease as a result of the changing climate. In addition to changes in hurricane wind and frequency, hurricane-induced storm surge may also change as a result of climate change. The IPCC (2007) estimates that the global average sea level may increase by approximately 40 cm in the 21st century due to climate change, and has already estimated that global sea levels have increased by 10 to 20 cm over the last 100 years. For example, it is estimated that the sea level along the Atlantic Florida coast may increase at a rate of 2 mm per year over the next 100 years. Increasing sea levels mean that hurricane-induced storm surge will be riding on higher sea levels, resulting in higher surges that are able to travel further inland .  found that the vulnerability of coastal communities in the U.S. to flooding will increase as a result of higher sea levels due to climate change. The New York City Panel on Climate Change 2009found that rising sea levels as a result of climate change could lead to a significant increase in structural damage.

In the following, a brief description of the GPD and its application is provided. The \"peaks-over-threshold\" method involves the analysis of events that exceed a given threshold. The events above the given threshold can be described with the GPD ). An adequately chosen threshold will result in only true peaks, and these peaks have a Poisson arrival rate.

The GPD has been used to model hurricane wind speeds that exceed a threshold in the U.S.; furthermore, the frequency of the hurricane wind speeds exceeding the threshold are modeled with the Poisson distribution .

For example, the \"worst case scenario\" (i.e. Climate Change Scenario 9) involves increasing the frequency of hurricanes by 10% and increasing the hurricane wind speed by10%, which results in an annual damage risk ranging from 28% to 45% higher than that of the no climate change scenario for the three counties.  Galveston County, respectively, from the no climate change scenario. From the figure it is evident that the cumulative damage costs for Miami-Dade County are considerably higher than those for the other two counties. This can be attributed to a few factors. First the annual occurrence rate of hurricanes is higher from Miami-Dade County than the other two counties, and the GPD parameters determined for Miami-Dade County are based on wind speeds that are higher than those found for the other two counties. Furthermore, the number of single-family housing units that are exposed to a hurricane event in Miami-Dade County are approximately 452,000 units, while in New Hanover County there are 58,500 units and in Galveston County there are 56,300 units. The number of housing units in Miami-Dade County is considerably higher than that of the other two counties, which results in the significantly higher exposure and damage costs for the region. The number of exposed housing units has a considerable effect on the potential damage cost to a region, and Miami-Dade County has about seven times the number of exposed housing units than both other counties. Therefore, the expected damage cost for Miami-Dade County is significantly higher than those in the other two counties. However, New Hanover County and Galveston County experience a greater percentage of increase because the annual damage risk was initially lower, resulting in proportionally higher increases.   To normalize the damage risk, Figure 3.5 shows the cumulative damage cost after 50 years per 100,000 residents for all three counties under various scenarios of climate change. From this figure it can be seen that New Hanover County has a higher expected cumulative damage cost per 100,000 residents than the other two counties. If no climate change is assumed, the cumulative damage costs is $1,310 million per 100,000 residents in Miami-Dade County, $1,680 million per 100,000 residents in New Hanover County, and $400 million per 100,000 residents in Galveston County.

The house replacement value in New Hanover County is 45% higher than in Miami-Dade County; therefore, even though the total cumulative damage cost in Miami-Dade County is significantly higher, the cumulative damage cost per 100,000 residents is higher for New Hanover County.

The illustrative example herein includes three different locations, and certain parameters must be identified for each location. First, it is assumed that the radius to maximum wind speed and central pressure deficit is constant between the three locations, because little information is available on how these parameters vary between locations. Furthermore, it is assumed that the values of these parameters correspond to the mean value and COV found in Table 3.1. Once the radius to maximum wind speed and central pressure deficit have been identified, the site-specific parameters, such as wind speed and ocean slope, can be identified. The wind speed is assumed to correspond to a maximum gust wind speed with a return period of 50 years . By implementing a wind speed specific to a certain return period, it is possible to incorporate the site-specific differences between hurricane wind for the three locations. This wind speed will be used to estimate the combined damage due to hurricane wind speed and hurricane-induced storm surge. The ocean slope of Miami-Dade County and Galveston County is assumed to be 1:250 corresponding to an ocean slope of 4\u00b0 ; on the other hand, New Hanover County is assumed to have an ocean slope of 1:500 because the continental slope off the coast of North Carolina is steeper than for the other two locations (USGS 2007).

The varying surge height alone does not have a considerable impact on the damage costs ( Figure   3.6a), but varying both the wind speed and the surge height has a significant effect on damage costs; therefore, it is evident that wind speed has a significant role in estimating damage costs due to hurricane hazard within the proposed framework.

In contrast to the results presented for the annual damage analysis presented earlier, Miami-Dade County has a higher expected damage cost per 100,000 residents than the other two counties.

First, Miami-Dade County has a significantly higher expected damage risk due to wind, or 88% higher than New Hanover County and 76% higher than Galveston County. Second, similar to the annual damage analysis conducted earlier, Miami-Dade County has a significantly larger number of houses exposed to hurricane hazard than the other two counties. However, on the other hand, these results show that New Hanover County has a higher expected damage cost per 100,000 residents than Galveston County.

Therefore, any changes in wind speed resulted in proportionally higher changes in the annual P f than for the other two design cases. An increase in wind speed of 10% over 100 years could increase annual failure probabilities by up to 90%, from the case of no climate change and assuming no deterioration of the pole. Degradation was also found to be an important factor in damage probability. For a pole that is 30 years old, an increase in wind speed of 10% over 100 years could result in an increase in annual damage probability of 30% to 60% from the no climate change scenario. These increases in failure rates are not as dramatic as for newly constructed poles, but an increase in failure probability for the 30 year old poles of approximately 30% or more, over a 100-year time frame, could indicate significant increases in replacement costs. Furthermore, the service proven reliability of distribution poles was investigated for distribution poles. It was found that the updated annual P f could increase by up to 50% under an assumed increase in wind speed of 10% over 100 years, with deterioration, which further indicates increases in replacement costs. Therefore, if this or other climate change scenarios are believed to be possible it is necessary to assess the economic viability of adaptation strategies to replace or strengthen distribution poles in hurricane-prone zones.\nThe proposed framework provides a tool to evaluate hurricane vulnerability and damage risk of distribution poles, as well as the economical variability of mitigation strategies.

In Miami-Dade County, there are currently 220,000 distribution poles (N tot =220,000), with an annual growth rate (\u03b1) of 1.4% (FP&L 2006. It is assumed that these distribution poles are made of Southern pine timber (i.e. 14 m high with a spacing of 46 m), designed using the ASCE method. Furthermore, the typical timber pole is assumed to support three conductors, one neutral wire, and one communication cable. It was found that the required distribution pole for Miami-Dade County is a Class 5 pole . Table 5.1 shows the design parameters for this distribution pole (ANSI 2002). The table shows the circumference at ground line (C g ), the nominal resistance, and the actual resistance. The actual resistance was obtained by adjusting the nominal resistance with the model error (ME). The ME for Southern pine distribution poles is approximately 1.12 . In order to estimate the updated annual p f , a MCS is conducted. Therefore, the uncertainty within both the resistance and the applied load must be accounted for. The actual resistance is determined from the nominal resistance and the model error, and both these parameters have uncertainty associated with them. The ASCE-111 (2006) suggests that the resistance can be described with three distributions: normal, lognormal, and Weibull. , , and  recommend that the resistance of the pole should be described with a lognormal distribution; therefore, it is chosen as a starting point for this analysis. The ASCE-111 (2006) also recommends a COV of 20% for the resistance. The ME is assumed to be 1.12 and to be normally distributed with a COV of 14% . The uncertainty of both the nominal resistance and the model error can then be accounted for within the MCS. Also, as stated earlier, the distribution poles are assumed to age by incorporating a decay function into the estimation of the resistance (Eq. 5.5). The decay function is obtained from . The nominal wind load is determined from Eq. (52) and Eq. (53). The actual wind load (S) for this analysis is determined using the equations for the nominal wind load, including the uncertainty present within some of the values. Therefore the applied wind load (S) is dependent on various random variables, and the variables must be identified along with their corresponding statistical distributions and COV. The wind load for the poles is determined based on the wind speed (V), the projected wind area (A) (which varies between the components of the pole), the air density factor (Q), the importance factor (I FW ), the terrain exposure coefficient (k), the gust response factor (G RF ), the force coefficient (C F ), and the height of the components from the ground (h) (ASCE-111 2006). These values are presented in Table 5.2 with the corresponding statistical distribution and COV. However, the wind speed is discussed specifically in the next section so it is not included in the table. Also not included in the table are the air density factor (Q) and the importance factor (I FW ) as these are constants with values of 0.00256 for U.S. units (0.613 for SI Units) and 1.0, respectively. The details of the statistics and development of the fragility curve can be found in ). The resistance of a timber distribution pole decreases with age, as the degradation results in a decreased diameter of the pole due to decay. Because available data from Miami-Dade County on the age profiles of distribution poles states that the poles vary from 1 years old to 50 years old (FP&LC 2006), the actual resistance and its corresponding COV are determined for each year over the 50 year time frame. For illustration purposes,  , and for the sake of brevity are not included herein, but the interested reader is directed to  for details on how the equations outlined in  are implemented in assessing the affects degradation has on the strength of timber distribution poles in the U.S. The table shows that as the poles are assumed to age, the uncertainty within the estimated resistance increases which translates to the increasing COV with age. Furthermore, deterioration will impact the updated annual p f ; the distribution poles are more vulnerable to damage from wind as the age of the poles increases. Hurricane fragility curves show the probability of failure of a distribution pole conditioned at a specific wind speed, which increases monotonically, and can be developed based on the information in Table 5.2 to examine the differences in vulnerability between distribution poles of varying age, size, or material. The probability of failure for the fragility curves is estimated by a MCS, which involves counting the number of times the load (S) exceeds the resistance (R). The load (S) and resistance (R) are randomly generated with the wind speed being deterministic within the selected range (i.e. from 0 m/s to 120 m/s). For illustration purposes, fragility curves are presented for Class 5 distribution poles, of varying age, located foreshore in Figure 5.2. From the figure it is seen that as poles age they become more vulnerable to failure. For example, for a wind speed of 36 m/s, the 1 year old distribution pole has a 0.005 probability of failure, the probability of failure increases to 0.228 for a 30 year old pole, and to 0.570 for a 50 year old pole. The updated annual p f for new Class 5 distribution poles is estimated to be approximately 0.054 (i.e. no deterioration at Foreshore locations). In comparison, given an extreme wind criterion of 65 m/s, the annual probability of failure for timber poles located in Southern Florida is estimated to be 0.045 (FP&LC 2006, Quanta 2009. This estimate by Quanta (2009) is lower than the updated annual p f estimated using the proposed framework. This can be attributed to the fact that Class 4 poles are the most common class of distribution poles in the U.S. (Foedingur et al. 2002), while the ASCE design method recommended a Class 5 pole. A lower annual probability of failure is expected for a higher class of pole, because it is larger and able to withstand higher wind speeds. The updated annual p f is determined for distribution poles ranging from 1 years old to 50 years old. Figure 5.3 shows the updated annual p f for Class 5 distribution poles located foreshore considering both degradation and no degradation over a 100 year period . The updated annual p f is quite similar for the first years of the assessment. When degradation is accounted for, the updated annual p f increases significantly. However, when degradation is not considered, the updated annual p f decreases. This is attributed to the fact that the reliability of service-proven structures should increase if no degradation is accounted for . The updated annual p f considering degradation is used herein. \nMiami-Dade County is used as a case study to illustrate the development of the CCSVI and to explore the possible effect climate change may have on social vulnerability. The county has a population of 2.4 million, making it the eighth largest county in the U.S. and the most populous county in Florida.

The CCSVI will be estimated after a 50 year time frame.

The amp is estimated to be 1.133 for the distribution poles designed according to the ASCE method and 1.118 for poles designed according to the NESC method. The variation is attributed to the fact that when the amp is estimated using the Gere-Carter method, a dead load factor is implemented within the calculations. The dead load for the ASCE method is 1.1 (ASCE-111 2006), while the NESC (2002) recommends a dead load factor of 1.0, i.e. amp is dependent on which method is being used.

Table   4.3 also presents the design resistance (R n ) that is found in design standards given the pole class (ANSI 2002). ANSI (2002) defines the minimum ground line circumferences for a range of pole classes, i.e. Classes H6-H1 and Classes 1-6, where Class H6 is the largest with a minimum circumference of 1,500 mm and Class 6 is the smallest with a minimum circumference of 762 mm (based on a 14 m pole).

The mean model error (ME) is assumed to be 1.12, with COV ME =14%, for the design resistance . As a starting point, the ME is assumed to be normally distributed. Table 4.4 shows the actual resistance for the four design cases. The design strength for the four pole classes has a COV of 20% (ANSI 2002). The ASCE-111 (2006) recommends that the strength of the pole be described by three distributions: normal, lognormal, and Weibull. For this analysis, the strength of the pole will be assumed to have a lognormal distribution, as suggested in , Li et al. (2006), and .  4.2and (43). To account for the uncertainty within amp, it is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean value which is assumed to be the value estimated with the Gere-Carter method. The COV is determined by running a MCS, assuming that the modulus of elasticity (MOE) has a normal distribution with a COV of 20% (ANSI 2002) and the geometry of the poles has a normal distribution with a COV of 6% . The mean value of amp is estimated to be 1.118, with a COV of 8% for the NESC method and to be 1.133, with a COV of 11% for the ASCE method. Hurricane fragility curves show the probability of failure of a distribution pole conditioned at a specific wind speed, which increases monotonically. The probability of failure for the fragility curves is estimated by a MCS, as stated previously, which involves counting the number of times the load (S) exceeds the resistance (R). The load (S) and resistance (R) are randomly generated with the wind speed being deterministic  From the comparison, it can be seen that Case 1 has a 50% probability of failure at wind speeds that are about 27% lower than for Case 2. These differences are attributed to the fact that Cases 2 and 3 are more conservative than Cases 1 and 4, because they implement a significantly higher ratio of load factor and strength factor (\u03b3/\u00f8). Cases 2 and 3 required larger ground line circumferences than Cases 1 and 4, which resulted in larger poles for Cases 2 and 3 that are able to withstand higher loads. Furthermore, the ratio of the load factor to the strength factor (\u03b3/\u00f8) implemented for Cases 1 and 4 are similar, or 1.27 and 1.29, which yielded the same class of pole; however, the fragility curves are not exactly the same for Case 1 and 4 because the methods resulted in different amp factors.

The age of the poles appears, from a comparison of Figure 4.7 to 4.10, to affect the probability of failure for the poles designed according to Cases 1 and Case 4 more than for the Cases 2 and 3. This is due to the fact that the COV for the bending strength of the poles is higher for Cases 1 and 4 than for the Cases 2 and 3.

Although, it should be noted that the time frame is irrelevant for the point-in-time analysis given by Eq. (4.15) as this is not path dependant (i.e. the annual P f will depend on the change in wind speed not the number of years being investigated). To estimate the annual P f due to the potential impact of climate change, the mean maximum annual wind speed is assumed to change linearly over the selected time period. The mean maximum annual wind speed is 23 m/s, 24 m/s, 26 m/s, and 30 m/s assuming changes in wind speed of -5%, 0%, 10%, and 25%, respectively, over 100 years. The COV for the mean maximum annual wind speed at year 1 is estimated to be 0.584, which is assumed to be constant for all years within the time frame ). Using the mean maximum annual wind speed and the COV, the Weibull parameters can be determined for each change in wind speed in each year during the 100-year time frame. Subsequently, the annual P f of distribution poles can be estimated using Eq.  The larger poles, designed with Cases 2 and 3, experience the greatest change in annual P f as the wind speed is assumed to change over a the selected time frame. This is because the annual P f was very low for these design cases initially; therefore the changes in wind speed resulted in proportionally higher changes in the annual P f than for Cases 1 and 4, which had considerably higher annual P f initially. For example, for Case 2, an increase in wind speed of 10% could result in an increase in the annual P f of 90% from the case of no climate change, while the same increase in wind speed could result in an increase in the annual P f of approximately 50% for Cases 1 and 4.

An assessment of this nature takes into account the fact that the number of years that distribution poles have survived gives an indication as to the minimum structural capacity of the distribution poles. This analysis considers the updated annual P f that a distribution pole will fail in the subsequent year given that the distribution pole has survived T years of service , and the updated annual P f is estimated at each subsequent year of the assessment by conducting a MCS. The MCS estimates the number of distribution poles that fail in a specific year given the load (S) and the resistance (R) of the poles, and then the total number of remaining poles is updated for the next year by subtracting the failed poles for the previous year from the total number of poles. The updated annual P f is then estimated at each subsequent year based on the number of failed poles and total number of poles for that specific year. This service proven reliability analysis was conducted for distribution poles, considering climate change scenarios of 0% and 10% increases in wind speed over 100 years. For the sake of brevity, one case is presented herein, ASCE Design Case 1. 16, is a conditional probability that estimates the likelihood that the distribution poles will fail in year T+1 given that the distribution poles have survived T years: where p f (t) is the cumulative probability of failure up to time t .  Therefore, the updated annual P f is quite similar for the first years of the assessment. From the figure it can be seen that the updated annual P f increases significantly for both climate change scenarios when degradation is accounted for. On the other hand, when degradation is not considered, the updated annual P f decreases for 0% increase in wind speed, and this is because, for service proven structures, the reliability should increase if no degradation is accounted for . However, when wind speeds are assumed to increase by 10%, the decrease in the updated annual P f seen initially for 0% increase in wind speed is counteracted and the updated annual P f remains relatively constant for the 100 year service life of the distribution pole. In all cases, the updated annual P f shown in Figure 4.15 and 4.16 is less than the annual P f shown in For comparison purposes, recall that the annual P f for the ASCE Design Case 1, was estimated at 0.054 for any year under current climate conditions (i.e. no climate change and no deterioration). However, the updated annual P f at year 20, (i.e. the probability that a distribution pole will fail in year 20, given that it has survived the previous 19 years of service) is 0.047 if there is no degradation and 0.057 if there is degradation, for no change in wind speed. If wind speeds increase by 10% over 100 years, the updated annual P f at year 20 is 0.054 and 0.086 for no degradation and degradation, respectively. For a survival age of 50 years, the updated annual P f is 0.038 for no degradation and 0.178 for degradation, for 0% increase in wind speed, and for 10% increase in wind speed, the updated annual P f is 0.056 when degradation is not accounted for and 0.244 when degradation is accounted for. These are increases in the updated annual P f of up to 50% if there is degradation, under an assumed increase in wind speed of 10% over 100 years. From this analysis it can be concluded that climate change could have a significant impact on the service proven reliability of distribution poles if there is deterioration, but if there is no deterioration then a 10% increase in wind speed over 100 years will not increase updated annual probabilities of pole failure."}, {"section_title": "Design and risk assessment of distribution poles", "text": "The power system includes three main components: generation, transmission, and distribution. Of these three components, the distribution systems (lines and poles) are the most susceptible to wind damage. This is due to the fact that distribution lines and poles are more exposed to hurricane winds than the generation plants and the transmission systems. Furthermore, distribution poles are often not designed to withstand high wind speeds (Davidson et al. 2003). A typical timber distribution pole system is seen on Figure   5.1 that consists of a solid pole, three conductors, one neutral wire, and one communication wire. Approximately 99% of distribution poles in the U.S. are composed of wood materials (USWAG 2005). The Southern pine species accounts for approximately 75% of timber poles in the U.S. . Therefore, this paper will focus on the risk and vulnerability of timber distribution poles caused by hurricanes. The National Electric Safety Code (NESC) outlines a deterministic method to design timber distribution poles (NESC 2002). This method has, however, led to non-uniform reliabilities for distribution poles, which prompted the development of a Load Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) method by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) to maintain uniform reliabilities Li 2006, Dagher 2001). This ASCE design method has been introduced in the field of distribution (utility) pole design and is now used in design (ASCE-111 2006). The following formulation can be used in the design of distribution poles using the ASCE design method. where R n is the nominal strength of the pole (e.g. bending moment) and identified using design standards, \u00f8 j is the strength factor for load effect i, S n,j is the nominal load for load effect j, and \u03b3 j is the load factor for load effect j. ASCE-111 (2006) recommends a strength factor (\u00f8) of 0.79, for a bending moment with a coefficient of variation (COV) of 20%, and a load factor (\u03b3) of 1.0 for wind load. In order to design a distribution pole, the material of the pole is first decided, and then the required height and ground line circumference (C g ) of the pole are determined based on the load being designed for (i.e. wind load for the purpose of this paper). The wind load acting on the distribution pole is affected by the wind load acting on each of the components found in Figure 5.1. where S n is the nominal load (N-m), amp is the amplification factor, F i is the wind force (N) on component i (Eq. 5.3), and h i is the distance (m) from ground line to the centroid of component i. The amplification factor is included to account for the P-\u0394 effect that occurs in tapered distribution poles (ASCE-111 2006. The wind force acting on each component is described with (ASCE-113 2008): where Q is air density factor, k i is terrain exposure coefficient for component i, V is the 3-sec gust wind speed with a return period of 50 years (Bingle et al. 2003), I FW is the importance factor, G RF is the gust response factor, C f is the force coefficient, and A i is the projected wind surface area normal to the direction of wind for component i. Distribution poles are divided into classes based on the material of the pole, and assigned a permitted bending moment at ground line (i.e. 2.0 m from the base of the pole) based on the class, height, and circumference (ANSI 2002). The circumference of the pole can be estimated from the nominal load (S n ) acting on the pole and the fiber stress of the species of timber (Brown 2008, Wolfe and. Once the circumference has been determined, the class of the pole is determined from design standards, and from the pole class the nominal resistance (R n ) is found (ANSI 2002). The performance of distribution poles is dependent on various intervening variables (e.g. wind speed, pole strength) and design parameters (e.g. pole height and size) . The limit state function for distribution poles is: where R(t) is the actual capacity of the pole at time t, S is the actual load based on various intervening variables (e.g. wind speed, pole geometry, wire geometry), a(t) is the timedependent decay function, and ME is the model error, determined from available test data . The uncertainty of the resistance is accounted for by including the ME term within the equations, which is relative to the nominal strength (Lupoi et al. 2006, Zhai and. As a distribution pole ages, the strength of the pole degrades . The main contributor to the degradation of strength of distribution poles is in-ground decay due to fungal attacks. In-ground decay occurs because the poles are in direct contact with the soil creating good conditions for fungal attacks . In order to take into account this deterioration of strength with age, the resistance in Eq. 5.5is modified with a decay function (a(t)) to represent how the strength deteriorates over time. The limit state for the performance function (Eq. 5.4) between failure and not failure is defined as G=0. If the variables result in G>0, then the system has fulfilled its performance criteria, but if G<0, then the system has failed. The P(G>0) is defined as the reliability of the system, and the probability of failure is defined as: Hurricane fragility can be defined as the conditional probability of failure of a structural member as a function of wind speed, and is often modeled as a lognormal cumulative distribution function (CDF) . where V is the 3-sec gust wind speed, m R is the median capacity or resistance, \u03be R is the logarithmic standard deviation of the capacity or resistance, and \u0424(\u2022) is the standard normal probability integral. This paper will consider the service proven reliability of distribution poles, by considering the effects load history may have on their reliability. The minimum structural capacity of a distribution pole can be determined from the number of years the distribution pole has survived. The analysis conducted herein will implement an updated annual p f of the distribution poles to account for load history. The updated annual p f is the probability that a distribution pole will fail in the subsequent year given that the distribution pole has survived g years of service , and is estimated at each subsequent year by conducting a MCS. Given the load (S) and the resistance (R) of the distribution poles, the MCS estimates the number of poles that fail in a given year. The total number of poles remaining each year is determined by subtracting the number of poles that failed the previous year. The updated annual p f is determined for each subsequent year from the total number of poles and the number of failed poles ). The updated annual p f is a conditional probability that estimates the likelihood that the distribution poles will fail in year g+1 given that the distribution poles have survived g years: where p f (t) is the cumulative probability of failure up to time t . The actual load, S, is influenced by the Weibull distribution of the maximum annual 3sec gust wind speed, at a height of 10 m on open terrain for hurricanes in the U.S. . The PDF of the Weibull distribution is: where V is the 3-sec gust wind speed, and k and u are site-specific parameters. To take into account the effects of exposure on wind speed and, ultimately, on the p f of distribution poles, the location of the distribution poles is identified within this study.  identified three exposure categories for residential construction: Foreshore (within 1 km from coast), Locations within l0 km inland, and Locations further inland. These three exposure categories are assumed to apply to distribution poles, because distribution poles located in foreshore locations will be exposed to higher wind speeds than poles located further inland; therefore the poles located foreshore will have a higher p f than poles located in the other exposure categories .

For each exposure category, the replacement cost is determined with the sum of the number of poles that fail annually within each exposure category and the expected annual growth rate of new distribution poles. Once the replacement cost has been determined for each of the three exposure categories, the replacement cost for the region is the sum of the three values. The cumulative replacement cost involves summing up the regional replacement cost for each year within a set time frame . Once more detailed information is available on costs associated with distribution pole failure, it can be incorporated into the proposed framework. Eq. (5.11) and Eq. (5.12) estimate the cumulative replacement cost for the mitigation strategies. The annual replacement cost due to distribution pole failure is found by multiplying the updated annual p f with the cost of pole replacement (C rep ), including labor, material, and disposal cost. Costs due to interruption of power supply; death, injury and damage to property caused by falling poles or wires; and other direct or indirect losses are not considered herein, but will be considered in future implementations of the proposed framework. The cumulative replacement cost (LCC(1,T)) is found by summing the cost of replacement over a time period, T, for the region.

Furthermore, the cost of replacement is assumed to be an additional cost, and the discount rate is investigated for a range of possible rates as discussed below. The cost of labor of removing an existing pole and installing a new distribution pole is approximately $1115, including disposal cost . The material cost is additional; therefore the cost of replacement is the total cost (i.e. $1115 plus material cost). Because the mitigation strategies involve either replacing a pole with a new same size pole or a new larger pole, the material costs will differ between the mitigation strategies; therefore two costs of replacement are implemented (C rep,1 and C rep,2 ). The material cost for a new Class 5 pole is approximately $180 and, for a new Class 4 pole, is approximately $260 .

The Australian Government Office of Best Practice Regulation (OBPR) recommends that the discount rate for regulatory interventions is 7%, and that sensitivity analyses consider discount rates of 3% and 10% (OBPR 2010). Discount rates are generally assumed to be constant with time. Projects with significant effects beyond 30-50 years are considered intergenerational. In this case, a time-declining interest rate may be appropriate because of (i) increasing time aversion resulting in lower discount rates, (ii) ethical dilemmas of costs and benefits having negligible value far into the future if a constant discount rate is used, (iii) time-declining discount rate will place greater weight on future generations, and (iv) lower discount rates should be used to reflect greater inherent uncertainty about the future growth rate of the economy and future market rates the further we look into the future . For this reason, the British Treasury recommends that following declining long-term discount rates (HM Treasury 2003): 3.5% (0-30 years), 3.0% (31-75 years), 2.5% (76-125 years), 2.0% (126-200 years), 1.5% (201-300 years), and 1.0% (300+ years). The U.S. OMB also believes that intergenerational effects are important, and mandates: \"If your rule will have important intergenerational benefits or costs you might consider a further sensitivity analysis using a lower but positive discount rate in addition to calculating net benefits using discount rates of 3 and 7 percent.\" (OMB 2003). The OMB provides no quantitative guidance about the 'lower' time-declining discount rate. There is some controversy about time-declining interest rate (e.g., , and the Australian OPBR states that \"there is no consensus about how to value impacts on future generations\" and \"Rather than use an arbitrarily lower discount rate, the OBPR suggests that the effects on future generations be considered explicitly\" (OBPR 2010). In the cost-benefit analysis, the following discount rates will be used to be consistent with U.S. practice and regulations: \u2022 r=7% \u2022 r=3% \u2022 r=3.5% (2010-2030), 3.0% (2031-2060) Since the time period for our analysis is the 50 year period 2011 to 2060, then intergenerational affects may be important and so a time-declining interest rate similar to that specified by the U.K. is used herein. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) can be used to estimate the mean and 10 th and 90 th percentiles of LCC."}, {"section_title": "Cost-effectiveness of Mitigation Strategies", "text": "To assess the cost effectiveness of mitigation by using a LCC analysis, the number of poles that fail annually are determined for the \"do nothing\" (or \"business as usual\") case and for the four mitigation strategies. Information is available on the age profiles of distribution poles in Miami-Dade County ranging from g=1 years old to 50 years old (FP&LC 2006). Therefore, it is assumed that distribution poles in Miami-Dade County are between the ages of 1 and 50 years old. As stated previously, it is assumed that the initial strength of Class 5 poles follow a lognormal distribution, with a mean strength and COV found in design standards (ANSI 2002). In order to perform this analysis, a 51 by 220,000 matrix is generated, where 220,000 initial pole strengths are created to represent the actual number of poles in Miami-Dade County (FP&L 2006)  In order to conduct a comparative analysis of the cost effectiveness of mitigation strategies, the cost of the \"do nothing\" case should first be estimated. The \"do nothing\" case corresponds to current practices without mitigation. Furthermore, the \"do nothing\" case assumes that the distribution poles that fail annually are replaced with new poles of the required (same) pole class size. However, the \"do nothing\" case does not assume that there is any additional distribution pole replacement within the region (i.e. distribution poles are only replaced if they fail). The cost of the \"do nothing\" case at year 2060 (i.e. after 50 years) is presented in Table 5.4. The table also includes the cost per pole which is calculated based on the LCC and the total number of poles, including the effects exposure has on the number of poles potentially exposed to hurricane wind. The results are shown considering various discount rates. From the table it can be seen that the discount rate has a significant effect on the cost, i.e. the higher the rate results in lower future costs. As the affects of the discount rate are consistent throughout this illustrative example, results will be presented for a discount rate of 3% hereafter. After estimating the \"do nothing\" case, the cost effectiveness of the various mitigation strategies can be assessed by first determining the cumulative LCC for each strategy. Once the strength and deterioration of the distribution poles has been estimated and accounted for, it is possible to begin replacing the distribution poles. The average number of poles replaced, the average time to failure, and the mean loss of resistance for the \"do nothing\" case and the mitigation strategies are shown in Table 5.5. From the table it can be seen that because Mitigation Strategy 1 involves the proactive measurement of replacing a percentage of old poles with new, but same size, poles, it does not actually decrease the vulnerability of the distribution poles. The other mitigation strategies do decrease the average number of poles being replaced from the \"do nothing\" case. The reason for this decrease is due to the fact that these mitigation strategies involve replacing poles with stronger distribution poles which results in the decreased vulnerability of the poles, so fewer poles are failing annually due to wind. The mean time to failure refers to the mean age distribution poles are replaced for the respective strategy. Mitigation Strategies 2, 3, and 4 involve replacement of distribution poles with larger poles, able to withstand higher wind loads, this, in turn, translates into a longer average service life of the distribution poles. From the table it can also be seen that within this framework, distribution poles are replaced on average earlier than the NESC threshold criteria of strength (i.e. 2/3 of the initial strength), and this attributed to the fact that these values include poles that are assumed to fail annually due to hurricanes. Mean loss of resistance at replacement or at time of failure (%) 27% 27% 32% 32% 29% Figure 5.4 shows the cumulative LCC at year 2060 associated with the mitigation strategies, and the results for the \"do nothing\" case are included for comparative purposes. From the figure it can be seen that certain mitigation measures could be cost effective in reducing the vulnerability of the distribution poles to hurricane damage.  The following results (i.e. Figure 5.5) were generated using the 10 th and 90 th percentile values of the LCC based on 10,000 MCS runs. It was found that the replacement cost of the \"do nothing\" case is $102 million using the 10 th percentile values and $201 million using the 90 th percentile values. Figure 5.5 shows the 10 th , 50 th , and 90 th percentile values of the cumulative LCC for the \"do nothing\" case and the mitigation strategies at year 2060. These results confirm the results found previously, as they show that mitigation can be cost effective. Mitigation Strategies 2 and 3 are again the most economical choices. The results for Figure 5.6 were generated using the 10 th and 90 th percentile values of the LCC based on 10,000 MCS runs. Figure 5.6 shows the 10 th , 50 th , and 90 th percentile values of the net benefit at year 2060 for the mitigation strategies in comparison to the \"do nothing\" case. Mitigation strategies 2 and 3 are the most cost effective, resulting in median net benefits of $32 million and $29 million, while Mitigation Strategy 1 is not cost effective resulting in a net loss of $10 million. Mitigation Strategy 4 could be a viable option, with net benefits of up to $13 million if implemented, but causes potentially little disruption, because it focuses solely on mitigation in high vulnerability areas. For Mitigation Strategy 2, there is a 90% chance that the net benefits will exceed $27 million in 2060, and there is a 10% chance that net benefits may exceed $44 million in 2060 if the strategy is implemented. On the other hand, if Mitigation Strategy 1 was to be implemented, there is a 90% chance that the net loss will exceed $7 million in 2060, which is not a desirable outcome.  costs exceeding $1,000,000 is about 93% but by implementing Mitigation Strategy 2 the probability of exceedance is reduced to 67% (i.e. there is 67% chance that replacement costs may exceed $300,000 in year 50). The probability of exceeding $2,000,000 in annual replacement costs is about 34% for the \"do nothing\" case and approximately 6% after the implementation of Mitigation Strategy 2. This is a reduction in exceedance probability of approximately 83%. "}, {"section_title": "References", "text": "American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE-111) (2006)   . Hurricane damages are increasing, principally due to a growing U.S. coastal population. In 2003, approximately 53% of the U.S. population, or 153 million people, live in coastal counties (Crosset 2008). This is an increase in population of 33 million since 1980, and it is estimated that the U.S. coastal population will increase by another 12 million by 2015 (W&PE 2003). Social vulnerability is a combination of a region's capacity to respond and recover from a natural hazard, with minimal damage . Therefore, it is important to identify the societal factors that have the greatest effect on hurricane vulnerability and combine them to create an index which describes the hurricane risk for the region . Studies have indicated that hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean has increased significantly since 1995 . This increased hurricane activity has been attributed to two factors. First, the increase in hurricane activity is due to the warming global climate . Second, the increased hurricane activity is due to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (i.e. the natural cycle) . The changing global climate has resulted in both rising sea surface temperatures (SST) and a rising sea level, as indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007). Emanuel (2005) found that every increase in SST of 1\u00b0C could result in an increase of the peak wind speed of a tropical cyclone by 5%. As hurricane wind speeds increase, it can be assumed that the frequency of hurricanes may increase as well (CCSP 2008).  concluded that the frequency of hurricanes may increase by 6% under enhanced greenhouse conditions. The IPCC predicts that by the end of this century the average global sea level may increase by about 40 cm (IPCC 2007). This projected increase in sea level will result in higher storm surges, because the surge will be riding on a higher sea level, and will bring storm surges further inland ). Li and Stewart 2011 The CCSVI differs from existing metrics (e.g. . The hurricane intensity is measured in wind speed in order to utilize probabilistic wind field models (i.e. the Weibull distribution, which will be discussed in the section which is composed of the same social parameters despite location."}, {"section_title": "Development of the Coastal Community Social Vulnerability", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Index", "text": "The social characteristics of a community or region have an impact on the vulnerability of a region to hurricanes and other natural disasters. For example, the presence of both the elderly and the poor contribute significantly to the vulnerability of a region to a hurricane event, however the contribution is quite different. The elderly are more vulnerable because of their mobility constraints, while lower income residents are more vulnerable to potential hurricane damage because the poor are often located in inadequate housing that is more susceptible to hurricane damage . There are many aspects and factors that contribute to the social makeup of a community, and though they are difficult to quantify, there is some consensus as to what factors influence social vulnerability, such as race, gender, and race . Agencies, worldwide, have tried to quantify the social vulnerability of various hurricaneprone regions (UNDP 2000;World Bank 2001;NRC 2000).  created the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) by using demographic information for the United States. The SoVI involves quantifying the social variables that have the greatest impact on the vulnerability of the region to a natural hazard. Finally, the \"place vulnerability\" (i.e. the vulnerability of a community to a natural hazard) of each county was found by combining the social variables with the probability of a natural hazard and regional exposure.  established the Hurricane Disaster Risk Index (HDRI). The HDRI was calculated by identifying certain characteristics within a region, such as probability of a hurricane hazard, the demographic makeup of the individuals residing within the region (e.g. ethnicity, gender, age), and the exposure of construction within the region. In this paper, a principal component analysis (PCA) will be used to identify the dominant social factors (SF) within a region  and is site-specific. The wind speed and the hurricane induced surge will be estimated at year 50 to assess the impacts the changing global climate may have on the social vulnerability of coastal areas. The CCSVI is expressed as: where H(t) is the hazard factor at year t, SF j (t) are the dominant social factors at year t, and Q j are the social factor weights.

The number of dominant social factors (n) is determined through the PCA and the number of social indicators (m) used is dependent on the sample data available. In the following, the derivation of Eq. (6.1) and Eq. (6.2) are developed."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Wind Models and Hurricane-Induced Surge Models", "text": "Various hurricane wind field models have been developed over the years.  developed a model based on the gradient level wind field, which has since been improved by , for hurricane winds along the Gulf Coast. Batts' model (1980) used the rise in the central pressure parameter to model the deterioration of a hurricane at landfall.  also developed a distribution to model hurricane wind speed. This model has been modified with the latest wind contours . The Weibull distribution is an appropriate model of the 3-sec gust wind speed, at a height of 10m on open terrain for hurricanes in the U.S. . When nonstationary wind speed is assumed due to climate change, the probability density function (PDF) of the distribution is: where v is the 3-sec gust wind speed, and \u03b1 and u are time dependent and site-specific parameters for the Weibull distribution. Eq. (6.3) includes two parameters of the Weibull distribution; the shape parameter, \u03b1, and the smallest probable value, u. These parameters can be estimated, at year 1, by using the relationship between wind speed (V T ) and return period (T): where V t and T are found using wind contour maps . For example, using the wind contour maps, two wind speeds were found for Miami-Dade County, 132 mph corresponding to a 50 year return period and 180 mph corresponding to a 1000 year return period (where 1 mph = 0.447 m/s). Using these values and solving for Eq. (6.4) simultaneously, the Weibull parameters at year 1 were estimated to be u(1)=27.36 and \u03b1(1)=1.77. Once the Weibull parameters at year 1 have been determined, the mean maximum annual wind speed can be estimated for year 1, and for Miami-Dade County, the mean maximum annual wind speed at year 1was found to be approximately 24.3 m/s. The maximum annual wind speed for Miami-Dade County under the current climate was determined using the Weibull distribution (see Figure 6.1). hurricanes by utilizing certain parameters (i.e. storm pressure, size, forward speed, forecast track, wind speeds, and topographical data) (NOAA 2009b). The Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model is a finite element method used to simulate the circulation in coastal waters, and for forecasting storm surge height and propagation (Luettich et al. 1992. Westerink et al. (1992) used a finite element model to estimate hurricane surge along the coast of Mississippi.  used a fine grid model to estimate storm surge heights in the North Sea.  used an inundation algorithm to create a surge model for Australia.  developed a storm surge model that combines the central pressure deficit, storm size, and storm forward speed to estimate surge height. The following equations are combined to estimate the surge height (m) where the ^ refers to a dimensionless quantity : where \u0394p is the central pressure deficit (millibars, or mb) at year t, \u03b6 is the surge height (m) at year t, R max is the radius to maximum wind speed (km) at year t, V max is the maximum wind speed (m/s) at year t, C(S 0 ) is the 2x3 curve fitting coefficient matrix for the ocean slope, p atm is the atmospheric pressure (1013.2mb, standard value), and g is the gravitational constant (9.813 m/s 2 ). Eq. (6.5c) involves the multiplication of three matrices that include the parameters estimated with Eq. (6.5a) and (6.5b), with the addition of the C(S 0 ) matrix, which is determined based on the ocean slope of the region in which the surge height is being estimated . Using the Irish model and data from historical hurricanes (NOAA 2009a), a histogram of hurricane-induced surge height was derived, with a mean surge height of 2.3 m for an ocean bed slope of 1:250 (see Figure 6.2). For illustration purposes, various statistical distributions were examined for goodness-of-fit, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Anderson-Darling test . Both tests were performed at a 5% significance level. The tests showed that the lognormal distribution is appropriate for hurricane-induced surge height. To investigate the impacts climate change may have on the CCSVI, the CCSVI will be estimated at year 50 (or 50 years from now) for various scenarios of climate change. For the determination of the CCSVI at year 50 (CCSVI(50)), the Weibull distribution parameters will be used to determine the mean maximum annual wind speed for a specific exposure category at year 50 for scenarios of climate change, where the mean maximum annual wind speed at year 50 is referred to as X' H1,c . However, the   Count model will be used to determine the maximum surge height at year 50 for scenarios of climate change. The maximum surge height at year 50 is assumed to be the mean value generated with Eq. (6.5) and is referred to as X' H2 . This is a starting point for this analysis, and when new surge models and wind speed models become available, they can be incorporated into the framework herein. To take into account the effects of exposure on hurricane intensity and surge, the various exposure categories were identified.  identified three exposure categories (c), which will be used herein: c=1) Foreshore (within 1 km from coast) c=2) Locations within l0 km inland c=3) All other locations further inland"}, {"section_title": "Principal Components Analysis (PCA)", "text": "Burton 2010assessed the effects that social characteristics had on the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in three counties in Mississippi, by using the SoVI ).

The dominant social factors (SF) are comprised of social indicators, and these social indicators were the original input factors for the PCA (e.g. percentage of African Americans, percentage of females). The hazard factors (H) is comprised of hazard indicators (e.g. wind speed, surge height). The CCSVI is a descriptive index, with a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being low risk and 10 being high risk; similarly, the hazard factor (H) and the dominant social factors (SF) also have a scale of 1 to 10. In order to create the CCSVI, both the social and hazard indicators must be scaled to dimensionless values, because the social and hazard indicators have different units (i.e. percentages, m/s, dollars); thus, the indicators can be combined to create the CCSVI. The scaling method includes identifying the minimum and maximum possible values for each social and hazard indicator . This scaling method was chosen because it is not sample-specific and is, therefore, easily interpretable. For example, the dimensionless value X jk ,for dominant social factor j, is given by: where X' jk refers to the unscaled value for social indicator within dominant social factor j, MIN jk is the minimum possible value of the social indicator, and MAX jk is the maximum possible value of the social indicator. The maximum and minimum possible values were determined by making best guess estimates through studying U.S. Census Bureau projections . The dimensionless value for the hazard indicators (X H1,c and X H2 ) is determined in the same manner, using the unscaled hazard indicator values (X' H1,c and X' H2 ) found with the Weibull distribution for wind speed and the Irish model for surge height, and the minimum and maximum values were estimated using available hurricane data (NOAA 2009a). Next, the weights for the dimensionless social indicators (i.e. relative weight, w) and the weights for the dominant social factors (i.e. factor weight, Q) are determined through the use of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) (Saaty 1990). The AHP assesses the importance of a set of factors through a pairwise comparison. First, the AHP is used in determining the relative weight (w) for an individual social indicator within a dominant social factor. For instance, the percentage of labor participation may have more importance than the average number of persons within a household to the social vulnerability, which will be reflected in the determination of the weights of the social indicators. The factor weights (Q) of the dominant social factors are also determined through the AHP, because the dominant social factors will influence a region's vulnerability in different magnitudes. For example, the number of retirees (over 65 years old) and the number of Hispanics will have the greatest impact on the social vulnerability of Miami-Dade County, Florida ; therefore, these factors will have the greatest weight when determining the CCSVI for Miami-Dade County. Once the social and hazard indicators, their minimum and maximum values, and their respective weights have been established, the CCSVI can be calculated. The hazard factor (H) has two components, the wind hazard and the surge hazard, and each component has its hazard indicator. The CCSVI defines the wind hazard indicator as the wind intensity at a specific location or exposure determined with the parameters of the Weibull distribution, and the surge hazard indicator is defined the annual average surge height, which is affected by the continental slope at the site, determined through Eq. (6.5).  found that Hurricane Katrina caused a surge that carried as far as 10 km inland in some parts of Mississippi, while  found that the surge caused by Hurricane Hugo penetrated several hundred meters inland in Puerto Rico.

X H1,c and X H2 have been scaled to dimensionless values using Eq. (6.6). The H wind and H surge are then combined to find the Hazard Factor for each exposure category. The National Weather Service (2009) estimates that 60% of Hurricane Katrina damage costs can be attributed to hurricane-induced surge. The combination of damage due to hurricane intensity and hurricane induced surge may vary due to specific geographical information (e.g. elevation), different hazard measures (i.e. the wind intensity is an annual value while the surge height is based on historical data), and epistemic (knowledge-based) uncertainties within the study. Therefore, the ratio between H wind and H surge can be modified by varying a 1 and a 2 . where a 1 and a 2 are constants that can be varied to represent different weightings of H wind and H surge , H 1 (t) is the hazard factor for foreshore locations (i.e. category 1), H 2 (t) is the hazard factor for locations within 10 km of the coast (i.e. category 2), and H 3 (t) is the hazard factor for locations further than 10 km inland (i.e. category 3). The hazard factors for the three exposure categories are combined to create the Hazard Factor (H) for the region.

The dominant social factors (SF) of the CCSVI are calculated by weighting the indicator values together, and are obtained through Eq. (62).

The Hazard Factor was based on the mean maximum annual wind speed and the mean maximum surge height, and was determined through Eq. (6.7f), by combining the hazard factor for the three exposure categories. For this preliminary study, it was assumed that surge effects solely the foreshore locations; therefore, the hazard factor for foreshore locations was found by combining the wind hazard (H wind ) and the surge hazard (H surge ). There is some uncertainty as to how wind speed and surge combine when determining damage costs and vulnerability, so various combinations of the weights of H wind and H surge can be explored within Eq. (6.7c). As a starting point, three different ratios of wind hazard and surge hazard were explored. The first ratio of a 1 -a 2 (50-50) was explored because it averages out vulnerability due to wind speed and surge height, as assumed in the preliminary results for . The second ratio  was chosen because the hurricane surge of Hurricane Katrina is estimated to have caused 60% of the total loss (NWS 2009). The third ratio (65-35) was chosen to cover a wide range of different combinations of the weights. The CCSVI for Miami-Dade County was established using Eq. (6.8). The CCSVI(1) was determined under current climate projections and current demographics for the three ratios, see Table 6.4. These values are used in evaluating how the CCSVI will change under a changing climate and projected changes in demographics. The wind speed and surge height were assumed to vary by -5% to 15% over 50 years. The CCSVI was determined for various scenarios of climate change and for projected demographic changes for Miami-Dade County. The three various combinations of the weight of H wind and H surge (i.e. ratios) were explored, and it was found that the percentage changes from CCSVI(1) for the three ratios were similar, subsequently for the sake of brevity, the results are presented for the ratio of 50%-50%.

The CCSVI was estimated to be 6.70, which is about 4% higher than the CCSVI for Miami-Dade County at year 1 (see Table 6.4). Furthermore, the CCSVI was determined for tsunami conditions. The 2004 Asian Tsunami produced waves of approximately 30m high (NOAA 2009d). The CCSVI was estimated to be approximately 8.40 for tsunami conditions. This would result in an increase from the CCSVI(1) for Miami-Dade County (see Table 6.4) of approximately 30%. From these values it can be observed that the CCSVI can be a useful tool in assessing the social vulnerability of community to a hurricane hazard. The CCSVI increases as the intensity of the hurricane or storm hazard increases. The CCSVI increases as the intensity of the hurricane or storm hazard increases. TS Bonnie was found to increase the CCSVI(1) by about 4% and Hurricane Katrina was found to increase the CCSVI(1) by about 16%. A 4% increase in CCSVI, as for TS Bonnie, may not translate into a significant impact on the social vulnerability of a community, but increases in CCSVI of 16%, as for Hurricane Katrina, could given an indication as to how much damage a community could sustain (directly and indirectly). If these estimated increases in social vulnerability are possible, it is vital that decision makers explore strategies that could mitigate the vulnerability of a region to the impacts of increased hurricane activity as a result of climate change. As defined previously, social vulnerability is a combination of a region's capacity to respond and recover from a natural hazard, with minimal damage . Mitigating the social vulnerability of hurricane-prone areas would, therefore, include enhancing the regions capacity to respond and, ultimately, recover from a hurricane event. There are numerous ways decision makers can mitigate the social vulnerability of their respective region to hurricane events, such as land-use planning and creating comprehensive hazard/vulnerability maps. The CCSVI is a descriptive index, based on site-specific social factors and localized hurricane data. The proposed framework herein can be applied to communities that are susceptible to hurricanes, creating a ranking system for hurricane-prone communities. This ranking system could be an effective tool in aiding government authorities in making decisions on land-use planning and resource allotment. Furthermore, by conducting a PCA, as in this study, regions are able to identify the dominant social factors (SF) that have the greatest impact on the vulnerability for a given community. Once these dominant social factors have been identified and quantified, the locations of these groups should be mapped and, therefore, specific measures can be taken to address the special needs of each dominant social factor. For example, ethnic communities are often hindered by a language barrier that affects their ability to respond . Areas where there the elderly are prominent, for instance, may need special consideration because of mobility restrictions. Although they are not directly based on the analysis conducted herein, there are other strategies available that can aid in reducing the social vulnerability of a region. Strategies can involve enhancing the region's response time by increasing public awareness and knowledge of potential events through media, such as television, radio, and the internet. Enhancing the response time could also include reducing the evacuation time of regions by creating shorter and more effective evacuation routes. An increase in the number of available emergency shelters will accommodate a greater number of residents. All these strategies could mitigate the social vulnerability of regions to hurricane events."}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty in CCSVI", "text": "In order to address some of the uncertainty present in key variables within the study, the CCSVI is determined considering the random variability of wind speed and surge height using Eq. (6.3) and Eq. (6.5). For these preliminary results, a ratio a 1 :a 2 of 50%:50% between wind speed and surge height is assumed in the determination of the Hazard Factor. The CCSVI can be established for various combinations of changes in wind speed and surge height at year 50; however, for the sake of brevity four combinations of changes in wind speed and surge height are presented (i.e., 0% to 15%). The simulation histograms of CCSVI(50) for Miami-Dade County for various scenarios of climate change are presented in Figure 6.3. The mean was determined for each scenario of climate change, and was found to be 6.81, 7.01, 7.19, and 7.37, for increases in wind speed and surge height of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%, respectively. These values are lower than the values found in Table 6.4, which can be explained because of the wide range the wind speeds and surge heights used in the calculations (see Figure 6.1 and 6.2). Several distributions were fitted to the CCSVI(50) for no increase in wind speed or surge. Various statistical distributions were examined for goodness-of-fit, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Anderson-Darling test . Both tests were performed at a 5% significance level. The tests showed that the Weibull distribution is appropriate for CCSVI at year 50. Similar analyses were run on the CCSVI at year 25, and it was found that the Weibull distribution the best fit for 25 years, at a 10% significance level. The means and 5 th and the 95 th percentiles of the CCSVI are presented in Table 6.9. The means of the CCSVI vary as the wind speed and surge height are assumed to change, increasing with time if the wind speed and surge height are assumed to increase, and decreasing otherwise; however, the COV is constant regardless of climate change scenario (COV=8%). It is clear that there is variability within the CCSVI values which is expected given the high uncertainty associated with the random variability of the Weibull distribution and surge hazard model ( see Figure 6.1 and 6.2). This suggests that even under a 5% increase scenario there is more than 5% likelihood of CCSVI values exceeding that experienced by Hurricane Katrina, and that the probability of exceeding this benchmark set by Hurricane Katrina increases with more severe climate scenarios.  therefore, it is necessary for decision-makers to develop strategies that could mitigate the social vulnerability of a community to hurricane events. Social characteristics are difficult to quantify, but there is some consensus on which factors influence social vulnerability, as stated within this study; however, the effects of these dominant social factors vary between regions, which is why the PCA is utilized, as it identifies the dominant social factors within a specific community. Therefore, the CCSVI should be determined for a number of hurricane-prone communities to investigate how different social characteristics and hurricane hazards affect the CCSVI, and to create a ranking system for communities susceptible to hurricanes. This would also allow for additional insights on how to mitigate social vulnerability through use of the CCSVI. The CCSVI used, herein, could be refined to adequately represent conditions of the future so that a more accurate portrayal of the effects of climate change can be made. The CCSVI could be connected to direct loss by using a regression analysis, because a regression model can be used to find the relationship between the dominant social factors, wind speed, and surge height and the potential hurricane damage. Other direct losses including injury and death can be considered when estimating the hurricane risk of a region. Furthermore, the proposed framework could be expanded to investigate the effects of climate change after different time frames (i.e. 10 years, 30 years). As hurricanes are expected to become more frequent and/or have higher intensities, it can be expect that they will result in more injury and deaths. But frequency and intensity are not the only contributing factor to hurricane related death and injury, the social composition has an effect, as does the quality of the construction within a community. proposed herein will be split into four sections, however it can be noted that in some cases the future work proposed in one section could be applied to another (this especially applies to some proposed avenues with the first section (Hurricane Risk Assessment of Residential Construction) which can be applied to other sections). It is for the sake of brevity that some ideas are not duplicated between the four sections."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Risk Assessment of Residential Construction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Considering Climate Change", "text": "The hurricane risk assessment of residential construction includes hurricane wind field models, hurricane surge height models, and hurricane vulnerability models. There is much uncertainty associated with these models; therefore future work would involve the reduction of these uncertainties. layer model is implemented, because wind speeds generated with the wind field model need to be modified to account for surface conditions. Typically, the boundary layer model is simply in the form of a multiplication factor. For example, within this study, a conversion factor of 0.70 is used to adjust the 3-sec gust stipulated in wind speed maps to surface wind speed. The accuracy of this value could be refined through improved observations of the entire wind field. To account for the uncertainties present even further, building vulnerability models could be developed for specific construction types, construction materials, age profiles, code specifications, etc. Aging effects on existing building that will be retrofitted over a period of time need to be considered. In addition, to evaluate the indirect losses and social disruption by hurricanes, it would be beneficial to develop a more thorough economic decision analysis, which would consider the effect of various factors (e.g. insurance premiums, discount rates, exposure periods, life safety, social issues, incentives, and hurricane mitigation). Since some (  and Chapter 5, is only one step in determining the hurricanes replacement costs to power systems. Because of infrastructure failure (i.e. timber distribution pole failure), the power system may experience a power outage. As a result of the power outage it can be expected that customers experience lost production, equipment damage, utility costs, idle resources, etc . Each hour of outage or interruption can lead to significant losses for customers. Sullivan et al. (1997) estimated the cost of interruption for individual customers. The study conducted a survey of power system outages within the last ten years, and developed a statistical model for the determination of interruption costs. When determining the cost of interruption, first the type of customer (i.e. commercial, industrial, or residential) affected by the power outage must be identified. For example, a one hour outage occurring during business hours could result in a mean cost for a commercial or industrial customer that is 2000 times higher than that of a residential customer. Not only is the cost to residential customers significantly less, but the cost to commercial and industrial customers varies significantly ($0 to $1,000,000) (Sullivan et al. 1997). When a distribution pole fails, customers in the area will experience a power outage; therefore, the future work of the proposed framework is to model the costs of the outage (i.e. interruption). However, before the interruption costs can be estimated, the duration of interruption due to a potential hurricane event must be estimated. In the past few decades, estimating the duration of power outages due to hurricanes has been widely explored. Isumi and Shibuya (1985) modeled the restoration procedure after a hurricane event ignoring all uncertainty, where the restoration time is equivalent to the outage duration. Then an optimization model is used to minimize the time a customer is without power, using decision variables (e.g. repair times). The effect of these variables on the restoration times is then evaluated through a sensitivity analysis. Nojima and Sugito (2002) developed restoration curves from past data from earthquakes that show the percentage of customers for whom service has been restored. These curves represent utility performance during an extreme event; however, its application to estimating outage costs for future events is untested. Balijepalli et al. (2005) implemented a bootstrap method to estimate the parameters of a lightning storm. The parameters and fault rates were then combined in a MCS to estimate system reliability indices. The network approach involves simplifying the power system by using supply and demand nodes that are connected by functional/nonfunctional links. The mean time for restoration is then minimized through graph theory and optimization techniques. Xu et al. (2007) optimized the order substations were repaired after a major disaster. The regression approach accounts for the many variables that interact to affect the duration of a power outage. The past dataset must be large enough to describe the response of the power system to an approaching hurricane. Liu et al. (2005) implements a negative binomial regression to estimate power outages in North Carolina. The study recommends the implementation of a zip code regression model to estimate the duration of power outages. The zip code regression model has 5 input parameters. These input parameters are derived from data available using a similar technique as a PCA (principal components analysis), i.e. the input parameters are estimated by using a SAS statistical analysis package. The SAS takes variables based on the hurricane-outage rates, electrical power system inventory, hurricane wind speed, hurricane rainfall rates, soil drainage level, tree type, and land cover. From these variables the 5 input parameters are estimated for North Carolina, and are then input into the regression model. Unfortunately, the authors state that this model can only be used for North Carolina because the parameters are based on historical data for North Carolina. The author proposes using the Liu et al. (2005) binomial regression model to the duration of interruption due to a potential hurricane event in New Hanover County, North Carolina, as a starting point. Within the binomial regression, hurricane parameters consistent with the parameters used to estimate annual damage costs due to timber pole failure in New Hanover County (Chapter 4) will be used to estimate annual interruption times. Once the duration of interruption has been estimated, the customers within the region will be assigned a customer group (i.e. residential, commercial, industrial) and the proportion of customers within each customer group will be identified. LaCommare and Eto (2006) estimated the cost of interruption per hour for the three classes of customers, in 2001 U.S. dollars, is: Residential $8, Commercial $2,558, and Industrial $9,373. Finally, the duration of interruption, the proportion of customers, and cost of interruption per hour are combined to estimate the total cost of interruption for the area. The total cost of interruption is then added to the structural damage estimates found in Chapter 4. As hurricane intensity and/or frequency may change due to climate change, it can be expected that the frequency of intense hurricanes may increase; indicating that interruption costs may increase. Furthermore, the hurricane risk assessment of timber poles can be enhanced to account for hurricane frequency. This can be achieved by incorporating the GPD model for hurricane wind speed in a similar manner as for the hurricane risk assessment for residential construction (Chapter 3). In some cases it may be practical to include hurricane-induced storm surge in damage estimates for timber distribution poles, even though research strongly suggests that the primary cause of damage to timber distribution poles during hurricane events is hurricane wind speed . However, in such applications where damage estimates due to hurricane-induced surge height are preferred, the damage to timber distribution poles due to hurricane-induced surge height can be determined in a similar manner as outlined for residential surge damage in Chapter 3. In addition, studies have shown that windborne debris (includes anything that has been broken or destroyed) and windborne trees due to intense hurricane wind can account for a considerable amount of damage to the power system . Windborne debris during a hurricane can cause excessive damage to the environment; therefore to further enhance the accuracy of this hurricane risk assessment, the framework should be extended to include windborne debris in the damage estimates. Models have been developed (e.g. Willis et al. 2002) that estimate the damage that buildings may sustain as the result of windborne debris during hurricane events, and these models could be modified to be incorporated into the hurricane risk assessment framework developed herein."}, {"section_title": "Adaptation/Mitigation for Reduced Hurricane Damage Costs", "text": "The research herein developed a framework for hurricane risk assessment considering the impacts of a changing global climate. The framework was developed originally for residential construction and then adapted to timber distribution poles. In addition to the hurricane risk assessment framework, this research developed adaptation/mitigation strategies that could aid in reducing hurricane damage costs to both forms of infrastructure. A more detailed prediction of localized change in hurricane hazard patterns and sea levels change is desirable for regional adaptation. First, the research developed and evaluated five adaptation strategies for residential construction. These adaptation measures were developed to mitigate damages due to hurricane wind speed considering the impacts of a changing climate. As the hurricane risk assessment framework was extended to include hurricane-induced storm surge, a reasonable next step would be to develop adaptation strategies that would have the capacity to mitigate damage costs to residential construction from both hurricane wind speed and hurricane-induced storm surge. These measures would be potentially more costly and more disruptive, but could also significantly reduce damage costs, if the current work on adaptation for hurricane wind damage is any indication. Second, the work proposed four mitigation strategies for timber distribution poles to reduce damage costs due to hurricane winds. The mitigation strategies were developed for current climate conditions (i.e. no climate change); therefore, it is proposed that strategies for climate change adaptation be developed to mitigate the potential increase in hurricane damage costs due to climate change. The proposed mitigation strategies included replacing failed distribution poles with poles that are stronger (i.e. larger) than the failed poles and the pro-active measure of replacing old distribution poles. Future work could include looking at replacing failed timber poles with distribution poles that are constructed from different materials, e.g. steel poles and concrete. Using different materials could be a cost-effective measure in reducing pole failure rates in high risk areas."}, {"section_title": "Social Vulnerability of Hurricane-Prone Regions Considering", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Climate Change", "text": "It is possible that hurricane hazard patterns may change as a result of climate while coastal populations continue to grow. Therefore, this study proposes the Coastal Community Social Vulnerability Index (CCSVI) that considers the potential impact of climate change on the social vulnerability of hurricane-prone areas. The work herein looked solely at time-dependant changes in demographics and hurricane patterns (i.e. hurricane wind speed and hurricane-induced storm surge). The current work did not look into changes in the relative weights of each of the social indicators within the CCSVI. For example, from Table 6 the relative importance of each indicator has changed within its social factor, e.g. perhaps in 50 years the Percent of African American Population has a much smaller effect on the social vulnerability of a region to a hurricane hazard than stated in Table 6.3. In addition, the Social Factors were assigned a factor weight that indicates their respective importance within the CCSVI. It is quite possible that these factor weights may change with time. Currently, Social Factor 2 (Age and Gender) and Social Factor 5 (Hispanic) have the greatest influence on the CCSVI. Potentially, with time, Social Factor 2 could continue to be a driving force between the CCSVI in Miami-Dade County, but Social Factor 5 could become less dominant with the other social factors (i.e. 1, 3, and 4) becoming more influential in contrast. With changing social views characteristics, it is quite challenging to forecast the social dynamics that are driving forces behind social vulnerability of the future. Therefore, it would be interesting to look at possible changes within both the relative weights of the indicators and the factor weights of the dominant social factors. As previously stated, social characteristics are difficult to quantify; however, this research has presented a potential method in an attempt to quantify social vulnerability to hurricane hazards. The CCSVI is a compilation of social characteristics and hurricane In essence, three different forms of analysis were implemented for the hurricane risk assessment of residential construction. First, hurricane damage costs were estimated from solely looking at hurricane wind speeds on an annual base, and summing up damage costs over a specified time frame. As hurricane wind speeds contribute to only a portion of damage costs this research strove to find ways to combine other dominant parameters of hurricanes (i.e. hurricane frequency and hurricane-induced storm surge). Due to limitations of the surge height model, it was found that combining all three parameters is not possible at this time; however, when more sophisticated surge height models are available they can be easily incorporated into the proposed framework herein. Therefore, two other analyses are included; one that combines hurricane wind speed and hurricane frequency and one that combines hurricane wind speed and hurricane induced storm surge. This research finds that climate change could have a significant impact on hurricane damage costs to residential construction. If these increases in damage costs due to climate change are believed likely then, it is necessary to assess the economic viability of mitigation (adaptation) strategies to strengthen or retrofit construction in hurricane-prone zones. Five adaptation strategies were developed to mitigate damage costs to residential construction. An adaptation strategy involving strengthening new construction at foreshore locations also proved to be very cost effective and to cause the least disruption because it did not require the retrofit of older buildings. These adaptation strategies were found to be cost effective even if there is no change in wind speed, which implies that the strategies could result in a \"win-win\" situation. In comparison, similar adaptation strategies may not be economical for building in Queensland, Australia, mainly due to the relatively low hurricane intensity in the area. The research adapted the hurricane risk assessment framework to include timber power distribution poles, and assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the annual failure probability of the distribution poles. A fragility analysis was used to evaluate the damage risk of timber distribution poles. The annual failure probability of timber distribution poles was found to change significantly when they are subjected to changing patterns of hurricane hazard. Under the assumptions of the proposed framework for the hurricane risk assessment of distribution poles, the replacement costs of distribution poles for the \"do nothing\" case, i.e. without mitigation was found to be approximately $152 million for Miami-Dade County over a 50 year time frame. The high replacement costs warrant an investigation into the cost effectiveness of various mitigation strategies that may aid in reducing replacement costs. Four mitigation measures were developed for distribution poles in an attempt to reduce replacement costs, and through an evaluation of the mitigation strategies, it was found that mitigation strategies may significantly reduce replacement costs due to hurricanes. This research proposes the Coastal Community Social Vulnerability Index (CCSVI) that considers the potential impact of climate change on the social vulnerability of hurricaneprone areas. The study found that the CCSVI could increase significantly under various scenarios of climate change and for demographic projections; therefore, it is necessary for decision-makers to develop strategies that could mitigate the social vulnerability of a community to hurricane events. As hurricanes are expected to become more frequent and/or have higher intensities, it can be expect that they will result in more injury and deaths. But frequency and intensity are not the only contributing factor to hurricane related death and injury, the social composition has an effect, as does the quality of the construction within a community. km-% of houses located further than 10 km), and the median insured house value are included in the table for each county. To normalize the damage risk, Figure AI.1 shows the cumulative damage cost after 50 years per 100,000 residents for all three counties under various scenarios of climate change. From this figure it can be seen that Miami-Dade County has considerably higher expected cumulative damage cost per 100,000 residents than the other two counties. If no climate change is assumed, the cumulative damage costs is $1,600 million per 100,000 residents in Miami-Dade County, $620 million per 100,000 residents in New Hanover County, and $240 million per 100,000 residents in Galveston County. These figures increase to $1,840 million, $720 million, and $280 million for Miami-Dade County, New Hanover County, and Galveston County, respectively, under an assumed increase in wind speed of 5%. "}, {"section_title": "AI.2 Cost-Benefit Analysis of Adaptation Strategies", "text": "The cost-effectiveness of the adaptation strategies varies significantly among the three counties, mainly due to the fact that the expected annual damage in Miami-Dade County is considerably higher than that of the two other case study locations. All adaptation strategies were found to be cost-effective for Miami-Dade County if the cost of retrofit is not greater than 10%. In comparison, for New Hanover and Galveston Counties, the cost of retrofit would have to be as low as 3% for all strategies to be cost-effective.  From Table AI.3, it can be seen that under an increase in wind speed of 5%, adaptation strategy 2 could result in a net benefit of $1.06 billion for Miami-Dade County over 50 years, if the cost of retrofit is 10% and the annual rate of retrofit is 3%. Even if there is no change in wind speed, and rate and cost of retrofit were unchanged, adaptation strategy 2 could result in a net benefit of $780 million over 50 years. This implies that certain adaptation strategies could result in a \"win-win\" situation for society irrespective of climate change predictions.

Table AI.4 summarizes the net benefit for all three counties, under increases in wind speed of 5% and 0%, for Strengthened Construction Type I and Type II. From the table it can be seen that reducing the vulnerability of new construction by 80% is more cost-effective than reducing the vulnerability of new housing by 50%, if the cost of strengthening stays the same. From Table AI.4, it is evident that adaptation strategy 5 could be cost-effective if wind speeds in the three counties remain constant over a 50 year time frame. This implies that this adaptation strategy could result in a \"win-win\" situation for society.   The adaptation strategies were ranked individually for the three counties, summarized in the number of distribution poles that fail due to the extreme wind event.

Once the dominant social factors and the loadings have been identified for Miami-Dade County, a multivariate regression model is used to evaluate the impacts the social factors have on the potential hurricane damage costs considering various scenarios of climate change. Since the 35 municipalities of Miami-Dade County were used in the PCA, they will be used for the multivariate regression analysis. Therefore, it was necessary to identify the maximum annual wind speed of each municipality and the expected cumulative damage costs associated with the maximum annual wind speed. The maximum annual wind speed was found by applying the gradient-to-surface factor, according to the exposure category of the municipality, to the maximum annual wind speed found for Miami-Dade County.
