[{"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "Since hurricane Katrina (2005) flooded large parts of New Orleans and coastal Louisiana, a high demand for fast and accurate hurricane surge forecasting models and tools has been developed. Van den Berg (2008) developed the beta version of a rapid hurricane surge forecasting model eSURF. Furthermore, during hurricane Ike in 2008 eSURF predicted lower maximum water levels then were actually observed in coastal Louisiana. Therefore Lin (2009) adjusted eSURF by adding the Integrated Kinetic Energy parameter to improve eSURF predictions for hurricanes with a large wind span. The main objective of this thesis was to develop an organized historical hurricane database that can give quick insight in maximum water levels that occurred during historical hurricanes. Another objective of this thesis was to validate the rapid hurricane surge forecasting model eSURF with the water level observations stored in the historical hurricane database. The main research question of this thesis is: How accurate are the predicted maximum water levels of eSURF for historical hurricanes passing coastal Louisiana or near coastal Louisiana? The first result of this thesis is a historical hurricane database that contains meteorological and water level data for coastal Louisiana observed during hurricanes. The hurricanes included in the database: Lili (2002), Ivan (2004), Cindy (2005), Dennis (2005), Katrina (2005), Rita (2005), Humberto (2007), Gustav (2008), Ike (2008 andIda (2009). The following hurricanes are selected based upon criteria: (1) a hurricane should have at least category 1 strength on the Saffir-Simpson-Hurricane-Windscale, (2) have a track within 200 Nautical Miles of the state Louisiana and (3) occurred between 1999 and 2009. The basic hurricane characteristics, water level observations, total daily precipitation and wind speed vector grids have been stored. The data quality of information stored in the historical hurricane database is discussed in this report. The second result of this thesis is that the maximum water levels predicted by eSURF have a mean relative error of 37.2%. This error exceeds the mean error of the SLOSH model with 17.2%. The report includes validation of the historical hurricanes: Ida (2009), Ike (2008), Gustav (2008), Rita (2005) and Katrina (2005). eSURF has been validated based on 25 eSURF prediction points and 25 observations stations. Table 0-1 illustrates the overview on eSURF's accuracy. eSURF best predicted hurricane Ike (28.2%) and Ida (29.8%), based upon mean error. The most in-accurate predictions were made for hurricane Rita (48.7%). Although, Katrina (44.8%) and Gustav had similar mean relative errors (45.4%). Only 2.4% of the stations of eSURF are validated, due to limited amount of available maximum water level observations. When using the results of this validation, some care has to be taken into account as the results may not be representative for eSURF's general accuracy. The results of this thesis are only representative for the available and suitable 2.4% of the prediction points.

The city is located on the southeast coast of this state. In the vicinity of the city flows the Mississippi river, the largest river in the U.S.A. The river passes the city to the west and meets the Gulf of Mexico to the south east of the city. New Orleans and coastal Louisiana have been exposed to hurricanes for centuries. There are two main reasons why New Orleans is vulnerable to hurricanes. 1. Coastal Louisiana (including New Orleans) is subsiding (or sinking). The settlement of the ground level occurs due to consolidation of soils and groundwater pumping. The natural counterbalancing effect of the subsidence is the supply of new sediment due to flooding of the Mississippi river. However, this supply is prevented by the major flood control structures build upstream of the river. Therefore some parts of the city are already situated below mean sea level and continue to subside (American Society of Civil Engineers Hurricane Katrina External Review Panel, 2007). 2. The Mississippi river discharge can strongly increase, when a hurricane passes its 3,1 million square kilometer total area of drainage. The most recent devastating hurricane was on 29 th of Augustus 2005. It crossed the southeast coast of Louisiana with a hurricane force of category three. The high surge levels (in Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain) and the subsequent failure of the New Orleans Levee system caused a 80% flooding of the city of New Orleans. At this moment the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is rebuilding the levees and floodwalls around New Orleans. The 600 km long system needs to be ready before the 2011 hurricane system and will provide the greater New Orleans area protection against a storm that may occur one in 100 year. The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Planning area (LACPR) is defined by the USACE to their coastal zone for restoration and protections purposes against hurricanes. Figure 1-1 illustrates the LACPR areas. Overall, the USACE is responsible for the safety and protection of the people and buildings in the greater New Orleans area and has to operate several storm surge barriers during storm events. The closing and opening of these surge barriers mainly depends on the development of water levels and wave heights over time. In the United States the National Hurricane Center (NHC) monitors all storm developments on the Atlantic Ocean during Hurricane season (1 June to 30 November). After a tropical storm develops, the NHC issues every 6 hours forecasts of air pressure, storm size (diameter), forward speed, wind speeds and the expected storm track. About 24 to 36 hours prior to landfall, the National Weather Service (NWS) uses these parameters in their SLOSH (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) computer model to forecast maximum water levels. Besides SLOSH the USACE also uses the results of a modified version of the advanced circulation model (ADCIRC) SL15 grid. This numeric model computes water levels based on predicted wind speeds, air pressure, bathymetry and surface roughness of an area. In 2008 Royal Haskoning developed and introduced the use of a storm atlas. This atlas was developed by using more than 300 different \"Hypothetical\" Hurricanes that make landfall in the State of Louisiana. This Hurricane Surge Atlas is a useful tool during emergency operations. The data which is presented in the atlas shows the surge for hurricanes with different tracks, sizes, intensities and speeds. Looking up the hurricane that most resembles the approaching hurricane will give a quick first estimate of the surge levels that can be expected in the area of interest. Parallel to the development of the storm atlas, eSurf (experimental Surge Forecast) was developed. The beta version of eSURF has been developed by Van den Berg (2008) and improved by Lin (2009) in 2009. eSURF predicts the maximum surge levels based on the interpolation of surge levels from 152 hypothetical storms computed by Advanced Circulation model (ADCIRC). eSURF is basically a search engine and is used for fast maximum water level prediction during actual hurricanes. Both the storm Atlas and eSurf can be defined as rapid surge forecasting tools that help to provide quick insight in maximum surge levels caused by an approaching hurricane."}, {"section_title": "PROBLEM DEFINITION", "text": "At the moment there are only few tools available that can be used for fast and relatively accurate prediction of maximum water levels for coastal Louisiana. The model ADCIRC is a highly detailed numerical model, but has a long calculation time (+/-6 hours). This calculation time is not favorable, because the hurricane parameters (for example; radius, maximum winds and pressure) can change rapidly over time. The model SLOSH is used for determining the location of the potential of flooding, instead of determining detailed inundation depths and water levels in specific regions. The model eSURF has a short calculation time and uses 152 synthetically generated hurricanes by ADCIRC (eSURF). However, to better know the accuracy of eSURF's maximum surge level predictions and for further development of the model, a validation of eSURF with historical hurricanes is required. In July 2010 eSURF has only been validated with maximum water levels observed during 5 historical storms, but Van den Berg (2008) and Lin (2009) have not used many observations stations in their validation steps. In addition, three of these five storms have been validated with maximum water level prediction calculated by another model ADCIRC. At the moment the required data for validation is dispersed at many information sources and presented in a disorderly format. Therefore, an easy to access database with historical meteorological and water level data for coastal Louisiana is required to validate eSURF."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH OBJECTIVE", "text": "The main objective of this research is to validate the maximum surge level forecasting model eSURF.

The USACE defined this area as the main zone of Louisiana influenced by storm surge. In addition, the eSURF prediction points are located within this area."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH APPROACH", "text": "This research consists of three main parts. 1. Inventorying the required data for the validation of eSURF. (Q1,Q2) 2. Download and storage of this data in the Historical Hurricane Database. (Q3) 3. Validation of eSURF(Q4,Q5). 1. In order to know what needs to be stored in the database a literature review was executed to determine the minimum data requirements for the validation of eSURF. The data required for validation was written in the report of Berg v.d. (2008), Lin (2009). Next, hurricanes have been selected to be used for validation of eSURF. The hurricanes included in this thesis have been selected based upon the following criteria: \uf0b7 Categorized as a hurricane category 1 on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. In general, lower intensity storms cause relatively small storm surge compared with the hurricane force winds. \uf0b7 Made landfall within a 200 Nautical miles of the Louisiana state boundary. Hurricane Ike did not made landfall in Louisiana. However, due to its large span of wind it caused a storm surge at a large distance from the hurricane center. To also include hurricane Ike in the dataset this criteria has been used. \uf0b7 Occurred between 1999 and 2009. Due to the amount of meteorological and water level data available and the accuracy of the observed water levels, only hurricanes within this time frame have been used to store in the hurricane database. Many governmental organizations publish hurricane and observed water level information their websites. Through telephone conversations and emails with various engineers of Royal Haskoning in New Orleans and a thoroughly search on the internet the sources of data were identified. For all the found sources and observations stations a data inventory has been made. 2. The data collection process started once this inventory for each source of data was completed. Data was collected by simply downloading the information from the websites and by doing requests by email to the various organizations that had data available for the time period of the selected hurricane. The data was restructured and organized in such a way that all information was stored in the same format in order to easily compare and analyze the available information. Because all information has a spatial component (location along the Louisiana coastline) some of the information was mapped in order to visualize any spatial relationships between the data.  3. The final phase of this research is the validation of eSURF with the data stored in the HHD (Historical Hurricane Database). To validate eSURF; first, suitable hurricanes observation stations and prediction points have been selected out of the dataset based upon spatial and temporal criteria. For each observations station, a nearby eSURF prediction point has been selected based on its spatial component. The criteria is a 9000 feet distance between both locations. The hurricanes have been selected based upon the maximum amount of water level observations available and the landfall location of the hurricane. Next, a dataset with maximum surge levels predictions has been establish by running eSURF for all selected hurricanes. Comparing the maximum observed water levels during the time of a hurricane event with predicted maximum water levels by eSURF will give insight in the prediction capabilities of eSURF. However, the quality of the used meteorological and observed water level data for validation of eSURF can cause differences between the eSURF maximum water level predictions and maximum observed water levels. Therefore the accuracy of the water level measurements, the completeness of this dataset, influence of subsidence on maximum water level observations, and local terrain influences have been investigated. The accuracy of the water level measurements has been investigated by searching the organizations website on their view on the quality of their measurements. The influence of missing data on the validation of eSURF has been reduced by examining the historical hurricane database on missing water level observations during the hurricane landfall. By use of a literature review the influence of subsidence on coastal Louisiana has been estimated. After a first validation run, the locations of the both the prediction point and observations station have been closely examined with a relatively high resolution map of coastal Louisiana for those eSURF prediction points that had an error exceeding 2.00 feet. Due to the limited amount of time of this thesis, the prediction points with an error less than 2.00 feet have not been examined. The observations station that did not represent the eSURF prediction points have been excluded from list of stations used for the final validation of eSURF. The results of this last validation have been visualized in this report. The accuracy of eSURF is defined as the overall accuracy for all selected hurricanes and as the accuracy for the individual hurricanes. In this research accuracy is defined by the mean overall error (absolute and relative).In addition, under-or over-estimation is investigated with the use of a scatter plot. This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the observed maximum water levels and eSURF maximum water level predictions. A regression line in this scatter plot will illustrate if eSURF over-or underestimates the maximum water levels. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) determines how good the regression line fits the maximum observed water levels. Furthermore, the errors (in feet) for each prediction point have been visualized in histograms for the individual hurricanes."}, {"section_title": "OUTLINE", "text": "Chapter introduces the model eSURF.

In total 86 water level observations stations have been stored in the HHD. It contains 19 NOAA, 49 USGS stations and 18 USACE stations. Next, all water levels data could be downloaded into Excel files and .txt files. This data had to be re-organized and modified so it could be used for validation of eSURF. Next to deleting comment rows and unnecessary meta data, the following labels have been attached to the water levels: The station identity number, station name, its location (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees), the vertical datum used, the unit of observation, time of the observation (UTC 4 ) and hurricane name. eSURF uses the vertical referce datum NAVD 88. However, not all downloaded data is referenced to this vertical datum. Some of them are referenced to the datum NGVD 29 or to a station unique vertical reference level. Therefore these water levels needed to be converted to NAVD 88 in order to get a consistent dataset. For conversion of the vertical datum, an additional station specific conversion value has been attached to each water level observation and used to convert observed water levels to the vertical datum NAVD 88. The observed water levels referenced to station datum have first been converted to Mean Sea Level and then to NAVD 88. After the data has been modified, the maximum observed water levels during hurricanes have been visualized into maps. Maps do better visualize the observed water levels over coastal Louisiana. An example is displayed in appendix C. More of these maps could be made to provide a quick look in the spatial relations of the maximum observed water levels during a hurricane.

Directory 2 of the historical hurricane database contains the basic hurricane characteristics in a tab separated file (.txt). In addition, this chapter also contains shape-files of the basic hurricane characteristics for every hurricane. These characteristics can be easily imported in ArcGIS to visualize them on a map. Furthermore, water level data has been organized in a database for each organization. These databases contain two sheets, one with all data and one with a summary of all data by hurricane. The column labels of the sheet with all data is; YYYY (year), MM (month), DD,(day Three examples of visualizations made from the data stored in HHD are a map of maximum water levels observed in the LACPR planning areas, a map of the total precipitation at the hurricane landfall for Louisiana or a map of gridded wind speed and wind direction.

The measurement errors in the water level data of the three organizations, could influence the validation results. In addition, the measurement method could provide less accurate water levels. CO-OPS (A component of NOAA) monitors the quality of the data of the NOAA stations, for example filtering unusual water levels out of the dataset. Twenty-four hours a day and 7 days a week NOAA's employees check the quality of the measurements and published real-time water levels as preliminary observations. After about 2 weeks till 4 weeks, the data is being verified and published as verified water levels on the NOAA website. Water level measurements with measurement errors could assess the reality wrongly, but for this thesis it is assumed to be of inferior to errors associated with the main area of this research: Hurricanes. During hurricanes extreme wind velocities and waves impact the stations. It influences the quality of the observations. Several stations stopped measuring water levels during a hurricane because they were partly or completely destroyed. This results in gaps between observations. If stations had gaps during hurricane landfall, it could be that not the actual maximum water level is derived from the database. An example, as hurricane Katrina (2005) made landfall, all of the selected USACE stations stopped measuring and therefore the maximum water level derived from the dataset could wrongly display the actual occurred water level."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of vertical datum", "text": "The maximum water levels calculated by eSURF are referenced to NAVD 88(2004.65). The best suitable stations for validation of this model are those stations using this datum. The accuracy of the vertical datum establishment of each station directly influences the quality of the water level observations, hence this can impact the eSURF validation results. This section will discuss the accuracy of the vertical datum used throughout this study. The water levels are measured relative to a reference level, or also called vertical datum. Since 1991 the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) has been replacing the old vertical datum; the National Geodetic Vertical datum of 1929 (NGVD 29). On the 65 th day of 2004, a reestablishment of to the vertical datum has been made for a various location dispersed over coastal Louisiana. This correction to the datum is to reduce error, associated with the subsidence of this part of Louisiana. \"The land-surface altitude data collected in the levied areas of New Orleans metropolitan region during five survey epochs between 1951 and 1995 indicated mean annual subsidence of 5 millimeters or 0.016 feet per year. Preliminary results of other studies detecting regional movement of the north-central Gulf coast indicate that the rate maybe as much as 1 centimeter or 0.033 feet per year.\" (Burkett, Zilkoski, & Hart, 2003). If this subsidence value is extrapolated, the measured water level to the NAVD 88 6 during hurricane IDA (2009) could have included an error of 0.3 to 0.6 feet due to this datum issue. Therefore some of the observed water levels could be overestimations of the true water levels.   Along with storm surge, the waves can also overtop levees during a storm. Another feature of eSURF can be used to predict wave heights during a storm. Therefore, adding wave height data would add to the quality of the database and validation of eSURF. The format and extracting method issues regarding the wave height data are discussed in appendix C. Additional, precipitation grids during hurricane landfall of hurricanes before 2007 could be used for future research to the relationship between total observed precipitation and rise of water level at a river observation station."}, {"section_title": "ESURF VALIDATION", "text": "eSURF has been validated with the information stored in the historical hurricane database.

The selection criteria were: 1. The locations of lands fall are spread over Louisiana. 2. Hurricanes preferably occurred in the period between 2005 and 2009. The observations stations have been set to the new vertical datum NAVD 88(2004.65) in this period. Therefore using stations with these datum's should reduce the amount error related to datum conversion and increase the number of available stations with NAVD 88 (2004.65). Selection of observations stations Next, suitable USGS, USACE and NOAA stations have been selected. Suitable stations have at least maximum daily water level observations or hourly water level observations (daily maximum water levels can be extracted from this). In addition, suitable stations also have observations at the moment of landfall of the hurricane (this means there are no gaps in the measurements and therefore the maximum water level during the hurricane event is captured by the dataset). Furthermore, the referenced datum has to be NAVD 88 (2004.65) or NAVD 88. After the suitable stations have been filtered from the total list of stations to meet these requirements, a station-inputlist is created. The locations of the selected stations on the map of Louisiana have been used to estimate the nearest eSURF predictions points. The closest prediction points were chosen, however in some cases the closest prediction point was quite far away. Prediction points with a distance up to a maximum of 9000 ft 7 were selected. For some NOAA stations, multiple eSURF prediction points have been combined to interpolate the predicted maximum surge level on the location of the NOAA station. eSURF model predictions When the eSURF prediction points and the NOAA stations were selected, the maximum predicted water levels for hurricane Ida (2009), Ike 2008, Gustav (2008), Rita (2007), Katrina (2005) were calculated by eSURF.

Those stations that could not represent the prediction points have been excluded from this list. More information of this selection of suitable stations and prediction points can be found in appendix F. The final list of stations and eSURF prediction points has been used to provide a final validation of eSURF. An alternative criterion to select points for further examination could be the accuracy of the SLOSHmodel. This model has also been validated with historical hurricane maximum water levels. The validation of SLOSH proved that model had an overall accuracy of +/-20 % (if the historical hurricanes were described adequately in tropical cyclone reports) (Jelesnianski, Chen, & Shaffer, 1992).The 20% mean error has not been used, because it would result in a closer examination of almost all the eSURF points.

Both hurricanes made landfall outside Louisiana. Ike made landfall near the western border of the state Louisiana, Ida near the coast of south-east Louisiana. The hurricane category of Ike and Ida were both small compared to Gustav, Rita and Katrina. Ida was a category 1 hurricane near Louisiana and Ike a category 2 hurricane. Ida had a small RMW of 19 nautical miles, Ike had a large RMW of 37 Nautical miles.\nGustav made landfall in south east Louisiana as a category 2 hurricane. The date and time of landfall are September 1 th and 00:00 hour (UTC). Remarkable is the fact that maximum 1-minute sustained wind speeds decreases along with the minimum pressure. The RMW is smaller than the RMW of Katrina and Ike. Table 8-13 visualizes this. The maximum observed storm surge (above predicted tide) in Louisiana described in the tropical cyclone report of Gustav is 9.89 feet (Beven II & Kimberlain, 2009). The maximum estimated storm surge (above predicted tide) in Louisiana described in the tropical cyclone report of Gustav is 12.50 feet. Figure 8-16 visualizes the track of hurricane Gustav.

The prediction points (combination Q308 and Q309) and Q104 under estimated the water levels. A closer look on the map is needed to exclude possible terrain type influence on the station and points. There are two observations that have been chosen to represent the eSURF prediction point D1468, based upon distance between point and station. Station 8762372 is located at a distance of 1800 feet in some kind of channel near coast. Station 85555 is located at a distance of 900 feet along the coast. A site visit is recommended for both stations. Q308 and Q309 are located at a distance of 2700 feet to the coast. The observations station of NOAA is located at a distance of 500 feet off the coast. Although this is not set to be a case of doubt in the first place, it the bathymetry could have influenced the error. Prediction point Q104 is a case of doubt. On the map the location seemed like a swamp and the points are partly separated by land. But the station and prediction point are both connected by water and distance is relatively small compared to the distance between other observations stations and prediction points. A site visit to the NOAA station would provide the necessary details to exclude possible terrain type influence on the error.\nRita made landfall in south west Louisiana at the border of Louisiana with the state Texas. It made landfall as a major hurricane (category 3). The date and time of landfall are September 24 th ; 07:40 hour UTC. Remarkable is that the wind speeds slightly decrease, the pressure increases between 12 hours before and landfall. In addition, the radius to maximum winds has the smallest value compared to the other used hurricanes for validation. Hurricane Ida had RMW of 19 Nautical miles. Table 8-17 visualizes this. The maximum storm surge (above predicted tide) in Louisiana described in the tropical cyclone report of Rita is 9.89 feet (Knabb, Brown, & Rh, Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Rita, 2006). The maximum estimated storm surge (above predicted tide) in Louisiana described in the tropical cyclone report of Gustav is 12.50 feet. Figure 8-16 visualizes the track of hurricane Gustav. Maximum, minimum and mean error Hurricane Rita had the highest mean error (in feet and %). Also hurricane Gustav (45.4%) and Katrina (44.8%) had high mean error (%) compared to Ike and Ida. Furthermore, hurricane Rita has the highest minimum error (feet and %). The maximum, minimum and mean errors have been visualized in Table 8-19. For all stations having maximum water levels and prediction points available, a histogram has been made. This histogram in Figure 8-17 provides a clear overview on the amount of error for the prediction points in feet.  Figure 8-17 shows 5 error peaks with an error value exceeding 2.0 feet. The points are displayed in Table 8-20. It seems that eSURF underestimated most maximum water levels for these prediction points. However, a closer look on the map is needed to exclude possible terrain type influence on the station and points.\nHurricane Katrina made landfall in south-east Louisiana as a major hurricane (category 3). The date and time of landfall are August 29 th ; 11:10 hour (UTC). Remarkable is the fact that, Katrina had a similar RMW as Ike. In addition, the maximum 1-minute sustained wind speeds rapidly decreases till landfall. Furthermore, the minimum pressure rises. Table 8-21 visualizes this. The maximum storm surge (above predicted tide) in Louisiana described in the tropical cyclone report of Katrina is 18.7 feet (Knabb, Rhome, & Brown, Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Katrina, 2005). Figure 8-19 visualizes the track of hurricane Katrina. Maximum, minimum and mean error Hurricane Katrina does not have an exceptional mean error (%). Hence, hurricane Gustav (45.4%) and Rita (48.7%) had high mean error (%) compared to Ike and Ida. Furthermore, hurricane Katrina has the highest maximum error (feet). The maximum, minimum and mean errors have been visualized in Table 8-22.  Figure 8-20 provides a clear overview on the amount of error for the prediction points in feet.  Figure 8-20 shows 1 error peak with value exceeding 2.0 feet. This point is displayed in Table 8-23.  There are no artificial or natural barriers between eSURF prediction point Q167 and NOAA station 876092.

The question is: are these errors mainly caused by the data that is being used for the validation or are these caused by the way eSURF interpolates and predicts the water levels? With this in mind the following can be said: 1) It seems unlikely that vertical datum differences between observed and predicted water levels are the main factor contributing to large errors. Measured water levels are relatively low compared to the peaks in errors occurred at some eSURF prediction points. Differences vertical datum cannot explain those high observed errors. 2) Also stations that had missing water level data during hurricane landfall were excluded from the validation. Only stations that captured a peak water level during the full course of a hurricane are included. Therefore missing data (or missing peak water level data) cannot be used as an explanation for errors. 3) Only 2.4 % of the eSURF prediction points have been used in the final validation. This is mainly caused by the limit number of observation stations that performed measurements during a specific hurricane."}, {"section_title": "4)", "text": "In some cases there is quite a distance between the station location and the prediction point. Some of the errors may be explained because of this reason. 5) More water level data for more hurricanes would provide better insight in relation between hurricane characteristics and the observed water levels. 6) Overestimated prediction of the maximum water level by eSURF could be caused by a low tide at a station. Some errors may be caused because of this reason. A rough estimation of the range of astronomical tide results in a 0 to 3 feet range. 7) eSURF has also been validated by Lin (2009). Lin validated eSURF with hurricanes Betsy (1965), Andrew(1992), Katrina(2005), Gustav(2008) and Ike(2008). For Betsy, Andrew and Katrina Lin (2009) used maximum water level prediction by the numerical model ADCIRC. For Gustav and Ike water level observations from observations stations were used. Lin (2009) concluded that the maximum water levels predicted by eSURF for hurricane Gustav were generally overestimated. From this validation in this thesis, no such conclusion can be made from the regression line in the scatter plot of hurricane Gustav. This could be caused by the input parameters used by Lin(2009) and the observations stations used for validation. The differences between Lin (2009) parameters and this validation are described in appendix D. The result of the validation of Lin (2009) and this thesis both conclude an underestimation for hurricane Ike. Furthermore, both validations conclude that there is no over-or underestimation of the eSURF's maximum water level predictions for hurricane Katrina."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The main objective of this thesis was to develop an organized historical hurricane database that can give quick insight in maximum water levels that occurred during historical hurricanes. Another main objective of this thesis was to validate the rapid hurricane surge forecasting model eSURF. The historical hurricane database contains meteorological (wind speed and precipitation) and water level data for coastal Louisiana observed during hurricanes: Lili (2002), Ivan (2004), Cindy (2005, Dennis (2005), Katrina (2005), Rita (2005), Humberto (2007, Gustav (2008), Ike (2008and, Ida (2009. At least the maximum observed water level data and the basic hurricane characteristics were needed to validate eSURF. The HURDAT database provided the necessary hurricane characteristics. The USGS, NOAA and USACE provided the water level observations, needed for suitable station to extract maximum water levels during a hurricane. For quick access to the database for validation of eSURF the data has been labeled and if possible corrected to the vertical datum NAVD 88. Suitable stations were selected to limit the error in the validation due to non-eSURF related causes. The stations and prediction points have been selected based upon the criteria: distance between prediction point and station, vertical datum of water level, no missing water level observations during hurricane landfall, less influence due to terrain differences between prediction point and station. As a result 2.4 % of all eSURF prediction points have been selected for validation of eSURF. The model eSURF has been validated with hurricane Ida (2009), Ike 2008, Gustav (2008), Rita (2005) and Katrina (2005). The overall mean relative error is 37.2 %. This mean relative error exceeds the mean relative error of the slosh model with 17.2%. It seems that eSURF best predicted hurricane Ida and Ike. Overall, eSURF slightly underestimated the maximum water levels. More specifically, the predictions by eSURF for hurricane Ike, Ida and Rita are slightly underestimated.

The hurricanes should be selected based upon track and category. This would improve the level of insight in the relation between track or category storm and eSURF's accuracy. It also would improve the level of insight in the relation between hurricane category and eSURF's accuracy. 4. The prediction points exceeding 2.0 feet should be further evaluated. Therefore, possible terrain characteristics causing the errors can be excluded. Bathymetry and elevation maps and/or a site visit to the location of the station and prediction point could be used. 5. Further research to the influence of predicted tide levels on errors occurred in this validation. The ADCIRC model calculated for 152 hypothetical storms the maximum water levels for the prediction points in coastal Louisiana. eSURF uses these values in the set-up phase. However, in this thesis it is assumed that ADCIRC included spring tide levels in their maximum water levels.

This phenomenon has a variety of names. In the western part of the pacific it is called a Typhoon, and in the Indian Ocean it is called a Tropical cyclone (R.H. Simpson, 1981). Furthermore, the Atlantic hurricane season takes place in the period of the 1 st of June till 30 th of November. What are the factors that contribute to the initiation and development of a hurricane? The reason for the development of (most) hurricanes in the tropical zone is, because of the warm and humid climate. The first important factor is a water temperature of at least 27 \u00b0C. If the temperature of the water is below 27\u00b0C, it won't generate enough heat and humidity to create and fuel the hurricane (National Weather Service, 2010). Secondly, the rotation of the earth along with its spherical shape results in a Coriolis force. This force increases at higher latitudes and at a minimum distance of 480 km of the equator it is large   As the hurricane moves through the North Atlantic basin, several of the hurricane characteristics are published by the National Hurricane Center at a six hourly interval. These hurricane characteristics are being used as important input parameters by many storm surge models that estimate the coastal water levels. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) stores these parameters in the HURDAT. HURDAT is the Atlantic basin hurricane database (Hurricane Research Division). Table 8-2 illustrates these parameters. Other important factors that influence the magnitude of storm surge along the coast of Louisiana are: local bathymetry, coastal geometry, the river Mississippi discharge and precipitation. For example, a funneling shape of coastline squeezes water to a location. As the water column is pushed forward by the hurricane winds, the funneling shape of both the coast line and bathymetry forces the water level to rise.

The Holland -B parameter is one of eSURF input parameters required for running the model. This parameter describes the pressure profile of the hurricane at surface level. This parameter is a result of a post-analysis of the of historical hurricanes pressure and wind profile. However, it has not been found on the internet for the selected hurricanes. Therefore Holland B has been set to the value 1.27. 1.27 is the most commonly used Holland B parameter. The value is used to avoid over-or under estimation of the pressure profile if the value is unavailable. Figure 8.4 illustrate the pressure profile related to the Holland-B parameter. The impact of this assumption is estimated by comparing hurricane Gustav's input characteristics in eSURF, but the value of the Holland -B parameter has been set first to 0.7 then to 1.5.

For example, a structure (dam or lock) could separate the prediction point and the observations station. Therefore; this appendix describes the selection of stations for the final validation.

Observation stations that did not have the same terrain characteristics (see below criteria for a definition of this word within this thesis) as the prediction point have been deleted. These stations have been deleted to improve the quality of the used station list for validation. In addition, excluding external errors provides a better view on eSURF related errors. The following criteria have been used for this cleaning process: \uf0b7 An open water connection between station and prediction point. \uf0b7 Relatively small distance between point and station. \uf0b7 No structures, barriers or dams between station and prediction point. After selecting suitable stations and prediction points, this list has been used in the final validation round. Please note that the stations with errors of less than 2.0 feet have not been checked based upon terrain differences, due to limited amount of time for this research. Prediction point seems suitable. NOAA station is approximately located in the middle of the 2 eSURF points. The distance between both the prediction points and the coast is approximately 2700 feet. The distance between station and coast is 500 feet. Bathymetry could cause a difference between predicted maximum water level and observed maximum water level. "}, {"section_title": "G. INDIVIDUAL HURRICANE RESULTS", "text": "This subsection will evaluate eSURF prediction capabilities for the individual hurricanes in chronological order.

The character includes: basic hurricane parameters, track and maximum storm surge above tide level for the state Louisiana. \uf0b7 A histogram is displayed. This illustrates the amount of error in feet for each station. \uf0b7 Number of prediction points and observation stations used for validation. \uf0b7 A scatter plot is displayed. This scatter plot visualizes how eSURF maximum water level predictions related to the actual observed maximum water levels. The scatterplot could illustrate if a hurricanes maximum water level is underestimated or overestimated by eSURF. Table 8-5 provides an overview of maximum, mean and minimum errors in eSURF maximum water level predictions (relative and absolute errors) for all 5 hurricanes. IDA 2009Hurricane characteristics Ida did not made landfall in the United States, but its track curved to the east near the south-east coast of the state Louisiana. The date and time used for determination of the eSURFS input parameters is 10 th of November on 00:00 hour (UTC). Table 8-6 illustrates that Ida decreased in intensity at that time. This hurricane had a small radius to maximum winds, compared to the other hurricanes. The maximum storm surge (above predicted tide) in Louisiana described in the tropical cyclone report of Ida is 6.53 feet (Avila & Cangialosi, 2010).

The distance between the points is approximately 4000feet. However, both station and point have an open water connection. A closer look to the bathymetry of the area is needed to estimate the error due to depth differences. A lower depth could have cause a higher storm surge. The prediction point Q701 is also a case of doubt. Station located in a channel perpendicular to the Mississippi River. The prediction point is located in the Mississippi river.
