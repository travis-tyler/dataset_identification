This report examines the characteristics of low-income undergraduates and how they pay for college. It begins with a profile of low-income students, comparing them with their not-low-income counterparts. Then, focusing on low-income students who attend full time, full year, it examines their financial need, describes the contribution of financial aid, and presents what is known about how they close the gap between what they have to pay and the amount of aid they receive. Finally, the report compares threeyear persistence among low-income and not-lowincome undergraduates. For the purposes of. this report, low-income students were defined as those whose family income was below 125 percent of the federally established poverty level for their family size. Because the prices students pay and the financing strategies they adopt vary substantially with institutional level and control, students at public 4year, private, not-for-profit 4-year, and public 2year institutions are examined separately. Within institution type, dependents, independents without dependents, and independents with dependents are also considered separately because their financial obligations are quite different, and they are treated differently by the financial aid system."}, {"section_title": "The analysis relies primarily on the 1995-96", "text": "National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96). but also uses selected data from NPSAS:93 for comparison and data from the Be-ginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/98) to examine persistence."}, {"section_title": "Profile of Low-Income", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Undergraduates", "text": "In 1995-96, 26 percent of all undergraduates were low income. At private, not-for-profit 4-year; public 4-year; and public 2-year institutions, the proportion of students who were low income ranged from 21 to 26 percent. A much greater proportion of students at private, for profit institutions were low income (48 percent), but relatively few (about 5 percent of all undergraduates) attended this type of institution. About one-half (49 percent) of all undergraduates were dependents, and a relatively small proportion were from low-income families (figure A). The other half of the undergraduate population was about evenly divided between independents Figure  without and with dependents of their own. (Spouses are not considered dependents.) Independent students were more likely than dependents to be low income because their parents' financial circumstances are not considered for aid purposes. Overall, 17 percent of dependent undergraduates were defined as low income. Certain groups were particularly likely to be in this category, including minorities and students whose parents had not gone to college. As parents' education increased, the percentage who were low income decreased (from 55 percent when both parents had less than a high school diploma to 23 percent when at least one parent had finished high school to 12 percent when at least one parent had attended college). Independents without dependents were almost twice as likely as dependents to be low income (31 percent were in this category). Rather than reflecting a disadvantaged background (there was no strong relationship between parents' education and students' low-income status), low-income status was closely related to marital status, age, and employment and enrollment status. Independents without dependents were much more likely to be low income if they were single rather than married. The likelihood of being low income declined with age. in part because older students are more likely to be married and have greater earning potential. Students who did not work or considered themselves primarily students were more likely to be low income than those who considered themselves primarily employees. About half of those who enrolled full time. full year (51 percent) were low income. 'Independents with dependents include single or married students with children or other dependents. As indicated earlier, spouses arc not consid-Distributed by DynEDRS ered dependents; their incomes are included in calculating family income. This group was the most likely to be low income (40 percent). As was true for independents without dependents, lowincome status was related to marital status, age. and primary role while enrolled (student or employee). Fifty-six percent of single parents were low income; the younger the students, the more likely they were to be low income; and they were more likely to be low income if they did not work or if they worked but considered themselves primarily students."}, {"section_title": "Financial Need", "text": "Financial need is the difference between the price of attending a postsecondary institution and what the student is expected to pay based on the family's financial circumstances. Compared with the average prices of attending the different types of institutions, the average expected family contributions (EFCs) for low-income students were relatively small (table A). Consequently, virtually all low-income undergraduates attending full time, full year had financial need (that is, the student budget minus EFC was greater than zero). The amounts of financial need were substantial at all types of institutions, ranging from about $5,800 to $16,700, varying with dependency status and type of institution (table A).\nFinancial need is the difference between the price of attending a postsecondary institution and what the student is expected to pay. Financial aid officers at each institution estimate the price of attending by developing student budgets for various categories of students. The student budgets take into account the amounts students must pay for tuition and fees, books and materials, and reasonable living expenses (based on whether the student lives on campus, independently off campus, or with parents or relatives). The expected family contribution (EFC) is determined by a formula that takes into account family income and assets, family size, and the number of other college students in the family. For independent students, the financial circumstances of the parents are not considered, only those of the students and their spouses. To calculate financial need for a given student, a financial aid officer takes the appropriate budget and subtracts the student's EFC. The EFC does not take into account the price of attending the institution the student chooses. However, if a student decides to attend a high-rather than low-priced institution, the student will have a higher budget, and consequently there will be a greater difference between the budget and the EFC (that is, greater financial need). There is no guarantee that this need will be fully met, however. While the price of attending can be estimated in a relatively objective manner, developing the formulas to specify the appropriate amount for a family to pay has been more subjective. The methodology used to calculate the EFC has changed many times over the years as policymakers have attempted to achieve simplicity and fairness and to ration limited student aid funds. Issues related to fairness and simplicity include at what age students' family income should not be considered in determining financial need; how the incomes of noncustodial or stepparents should be treated when parents are divorced; what assets should be counted; what percentage of their assets parents should be expected to contribute; and how much students should be expected to work. Proposed changes in the calculation of the EFC have always been evaluated in terms of their implications for the amount of aid that would have to be disbursed and to whom.10 I\u00b0For a discussion of these issues, see Financial Need\nDependency status is not a factor in assessing charges for tuition and fees. Thus, any observed variation in average tuition by dependency status reflects a tendency on the part of the different groups to choose different types of institutions. Among low-income undergraduates attending full time, full year, average tuition and fees for dependents were $3,600 at public 4-year institutions and $11,500 at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions (table 3). Their counterparts who were independent without dependents paid similar average amounts, suggesting that they attended similar types of institutions. Independents with dependents, however, tended to enroll in less expensive institutions than students with other dependency statuses in both the public and private 4-year institutions: their average tuition was $2,900 at public 4-year institutions and $7,600 at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. Differences by dependency status at public 2year institutions were not statistically significant.\nFinancial need is calculated by subtracting a student's EFC from the institutionally determined budget. This represents the amount of financial aid for which the student is eligible, although there is no guarantee that this amount will be made available. Among low-income students attending full time, full year, virtually all had financial need, regardless of type of institution attended or dependency status (table 3). The average amounts these students needed were substantial and varied with the type of institution attended and dependency status, ranging from $5,800 for dependents at publis. 2-year institutions to $16,700 for dependents at private, not-forprofit 4-year institutions (figure 2).11 For each dependency status, full-time, full-year students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions had the greatest need, followed by those at public 4-year institutions and then those at public 2-year institutions. Among low-income stu&-nts attending part time, full year, generally at least 9 out of 10 had financial need, with the exception of independents without dependents at public 2-year institutions. Among this group, 78 percent had financial need (appendix table A.3). 11The difference between the average student budget and the average EFC is not exactly equal to the average financial need shown in table 3 because of missing data for each variable. Figure 2Average financial need for low-income undergraduates enrolled full time, full year, by type of institution and dependency status: 1995-96  Figure 3 shows, for each dependency status, the relationship between the average budgets associated with attending the various types of institutions on a full-time, full-year basis and the average EFCs for each family income level. At each income level, the difference between the average budget and avaage EFC is the average amount of financial aid for which students at that income level would have been eligible (although not necessarily receive).\nAt an average-cost institution of each type, dependent undergraduates from families with less than about $50,000 annual income would have been eligible for financial aid if they attended full time, full year. Students from families with higher incomes would have been eligible only at certain types of institutions. Among independent students enrolled full time, full year, those without dependents would have been eligible for aid at an average-cost postsecondary institution of each type if their incomes were less than about $30,000, and those with dependents would have been eligible if their incomes were less than about $50,000."}, {"section_title": "Financial Aid", "text": "Most low-income students attending full time. full year (86 percent) received some financial aid, and the average amount received by low-income students (calculated including those with no aid) was about $6,100.

This represents the amount that students must come up with to pay for their education. Even for low-income students attending full time, full_ year, a substantial part of this gap is met by student earnings while enrolled (table A). These earnings do not cover the net price, however. For dependent students, the amounts left after taking into account student earnings appear to be considerably higher than their families could afford to cover (and that data on parent contributions suggest that they are cov-V 9 Executive Summary ering), especially at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. For independents without dependents, earnings cover most of the net price at 4-year public institutions, but the gaps at private, not-forprofit 4-year institutions and public 2-year institutions are large. The pattern is similar for independents with dependents. Despite these apparent gaps between the net price of attending and students' financial resources, the students are enrolled. How do they manage? One possibility is that they are surviving on a lower budget than estimated by their institutions. Other possibilities are that students are actually earning more than estimated (students often have numerous short-term jobs), are able to save from summer earnings, or have savings accumulated before they enrolled. Yet another is that they have received more than estimated from their parents. Or, they may be borrowing from sources other than student loan programs. The actual contributions of parents and other family members are difficult to determine because families typically do not keep detailed records and this type of information is difficult to recall many months later in a telephone interview. In addition to the amounts repbrted as allowances, about onethird of all low-income students attending full Distributed by DynEDRS time, full year reported that their parents pal' for all or part of their tuition, housing, meals, or books, but we do not know how much this amounts to.

through some combination of current earnings, savings, and borrowing. Low-income families rarely have substantial savings or assets against which to borrow, and are unlikely to have enough to pay for college out of current income. To place their situation in context, a family at the 20th income percentile (that is, 80 percent of all families have higher incomes) would be required to spend 32 percent of their income to cover the charges for tuition, room, and board at an average-priced public college or university in 1995 and 89 percent at an average-priced private one.' Thus, students from low-income families will normally need substantial financial assistance to be able to attend college. This report examines the characteristics of low-income undergraduates and how they pay for college. It begins with a profile of low-income undergraduates, comparing them with their not-low-income counterparts. It then examines their financial need, describes the contribution of financial aid, and presents what is known about how students close the gap between what they have to pay and the amount of aid they receive. Finally, the report compares three-year persistence rates for low-income and not-low-income undergraduates."}, {"section_title": "ackgrouind", "text": "In the years since the passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965, the federal government has established a range of programs to provide financial assistance to students enrolled in postsecondary education. This assistance comes in many forms, including grants, which do not need to be repaid, subsidized and unsubsidized loans, which must be repaid, and subsidized student employment through work-study programs. Most states support students through the tuition subsidy provided to all students at public institutions, and many states offer their own student aid programs over and above the federal ones. Still more financial assistance, usually in the form of grants, comes from institutions, community organizations, employers, and others. While some of these programs are merit based and provide support to students in a wide range of income brackets, most target students with financial need. A fundamental objective of financial aid programs has always been to enable students with limited financial resources to continue their education Introduction after high school and to minimize the financial constraints that limit students' choice of institutions. As the price of attending college has escalated, concerns about accessibility and affordability for low-income students have intensified. To determine how low-income undergraduates pa , for college and how well the current financial aid system is serving them, this report addresses questions such as: What are the characteristics of low-income students other than their limited financial resources, and how do these characteristics compare with those of other students? What is the price of their undergraduate education, and how much financial help do they need? How many low-income undergraduates received financial aid of each type, and how much did they receive? What proportion of their expenses are not met by financial aid, and what do we know about how they cover these expenses? Do low-income students have lower persistence rates than those with greater financial resources? While the data available to this study provide useful insights about how low-income undergraduates pay for their education, it is impossible to describe completely how they do so. First, we do not know the exact amounts they pay. An assumption has to be made that the student budget determined by the institution is a close approximation of the price of attending, and this assumption may not always be correct. (This topic is discussed further in the section on the Price of attending.) Second, while the amounts of student aid awarded through federal, state, and institutional programs are well documented by the institutions attended, information on other scholarships, employer aid, student earnings, and contributions from families and friends is all student reported through telephone interviews. Consequently, only a limited amount of time is available to gather information. Furthermore, individuals' recollections of the exact amounts of their earnings and of contributions from relatives and friends over a period of a year are unavoidably approximate. Nevertheless, the analysis provides considerable useful information on how low-income students pay for their education, particularly on the extent to which student financial aid programs support them."}, {"section_title": "Definition of Low Income", "text": "For this analysis, low-income students were defined as those whose family income was below 125 percent of the federally established poverty level for their family size. In 1994 (the determining year for 1995-96 financial aid eligibility), the levels were as follows: For dependent students, family income includes their parents' income as well as their own; for independents with and without dependents of their own, it includes the student's income and the spouse's income if the student is married. (For financial aid purposes, a spouse is not considered a dependent.) This definition of low income, also used in an earlier report on low-income students,2 has several advantages. First, it is independent of who goes to college, meaning that students meeting this criterion are poor relative to the general population, not just relative to other college students. Second, because the poverty levels are stated in terms of both income and family size (as shown above), comparisons among students in different family sizes are appropriate. Finally, the poverty levels are updated annually and adjusted for inflation, allowing meaningful comparisons over time."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This report relies primarily on data collected through the 1995-96 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96). NPSAS:96 combines student and parent interview data; institution-reported registration and financial aid data; institutional characteristics matched from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS); student background and financial information from FAFSA financial aid forms (aid applicants only); and longitudinal loan data from the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) (federal loan recipients only).

Students who attended more than one institution in 1995-96 (about 5 percent of all undergraduates3) are excluded from most of the analysis in order to avoid the confounding effect of different prices of attending and varying types of aid when a student attends more than one institution. Within institution type, students who attended full time for the full year (36 percent of all undergraduates) and students who attended part time for the full year (23 percent of all undergraduates) are examined separately. The 41 percent of undergraduates who did not attend either full time, full year or part time, full year have such varied attendance patterns that it is impossible to discuss them meaningfully as a group. The discussion of student characteristics covers all lowincome students, but the discussion of how students pay for college focuses primarily on students who attended full time, full year. Data on all students and on part-time, full-year students are presented in tables in appendix A. These tables also show data for students who attended private, for-profit institutions, but not by attendance status because of the relatively few number of students at this type of institution (5 percent of all undergraduates).4 The low-income student population consists of traditional college-aged students who are financially dependent on their parents, financially independent students with no dependents of their own, and financially independent students with their own dependents. (Spouses are not considered dependents here.) These three groups have quite different financial resources and obligations and are treated differently by the financial aid system. Therefore, when examining hoW lowincome students pay for their education, it is important to consider each group separately within institution type. Because how students pay for their educaticn generally varies more by institution type than by dependency status, the data are presented by dependency status within institution type rather than by institution type within dependency status. 3U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Profile of Undergraduates in U.S. Postsecondaty Education Institutions: 1995-96 (NCES 98-084) (Washington.

At private, not-for-profit 4-year; public 4-year; and public 2year institutions, the proportion of students who were low income ranged from 21 to 26 percent (table 1). A much greater proportion of students at private, for-profit institutions were low income (48 percent); however, as indicated in the Introduction, only 5 percent of all undergraduates attended this type of institution. Students with certain demographic characteristics were particularly likely to be low income. Students ages 24-29 were in this category (40 percent were low income), as were minorities (black, non-Hispanics, 43 percent; Hispanics, 40 percent; Asian/Pacific Islanders, 34 percent; and American Indian/Alaskan Natives, 42 percent), single parents (56 percent), students from families where neither parent finished high school (38 percent), and students from families where neither parent had gone to college (31 percent). While the definition of low income used in this analysis is unrelated to the financial aid system, whether a given student would be considered low income or not for this analysis is related to that student's dependency status for determining eligibility for financial aid. For financially dependent students, their parents' incomes and financial circumstances determine their eligibility regardless of whether or not their parents actually provide any financial support. For financially independent students, only the incomes of the students and their spouses are used to determine eligibility. Parents' income is not taken into account, even if the parents provide financial support. From a financial aid perspective, there are three distinct groups of undergraduates: dependent students; independent students without dependents (spouses are not considered dependents); and independent students with dependents of their own. Each group is profiled separately here. About one-half (49 percent) of all undergraduates were dependent, but a relatively small proportion of all undergraduates were dependents from low-income families (8 percent) (figure 1). The other half of the undergraduate population was about evenly divided between independents without and with dependents (26 and 25 percent, respectively). Independent students were more likely than dependent students to be low income because their parents' income is not included in their family income. Of the entire undergraduate population, a percent were low-income dependents   "}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "'buted by DynEDRS"}, {"section_title": ".EST COPY AVAiLABLE", "text": "Profile of Low-Income Undergraduates percent were low-income independents without dependents, and 10 percent were low-income independents with dependents."}, {"section_title": "Dependents", "text": "Undergraduates less than 24 years of age are normally considered financially dependent on their parents for the purpose of determining financial aid eligibility. The main exceptions are married students and students with dependents of their own. Both types of students are automatically considered independent even if they are less than 24 years old, but there are relatively few of them. In 1995-96, 96 percent of 18-year-olds and 89 percent of 19-to 23-year-olds were considered dependent.5 Overall, 17 percent of all dependent students came from low-income families (low-income would be less than about $19,000 for a family of four, for example), but there was substantial variation by race/ethnicity and parents' education (table 1). Dependent students from minority racial/ethnic groups were much more likely than white, non-Hispanics to be low income (30 to 36 percent versus 10 percent). There was an inverse relationship between the level of parents' education and the percentage of students who were low income. Fifty-five percent of students whose parents both had less than a high school diploma were low income, while 23 percent of those with at least one parent who had finished high school and 12 percent with at least one parent who had attended college were low income. Among dependent undergraduates, low-income status does not appear to have a major effect on where they enroll, with low-income and not-low-income students about as likely to attend public or private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions and public 2-year institutions (table 2).

As was the case with dependents, minorities were more likely than white, non-Hispanics to be low income. Unlike dependents, however, there was no strong relationship between parents' education and low-income status.8 Rather than reflecting a disadvantaged family background, low-income status for independents without dependents is closely related to the student's marital status, age, and employment and enrollment status. Independents without dependents were much more likely to be low income if they were single or separated than if they were married (40 percent versus 14 percent), probably at least in part because there was no spousal income to contribute to the family income. The likelihood of being low income declined with age (from 59 percent of those less than 24 years old to 37 percent of those 24-29 years old to 21 percent of those 30 years or older). This can be explained by the fact that older students are more likely to be married or to have greater earning potential if employed while enrolled. In addition, low-income status was related to the priority that students gave to studying versus working. About one-third (36. percent) of the independents without dependents who were not working and 39 percent of those who worked but considered their primary role to be that of a student were low income. A much lower percentage of those whose primary role was as an employee were low income (13 percent). About one-half (51 percent) of those who enrolled full time, full year were low income. Compared with their not-low-income counterparts, low-income independents without dependents were more likely to be male, less than 30 years old, and single (table 2). They were also more likely to be enrolled full time, full year, and not to work (or if they did work, to consider themselves primarily students rather than employees).9\n)0 Closing the Gap There are two major ways to look at the financial situation of low-income students once financial aid is taken into account. One approach is to look at unmet need, which is calculated by subtracting the expected family contribution (EFC) and financial aid from the student budget. The difficulty with this measure of students' financial circumstances is that it assumes that the EFC is a measure of what families can afford, which may or may not be true, because, as discussed earlier, the EFC is a financial aid rationing device as well as an indicator of what a family can afford to pay. The other approach is to look at net price, which is defined as the student budget minus financial aid. This represents the amount of money that students and their families have to come up with during a given year in order for the student to enroll.\" This section examines both unmet need and net price, but focuses on the availability of student earnings and assistance from families and friends to close the gap between net price and financial aid."}, {"section_title": "Independents With Dependents", "text": "Undergraduates with dependents are considered financially independent of their parents regardless of their age.

As was true for independents without dependents, lowincome status was related to family status, age, and primary role while enrolled (student or employee). Fifty-six percent of single parents were low income; the younger the students were, the more likely they were to be low income; and they were more likely to be low income if they did not work or if they worked but considered themselves primarily students. Low-income independents with dependents differed from their not-low-income counterparts (table 2). Specifically, they were more likely to be female, less than 30 years old, and single parents. They were also more likely than their not-low-income counterparts to be enrolled full time, full year; to attend a private, for-profit institution; or to be not working or if working to consider themselves primarily students. 1333 41.wsuimminNimmasionimise t*-4\"411111IMMINNalliMMINI"}, {"section_title": "Price of Attending", "text": "The price of attending (as represented by the student budget) has two major components.

Because the parents of dependents from low-income families are not expected to contribute very much for their children's education, the difference between the EFCs of dependents and independents without dependents tends to be less. In both cases, the EFC consists primarily of the contribution expected from the students themselves.

In addition to the amounts reported as allowances, about one-third of all low-income students attending full time, full year reported that their parents paid for all or part of their tuition, housing, meals, or books, but we do not know what Figure 8Average amounts for selected components of price and sources of funds for independent lowincome undergraduates without dependents enrolled full time, full year, by type of institution: 1995-96 "}, {"section_title": "41", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE Closing the Gap Figure 9Average amounts for selected components of price and sources of funds for independent low-income undergraduates with dependents enrolled full time, full year, by type of institution: 1995-96 this amount was. Since low-income independent students do not necessarily come from lowincome family backgrounds, their parents may have substantial resources. As indicated in the Introduction, it is impossible to describe completely how low-income students cover the price of attending. In conducting this analysis, the assumption had to be made that the budget determined by the institution closely approximated the price of attending, and this assumptions may not always be correct. In addition, information on scholarships from private sources, employer aid, student earnings, and contributions from families and friends is all student reported through telephone interviews, which allow only a limited time for gathering information. Individuals' recollections of the exact amounts over a period of a year are unavoidably approximate, and therefore they are not asked about them in great detail. Cha ges etween 1992-93 and 1995-96 Between 1992-93 and 1995-96, tuitions increased, financial aid eligibility criteria changed. and unsubsidized student loans were introduced, all of which affected low-income students. The specific impact of these changes on how low-income students who attend full time, full year finance their education is examined here. Independents with and without dependents were combined in table 16 to make the data for 1992-93 and 1995-96 comparable. This was necessary because of the way in which spouses were treated for the purposes of determining eligibility for financial aid. In 1992-93, spouses were considered dependents; in 1995-96, they were not. Among low-income students who attended full time, full year, those who attended public 4-.year institutions faced higher average tuition charges in 1995-96 than in 1992-93 ($3,400 versus $2,60016) (table 16). (At private, not-for-profit 4-year and public 2-year institutions, the apparent increases in average tuition were not statistically significant.) Due to changes in the way that EFC is computed (most notably, dropping the minimum student contribution), the average EFCs for both dependents and independents tended to be lower in 1995-96 than in 1992-93. (The differences for dependents at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions and independents at public 2year institutions were not statistically significant.) The net result of changes in tuition, budgets, and EFCs for full-time, full-year low-income students was an increase in average financial need for dependents at public 4-year institutions and independents at all three types of institutions. Average grant aid (calculated for all full-time, full-year low-income students, including those who did not receive grants) increased for dependent students at public 4-year institutions (from $2,700 to $3,400), but not for any of the other groups of students considered here. Between 1992-93 and 1995-96, the average amount borrowed (calculated for full-time, full-year lowincome students, including those who did not borrow) rose for dependents at public 4-year institutions (from $1.400 to $1,800) and independent students at both types of 4-year institutions (from $2,200 to $3,800 at public 4-year institutions and from $2,800 to $4.200 at private, not-forprofit 4-year institutions). The only group for which the percentage who borrowed increased was independents at public 4-year institutions (from 58 percent to 70 percent) (figure 10).

Among undergraduates who began their postsecondary education in 1995-96, students who were not low income were more likely than their low-income counterparts to have attained or been enrolled in 1998..(71 peicent versus 59 percent). Persistence is affected by a variety of factors other than income. In order to determine whether persistence is associated with low-income status independently of these other factors, a multivariate analysis was conducted using a regression mode1.17 The dependent variable was defined as the likelihood of persisting (that is, either attaining a degree or being still enrolled) until 1998. In addition to low-income status, the model included a number of independent variables that describe students' background and enrollment characteristics. They are listed in table 17. The first column shows the percentages of students who began their postsecondary education in 1995-96 who persisted through 1998. The second column shows the corresponding percentages after being adjusted for the covariation of the independent variables included in the regression equation. Asterisks indicate when a particular group differs significantly from the comparison group (shown in italics). The results show that even after controlling for student background and factors likely to affect persistence, low-income beginning students still had lower persistence rates than their notlow-income counterparts. The unadjusted persistence rate for low-income and not-low-income students were 59 percent and 71 percent, respectively. After adjustment, 64 percent of lowincome and 69 percent of not-low-income students persisted. The model does not necessarily include all factors that affect persistence. However, of those included in the model, factors associated with lower persistence rates for beginning undergraduates included being black, non-Hispanic (rather than white, non-Hispanic), being financially independent for financial aid purposes (rather than dependent), delaying entry into postsecondary education two years or more after high school, enrolling part time for the entire period (rather than full time), enrolling first in a public 2-year institution (rather than a public 4-year \"See appendix C for details on the methods used."}, {"section_title": "ted by DynEDRS", "text": "Persistence Among Low-Income Students Table 17-Percentage of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who attained a degree or were still enrolled in 1998 and the adjusted percentage after controlling for the variables listed in the  3 Least squares coefficient, multiplied by 100 to reflect percentage (see appendix C). 4Standard error of least squares coefficient, adjusted for design effect, multiplied by 100 to reflect percentage (see appendix C)."}, {"section_title": "6G", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Susnlinary and Conchnsions", "text": "Students from low-income families typically need substantial financial assistance to attend college. In 1995-96, 26 percent of all undergraduates were low income. Independents with dependents were most likely to be low income (40 percent), followed by independents without dependents (31 percent), and then dependents (17 percent). Among dependent students, lowincome status was related to parents' education. Among independent students, however, there was no strong relationship between parents' education and low-income status. Instead, lowincome status for independents was closely related to marital status, age, and primary role (as a student or employee). Independent students tended to be low income when they were not married (and therefore did not have a spouse's earnings to add to their family income) and when they were primarily students (and placed a lower priority on working). In addition, the likelihood of being low income decreased with age (as marriage became more likely and earning potential increased if the student was employed). Virtually all low-income students enrolled full time, full year had financial need (that is, the student budget minus the EFC was greater than zero). The average amounts were substantial, ranging from $5,800 to $16,700, depending on dependency status and type of institution. A large majority of these students (86 percent) received some financial aid (81 percent received grants and 51 percent took out loans). On average, aided low-income students attending full time, full year had about 60 percent of their budgets covered by aid. About 60 percent of their aid was in the form of grants, and 32 percent in the form of loans. The rest came from work-study and \"other\" types of aid. Despite the usefulness of the concepts of need and unmet need for financial aid policy purposes, a more relevant number for the student is the net price, which is the difference between the student budget and the amount of financial aid received. This represents the amount that the student must pay in the current year. (Loans must be repaid, but in the future.) A substantial amount of the net price was covered by student earnings while enrolled, and parents do contribute, but gaps remain. The students are enrolled, which means that they are either surviving on a lower budget than estimated by their institution or have other sources of funds. For example, they might actually be earning more than estimated (students often have numerous short-term jobs). They might be able to save from summer earnings, or have savings accumulated before they enrolled. Yet another explanation is that they have received more than estimated from their parents. Or, 51 6 7 Summary and Conclusions they may be borrowing from sources other than student loan programs. Low-income independent students do not necessarily come from low-income backgrounds, so their parents may have substantial resources and help pay. Low.:income students are at greater risk than other students of not completing. After controlling for student background characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, and parents' education) and other factors thought to affect persistence (dependency status, institution type, enrollment delay after high school, enrollment status, amount worked, borrowing, and assistance from parents), low-income students who began their postsecondary education in 1995-96 were less likely than not-low-income students to have attained a degree or certificate or be still enrolled.
