[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "One distinct feature of the cerebral cortex is its convex (gyri) and concave (sulci) folding patterns. Due to the remarkable complexity and variability of gyral/sulcal shapes, it has been challenging to quantitatively model their organization patterns. Inspired by the observation that the lines of gyral crests can form a connected graph on each brain hemisphere, we propose a new representation of cortical gyri/sulci organization pattern -gyral net, which models cortical architecture from a graph perspective, starting with nodes and edges obtained from the reconstructed cortical surfaces. A novel computational framework is developed to efficiently and automatically construct gyral nets from surface meshes, and four measurements are devised to quantify the folding patterns. Using an MRI dataset for autism study as a test bed, we identified reduced local connectivity cost and increased curviness of gyral net bilaterally on the parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe in autistic patients. Additionally, we found that the cortical thickness and the gyral straightness of gyral joints are higher than the rest of gyral crest regions. The proposed representation offers a new tool for a comprehensive and reliable characterization of the cortical folding organization. This novel computational framework will enable large-scale analyses of cortical folding patterns in the future."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques enable in vivo studies of the cortical folding patterns, which attract growing research interest. It has been shown that an understanding of the cortical folding can benefit cytoarchitectonic areal parcellation , normal maturation and neurodegenerative process investigation ( Giedd et al., 1999 ) , and abnormal brain development understanding ( Schaer et al., 2008 ) . As a convoluted surface, the neocortex is usually represented by a reconstructed mesh surface, upon which quantitative analyses are performed. The widely used folding pattern descriptors in the literature can be classified into two groups -global and local descriptors . Global measurements such as surface area , gyrification index ( Zilles et al., 1988 ) , and spherical wavelets quantify the cortical convolution level of the whole brain or preselected regions of interest (ROIs). In contrast, local descriptors, such as surface curvature, estimate the cortical folding pattern vertex-wise in a small area. Some recent works also extend * Corresponding authors.\nE-mail addresses: tliu@cs.uga.edu , tianming.liu@gmail.com (T. Liu).\nthe global descriptors, such as gyrification index to local scales Luders et al., 2006; Toro et al., 2008 ) .\nIn addition to global or local analysis of cortical surfaces, another trend of studies proposed to analyze cortical folding patterns using line representations. In these studies, the skeletons of sulcal fundi and gyral crests were extracted and analyzed. Since sulcal fundi were shown more consistent across individuals ( Lohmann et al., 2008 ) , they attracted more research attention than gyral crests. For instance, different computational methods have been proposed to segment the sulcal fundi and extract skeleton lines ( Kao et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009; Li and Shen, 2011; Lohmann, 1998; Lyu et al., 2010; Seong et al., 2010 ; Yonggang Shi et al., 2009 ) . The shape of the extracted sulcal fundi was then quantitatively modeled ( Caunce and Taylor, 2001; Tao et al., 2001 ) and compared across individuals and populations ( Im et al., 2013; Lohmann et al., 1999 ) . Sulcal fundi were also applied as references to register brains ( Perrot et al., 2011 ) or segment cortical surfaces ( Lohmann and von Cramon, 20 0 0 ) . Moreover, since the deepest sulcal regions (sulcal pits) were considered as the first cortical folds under development and that they were closely related to functional areas ( Lohmann et al., 2008 ) , further analysis on sulcal fundi have been conducted as well ( Auzias et al., 2015; Im et al., 2011 Im et al., , 2010 Meng et al., 2014 ) . In comparison, as the counterpart of sulci fundi, the morphology of gyral crest has not been thoroughly investigated. For instance, one identical feature of the gyral crest is that they form a joint when different gyri meet -namely gyral joint. However, its distribution, folding pattern, functional role, and developmental mechanism are rarely explored so far. Notably, the gyral folding pattern also plays a critical role in studying brain function and anatomy. In previous studies, gyral based regions of interest (ROIs) were shown to be biologically valid and reliable to parcellate cortical surface areas ( Desikan et al., 2006 ) . Gyral features have also been widely applied to quantify brain development ( Gogtay et al., 2004 ) and model brain diseases ( Narr et al., 2004; Nordahl et al., 2007 ) . Further investigations on gyral folding patterns are of fundamental importance to understand brain organization.\nOur previous works attempted to fill this underexplored area from different perspectives. For instance, we proposed a surface feature profiling scheme to quantify gyral folding patterns . A quantitative examination of gyral folding patterns across primate species showed that the gyral complexity successively expressed from macaque brain to human brain ( Chen et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016 ) . We also found different connectivity patterns ( Nie et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014 ) and functional roles ( Deng et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2016 ) between gyri and sulci. In addition, new computational models were proposed to study the mechanisms that regulate gyral development by simulating the process Zhang et al., 2016 ) . However, most of these studies only focused on specific brain ROIs. A whole-brain global representation of gyral morphology is still missing, which motivates this work.\nIn the early work by Lohmann (1998) , a line representation of gyral crests has been proposed and extracted from 3D brain image volumes. Later on, Shi and his colleagues proposed a framework to extract gyral skeleton on the mesh surface and represent gyral crests as a graph ( Shi et al., 2008 ) . In our view, such line and graph representation of gyral crests could be a powerful abstract description of gyral morphology. However, no quantitative analysis of the extracted gyral crest lines and their joints has been conducted so far. Thus, in this work, we proposed to quantify cortical folding organizations by a graph representation -gyral net, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Specifically, we developed a new computational framework that can automatically construct the gyral net. Different from previous works, we devised a set of measures that can quantify the complexity of neocortex gyrification and the local connectivity between gyri. In addition, we differentiated gyral crests by the degree of gyral net and the vertices with degree higher than two were defined as gyral joints (highlighted by yellow arrows in Fig. 1 (c) ). The gyral joints were extracted based on gyral net and their properties were also examined in this work. We will show that representing the cortical folding pattern by gyral net offers a more comprehensive view such that its shape pattern, complexity, connectivity, and convolution level can be measured both locally and globally within a unified framework."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "In this paper, we extract the gyral net from the white matter cortical surface. The first step is data preprocessing and cortical surface reconstruction ( Fig. 2 (a) and (b), Section 2.1 ). Then we segmented the gyral crest area on the cortical surface ( Fig. 2 (c) , Section 2.2 ). After that, the gyral net was constructed by extracting the skeletons of the gyral crests ( Fig. 2 (d) -(g), Section 2.3 ). Finally, different measurements were computed on the gyral net ( Section 2.4 ). The method section is organized following these steps accordingly."}, {"section_title": "Data preprocessing", "text": "Data preprocessing was performed using FMRIB Software Library (FSL) ( Jenkinson et al., 2012 ) and FreeSurfer ( Fischl, 2012 ) . In brief, we firstly resampled the 3D T1w images into 1 mm isotropic images using spline interpolation. Then, skull removal, gray matter (GM)/white matter (WM) tissue segmentation, and WM surface reconstruction were performed. During surface reconstruction, the interface between GM and WM was modeled as a triangle mesh in 3D space ( Fig. 2 (b) ). Once the cortical surface models were complete, the gyral altitude and cortical thickness were calculated for each vertex on the reconstructed surface. Specifically, gyral altitude was defined as the dot product of the movement vector during inflation with the surface normal which can be viewed as the altitude from the current vertex to the \"mid-surface\" that existed between the gyri and sulci ( Fig. 3 (a) ) ( Fischl et al., 1999 ) . Cortical thickness was calculated as the closest distance from the GM/WM boundary to the GM/CSF boundary at each vertex ( Fischl and Dale, 20 0 0 ) . Since the surface reconstruction was performed for left hemisphere and right hemisphere separately and part of the reconstructed surfaces belongs to the cutting plane between two hemispheres, we eliminate this region with zero cortical thickness to exclude it in our analysis ( Fig. 2 (b) )."}, {"section_title": "Gyral crest segmentation", "text": "After reconstructing the cortical surface, the next step is to segment the gyral crests on the cortical surface. Intuitively, all gyral crest areas are high in altitude. However, some gyral crests could be so deep that they fall below the \"mid-surface\" ( Fig. 3 ) . We adopt the watershed algorithm ( Bertrand, 2005 ) to extract all gyral crests. In practice, an initial water level is set and the areas with their gyral altitudes lower than the water level are flooded. Each connected flooded area is defined as a water source ( Fig. 3 (a) ). With the successively increased water level, each water source is growing in size. When different water sources meet, they are either merged or watersheds are built. Merging is only considered when one water source is very shallow -the depth (altitude differences between barrier peak and water source bottom, Fig. 3 (b) ) is smaller than a set threshold. The flooding process stops when the upper bound of water level is reached. The remaining areas above the water level together with the barriers are taken as gyral crests.\nA reasonable water level threshold will help avoid false positives and false negatives in gyral crest segmentation. For instance, \nif the initial water level is set too low, a small convex region in a deep sulcus is also likely to be extracted as a gyral crest. On the other hand, if the final water level is set too high, some gyral crests could be missed. In addition, a reasonable merging criteria can help avoid extracting gyral crests of small concaves, which are false positives. Based on visual inspections, we empirically selected \u22120.7 as the initial water level, 0.7 as the final water level, and 0.3 as depth difference threshold for water source merging criteria."}, {"section_title": "Skeletons of gyral crests and gyral net", "text": "With the gyral net, we aim to represent gyral crests by lines. Ideally, the lines should follow the centers of gyral crests, which can be obtained by extracting the skeletons of gyral crest area. Inspired by the all-path-pruning algorithm ( Xiao and Peng, 2013 ) designed for reconstructing a digital representation of neuron morphology from 2D/3D microscopy image, we proposed a novel computational framework ( Fig. 2 (d) - (g)) to extract the skeletons of the gyral crests on the cortical surface via the following steps."}, {"section_title": "Step 1: distance transform", "text": "The distance transform is firstly performed to highlight the centers of the gyral crests and generate a field with decreasing gradient from crest centers to boundaries. The classic distancetransform algorithm is defined on 2D/3D image and measures the length of the shortest path from each pixel to the border. In our approach, we extend the algorithm to measure mesh surface. The algorithm starts by setting the distance value of none-crest area to 0. Then, we will march from the borders to the centers and calculate distance value for each vertex. Since each vertex may not be connected by the same number of edges, to generate a smooth map, we modified the distance-transform algorithm and use different methods to calculate distance value for border and non-border vertices. For a border vertex, to give more weight to the vertex with more connections to the crest area, its distance is defined as the percentage of gyral crest vertex among its neighbors. For the rest vertices, their distances are calculated by adding 1 to the average distance of previously marched vertices in its neighbors. The algorithm is detailed as following: ( Algorithm 1 )"}, {"section_title": "Step 2: tree marching", "text": "After distance transform, we will connect vertices from crest centers to borders by a tree marching algorithm. At the beginning, a tree root is placed in each regional maximum. From each root, a breadth-first search will be performed to construct a tree. To ensure the newly marched connections will follow the crest skeleton, we control the marching speed by applying a distance threshold such that only the vertices with the distance above the threshold can be connected. By successively decreasing this threshold value to 0, trees grow from crest centers evenly in all directions, following the crest skeletons ( Fig. 4 (a) - (d)). Each crest vertex will be connected and assigned to a specific tree. The whole process can be interpreted as marching a tree structure from gyral crest centers to borders."}, {"section_title": "Step 3: connect trees", "text": "The next step is to connect trees to form a graph. In previous tree marching step, we did not address the scenario when two trees meet. Considering the redundant connections and abnormal short circles in gyral nets, our strategy in handling the meeting trees is to keep a record of those connections and calculate the shortest length between each pair of vertices to connect. Connections are made provided the length is longer than a selected loop threshold. A good loop threshold will help avoid small local loops on the same gyrus, while ensuring that the gyral crests can be connected into a complete net. In practice, we empirically selected 40 steps as the default loop threshold."}, {"section_title": "Step 4: branch pruning", "text": "During the tree marching, we connect all the vertices in crest area and some connections are the redundant branches from the skeleton to the border. The final step is to prune these redundant branches (highlighted by yellow arrows in Fig. 2 (e) and (f)) generated during tree marching. For each tip vertex (vertex with degree 1), if its path length to the nearest branch vertex (vertex with degree larger than 2) is shorter than the selected length threshold, the tip vertex, as well as the vertices along its path to the branch vertex, will be viewed as redundant and thus deleted. The length threshold should be higher than the width of the widest gyrus and smaller than the length of the shortest gyrus. In our implementation, we empirically selected 10 steps as the default length threshold. Such pruning process will be performed iteratively until no more vertex can be pruned ( Fig. 4 (f) and (g)). After pruning, only the edges following the gyral crest skeletons will be left ( Figs. 2 (g) and 4 (h)), which forms the final gyral net."}, {"section_title": "Quantify gyral net", "text": "The extracted gyral net is a graph representation of the cortical gyral pattern.

As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the point where three or more gyral bridges meet is defined as a gyral joint. If we view the gyral net as a graph, the gyral joint will be the hub in this graph. Thus, the number of gyral joints can partially reflect the topology of the gyral net. It has been shown that the number of gyral joints in human brain is 2.5 times more than that in chimpanzee brain and 7.8 times more than that in macaque brain . Based on this observation, it has been hypothesized that the number of gyral joints partially reflects the level of complexity of cortical folding patterns. In practice, we picked all the vertices with degree higher than 2 in gyral net and took those as gyral joints."}, {"section_title": "Gyral crest length", "text": "Intuitively, we can accumulate the total length of the gyral net. This metric quantifies the global size of gyral net. It is impacted by the size of brain volume, curviness of gyral crest, and total surface area, and thus it reflects the complexity of brain gyrification. It also provides a simple and straight forward metric to evaluate the performance of our proposed gyral net extraction frameworkthe extraction is likely to be wrong when the total length is too small or too large. "}, {"section_title": "Gyral net integrity", "text": "In our observation, most gyral crests are continuously connected. Though the biological philosophy behind this phenomenon is still unclear, to quantitatively verify such a phenomenon, we proposed an integrity measurement of the gyral net. Specifically, since the gyral net is defined as vertices connected by edges, the directly or indirectly connected vertices can be grouped together into a connected component. The integrity of a gyral net is defined as the number of vertices in the largest connected component over the total number of vertices. If all the vertices on gyral crest forms a single connected component, the integrity will be 1. This measurement can serve as another global metric to verify the performance of gyral net extraction framework."}, {"section_title": "Local connectivity cost (LCC)", "text": "It has been shown that the surface geodesic distance between two vertices measures the intrinsic connectivity cost between them ( Khan et al., 2013 ) . In the context of gyral crest vertices, the surface geodesic distance not only reflects the spatial cost to make functional connections for intrinsic grey matter connections but also reflects the cost of extrinsic white matter connection. For this reason, the geodesic distance provides a reasonable estimate on the connectivity cost between a neuron at gyral crest with other neurons in its neighborhood. As shown in Fig. 5 , the surface distance between gyral points A and B is the shortest path between them to make connections no matter it is extrinsic white matter connection or intrinsic grey matter connection. While for sulcal points D and E, the travel distance for axons to make extrinsic connections between them is much shorter than the surface distance between them.\nSpecifically, to measure LCC of each vertex v on the gyral net, all the surface vertices within Euclidean distance r E are extracted. Both the surface geodesic distance and the Euclidean distance between v and its surrounding vertices are calculated. Then the averaged ratio between the surface distance and the Euclidean distance is defined as LCC:\nwhere SGD ( v, w ) is the surface geodesic distance between vertices, DIST ( v, w ) is the Euclidean distance between vertices, W is the set of surrounding vertices within radius r E such that W \u2282V and \u2200 w \u2208 W, DIST ( v, w ) < r E . LCC quantifies the distance cost to make both intrinsic and extrinsic connection between a neuron on gyrus and all the other neurons close to it. A higher LCC indicates a higher cost to establish local functional connectivity and vice versa. Notably, LCC is impacted by the selection of r E . In practice, different radiuses should be considered and compared."}, {"section_title": "Gyral crest straightness", "text": "In our previous work, we found that the gyral convolutional patterns in parallel to the cortical surface varied between primate species and could be taken as a complementary metric of brain development . The curvature of gyral crest line was applied to quantify such patterns. However, the curvature is not feasible when gyral crest forks into the gyral joint . Thus in this study, we proposed a new measurement -straightness, to quantify the convolutional patterns of the gyral crest. Given a vertex v on the gyral net, we found the vertex w that has the farthest Euclidean distance to v among the neighbor vertices of v along the gyral net within distance r C . We then compare the Euclidean distance and the geodesic distance along the crest line between them such that:\nwhere CrestD ( v, w ) is the geodesic distance between the vertices along the crest line. w is the farthest vertices to v within v 's neigh- w ) < r C . In this way, straightness can quantify the local folding pattern of gyral crests. When the gyral crest is an exactly straight line, its straightness is 1. And when the gyral crest is curved, its straightness will be relatively small."}, {"section_title": "Algorithm implementation", "text": "The gyral net extraction and quantification algorithms proposed in this paper are implemented in Matlab ( https://www.mathworks. com/ ). The computational complexity for most steps such as gyral crest segmentation, distance transform, skeleton tree marching, and skeleton tree pruning is O(|V|), where |V| is the number of vertices that need to be processed. The most time-consuming step is the calculation of the graph distance between vertices such as the distance between adjacent tree leaves when connecting trees and the surface distance between gyral nodes when computing LCC. The computational complexity is O(|V| 3 ). For a typical subject, the computational time required to extract and process the gyral net of one hemisphere is about 15 minutes. In the future, this can be significantly optimized by improving the distance calculation algorithm, since in our problem we do not necessarily need a precise value when the distance is larger than a threshold."}, {"section_title": "Applications", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Experimental materials", "text": "To test the proposed framework, two different sets of data were used. First, 120 T1-weighted MRI scans acquired from 3 subjects in a test-retest experiment ( Maclaren et al., 2014 ) were applied to evaluate the reproducibility of our proposed method. The data was downloaded from http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.929651 . 40 scans were acquired for each subject in 20 separate days in a month by using a GE MR750 3T scanner. ADNI-recommended T1-weighted imaging protocol were applied and one can refer to Maclaren et al. (2014) for more details.\nWe then analyzed the gyral net in the domain of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). ASDs are a group of neuro-developmental conditions featured by difficulties in social interaction and communication, and repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, or activities ( Miles, 2011 ) . Previous neuroimaging studies have shown abnormalities in both cortical anatomical folding patterns ( Stigler et al., 2011 ) and functional connections ( Khan et al., 2013; Philip et al., 2012 ) in ASDs.\nT1 weighted MR images of ASD subjects and healthy controls (HCs), downloaded from publicly available data portal -Autism Brain Image Data Exchanged I (ABIDE I, http://fcon _ 10 0 0.projects. nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide _ I.html ), are used in this study. Data pre- processing is performed following the previous descriptions. The reconstructed cortical surfaces are then visually inspected by experts and the surfaces with obvious reconstruction errors were eliminated in our analysis. The reconstructed cortical surfaces of 437 subjects (185 ASD subjects) were finally adopted for analysis. These data were collected from 9 different sites and the related meta information was listed in Table 1 . For more information, one can refer to ABIDE website. For both datasets, we extracted and analyzed gyral net for each brain hemisphere by our proposed method. The same parameters were applied for all subjects. Examples of extracted gyral net and gyral joints were shown in Fig. 6 . By visual inspection, our proposed method performed well in extracting a complete gyral net and identifying gyral joints. In our experiments, we first quantitatively evaluated the reproducibility of our proposed method. After that, we examined the properties of gyral net and gyral joints. Then we quantitatively compared the differences between healthy controls and ASD subjects."}, {"section_title": "Reproducibility experiment", "text": "By visually inspecting the results from 120 scans of 3 subjects, the morphology of extracted gyral net were shown relatively consistent for each brain hemisphere of each subject. Some examples were shown in the Supplementary Fig. S1 . However, it should be noted that the quality of extracted gyral nets heavily depends on the quality of reconstructed cortical surfaces. In this experiment, to verify the reproducibility of the whole pipeline, we used the same parameters for cortical surface reconstruction and accepted all the results as-is. As highlighted in Supplementary Fig. S1 , when surface reconstruction varies between different scans of the same subject, the extracted gyral net also varied. Though FreeSurfer performs reasonably well on most cases, it is still critical to verify the surface reconstruction quality with visual inspection before conducting any further analysis.\nTo further quantitatively evaluate the reproducibility of our proposed method, for each cerebral hemisphere of each subject, we compared two global metrics (gyral net length and gyral joint number) of extracted gyral nets obtained from 40 scans. As shown in Fig. 7 , both the length and the gyral joint number vary across individuals. Meanwhile, for the same hemisphere of the same subject, all the measurements followed a normal distribution among 40 scans. For gyral net length, the average standard deviation is 93.25 mm, which is 1.36% of the average gyral net length. And for gyral joint number, the average standard deviation is 5.53, which is 3.19% of the average gyral joint number.

The Pearson correlation between two hemispheres' gyral net length is 0.92. And the Pearson correlation between two hemispheres' gyral joint number is 0.81. Intriguingly, the number of gyral joint is positively correlated with the length of the gyral net ( Fig. 8 (c) ). The Pearson correlation between them is 0.89. Further analyses show that both measurements are linearly correlated with the total size of white matter (WM) surface area ( Fig. 7 (d) and (e) ). The Pearson correlation between gyral crest length and surface area is 0.93 and the Pearson correlation between gyral joint number and surface area is 0.77. By linearly rescaling the length of gyral crest length and gyral joint number of WM surface area, the correlation between those two variables drops to 0.68 ( Fig. 7 (f) ).

Similar to sulcal pits, gyral joints could potentially be taken as landmarks to establish a correspondence between brains and to quantify cortical morphology. To evaluate the properties of gyral joint, we compared the local measurements between gyral joints and the rest part of gyral netnamely, gyral bridges. Notably, the vertices within 10 mm of gyral joint were labeled as the inter zone and excluded from this analysis. The definitions of gyral joint, gyral bridge, and inter zone were illustrated in Fig. 1 . Notably, the inter zone is defined to clearly differentiate gyral joint and gyral bridge for comparison purpose only.\nIn this experiment, we included all the subjects and did not differentiate hemispheres and ASD subjects and healthy controls. Intriguingly, gyral joints are significantly thicker than gyral bridges (paired-sample t -test p-value is 0). On average, the gyral joint is 3.13 \u00b1 0.24 mm in thickness and the gyral bridge is 2.90 \u00b1 0.22 mm in thickness. Moreover, gyral joints are relatively flatter than gyral bridges. The average mean curvature of gyral joints ( \u22120.26 \u00b1 0.01) is significantly closer to 0 than gyral bridge ( \u22120.31 \u00b1 0.01, pairedsample t -test p-value is 0). We then compared LCC and gyral crest straightness between gyral joints and gyral bridges. Notably, these two measurements need to define the radius of the neighborhood before computation. We empirically selected 4 different radius values (5, 10, 15, and 20 mm) to compute and the results were shown in Table 3 . It is interesting that the gyral nets radiated from the gyral joints are straighter than the gyral bridges. Also, the gyral joints have smaller LCC than the gyral bridges.

In this section, we will investigate the differences between local measurements of the gyral crest.

Five brain ROIs were defined and analyzed accordingly including frontal lobe (FL), central gyri (CG), parietal and occipital lobe (POL), temporal lobe (TL), and cingulate cortex (CC).\nIntriguingly, we found that the LCC in ASD subjects' brain is overall lower than healthy controls' brain. And such difference is more significant in the left parietal lobe, left occipital lobe, and left temporal lobe than other brain regions. We showed the results when the radius is 10 mm in Table 4 and more results can be found in Supplementary Table S 1. Such finding is consistent among different radius selections. Moreover, healthy controls' gyral nets were shown to be straighter than ASD patients' ones ( Table 5 ). The higher straightness was also shown to be significant in the temporal lobe with different radius selections (Supplementary Table S 2). These findings coincide with the findings in previous studies that ASD patients' cerebral cortices have increased gyrification than normal controls.\nSince gyral crest straightness only quantified the gyral folding pattern in the tangential direction of the cortical surface, there is a possibility that the abnormal cortical folding pattern exists in the normal direction of the cortical surface. Intuitively, a deeper sulcus could result in higher LCC. Thus, we presumed that there is decreased sulcal depth in ASD patients, which result in decreased LCC. However, no significant difference in the gyral altitude between ASD patients and healthy controls was observed (Supplementary Table S7 ). Since this altitude did not capture the depth information of adjacent sulci, we further analyzed the height of gyrus, which is defined as the altitude difference between a gyral crest vertex and the deepest point in its neighborhood (vertices within 20 mm geodesic distance). Still, no significant difference was observed (Supplementary Table S8) .\nAnother important metric to quantify cortical folding pattern is cortical thickness. The correlation between cortical thickness, brain development, and mental disorders have been widely studied in literature ( Antonio Y. Hardan et al., 2006; Giedd and Rapoport, 2010 ) . To test whether the abnormal cortical folding patterns we observed in ASD patients are correlated with abnormal cortical thickness, we analyzed both the average cortical thickness in the whole ROI and the average cortical thickness of gyral crests only.

In the previous section, we showed that the gyral joint has lower LCC and higher straightness than the gyral bridge. Thus we wonder if the differences in LCC and straightness in ASD patients' brain are related to the different numbers or distributions of gyral joints. However, as shown in Supplementary Table S9 , there is no significant difference on the number of gyral joint. We also studied the distribution of gyral joint by analyzing the percentage of the gyral net that locates within the neighborhood of gyral joint.

By analyzing the gyral nets of 437 subjects from ASD patients and normal subjects, we had two interesting observations in our results. 1) Gyral joints have very different properties than other gyral crest regions. 2) ASD patients' gyral nets have lower local connectivity costs and are more curved than those of healthy controls.\nIntuitively, the lower local connectivity cost in the gyral joint area is largely due to the special cortical geometry in its surroundings. As illustrated in Fig. 5 , when points B and C on the gyral crest are connected via a gyral bridge, the travel distance required to make connections between them is relatively low (green lines) indicating a low local connectivity cost. Simultaneously, gyral joints will be formed at point B and C. On the other hand, if we removed the gyrus between them as illustrated by red dash lines, the travel distance of the axons between B and C will significantly increase (red line) resulting in a high local connectivity cost. One interesting hypothesis behind this observation is that, with a relatively low local connectivity cost, will the functional role of gyral joints differentiate from other brain regions? Further analysis on functional imaging could answer this question.\nThe higher thickness and straightness in the gyral joints we observed is quite intriguing. In the previous studies, researchers have reported the difference in cortical thickness between gyral and sulcal areas ( Fischl and Dale, 20 0 0; Li et al., 2015 ) . However, the difference in thickness between gyral joint and other gyral crest regions have been rarely investigated. This observation could offer new insight into the developmental mechanism of the cortical surface that regulates the emerging of cortical folds. In previous studies, different hypotheses of the physical mechanism that regulates the cortical landscape have been proposed, including differential cortical expansion ( Bayly et al., 2014; Rash et al., 2013; Ronan et al., 2013 ) and neuron wiring ( Nie et al., 2012; Van Essen, 1997; Xu et al., 2010 ) . Based on the thicker cortex in gyral joints, we hypothesize that the gyral joint could be the earliest emerging area of a gyrus and there could be more axonal fibers concentrating on gyral joints than other gyral crest regions. Meanwhile, the higher straightness in gyral joints could be due to the relatively stable triangle shape in its neighborhood. However, to fully understand the mechanism behind these observations, further investigations on brain developmental data and mechanical simulations are needed.\nOur findings on ASD patients' brains are consistent with the previous findings that ASD patients' brains have increased gyrification ( Hardan et al., 2004; Nordahl et al., 2007; Stigler et al., 2011; Wallace et al., 2013 ) . Similar to the recent findings by Wallace and his colleagues ( Wallace et al., 2013 ) , we found increased gyral convolution in the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe, although the overall size of the gyral net remains the same between ASD patients and healthy controls. Instead of focusing on the cortical convolution patterns in the radial direction of the cortex (e.g., sulcal depth), our proposed straightness metric mainly quantifies the convolution patterns in the tangential direction of the cortex.\nIn the future works, more analyses on the gyral nets and gyral joints using different image modalities and longitudinal data are needed to fully understand their functional roles, connectivity properties, and development mechanisms. The proposed gyral net representation can be further adopted to study neurodevelopmental processes and other brain diseases. Based on the extracted gyral nets, an automatic searching framework will be developed to identify novel cortical landmarks such as the consistent gyral joints introduced in . In addition, the state of art graph matching and deep learning algorithms ( Li et al., 2017 ) can be developed to align gyral nets for group-wise analysis in the future."}]
