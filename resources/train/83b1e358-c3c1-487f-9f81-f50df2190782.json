[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: This study sought to evaluate gender and APOE genotype-related differences in the concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular injury across the life span of cognitively normal adults. Methods: CSF amyloid beta 1-42 (A\u03b2 42 ), phospho-tau-181 (p-tau 181 ), and total tau were measured in 331 participants who were between the ages of 21 and 100. CSF E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1) were measured in 249 participants who were between the ages of 50 and 100. Results: CSF total tau and p-tau 181 increased with age over the adult life span (p < 0.01) with no gender differences in those increases. CSF A\u03b2 42 concentration varied according to age, gender, and APOE genotype (interaction of age \u00d7 gender \u00d7 \u03b54, p = 0.047). CSF VCAM1, but not E-selectin, increased with age (p < 0.01), but both were elevated in men compared to women (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Female APOE-\u03b54 carriers appear at higher risk for AD after age 50. In contrast, men may experience a relatively higher rate of cerebrovascular injury in middle and early old age."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The reasons for gender differences in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementias remain unclear. Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of AD increases steeply with age in both men and women, but the rate of increase diverges between genders in later ages: after age 90, the incidence levels off in men, but it continues to increase in women [1] [2] [3] . One possibility is that men have higher mortality rates from cardiovascular disease than women. Indeed, the selective survival of men with a healthier cardiovascular risk profile and lower propensity to dementia may partly explain the relatively higher risk for dementia and AD that is observed in women versus men in older ages [4] .\nAnother potential mechanism for the increased incidence of AD in women over the age of 80 is the loss, after menopause, of the neuroprotective effect of estrogens [5, 6] . The challenge in understanding the potential role of estrogen in AD is the long lag time between the drastic hormonal changes and clinical manifestations of AD. The critical period of hormonal changes in women is around age 50, which is 20-30 years prior to the clinical manifestation of dementia. Recent studies have shown that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegenerative processes in AD (e.g., concentrations of amyloid beta (A\u03b2 42 ) , total tau, phospho-tau-181 (p-tau 181 ), and the tau/A\u03b2 42 ratio) may reflect underlying AD pathophysiology long before changes in memory and cognition are clinically detectable [7, 8] . Decreases in the concentration of CSF A\u03b2 42 (which correspond to increased deposition of amyloid in the brain [9] ), increased p-tau 181 , and increased total tau occur up to 25 years prior to clinical expression [10] . Recently, we have shown that CSF E-selectin is a candidate biomarker for cerebrovascular injury [11] . E-selectin is an adhesion molecule produced by endothelial cells [12] , usually after vascular injury, and is induced by cytokines [13, 14] . When released, E-selectin recruits leukocytes to sites of inflammation or injury [12] , thereby contributing to cerebrovascular disease [13, 14] . Using these kinds of biomarkers as markers for preclinical AD or cerebrovascular injury, we may be able to bring our understanding and recognition of pathological processes closer to the time in life at which hormonal changes occur. In addition, each specific biomarker enables us to identify specific pathological processes of AD and other conditions, such as cerebrovascular disease. These pathological processes are commonly comorbid in older persons, affect cognitive function in different ways, and are difficult to tease apart clinically.\nIn the present study, we examined age-related gender differences in CSF biomarkers for AD (A\u03b2 42 , p-tau 181 , and total tau) and vascular injury (E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1)) across the life span of cognitively normal adults. We also examined how these differences varied by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. The findings from this study are important in elucidating various biological pathways that may play a role in the development of dementia and that may thereby inform the design of targeted prevention strategies."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Two cohorts of study participants were initially recruited for this study, one cohort for a biomarker study of AD and one cohort for a vascular biomarker study. The collection and analysis of CSF AD biomarkers and clinical data in the first cohort were approved by the University of Washington (UW) institutional review board (IRB; under approval numbers 01-8926-V and 01173). This cohort included 331 participants who ranged in age from 21 to 100 and who were enrolled at the UW Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) and five collaborating centers, including the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), Indiana University, University of Pennsylvania, and University of California at Davis. The collection and analysis of novel vascular biomarkers in the CSF of the second cohort occurred at three of these same institutions under the approval of their respective IRBs (UW 01-8926-V and 01173, UCSD 080012, and OHSU 6845). This cohort included 249 participants who ranged in age from 50 to 100. There was an overlap of 126 participants between the two cohorts, but these overlapping participants were all age \u2265 50.

The CSF samples were analyzed for A\u03b2 42 , ptau 181 , and total tau using multiplex reagents (Luminex; InnoGenetics) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously [17] . CSF E-selectin and VCAM1 were measured using the Human Premixed Multi-Analyte Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) [18] . Assays were performed following the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications (http:// www.rndsystems.com/pdf/LXSAH.pdf ) using a LiquiChip Luminex 200\u2122 Workstation (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).

For these analyses, the CSF biomarker of interest was the dependent variable, and age, gender, and APOE genotype (i.e., presence versus absence of the APOE-\u03b54 allele) were the independent covariates; age was modeled as a three-degree restricted cubic spline to allow for nonlinear associations between age and CSF biomarker, with knots placed at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles (corresponding to ages 24, 60, and 81 for the CSF AD biomarker cohort and ages 55, 70, and 85 for the CSF vascular biomarker cohort) [20] . The role of gender as an effect modifier in the association between CSF biomarkers and age was tested by adding an age \u00d7 gender interaction term to the regression model. The additional role of the APOE genotype as an effect modifier in the association between CSF biomarkers, age, and gender was tested by adding a three-way age \u00d7 gender \u00d7 APOE genotype interaction term. Hypothesis testing relating to Eselectin was carried out using log E-selectin to satisfy the homogeneity of variance assumption, and the results were back-transformed to the original units, except where noted.\nIn instances where gender significantly affected the age-CSF biomarker association, nonparametric bootstrap methods were used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean difference in CSF biomarker concentration by gender across the age span. We selected the bootstrap approach for its ease in estimating CIs from complex models. This bootstrapping method generated 5000 datasets, and on each dataset the regression model for the CSF biomarker of interest was used to estimate a set of agedependent mean differences in CSF biomarker by gender. The adjusted percentile method was then used in these 5000 sets of differences to calculate 95% CIs for the mean difference in biomarker by gender across the age span [21] . Linear regression was also used to determine the association between CSF vascular biomarkers (the dependent variables) and vascular risk factors (body mass index (BMI), history of diabetes mellitus, and hypertension or coronary artery disease), adjusting for age and gender. BMI and age were both modeled as three-degree restricted cubic splines as stated earlier. The association between CSF E-selectin and CSF VCAM1 was assessed using linear regression with CSF VCAM1 as the dependent variable and CSF E-selectin as the independent variable. Effect modification due to age or gender was assessed by testing the significance of the Eselectin by age or gender interaction term. R 2.15.2 [22] and the Hmisc and rms packages [23] were used to carry out the regression models, and the boot package [24] was used to perform the bootstraps.

Furthermore, there was no evidence that the increase in total tau or p-tau 181 across age differed by gender (age \u00d7 gender interaction, p \u2265 0.43) or that differences in age-adjusted total tau or p-tau 181 by gender were further modified by APOE genotype (age \u00d7 gender \u00d7 APOE genotype interaction, p \u2265 0.16; Table 2 ). In contrast to the age-CSF tau relationships, there was a lack of overall association between CSF A\u03b2 42 and age or between CSF A\u03b2 42 and gender (Table 2, Fig. 2a) . The association between CSF A\u03b2 42 and age was complex due to the effect modification by gender and APOE genotype (age \u00d7 gender \u00d7 APOE genotype interaction, p = 0.047) and the presence of nonlinear trends in CSF A\u03b2 42 across the age span (Fig. 2 , Additional file 1: Table S2 ). Specifically, the age-related and gender-related differences in CSF A\u03b2 42 were dependent on APOE genotype. In the \u03b54 noncarriers, average CSF A\u03b2 42 increased monotonically across participant age for females, whereas CSF A\u03b2 42 increased up to midlife and then leveled off for males (Fig. 2b) .

In contrast, CSF A\u03b2 42 concentration varied according to age, gender, and APOE genotype.\nThe nonlinear relationship between age and CSF A\u03b2 42 is likely because our sample includes both participants who are experiencing normal aging as well as participants over the age of 50 who may have preclinical AD. Although the process of brain amyloid metabolism is not entirely clear in normal aging, during the early stages of AD brain A\u03b2 42 starts to aggregate, causing a \"sink\" effect characterized by a decrease in A\u03b2 42 concentration in the CSF [9, 25] . Likewise, we reported previously that CSF A\u03b2 42 decreases with age in cognitively normal adults across the life span (ages 21-88), with reductions in CSF A\u03b2 42 becoming apparent at earlier ages for APOE-\u03b54 carriers than \u03b54 noncarriers [26] . This is consistent with the report of low CSF A\u03b2 42 and continuous decline in middle-aged APOE-\u03b54 carriers [27] , as well as the well-established link between APOE \u03b54 and an increased risk of \u03b2-amyloidosis [9, 28, 29] .\nThe present study extends these findings by demonstrating more complex three-way interactions of age \u00d7 gender \u00d7 APOE genotype and different patterns of age-related change of CSF A\u03b2 42 in female versus male carriers of APOE \u03b54. Male APOE-\u03b54 carriers exhibited modest average decline in CSF A\u03b2 42 concentrations across participant age, whereas female APOE-\u03b54 carriers exhibited a steeper average decline in CSF A\u03b2 42 concentration with increasing participant age starting around age 50, coincident with the onset of menopause. Whether female APOE-\u03b54 carriers become more vulnerable to AD after the onset of menopause should be investigated further. By contrast, in female APOE-\u03b54 noncarriers, CSF A\u03b2 42 levels did not drop around age 50 and, instead, steadily increased over the life span. It is plausible that brain amyloidosis increases with aging; although no studies have investigated this in humans, a recent study of brain A\u03b2 42 in rhesus monkeys demonstrates that A\u03b2 42 increases with aging in both brain and CSF [30] . It is also possible that the observed age-related changes are partly due to age-related alterations in the clearance of A\u03b2 42 in brain or age-related changes in CSF flow. Because our current study uses a cross-sectional design, future studies that employ a longitudinal design will be necessary to clarify the nature of age-related A\u03b2 42 metabolism in the brain.\nGender differences in the brain aging and disease processes of AD are not well understood, and the existing literature in this area is inconsistent [8, 28, 31, 32] . Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, Altman et al. [32] reported that average levels of CSF total tau and tau/A\u03b2 42 ratio in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were higher in female APOE-\u03b54 carriers than male APOE-\u03b54 carriers; but in cognitively normal controls, they found no gender difference in either CSF A\u03b2 42 or total-tau concentration, regardless of APOE genotype. Consistent with the findings in the normal controls, a later analysis of the ADNI dataset showed no modifying effects of APOE \u00d7 gender on CSF biomarkers, but this analysis reports a significant interactive effect of APOE \u03b54 \u00d7 gender on brain metabolism and structure, in that female APOE-\u03b54 carriers had greater hypometabolism and atrophy than female \u03b54 noncarriers or male \u03b54 carriers [33] . However, a study by Jack et al. [28] of neuroimaging biomarkers in cognitively normal controls who were over the age of 60 showed that men had poorer memory and smaller hippocampal volume than women; they also found that memory and hippocampal volume decline began at earlier ages than brain A\u03b2 deposition. The authors speculated that this earlier decline in hippocampal volume may be due to cerebrovascular disease and age-related tauopathy. Our findings of a higher mean CSF concentration of vascular biomarkers in men compared to women, especially in E-selectin from age 50 to 70, but no gender differences in total tau or p-tau 181 suggest that the reduction in hippocampal volume observed in the Jack et al. study may be the result of cerebrovascular disease rather than age-related tauopathy. This is consistent with the expectation that men are at higher risk for cerebrovascular disease than women, especially in middle age and early old age [4] .\nThere is increasing evidence that small-vessel brain disease, especially when characterized by microinfarcts, plays an important role in the cognitive health of older persons [34, 35] , particularly older persons with hypertension and diabetes mellitus [36, 37] . Serum E-selectin, an endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule, plays an important role in inflammation. It is elevated in metabolic syndrome [14, 38] , in overweight women with additional cardiovascular risk factors [38] , in persons with diabetes mellitus who have silent cerebral ischemic infarcts [14] , and in diabetes mellitus patients in whom these cerebral ischemic lesions have progressed further [13] . Serum E-selectin is also linked to cerebral microbleeds [39] . In our earlier study, CSF Eselectin was found to be highly correlated with BMI and diabetes mellitus in persons with a diagnosis of AD; it was also elevated in clinically diagnosed AD patients who had no AD CSF biomarker signature [11] . In the present study, the correlation between CSF E-selectin and BMI, as well as the elevation in concentration of CSF VCAM1 in cognitively normal participants with diabetes mellitus, suggests that CSF E-selectin and VCAM1 may be biomarkers for cerebrovascular injuries in the brain. CSF E-selectin and the VCAM1 concentration in CSF were correlated modestly, but their relationship to age and gender were somewhat different. That is, VCAM1 increased with participant age in both genders, although males had higher mean VCAM1 levels than females across the age span of 50-100 years. In contrast, E-selectin did not increase with participant age, but males did have higher mean E-selectin levels than females aged between 50 and 70 years. Neuroimaging and/or autopsy studies are necessary to determine whether these two potential vascular biomarkers indicate different pathological processes in the development of cerebrovascular disease. Further studies are also necessary to determine whether elevated CSF E-selectin and VCAM1 are associated with functional impairments, especially to determine whether higher levels of E-selectin in men may explain their poor cognitive performance as observed in studies by Jack et al. [28] and our earlier study [15] . Such studies would also help to explain recent observations of weaker associations between cognitive function or hippocampal volume and CSF AD biomarkers of A\u03b2 42 and tau in men than in women [40] , because cognitive impairments in men may be due in part to vascular damage that has been underestimated.\nOur study has a few limitations that may affect the interpretation of the results. First, because this is a crosssectional study, our observations of age-related change are based on adults of different ages examined at a single time point rather than over time. The lower average concentration in the women with APOE \u03b54 after age 50 may reflect a high proportion of preclinical AD cases with lower CSF A\u03b2 42 concentration rather than the age-related decline. The age-related longitudinal changes in CSF concentration of A\u03b2 42 , total tau, and p-tau 181 in individual male and female adults may differ from those exhibited by a sample of adults of different ages who were measured cross-sectionally. Although a longitudinal study of these changes would be optimal, a study that spans 80 years, from age 20 to age 100, is not feasible. Second, the differences in CSF A\u03b2 42 change across age by gender and APOE genotype were accompanied by relatively large variability due to the stratification of our sample into gender and APOE genotype subgroups. Confirmation of these findings in a larger sample should be carried out. Finally, we were unable to measure both AD and vascular biomarkers in the same cohort, and the cohort for our vascular biomarker study included only middleaged and older participants. Because the effects of gender and APOE genotype on each biomarker are age dependent, a study that includes younger participants may yield different findings from the age and gender differences in Eselectin and VCAM1 observed in the current study. Thus, further study is needed of these biomarkers across the entire adult age span. Despite these limitations, this is one of the first studies of cognitively normal adults to demonstrate age-related gender differences in both CSF AD and vascular biomarkers across a large age span with an interactive effect of APOE genotype."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The AD pathophysiologic process over the adult life span is complex, and brain \u03b2-amyloidosis is dependent on age, gender, and APOE genotype.
