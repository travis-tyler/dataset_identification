In addition, numerous reports describing COVID-19 in children are becoming available, but little is known about the clinical presentation and outcomes in children in South Asia. The evidence gap is even wider in case of neonates (<29 days old).\nAlthough some studies suggest that children may be less vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections than adults, with the exception of pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, 2 this evidence is equivocal and evolving as non-pharmaceutical interventions change (eg, school closures). 3 There is a lack of evidence relating to neonates specifically. The first case of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections was identified on February 2, 2020 in China. 4 Since then, approximately 70 cases have been described, and symptoms ranged from mild to severe, and no deaths have been reported thus far. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] However, little is known about infection amongst neonates in South Asia, which already shares a disproportionately high burden of global neonatal morbidity and mortality. 10, 11 By August 31, 2020, there had been over 43 million infections and 77,000 deaths in South Asia, but only 2 sporadic reports on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on neonates in this region had been published. 6, 12 In this study, we report a series of 26 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in neonates who presented at Dhaka Shishu Hospital (DSH), the largest pediatric tertiary care, referral hospital in Bangladesh.

We screened 83 babies admitted at a tertiary care pediatric hospital, and 26 (31%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. We recorded a wide spectrum of presenting signs and symptoms. These included fever, respiratory distress, gastrointestinal symptoms and a range of noncommunicable morbidities like perinatal asphyxia and HIE that are commonly reported as neonatal causes of hospitalization and deaths in this region. Three of the 5 chest radiographs available showed changes consistent with pneumonia. Previous publications on neonatal COVID-19 cases have identified fever, respiratory distress and ground-glass opacity in chest radiographs as the most common symptoms in neonates; 7,22 presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms have also been noted. 5 Of the 8 babies who died, 6 had serious co-morbiditiesruptured myelomeningocele, perinatal asphyxia and HIE stage 2 and congenital pneumonia, anorectal malformation, posterior urethral valve with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, and congenital heart disease. These morbidities have been associated with high mortality in LMICs, 11 and therefore it is difficult to determine the role of SARS-CoV-2 in death. However, it is clear that in both children and adults, severity of and mortality due to COVID-19 are amplified in patients with specific preexisting morbidities. 23, 24 This might also be the case in neonates, where SARS-CoV-2 infection might aggravate the health of already vulnerable children.\nIn 2 patients who died, Ne08 and Ne09, SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely the key contributor. Ne09 was admitted with EONS and developed severe metabolic acidosis; chest radiograph showed bilateral ground-glass opacity. Both the bilateral ground-glass opacity and metabolic acidosis have been reported in severe COVID-19 patients. [25] [26] [27] Ne08 presented with respiratory distress and was diagnosed with EONS with disseminated intravascular coagulation, which has been reported in severe COVID-19 patients. 28 Both the babies died before they reached the ninth day of life. These 2 cases provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infections may lead to systemic disease with adverse outcomes in neonates.\nIn addition to the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 on neonates, this snapshot of vulnerable neonates born in LMICs in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and the loss of care or attention, depict the indirect impacts this virus can have on neonatal health. For example, the family of baby Ne10 is still waiting for a surgery, and baby Ne01 died at the age of only 38 days when the family was still waiting for a surgery. Such surgeries are routinely performed at DSH but due to the pandemic (and sometimes due to infections of health care providers themselves), cases had to be referred to general COVID-19 designated hospitals. Such delays in medical treatment are likely to have serious outcomes in the near future.\nTo confirm the positive results seen in the RT-qPCR assays, SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from 9 cases with high viral loads. Considering that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes belonged to different clades, and tests were conducted within 72 hours of admission in 19 (73%) cases, the virus was likely acquired before presentation at DSH, either in the household or at the hospital of birth. To further investigate potential sources of infections, we tested samples from 9 caregivers, 8 of whom tested positive. Of all 20 families interviewed, 6 mothers reported experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19 in the days before child delivery. While it was out of the scope of this study to further examine vertical or horizontal transmission from mother, this does suggest that neonatal infections are likely to increase if SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in the population, and preventative policies need to be designed and instituted immediately to protect children from acquiring the infection in this critical period of their development.\nThe findings of this study should be considered within the context of several limitations. First, DSH does not have a maternity facility and hence neonates were only admitted here if they had serious conditions, biasing our findings towards the most severe outcomes. Our surveillance did not include asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates and their outcomes. Second, as also alluded to above, most of the babies that tested positive were referred to government-designated COVID-19 hospitals and this transfer led to a gap in their treatment that could have negatively impacted their outcome (4 babies died after leaving DSH). Third, due to reduced hospital capacity because of COVID-19, chest radiographs were only performed on 5 cases, and limited laboratory tests were conducted, inhibiting more nuanced understanding of the inflammatory state of the neonates. Finally, the study only followed up patients for 27-75 days after testing positive. It has been reported that children with exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can have serious long-term effects like multisystem inflammatory response months after the infection. 2 Despite these limitations, this study has important lessons for the design of future studies looking at SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, specifically neonates. First, except for 2 cases that had typical COVID-19 symptoms, neonates presented with one or more comorbidities often seen in South Asia and other LMICs. Future studies should take this into consideration when designing their inclusion criteria to capture SARS-CoV-2 infections in this age group. The effects of COVID-19 may manifest or become apparent after other presenting comorbidities have been addressed. Second, half of SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified within the first 5 days of life indicating that patients should be screened very early to capture SARS-CoV-2 infections. Finally, while it is difficult to assign SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of death due to multiple comorbidities present in these cases, including several serious noninfectious clinical features, our study provides evidence that neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infections can be adversely affected, whether directly by the virus, or indirectly due to lack of optimal care as a result of a positive test. We recommend that policymakers take this into account and provide specific attention to neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infections when designing treatment policies for COVID-19 treatment."}]
