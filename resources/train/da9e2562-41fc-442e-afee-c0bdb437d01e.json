Since 1989, the U.S. Bureau of the Census has conducted the biennial Private School Universe Survey (PSS) for NCES. PSS is designed to generate biennial data on the total number of private schools, students, and teachers, and to build a universe of private schools to serve as a sampling frame of private schools for NCES sample surveys. For more information about the methodology and design of the PSS, please see the Technical Notes in appendix B of this report. The target population for the PSS is all schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia that are not supported primarily by public funds, provide classroom instruction for one or more of grades kindergarten through 12 (or comparable ungraded levels), and have one or more teachers. Organizations or institutions that provide support for home schooling, but do not provide classroom instruction, are not included. The 2017-18 PSS data were collected between October 2017 and August 2018. All data are for the 2017-18 school year except the high school graduate data, which are for the 2016-17 school year. Because the purpose of this report is to introduce new NCES survey data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information, only selected findings are listed below. These findings are purely descriptive in nature and are not meant to imply causality. These findings have been chosen to demonstrate the range of information available from the 2017-18 PSS rather than to discuss all of the observed differences, emphasize any particular issue, or make comparisons over time. The tables in this report contain counts and percentages demonstrating bivariate relationships. All of the results have been weighted to reflect the sample design and to account for nonresponse and other adjustments. Comparisons drawn in the selected findings have been tested for statistical significance at the .05 level using Student's t statistics to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS 9.2) and SUDAAN (10.0) were used to compute the statistics for this report."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": "\u2022 In the fall of 2017, there were 32,461 private elementary and secondary schools with 4,898,154 students and 482,325 full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers in the United States (table 1). \u2022 Sixty-six percent of private schools, enrolling 78 percent of private school students and employing 70 percent of private school FTE teachers in 2017-18, had a religious orientation or purpose (table 2). \u2022 Sixty-eight percent of private schools in 2017-18 emphasized a regular elementary/ secondary program, 9 percent emphasized a Montessori program, 3 percent had a special program emphasis, 6 percent emphasized a special education program, less than 1 percent emphasized a vocational/technical program, 7 percent emphasized an alternative program, and 6 percent emphasized an early childhood program (tables 1 and 3). \u2022 In 2017-18 there were 12,152 private schools in suburban locations, followed by those in cities (10,531), rural areas (7,024), and towns (2,754) (tables 1 and 4). \u2022 The largest number of private school students in 2017-18 were enrolled in schools located in cities (2,153,089), followed by those in suburban schools (1,906,478), rural areas (526,631), and then by those in towns (311,956) (tables 1 and 5). \u2022 More private school students in 2017-18 were enrolled in kindergarten (456,876) than in any other grade level (table 6). \u2022 The average school size in 2017-18 was 151 students across all private schools.

In order to provide coverage of private schools founded since 2015 and to improve coverage of private schools existing in 2017, NCES received and processed membership lists from 29 private school associations and religious denominations. The departments of education from 50 states and the District of Columbia provided lists of private schools. Additional private schools that contacted NCES to be included in the PSS were added as list frame cases. Schools on private school association membership lists and the state lists were compared to the base list, and any school that did not match a school on the base list was added to the universe list.

The area frame consists of a sample of these 2,062 PSUs. A total of 124 distinct PSUs (160 counties) were in the 2017-18 PSS area frame sample. Within each of these PSUs, the Census Bureau attempted to find all eligible private schools. A block-byblock listing of all private schools in a sample of PSUs was not attempted. Rather, National Processing Center staff created the frame by using such sources as online yellow pages (yp.com), local Catholic dioceses, local education agencies, and local government offices. The Census Bureau also obtained a list of eligible private schools for area frame sample PSUs from the InfoUSA database. 1 Once the area search lists were constructed, they were matched with the NCES private school universe list.

In order to reduce respondent burden during data collection, the PSS items were embedded in the NTPS private school questionnaire and the private schools selected for NTPS received a NTPS questionnaire only. After the NTPS data collection, PSS records were created for the private schools responding to NTPS from the NTPS data and were merged into the PSS. For the non-NTPS cases the List Frame followed two data collection tracks: non-Amish and non-Mennonite schools that were offered an internet response option and schools that do not use internet or telephones (primarily Amish and Mennonite schools) that never receive any reference to an internet response option. The 2017-18 PSS data collection began on October 2, 2017, with the internet instrument deployment, and the mailout of a letter to non-Amish and non-Mennonite schools describing how to respond to the 2017-18 PSS online with a User ID and password. For Amish and Mennonite schools, this first mailing included information about the PSS and their first paper questionnaire with a return envelope, there was no internet insert letter. On October 16 th , the second mail out occurred. Here, non-Amish and non-Mennonite schools received a paper questionnaire and Amish and Mennonite schools received their second paper questionnaire. Reminder postcards were mailed out to nonresponding Amish and Mennonite schools on October 30, 2017, and to nonresponding non-Amish and non-Mennonite schools on November 13, 2017. Because Amish and Mennonite schools do not often possess telephones, a field nonresponse follow-up effort targeting these schools ran from January 8 to February 23, 2018. Follow-up of nonresponding non-Amish and non-Mennonite schools was conducted first by computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) February 5 to March 16, 2018. Both nonresponding list frame and nonresponding area frame cases were included in this CATI operation. Finally, from April 9 through May 23, 2018, a field nonresponse follow-up operation was conducted for cases that did not respond during the CATI operation, targeting all list frame and area frame nonresponse cases. The online option was kept open throughout data collection. Data collection for the 2017-18 PSS ended on August 17, 2018.

Comparisons between the frame and respondent populations were made before and after the nonresponse weighting adjustments were applied in order to evaluate first the amount of bias measured, and second the extent to which the adjustments reduced or eliminated nonresponse bias. The following section explains the methodology and summarizes the conclusions. As outlined in appendix B of the NCES Statistical Standards, the degree of nonresponse bias is a function of two factors: the nonresponse rate and how much the respondents and nonrespondents differ on survey variables of interest. The mathematical formulation to estimate bias for a sample mean of variable y is as follows: where = the estimated mean based on all eligible sample cases = the estimated mean based only on respondent cases = the estimated mean based only on nonrespondent cases = the estimated number of cases (i.e., ) = the estimated number of nonrespondents = the estimated number of respondents A variable-free estimate of the bias, referred to as a relative bias, was used to compare biases across all variables included in the analysis. The relative bias for an estimated mean using only the respondent data, , is calculated using the following formula: Relative bias was estimated for variables known for respondents and nonrespondents. There is a very limited amount of information available about nonresponding private schools. The following steps were followed to compute the relative bias. First, the nonresponse bias was estimated and tested to determine if the bias is significant at the 5 percent level. Second, nonresponse adjustments were applied. The nonresponse adjustments, which are included in the weights, were designed to significantly reduce or eliminate unit nonresponse bias for variables included in the models. Third, after the weights were computed, any remaining bias was estimated for the variables listed above and statistical tests were performed to check the remaining significant nonresponse bias. For this comparison, nonresponse bias was calculated as the difference between the base-weighted sample proportion and the nonresponse-adjusted respondent proportion, which evaluates the effectiveness of each nonresponse adjustment in mitigating nonresponse bias. Schools found to be ineligible for the PSS were excluded from the analysis. As shown in table B-2, the weighting adjustments eliminated some significant bias. For all respondents, approximately 78 percent of the variable categories were significantly biased before nonresponse weighting adjustments, and approximately 34 percent were significantly biased after adjustments. The average bias was reduced by 58 percent, from 12 percent to 5 percent.

In addition to filling items where values were missing, some inconsistencies between items were corrected by ratio adjustment. For records where the number of students in item 6 (students by race) did not equal the enrollment in item 5, excluding prekindergarten, the item 6 entries were adjusted to be consistent with item 5 (i.e., each entry in item 6 was multiplied by the ratio of the student count in item 6 to the enrollment in item 5, excluding prekindergarten)."}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "The survey data from the area-frame component were weighted to reflect the sampling rates (probability of selection) of the PSUs.

The imputation process used a hot-deck imputation methodology by extracting data from the record for a school (donor) similar to the nonrespondent. Variables that describe certain characteristics of the schools (e.g., religious affiliation, size, instructional level) were created and used to sort the records and to match incomplete records to those with complete data. Items 12b (whether or not the school was located in a private home that was used primarily as a family residence) and 14 (school association membership) did not go through the donor imputation program. If, after the logic edit, the item was still incomplete, the assumption was made for item 12b that the school was not in a private home, and for item 14 that the school did not belong to any associations. Items 13a and 13c (religious orientation and affiliation) did not go through the donor imputation program. Rather, if values were still missing after the logic edit, the records were reviewed and imputed by an analyst."}, {"section_title": "Item Response", "text": "The weighted item response rates for the variables used in this report are all greater than 89 percent. Values were imputed to items with missing data to compensate for item nonresponse."}, {"section_title": "Analyst Imputation", "text": "For a few items, there were cases where entries were imputed by analysts during data review. The data record, sample file record, and the questionnaire were reviewed and an entry consistent with the information from those sources was imputed. This procedure was used when (1) there was no suitable donor found, (2) the computer method produced an imputed entry that was unacceptable, and (3) the nature of the item required an actual review of the data rather than a computer-generated value. All imputed values are marked with an imputation flag on the data files."}, {"section_title": "Sampling Error", "text": "The standard error indicates how much variability there is in the population of possible estimates of a parameter for a given sample size. Standard errors are used as a measure of the precision expected from a particular sample. If all possible samples were surveyed under similar conditions, intervals of 1.96 standard errors below to 1.96 standard errors above a particular B-8 statistic would include the true population parameter being estimated in about 95 percent of the samples. This is a 95 percent confidence interval. Estimates of standard errors were computed using a technique known as half-sample replication. As with any replication method, half-sample replication involves constructing a number of subsamples (replicates) from the full sample and computing the statistic of interest for each replicate. The mean squared error of the replicate estimates around the full sample provides an estimate of the variance of the statistic (Wolter 1985). A computer program (SUDAAN), developed by Research Triangle Institute, was used to calculate the estimates of standard errors. For PSS, only the area frame contributes to the standard error. Since all list-frame cases are included in the PSS, the list frame component of the standard error is always zero (0). Standard errors for statistics in each table are presented in corresponding tables in appendix C."}, {"section_title": "Tests of Significance", "text": "The tests of significance used in this analysis are based on Student's t statistics. The t statistic between estimates from various independent subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula: where x1 and x2 are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the means of two groups) and SE1 and SE2 are their corresponding standard errors. As the number of comparisons that are conducted at the same significance increases, it becomes more likely that at least one of the estimated differences becomes significant merely by chance, that is, will be erroneously identified as significantly different from zero. Even when there is no statistical difference between the estimates or percentages being compared, there is a 5 percent chance of getting a significant t value of 1.96 from sampling error alone. As the number of comparisons increases, the incidence of this type of error also increases."}, {"section_title": "Nonsampling Error", "text": "Survey estimates are also subject to errors of reporting and errors made in the collection of the data. These errors, called nonsampling errors, can sometimes bias the data. Nonsampling errors may include such things as differences in the respondents' interpretation of the meaning of the questions, differences related to the particular time the survey was conducted, or errors in data preparation. While sampling theory can be used to estimate the sampling variability of an estimate, nonsampling errors usually require either an experiment conducted as part of the data collection procedure or use of data external to the study. Undercoverage in the list and area frames is another possible source of nonsampling error. To reduce the possible bias caused by undercoverage in the list frame, the area frame was used to complement the list frame through the identification of schools missing from the list frame."}, {"section_title": "Publication Criteria for PSS Estimates", "text": "NCES criteria for the publication of an estimate are based on two category types: (1) surveys based on a sample from the frame or (2) surveys based on the entire frame (universe surveys). To publish an estimate for a sample survey, at least 30 cases must be used in developing the estimate; for a universe survey, at least three cases must be used in developing the estimate. PSS has pieces of both categories: (1) an area-frame sample of 124 PSUs which collects data on schools not on the list frame and (2) a complete census of schools belonging to the list frame. Since a significant component of a PSS estimate comes from the census of the list frame, the criterion of at least 30 cases seems unnecessarily high. However, since the area-frame component of an estimate can have a large sampling error, some indication of a large sampling error is appropriate. Based on these two concerns, the estimates reported in a PSS table must be based on at least 15 schools. Some of the estimates in this report are footnoted with \"Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation is between 30 and 50 percent.\" The coefficient of variation measures the precision of an estimate and is defined as the standard error of an estimate divided by the value of the estimate.
