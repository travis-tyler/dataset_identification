[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Delayed recall of words in a verbal learning test is a sensitive measure for the diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The relative validity of different retention intervals of delayed recall has not been well characterized. Using the Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Huashan version, we compared the differentiating value of short-term delayed recall (AVL-SR, that is, a 3-to 5-minute delay time) and long-term delayed recall (AVL-LR, that is, a 20-minute delay time) in distinguishing patients with aMCI (n = 897) and mild AD (n = 530) from the healthy elderly (n = 1215). In patients with aMCI, the correlation between AVL-SR and AVL-LR was very high (r = 0.94), and the difference between the two indicators was less than 0.5 points. There was no difference between AVL-SR and AVL-LR in the frequency of zero scores. In the receiver operating characteristic curves analysis, although the area under the curve (AUC) of AVL-SR and AVL-LR for diagnosing aMCI was significantly different, the cut-off scores of the two indicators were identical. In the subgroup of ages 80 to 89, the AUC of the two indicators showed no significant difference. Therefore, we concluded that AVL-SR could substitute for AVL-LR in identifying aMCI, especially for the oldest patients."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Episodic memory impairment is the core feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Accurate testing for episodic memory deficits is an essential part of detecting early cognitive impairment. Basing on a word list, the verbal learning test (VLT) is a popular method of episodic memory detection; the VLT's index of ''delayed recall'' is considered the most sensitive measure for the early diagnosis of AD. It is also regarded as the best predictor of conversion from MCI to AD [1] .\nA variety of standardized VLTs, such as the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [2] (RAVLT, 1958), California Verbal Learning Test [3] [4] (CVLT, Delis 1989; CVLT-II, 2000), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test [5] (HVLT-R, Brandt and Benedict, 2001) , are commonly used for clinical diagnosis and disease monitoring [6] . Other VLTs [7] , used as a subtest for a battery of tests (for example, ADAS-cog [8] and CERAD [9, 10] ), are easier and more convenient. These tasks present with relatively fewer words (a 10-word list) and fewer learning trials (2 to 3) ( Table 1) .\nBesides the difference in lengths of word lists and numbers of trials, these verbal memory tasks also differ in testing procedure. The most obvious difference is the retention interval of delayed recall: standardized VLTs usually require 20 to 30 minutes (i.e., long-term delayed recall), whereas other VLTs require less than 10 minutes, mostly 2 to 5 minutes (that is, short-term delayed recall). As such, although word lists with delayed recall are wellestablished paradigms, the retention interval for delayed recall remains controversial.\nThe Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Huashan version (AVLT-H) [11] adopts the rationale and methods of the CVLT and Hong Kong Verbal Learning Tests. It includes short-term delayed recall (AVL-SR, that is, a 5-minute delay time) and long-term delayed recall (AVL-LR, that is, a 20-minute delay time). It is proved to be acceptable to Mandarin speakers and is sensitive to detecting aMCI. Many screening tests, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Dem Tect, use short-term delayed recall to detect memory impairment, and these tests have achieved acceptable validity. Therefore, we hypothesized that the diagnostic value of short-term (SR) and long-term delayed recall (LR) for aMCI is similar. Further, because age is a significant factor that correlates with memory decline, we also examine whether age affects the discriminating ability of the AVL-SR and AVL-LR for diagnosing aMCI."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The AD and aMCI patients were recruited consecutively at the Memory Clinic of Huashan Hospital from 2005 to 2010.

The present study used a case-control design to determine the diagnostic value of using short-term and long-term delayed recall performance of the AVLT-H for aMCI identification. We also measured age-specific classification accuracy for the two delayed recall indicators.\nLong-term delayed recall of word list learning appeared to have the highest diagnostic accuracy for differentiating MCI patients from controls and might provide the most specific measure for early AD diagnosis. Long-term delayed recall reflects entorhinal and hippocampal cortical function, where the earliest neuropathological changes in AD occur [28, 29] . Retention intervals of delayed recall have to be long enough to be sensitive to impairment but short enough to keep the examinee's compliance. So far, few have compared the use of AVL-SR and AVL-LR in identifying aMCI. In the current study, both indicators had ideal diagnostic value. Moreover, in the 80-to 89-year-old group, the AUC of AVL-SR and AVL-LR showed no significant difference.\nThe AVLT-H has been shown to accurately distinguish between aMCI and controls. Our study shows that the correlation between AVL-SR and AVL-LR was very high (r = 0.94), and the percentage of zero scores for the two indicators was similar. The numerical difference of the two indicators was less than 0.5 points in each age group of aMCI. There were few studies focusing on the time interval of delayed recall in VTLs. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) group once examined the Rey AVLT measures and brain volume. They reported that, for both 5-minute and 30-minute delayed recall trials, the hippocampus was the only region correlated with the performance [28] . The ADNI results suggested a common biological basis of short-term and long-term delayed recall. They did not, however, provide direct evidence of the equivalence between the two trials. It is worth noting that, in the current study, although the AUCs for the two indicators were different in some age groups, the cut-off scores were identical. Practically, the AVL-SR appeared to be sensitive enough to detect a memory deficit. It was the first time that the close correlation of AVL-SR and LR had been reported in a Chinese version of verbal learning test.\nTo identify MCI and determine its subtypes, it is necessary to assess multiple cognitive domains such as memory, language, attention, and visual-spatial and executive function. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery is always time-consuming, especially the memory test. There is an urgent need for a test that requires minimal time investment but maintains the clinical diagnosing value for subtle memory decline like in MCI. But if the content and procedure of a classical test is arbitrarily reduced without re-validation, the accuracy and reliability of the test will undoubtedly be affected. The current study suggests that, using a relatively shorter time interval (like AVL-SR), it is possible to identify aMCI in a feasible time duration, especially for the oldest (80-89 years old) with poor physical and psychological tolerance. Yet, if time permits, the full version of the VLT including AVL-LR is still recommended for a more accurate and sensitive measurement.\nThe present study has some strength. Three memory tests including LMT, RCFT, and AVLT were administered to all the participants. The aMCI was diagnosed according to the scores of long-term delayed recall of both LMT and RCFT, whereas the AVLT-H scores were not taken into consideration for diagnosis, thus avoiding a circular argument. Additionally, the relatively large sample size allowed the analysis to be performed in agestratified groups, which minimized the confounding effect of age. There was, however, an important limitation as well. Without ADspecific biomarker analysis such as beta-amyloid and Tau protein measurement, we could only base our diagnosis of AD and MCI on clinical evidence in a probable level of likelihood [30, 31] .\nIn general, short-term delayed recall (that is, 3-to 5-minute delay time) and long-term delayed recall (that is, 20-minute delay time) of AVLT-H has a similar ability to discriminate aMCI from cognitively normal subjects. Future research will assess the value of each AVLT-H score in the differential diagnosis, prognosis, and conversion prediction of MCI to dementia. "}]
