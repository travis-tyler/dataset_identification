Nevertheless, individual projections are likely to vary somewhat from the actual number of degrees conferred during these years. Similarly, the figures presented in this report are aggregated estimates that will not equal the number of degrees actually conferred during 1972-1973 or 1974-1975. As an indication, unpublished data from the 1972-1973 NRC Survey of Earned Doctorates show a figure of 33,727 doctorates awarded in 1972-1973, a two percent increase over the total number awarded in 1971-1972. 3 In comparison, the figure reported here on the basis of institutional estimates was higher; the estimate was that 35,532 doctorate degrees would be conferred. The projections for 1974-1975 could be subject to similar variation from actual figures."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The results of this survey (reported in Tables 1-11) indicate that the total number of doctorate degrees to be conferred are expected to increase moderately at least through the 1974-1975 academic year. Total doctorate production, based on current enrollments and the best judgment of the institutional representatives, was projected for 1974-1975 to increase by approximately eight and one-half percent above the reported production level of 1971-1972. This increase was anticipated in both public and private institutions, with the rate of growth in total doctorate production relatively equal in both sectors. three-year period. The largest increases were expected in the health professions (24.2 percent) and in the \"other fields\" category (16.0 percent). In contrast, the only anticipated decrease (2.6 percent) was in physical sciences, while the number of engineering doctorates awarded each year was expected to remain about the same. Total doctorate production for the 1974-1975 academic year was expected to increase by approximately the same rate within public and private institutions. However, specific fields of study tended to show a disproportionate rate of increase in favor of one sector of the population. With engineering, for example, institutional representatives at public institutions expected the number of doctorates awarded to increase 3.5 percent by 1974-1975, whereas representatives at private institutions expected the number of doctorates in engineering to decrease 3.5 percent by that year. Similarly, substantial gains were expected for the arts and humanities, mathematical sciences, and \"all other fields\" in the public sector (14.0 percent, 16.3 percent, and 19.9 percent, respectively) while only moderate gains or losses were expected for these fields in the private sector (7.3 percent, -2.8 percent, and 7.9 percent, respectively). In contrast, the life sciences and social sciences reported sizeable gains in the private sector (19.1 percent and 15.7 percent) and only moderate gains in the public sector (8.5 percent and 6.8 percent). One field, health professions, was expected to increase considerably in both sectors although the largest increase was expected at public institutions. Tables 2-6 are refinements of  (Table 5) and by institutional control (Table 6) are presented separately. Although noticeable increases are projected in a number of fields of study for both public and private institutions, the proportions of each year's total doctorate production attributable to each field of study were expected to remain fairly constant ( for the other fields of study. Table 5 presents similar data for all fields, time periods, and types of institutions dealt with thus far. This consistency also holds true when controlling for type of institution. As can be noted in Table 6, the proportion of doctorates in each field that would be awarded by public and by private institutions is expected to remain stable across the three points in time. Although there are minor variations, no significant differences are expected. Tables 7-9 report doctorate production estimates by field of study, academic year and by type of institution. Reference is made in the tables to \"top twenty\" and \"developing\" institutions. The \"top twenty\" were designated on the basis of about 7 percent of all science and engineering doctorates in 1971-1972. The \"top twenty\" institutions were estimated to show little overall change between 1971-1972 and 1974-1975 in levels of doctorate production, although some changes among specific fields were expected. Decreases were anticipated in engineering, mathematical sciences, and physical sciences. The expected losses in these fields contrast with the large expected gain in the health professions. From Tables 8 and 9, it can be seen that both \"developing\" and \"all other\" institutions were expected to increase their doctorate production in the [1974][1975] academic year by a greater percentage than the national average, with \"developing\" institutions increasing by 38.9 percent. In \"developing\" institutions, often sizeable gains were expected for particular fields of study; it should be noted, however, that these percentage increases are partially an artifact of the small base Ns for these fields. The \"developing\" institutions were expected to grant only 9.5 percent of the total number of doctorate degrees in 1974-1975 (Table 11). If their estimates prove to be reliable, the relative proportion of doctorates contributed by each field of study will remain fairly stable (Table 10). Similarly, only minor shifts will occur in the relative proportion of degrees granted in a given field of study by public and private institutions (Table 6) or by top twenty, developing, or other institutions (Table 11).  1974-1975 1971-1972 1972-1973 1974-1975 Number    1971-1972to: Estimated 1972-19731974-19751971-19721972-19731974-1975 Number  Table 5 of Doctorates by Field, 1972Field, -1975 Institutions    1971-1972to: Estimated 1972-19731974-19751971-19721972-19731974-1975 Table 9 Production of Doctorates in Selected Fields,'1972-1975 Field of Study"}, {"section_title": "Doctorates Conferred", "text": "Anticipated Change From 1971-1972to: Estimated 1972-19731974-19751971-19721972-19731974-1975 Number L is the number of strata defining a reporting category. The REGIS data on doctoral degrees conferred was used to provide a ratio adjustment factor in these estimates. In the absence of data on doctoral production counts for later years, the REGIS data for [1970][1971] were used in the computation of the ratio estimator for all three time periods, Note that separate ratio adjustments were made for each field estimate. To estimate the precision of these estimators, the relative variance was computed as: is the estimated population relative variance of the doctoral production count, as reported by the sample institutions, V_ 2 is the estimated population relative variance of the doctoral production count as reported to HEGIS by the sample institutions, and the last term is twice the covariance between them. Each of these terms were separately estimated from the sample data within strata and combined across strata to estimate the population variance in the reporting category, which consisted in each case. of one or more strata. The 95 percent confidence limits appearing in Tables C2 and C3 were obtained by taking the square root of the absolute variance and multiplying it by 1.96. Thus, the total number of doctorates to be conferred during the period July 1974 to June 1975 in arts and humanities is estimated to be 5,818 with a 95 percent confidence interval of + or -227. Table Cl reports for all institutions the number of institutions used to estimate each field of study for the sample and the population. Weights were subsequently obtained for each field of study by year, by stratum. The resulting range of weights developed for each field and year for the seven strata is also reported in Table Cl.  1971-19721971-1972Sample 1972-19731974-19751971-19721972-19731974-1975 Arts Based on Table 2  3Bas on Table 3 4 Bala on Table 4   percent confidence interval (interpreted as + or -).
