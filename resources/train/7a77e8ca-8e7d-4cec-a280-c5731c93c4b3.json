Despite such an emphasis, many studies show that students have difficulties with understanding or constructing reasoning and proving related activities (Chazan, 1993; Haely and Holyes, 2000; Senk, 1985; Soweder & Harel, 2003; Webber, 2001) . In attempts to address issues involving reasoning and proving, recent research has examined reasoning and proving in the middle grades (Stylianides, 2009) , an integrated standards-based textbook series (Davis, 2010) , algebra and precalculus (Thompson et al., 2012) , and geometry .\nAlthough there are different views about the link between what textbooks offer and what students learn (Freeman & Porter, 1989; Fuson, Stigler, & Bartsch, 1988; Li, 2000) , researchers generally agree that the content of mathematics textbooks informs us about students' opportunities to learn mathematics (Garner, 1992; Reys, Reys, & Chavez, 2004; Thopmson et al., 2012) . If opportunities to reason and prove are not presented in textbooks, it is unlikely that these opportunities will be created in enacted curriculum of classroom practices (Thompson et al., 2012) . Thus, although opportunities provided by textbooks are not the only influencing factors on teaching and learning of mathematics, analyzing reasoning and proving opportunities in textbooks is a first important step to understand students' opportunities to learn reasoning and proving.\nThe textbook and curriculum studies cited above are limited to American mathematics textbooks examining reasoning and proving opportunities. Expanding understanding of reasoning and proving opportunities in textbooks from other countries will be beneficial (Ottten et al., 2014) , particularly from countries whose students have performed well on international studies such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The purpose of this study is to analyze and compare reasoning and proving opportunities in one American standards-based secondary textbook series, Core Plus Mathematics Project (CPMP), and secondary textbooks from Korea, one of the top performing countries, in geometry, where reasoning and proving is most prevalent (Ottten et al., 2014) . Here are the research questions that we attempt to answer.\n1. What is the nature of reasoning and proving opportunities in Korean and standards-based American textbooks? i) What types of justifications are used in the textbooks? ii)\nWhat types of reasoning and proving opportunities are provided in the textbooks? Int J Res Educ Sci 2. What similarities and differences are observed in reasoning and proving opportunities in Korean and standards-based American secondary textbooks?\nIn an attempt to answer these research questions, we selected Core Plus Mathematics Project (CPMP) textbooks. The algebra sections of the CPMP textbooks were examined by Thompson et al. (2012) . Geometry sections in Connected Mathematics, another standards-based textbook series, were examined and analyzed previously (Stylianides, 2009 ). Thus, it would be meaningful to examine geometry sections of CPMP, an exemplary mathematics program. Once CPMP was selected, we found Korean textbooks that include compatible topics of geometry: Middle School Mathematics I, II and III * ."}, {"section_title": "Related Literature Teaching and Learning of Reasoning and Proving", "text": "Many studies show students' difficulties in writing proofs (Harel & Sowder, 2007; Senk, 1985; Webber 2001) . One well-known finding is that students use inductive argument and that empirical evidence is sufficient enough to prove instead of using a deductive proof (Chazan, 1993; Harel & Sowder, 2007) . Other studies report similar results, where the majority of students proved a statement by providing a specific example, and only a few students tried to prove general arguments; however, they did not utilize deductive proof schemes (Knuth, Slaughter, Choppin & Sutherland, 2002; Thompson, 1991) . According to Fischbein (1982) and Haely and Holyes (2000) , students are convinced by empirical evidence but not convinced by deductive form of arguments. More specifically, Haely and Holyes (2000) found that even some able students feel that proof has to have certain features that are provided by the teacher (authority), and students have little feel for purposes for proofs. Moreover, only a few students thought that one counterexample is sufficient to disprove a conjecture (Galbraith, 1981) and that a proof verified a particular case (Vinner, 1983) . Fujita and Jones (2003) reported that students do not realize why proofs are needed even when they are able to write proofs. Since constructing proof is not easy, students may leave some responses with empirical or inductive arguments . This situation does not improve at the college level. Many college students also consider inductive arguments to be mathematical proofs or they do not differentiate deductive and inductive proofs (Martin & Harel, 1989; Morris, 2002) . These findings across secondary and post-secondary school levels and across countries can be serious stumbling blocks for students to accurately understand proofs. With this evidence, it is important to pay systematic attention to reasoning and proving opportunities provided by textbooks, which partially explain students' reasoning and proving experiences in mathematics classes."}, {"section_title": "Textbook Studies on Reasoning and Proving", "text": "Several studies have examined reasoning and proving opportunities in various textbooks (Davis, 2010; Fujita & Jones, 2013; Stylianides, 2009; Thompson et al., 2012) . Stylianides (2009) found in his analysis of the Connected Mathematics series that about 40% of tasks are related to reasoning and proving and rationale. Providing Non-Proof Argument was the most frequent type of reasoning and proving task. Otten and his colleagues (2014) discovered that geometry sections include a substantially high portion of reasoning and proving tasks compared to other mathematical areas. In addition, while there are more general statements in textbook narratives, there are more reasoning and proving exercises about particular statements than general statements, which, they claimed, could cause students' difficulties in constructing proofs.\nThere are varying results in the analysis of Algebra and Precalculus textbooks. There are more general statements in Algebra I textbooks, but there are more general argument problems than specific cases in Algebra II and precalculus textbooks (Thompson et al., 2012) . Thompson et al. (2012) found that less than 6% of the exercises are about proof-related reasoning. Also, standards-based textbooks offer more reasoning and proving opportunities, which was also confirmed by Davis (2012) . Fujita and Jones (2013) examined Japanese geometry textbooks on reasoning and proving opportunities and showed that a larger portion of exercises, compared to American textbooks, are devoted to reasoning and proving. However, this finding may be skewed because their study analyzed chapters that explicitly address proofs, triangle congruence, and parallelogram as argued by Cai * Korean high school geometry topics are three dimensional coordinates and figures and vectors. Some of these topics are included in Core Plus Mathematics Course 4. These topics were not considered in previous studies (Davis, 2010; ) so we did not consider them in this study either. & Cirillo (2013) . Overall, researchers agree that students should be exposed to various types of reasoning and proving tasks and activities (Davis, 2010; Stylianides, 2009) . These results are the foundation to the current study to determine the different reasoning and proving opportunities CPMP and Korean textbooks offer to students."}, {"section_title": "Textbook Comparison Studies", "text": "Textbook comparison studies have revealed contrasting results. Some demonstrate that in both elementary and secondary mathematics textbooks, textbooks from Asian countries contain more challenging problems, while American standards-based (e.g., Everyday Mathematics) and traditional textbooks contain more single-step problems (Fan & Zhu, 2007; Li, 2000; Son & Senk 2010) . However, other studies detected that standards-based textbooks include more problems with higher level cognitive demands than traditional American textbooks and Korean secondary textbooks (Cai et al., 2010; Hong & Choi, 2014) . Results also differ by response types of problems. Son and Senk (2010) found that Korean textbooks contain more problems requiring explanation while Li (2000) and Hong and Choi (2014) revealed that American textbooks contain more problems requiring explanation. Charalambous and his colleagues (2010) found that Taiwanese textbooks include more challenging problems and problems requiring explanations compared to textbooks from Cyprus and Ireland. Thompson et al. (2012) discovered that most problems in CPMP are related to proofs. Hong and Choi (2014) also revealed that CPMP contains more problems that require explanation and reasoning. One common finding in these studies is that CPMP contains more reasoning and proving problems than other American textbooks and Korean textbooks (Davis, 2012; Hong & Choi, 2014; Thompson et al., 2012) .

Few studies have shown the framework to analyze reasoning and proving opportunities in textbooks (Davis, 2012; Stylianides, 2009; Thompson et al., 2012) .

Both Thompson et al. (2012) and categorized mathematical statements to general and specific or particular cases. Otten et al. added one more category, particular instantiation provided. Since in geometry, a particular diagram is often used to satisfy the hypothesis stated in the statement , we felt that this code was appropriate in our analysis. Two examples in Table 2 prove two general statements about isosceles triangle and exterior angle of a triangle with particular cases. We also believe that providing these different statements are important for students, so these three categories were used to code mathematical statements in the textbooks analyzed.\nOther samples for each code are provided in Table 3 .

Thus, two codes that used in their study were also employed in this study. These codes are defined as follows:\n\u2022 Deductive justification-the textbook provides a logical argument building on definitions, postulates, or previously established results to support or prove a mathematical claim.\n\u2022 Empirical justification-the textbook provides a confirming example to a mathematical claim or infers the truth of the claim from a subset of the relevant cases (Otten et al., 2014, p. 62) .\nSamples for each category are seen in Table 4 . Other statements are Justification is left for students or No justification. Among these two, we did not find Justification is left for students after the initial pilot analysis, so only No Justification was included in our analysis.

After our pilot analysis, we determined not to include Outline and Past and Future that were not found in the selected lessons. Instead, we found that problems related to conjectures and arguments can be more specified to the categories of general and particular conjectures and arguments. Since we are only able to examine potential opportunities for students when they solve these problems, -potential\u2016 justification types that each problem potentially provides were not considered in our analysis.\nConstruct a proof was also used by Otten et al. However, in our pilot analysis, we noticed that Korean textbooks do not contain any problems that specifically ask to -construct a proof.\u2016 Instead, they use the word -explain\u2016 even if a deductive proof is provided (see Figure 1 ). Problems like these are also found in the exercise section. For these problems, although we can assume that students can provide deductive proofs, we decided not to code these items as construct a proof because we were not considering potential justification. Instead, we coded these items as evaluate an argument because we felt that the definition of the code (an argument or proof is presented and students are asked to determine whether it is valid) provided by Otten et al. was appropriate.\nTranslation: In an isosceles triangle with \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 , AD bisects .

Each statement was coded for their statement type and justification type. If several sentences represent one geometric statement, we considered those as one statement.\nExercise problems in these textbooks were also coded similarly based on statement type and expected activities. Similar to Otten et al., we excluded items related to finding missing angles and lengths even if we thought that reasoning might be required to solve the problem correctly. In Figure 2 , for example, students may need to rotate the second quadrilateral to find the scale factor.

For coding reliability, the two authors, fluent in both English and Korean, independently coded each problem in the textbooks. Next, a third rater, a doctoral student in mathematics education, randomly chose one textbook from each country and independently coded each problem.

The percent agreement of the two raters was between 86% and 92%."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In this section, we present the results of our analysis and compare them to those of previous studies. The findings from textbook exposition and textbook exercise follow."}, {"section_title": "Reasoning and Proving Opportunities in the Exposition", "text": "Statements in textbook exposition provide students with opportunities to read and reflect on mathematical arguments rather than opportunities to prove or evaluate any statements directly (Thompson et al., 2012) . These statements can be the basis that students use when they are working on proving and reasoning exercise problems. Table 6 shows the percent distribution of reasoning and proving statements from each textbook. We can note several things from this table. Korean textbooks include more reasoning and proving related statements per lesson in exposition: 3.59 in Korean textbooks versus 1.64 in CPMP. This is because the way CPMP is designed, by letting students work on and engage with various mathematics tasks rather than providing worked examples and explanations. In CPMP, instead of providing proofs for different statements and theorems, students conjecture and prove those statements and theorems, which was also found in previous studies that compared other mathematical topics in CPMP (Davis, 2012; Thompson et al., 2012) . On the other hand, Korean textbooks prove statements and theorems when they are introduced in textbooks. The number of reasoning and proving statements increased in CPMP 3 and Middle School Mathematics II. These two textbooks include topics of congruent and similar triangles and properties of quadrilaterals. These topics often require proofs to verify theorems and statements, which is why there are more reasoning and proving statements in these textbooks. (Figure 1 ) while CPMP devotes proof related problems in exercise sections. This finding indicates that Korean students have opportunities to read and become familiar with proofs provided by textbooks while CPMP students have opportunities to construct proofs themselves. Table 8 shows types of justification used in textbook exposition. The major difference between CPMP and Korean textbooks is the number of statements proved deductively in Korean textbooks. About 62% of reasoning and proving exercise problems are justified deductively. This is higher than any other American geometry textbook . Korean textbooks usually give statements and theorems and prove them deductively. Figure 1 shows the deductive proof of -The vertex angle bisector to the base of an isosceles triangle bisects the base.\u2016 This gives students opportunities to become familiar with deductive proofs. We can see that more deductive proofs are included in Middle School Mathematics II because several topics (properties of triangles and quadrilaterals and similar triangles) are treated in Middle School Mathematics II and these topics often require proofs, which is why more deductive proofs are included in this textbook. On the other hand, only a limited amount of reasoning and proving statements are justified in CPMP. Again, one of the foci of CPMP is letting students work on various problems so instead of providing proofs in exposition, CPMP lets students conjecture and prove those conjectures. CPMP introduces deductive proofs; however, to allow student become familiar with how deductive proofs are completed, more deductive proofs in exposition may need to be included. Although reasoning and proving statements in exposition sections of CPMP are minimal, deductive proofs are more prevalent in both countries' textbooks, which does not coincide with Otten et al., who found that deductive and empirical justifications were equally distributed. Around 82% of CPMP statements were not justified while 74% of reasoning and proving statements in Korean textbooks were justified. This finding shows different reasoning and proving opportunities provided by these textbooks. Korean students have opportunities to become familiar with reasoning and proving by reading textbook exposition while CPMP offers these opportunities in exercise problems."}, {"section_title": "Types of Statements in Exposition", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Types of Justifications in Textbook Exposition", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Reasoning and Proving Exercise in Textbooks", "text": "The exercise problems in textbooks offer different potential opportunities, practicing and testing their understating of a lesson, to students compared to textbook exposition. Thus, students have opportunities to engage in various reasoning and proving related problems. Table 9 shows the percent distribution of reasoning and proving problems in textbooks. As previously mentioned, CPMP devotes a substantial portion of its textbooks to exercise problems so that students can explore various mathematical topics themselves. In contrast to exposition in these textbooks, CPMP includes many more problems related to reasoning and proving compared to Korean textbooks. CPMP includes 22.3 reasoning and proving problems per lesson while Korean textbooks include 7.54 reasoning and proving problems per lesson. Approximately 40% of exercise problems are related to reasoning and proving. This is higher than any other geometry and algebra textbooks seen in previous studies Thompson et al., 2012) . Again, CPMP Course 3 and Middle School Mathematics II include more reasoning and proving problems because these two textbooks include properties of triangles and quadrilaterals and congruent and similar triangles. This finding confirms what Cai and Cirillo (2013) found in Japanese geometry textbooks. Table 10 shows types of reasoning and proving exercise problems. Unlike exposition in textbooks, particular statements are more prevalent in textbook exercises, which was also found in previous studies . The percentages of particular statements are 71.8% for CPMP and 92.7% for Korean textbooks, which are higher than what was previously found by . In Korean textbooks, the majority of general statements are already proved in exposition sections so in the exercise sections, only a limited number of problems about general statements are presented. Tables 11 and 12 show types of reasoning and proving activities in exercise problems. -Evaluate particular arguments\u2016 and -Construct a proof\u2016 are two of the most prevalent activities in CPMP while -Evaluate particular arguments\u2016 is the predominant activity in Korean textbooks. One apparent difference between CPMP and Korean textbooks is the number of different activities that CPMP presents. Compared to Korean textbooks, CPMP includes various reasoning and proving activities. In addition to different types of activities, CPMP lets students make and investigate conjectures while Korean textbooks rarely allow this. The exercise problems in the Korean textbooks provide opportunities to investigate conjectures but opportunities to make conjectures are very rare. Figures 3 and 4 show different learning opportunities that CPMP and Korean textbooks offer on the same topic. Figure 3 shows one example from CPMP Course 3, showing that students are asked to make a conjecture about parallel lines and related angles and to prove their conjecture. In contrast to CPMP's approach, instead of giving students opportunities to conjecture and prove statements, the Korean textbook provides an empirical justification, measuring angles with protractor, in textbook exposition (Figure 4) . In another textbook comparison study, it was also found that CPMP provides students with more reasoning and explanation problems than Korean textbooks (Hong & Choi, 2014) as well as other American textbooks (Thompson et al., 2012 ). It appears that this finding is one of the characteristics of CPMP textbooks. a. What condition on a pair of alternate interior angles would guarantee that line l is parallel to line m?

Also, if lines are drawn so that corresponding angles and are congruent, then two lines l and m are parallel (Woo et al., 2009, p. 212) . Another finding that we notice from Table 11 is the number of -Constructing Proof\u2016 problems in Korean textbooks. It is very odd to find no exercise problems are related to proofs, especially in geometry. This is not because Korean textbooks do not have any proof problems but because Korean textbooks do not use word -prove.\u2016 In Figure 1 , although a property of an isosceles triangle is proved deductively, the wording in the textbook is -Explain the reason.\u2016 In Figure 5 , the problem asks to explain why two triangles, and , are congruent rather than -Prove that two triangles, and are congruent.\u2016 Problems like these are coded either as -Evaluate Particular Argument\u2016 or -Evaluate General Argument.\u2016 Although it is plausible to assume that students are asked to present a -Deductive Proof,\u2016 we can only code these as -Evaluate Argument\u2016 rather than -Construct a Proof.\u2016 (Woo et al., 2009 b, p. 243) .

However, Korean textbooks provide only a few opportunities for students to make conjectures and prove statements themselves. In CPMP textbook exposition, general statements are more prevalent while particular statements are prevalent in both countries' textbook exercise problems. Senk (1985) found that students were more successful in proving particular statements. Although it has been almost 30 years since Senk published her work, particular statements are more prevalent in these textbooks, which may explain students' difficulty in proving general statements. Deductive proofs are prevalent in textbook exposition while possible justifications for exercise problems were not examined because with words such as -prove\u2016 or -explain\u2016 without referring to specific justification, it would be difficult to see what is expected from students."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "This study analyzes and compares reasoning and proving opportunities in geometry lessons from American standard-based textbooks and Korean textbooks to understand reasoning and proving opportunities. Overall, around 40% of exercise problems in CPMP ask for reasoning and proving activities while 20% of exercise problems in Korean textbooks are about reasoning and proving activities. For CPMP, it is higher than what was previously found in geometry textbooks as well as in other mathematics textbooks (Thompson et al., 2012) . It is also higher than other lessons in CPMP (Thompson et al., 2012) . Around 5% of problems in other geometry textbooks were about constructing a proof . CPMP also has higher a percentage of constructing proof problems. This reveals a well-known fact that geometry lessons typically focus on reasoning and proving activities than other mathematical topics (Hanna & Bruyun, 1999; Herbst, 2002) . However, only a limited number of geometric statements in CPMP were justified deductively. Reasoning and proving opportunities in Korean textbooks are quite different because they provide fewer reasoning proving problems but more statements are proved deductively in exposition sections. Compared to CPMP, many general statements are proved deductively to give students opportunities to read and become familiar with deductive proofs. On the other hand, CPMP provides opportunities for students to make, investigate, and prove conjectures by solving exercise problems. Reasoning and proving opportunities provided by these textbooks are clearly different. However, as Otten and his colleagues (2014) stated, it is beyond the scope of this study to discuss the ideal proportion of reasoning and proving statements and exercises in textbooks or to think about which textbooks would give more opportunities to students. Nonetheless, it is clear that Korean and CPMP students have different opportunities in learning geometry. It may be interesting to test Korean and CPMP students with different types of geometry problems to see how textbooks influence their learning.\nAnother interesting finding is the lack of -prove\u2016 problems in Korean textbooks. Rather than using the word -prove,\u2016 Korean textbooks used -explain\u2016 in both exposition and exercise sections. We also examined the curriculum guidelines from the Korean Ministry of Education and found that the word -prove\u2016 is not used in geometry lessons. It is plausible to think that deductive proofs are expected for those problems because numerous general statements are proved deductively in exposition sections of Korean textbooks. However, predicting what students will do to solve each problem is beyond the scope of this study. Based on this result, it may be interesting to see how Korean students perform on -prove\u2016 problems and -explain\u2016 problems. While -prove\u2016 problems are lacking in Korean textbooks, deductive justification is lacking in CPMP.\nTaking into consideration all of these findings, we can see how textbooks from these two countries approach geometry teaching differently. Whether students have opportunities to read or construct deductive proofs and make and investigate conjectures and arguments, textbooks need to provide equal opportunities for various reasoning and proving activities so that students can be exposed to various types of reasoning and proving problems (Davis, 2010; Stylianides, 2009 ). Stylianides (2009) developed a model that places reasoning and proving opportunities, from empirical arguments to proofs, hierarchically so that students can experience them at different grade levels. Such a model may be needed for students to experience various reasoning and proving opportunities. Since what textbooks offer is an influencing factor, opportunities might not be presented to students if they are not included in textbooks (Thompson et al., 2012) . Textbook authors and publishers need to consider findings from the current study as well as previous studies on reasoning and proving opportunities in textbooks.\nAs previously mentioned, one well-known fact about teaching and learning of proofs is that students are not comfortable with providing proofs; rather, they use specific cases (Knuth, Slaughter, Choppin & Sutherland, 2002; Thompson, 1991) . Our results support this fact because the most prevalent problems in both CPMP and Korean textbooks are evaluating particular statements. This result partially explains why students have difficulties in constructing proofs because of the opportunities provided by these textbooks. Again, equally providing general and particular cases to students may need to be considered when textbooks are developed and written.\nThe link between what textbooks potentially bring and what students actually learn is what teachers do in their classes (Bieda, 2010; Hong & Choi, 2014; Johnson, Thompson & Senk, 2010; Son & Senk, 2010) . Since these textbooks provide different learning opportunities, the teachers' role in teaching geometry with these textbooks also needs to be considered because teachers need to be sensitive about these different possibilities and ensure students have opportunities to experience them (Johnson et al., 2010) . However, Bieda (2010) discovered that teachers were not able to implement proof related opportunities even if those opportunities were provided by textbooks. Thus, whether students are using CPMP or Korean textbooks, what teachers need to do in their classes is critical in teaching geometry. Since there are only a limited number of deductive proofs in exposition sections of CPMP, teachers should guide students through conjectures and arguments until students are able to construct deductive proofs when using CPMP. For Korean students, teachers need to give them opportunities to make and investigate conjectures as well as opportunities to read and become familiar with deductive proofs in exposition. It would be interesting to examine how teachers use these textbooks in their classes in terms of teacher preparation programs.\nThis study also gives some insights into -textbook signature.\u2016 Charalambous, Delaney, Hui-Yu and Mesa (2010) defined -textbook signature\u2016 as -the uniform distinctive features in the textbooks within a particular country.\u2016 They proposed analyzing other mathematics topics from different textbooks for further understanding about characteristics of textbooks from different countries. One of the findings from this study that coincides well with previous studies is about CPMP. This study found that CPMP includes more reasoning and proving problems than Korean textbooks, which was also found when CPMP was compared to other algebra, geometry precalculus textbooks (Davis, 2012; Thompson et al., 2012) . Hong and Choi (2014) also discovered that CPMP provides more reasoning and explaining problems when quadratic equations sections were compared. These findings in total can be interpreted as the -textbook signature\u2016 of CPMP, where students have numerous opportunities to reason, prove, and explain mathematical concepts.\nFinally, we can think of textbooks' potential influence on American students' mediocre performances on TIMSS and PISA. Hong and Choi (2014) stated in their textbook comparison study that textbooks may not be the reason for American students' performances on TIMSS and PISA. We cannot confirm whether American students who participated in TIMSS and PISA used CPMP or any other standards-based textbooks; however, previous findings and this current study show that, compared to other textbooks, CPMP offers ample reasoning and proving opportunities to students. At the same time, our findings reveal that Korean textbooks also provide different reasoning and proving opportunities to students in reading various deductive proofs. Making conjectures and proving particular statements in CPMP and deductive proofs in Korean textbooks are different but they can both provide good learning opportunities to students. A TIMSS video study illustrated that in American mathematics classes, proof opportunities are very rare (Hiebert et al., 2003) and another showed that teachers are not able to provide proof related opportunities to students (Bieda, 2010 ). While we are not able to say which textbooks provide more meaningful learning opportunities to students, CPMP may provide comparable amount of reasoning and proving opportunities to students, and it is possible that enacted curriculum of class practices rather than potentially implemented curriculum of textbooks may play a role in American students' performances on TIMSS and PISA. For further study, it would be interesting to compare CPMP and other top performing East Asian countries' textbooks to determine how comparable those learning opportunities are. Such studies will provide a better picture about what learning opportunities CPMP and other textbooks bring to students."}]
