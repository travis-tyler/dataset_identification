The Golden Gate tidal series is the longest uninterrupted tidal series in the United States and one of the longest tidal series in the world. The Golden Gate is the entrance to the San Francisco Bay Estuary, one of the largest and most important commercial and industrial estuarine areas in the United States. The Golden Gate tidal series serves an important reference for tidal studies conducted within the San Francisco Bay Estuary. The primary objective of this report is to document the establishment of the common datum relationship between the three long data sets at Fort Point, Sausalito and Presidio locations. Tidal measurements have been recorded in the Golden Gate area since the mid-1800s at Fort Point (1854-1877), Sausalito (1877Sausalito ( -1897 and the Presidio (1897-Present). Once the datum relationships were established, the data sets were referenced to one common datum in order to establish the 146 year long data series for the National Ocean Service tidal program. Tidal analyses were performed and tidal datums were computed on the basis of long-term data sets leading to increased reliability of chart datums, and marine boundary determination with San Francisco as the reference station. Comprehensive studies of sea level changes and trends relative to land were possible. Long-term extreme high water levels are an important factor in studies of the influence of storms on the water levels. Return periods were determined with a higher degree of accuracy. Frequency and duration of inundation procedures were developed in which the data set at San Francisco provided ample long-term data. The scientific, engineering and academic communities have found this information useful to support resolution of many developmental and environmental issues related to the Golden Gate region."}, {"section_title": "I.

These include Fort Point (1854-1877), Sausalito (1877Sausalito ( -1897 and Presidio (two locations1897-present). This report describes the procedures used to relate the tidal heights from the three locations to a common reference zero for the entire time period 1854-present. This has enabled one continuous time series to be constructed. From this time series, analyses of seasonal and long term variations in sea level and of the observed extremes in high and low water levels are possible. Preliminary results of this effort were reported by Smith (1980)."}, {"section_title": "II. HISTORY OF TIDE STATIONS AT THE GOLDEN GATE", "text": "A history of tide gauges that have been used at the Golden Gate are described in Appendix A and locations of the tide stations are shown in Figure 1.

Fort Point", "text": "A self-registering tide gauge was installed at Fort Point on June 30, 1854 at the end of a 500 foot long wharf projecting out from the Golden Gate southern shore. The tide gauge was located approximately 2100 feet east of Fort Point. The wharf on which the gauge and staff rested decayed to the point that it was necessary to abandon the site on November 27,1877.\nOn June 30, 1854 a bench mark (BM), designated BM I(2), was established at Fort Point. It was a cross cut in the face of a large stone at the shore end of the wharf. In 1872 the Coast Survey established two additional bench marks, designated BM II(3) and BM III 5, to provide a more stable reference network at Fort Point. The history of the leveling to these bench marks is shown in Table 1. Historic levels show that the wharf and staff settled 2.40 feet between June 30, 1854 and January 2, 1858. A new staff was installed on April 2, 1858 closer to the shore on the same wharf. The 1859 levels indicate a staff settlement of 0.78 feet between April 1858 and June 1859. The wharf and staff were stabilized in 1859 by repairs to the wharf and the use of rock and stone fill in the area around the wharf. The water level heights between 1854 and 1859 were corrected to a common reference to take into account this movement. Appendix C, Figure C-1, shows a plot of the corrected versus uncorrected data and information on the wharf and staff movement."}, {"section_title": "B. Sausalito", "text": "The Sausalito station was established on February 27, 1877. Operation of the Sausalito tide station overlapped that of the Fort Point station for about 9 months. The tide gauge and staff were moved to a new wharf, adjacent to the old location, on October 12, 1881. The wharf at the old location had decayed to the point it was unsafe to continue tide operations. Data collection at Sausalito was discontinued on September 1, 1897 because a decision was made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey to move operations back across the Golden Gate to the Presidio.\nBench marks were established near the Sausalito tide station in 1877 prior to the water level crossing of the Golden Gate, including bench mark 2 (copper bolt) and bench mark 3 (granite block). Bench mark 2 is recoverable today and has been virtually undisturbed for over 100 years.

TIDAL DATUMS COMPUTED FOR THE GOLDEN GATE", "text": "A datum is a base elevation used as a reference from which to reckon heights or depths. It is called a tidal datum when defined in terms of a certain phase of the tide. The seven tidal datums and associated tidal parameters routinely computed by NOS are listed in Table 4 (See National Ocean Service (2000) for definitions). By the middle of the 20th century NOS adopted the concept of a National Tidal Datum Epoch (NTDE). A tidal epoch is a specific 19-year period accepted as the official time segment over which tide observations are taken and averaged to obtain mean values for tidal datums (Marmer, 1951). Establishment of an epoch was necessary to take into account the slowly varying changes in the tides due to the 18.6 year variation in the path of the moon called the regression of the moon's nodes. A tidal epoch is sometimes referred to as the Metonic cycle, which is defined as the period in which the new and full moon would recur on the same day of the year. Changes over time in the specific official 19-year period adopted are necessary because of observed periodic and apparent secular trends in sea level. The 19-year period is also used to \"smooth out\" the long-period meteorological, hydrologic, and oceanographic fluctuations. NOS has adopted the 1924-1942 (in 1953), 1941-1959 ( in 1964) and 1960-1978 (in 1980) tidal epochs. Sea level changes are monitored and approximately every 25 years NOS determines whether sea level has changed at a sufficient number of its National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) stations (long term continuously operating tide stations) in the United States coastal areas to warrant an update to a more recent tidal epoch. A new epoch update is presently underway in NOS."}, {"section_title": "A.

ADJUSTMENTS TO SAUSALITO 1877 -1897 TIDE HEIGHTS", "text": "The difference in the mean level of the sea surface across the Golden Gate between San Francisco and Sausalito was thought to be small enough that adjustments were not made to the MSL elevations at Sausalito when the datum elevations were transferred to the Presidio. The concept of a minimal sea surface slope across the Golden Gate between Fort Point and Sausalito was supported by the computed difference of MSL (1960 -1978) -NGVD of 0.02 feet between the two locations. The mean range of tide at Sausalito had an average range ratio (mean range of tide at Sausalito divided by the mean range of tide at Fort Point) of 0.94, therefore adjustments to the mean range of tide at Sausalito were needed. The range ratio was computed from an average of the ranges from the results of simultaneous comparisons between Fort Point and Sausalito. The mean high water and mean low water datum elevations also needed adjustments. The diurnal high water (DHQ = MHHW -MHW) and diurnal low water (DLQ = MLW -MLLW) inequalities were not required to be adjusted in the transfer. The following procedures were used to make adjustments to the tidal datum elevations for Sausalito to obtain values for these parameters for Fort Point/Presidio: All these adjusted values have been combined to reflect the tidal datum elevations reduced to mean values (1878 -1896) at Presidio, referred to the 1897 tide staff zero (Table 7).  -1916 1924 -1942 1941 -1959 1960 -1978 1980 -1998  The tidal datums, reduced to mean values for the 7 tidal epochs previous discussed ( Table 5 and Table 7) are summarized in Figure 3."}, {"section_title": "VI. DATUM RECOVERY AT SAUSALITO", "text": "A datum recovery is made at a tide station to determine how accurate the datum computed from one data set compares with the datum computed from a different period of time. It also assesses how accurate the datum at a location can be transferred from one period in time to another. The difference may also give an indication of how much the datum has changed over time due to manmade/or natural causes. If the recovery of the datum over time between different hydrographic surveys in the area are possible, then a history of the changes in sounding datum between hydrographic surveys can be determined which may provide information on bathymetric or other changes in the area. Tidal datum recovery at Sausalito has been computed over a 100 year period with the use of the tidal series 1878 -1896 and 1977 -1979. Bench mark 2 1877 is a common bench mark to both tidal series in the analysis. The preliminary steps in the datum recovery are shown in Table 8. The information in Table 8 is used to determine the datum recovery at Sausalito using the following steps: a. The difference in the elevation of the common bench mark on the respective staffs for the two series is computed. From This datum recovery 0.20 foot is quite good given that the two tidal series are separated by such a long period of time. This indicates is that there has probably been little movement of BM 2 at Sausalito and the comparison of the results of 19 year datums at Sausalito from 1878 -1896 compare well with those based on 1977-1979Sausalito data, reduced to mean values (1960-1978 through a simultaneous comparison with the Presidio. There are difficulties in obtaining a precise datum recovery (0.10 foot or better) at tide stations when a station is re-occupied again years later. The factors that affect the datum recovery include: common bench mark(s) available for both series, the bench marks may have been destroyed, settled or disturbed; and the quality of the tide data for one of the tidal series at the location may be questionable. The tidal datums for both series should be reduced to mean values (same tidal epoch) through simultaneous comparison with the same reference station in computing the tidal datums."}, {"section_title": "VII.

It was cumbersome for scientists and engineers to frequently update datums prior use of computers, therefore it was decided to adopted a \"standard mean sea level datum\" at Presidio of 8.52 feet referred to the 1897 tide staff zero. This datum elevation was determined from the mean of the hourly heights at observed at Presidio over the continuous period from 1898 to 1913. This datum was held fixed and was not updated. Two ways that these tidal datums may be computed are: a. Mean of the high or low waters around the time of spring tide or neap tide each month over a specific 19-year period. There are 4 high waters and 4 low waters used each month for both the spring tide and the neap tide. Spring tide occurs around the time of new and full moon and neap tide occurs around the time of the first and third quadrature of the moon each month. It is sometimes subjective which days and tides to select. b. The approach that can be used to compute approximate values for these tidal datums involves calculations using amplitudes of selected harmonic constituents from harmonic analysis for the location. The following is an example using the tidal parameters at Presidio for the 1960 -1978 tidal epoch and a 365 day harmonic analysis for 1994. The harmonic analyses results provide ratios of the mean ranges of tide:  "}, {"section_title": "IX. VARIATIONS IN MEAN SEA LEVEL AT THE GOLDEN GATE", "text": "The previous sections of this report describe how the tidal observations at the Golden Gate have been referenced to a common datum, the 1897 tide staff zero at the Presidio, resulting in a 146-year continuous record of MSL as well as other tidal datums and tidal parameters. MSL is frequently thought of as an equipotential surface, however it is known that MSL at any given location will deviate from that surface due to the effects of wind, barometric pressure, circulation patterns, and river flow. For tidal work, MSL is computed by averaging all hourly water level over specific time periods. NOS routinely computes monthly MSL, annual MSL, and the accepted tidal datum of MSL. The accepted datum of MSL is computed using 19-years of data over the accepted National Tidal Datum Epoch period. The long sea level series at the Golden Gate may provide important clues to climate and global change investigations. Sea level records are the longest and highest quality records of any oceanographic parameter and the primary evidence suggesting apparent rise in sea level comes from records of tide gauges such as San Francisco. In addition to reflecting changes in sea level, measurements of water level at a tide gauge may reflect changes due to the land movement in the region where the tide gauge is located.

The most severe El Nino events in the 20th century occurred in the time periods 1939 -1941, 1956 -1958, 1981 -1983 and 1991 -1993. The monthly sea level variations for these years are shown in Figures 5a and b. Duncan et al (1998) provide detailed descriptions at the data for west coast stations for the 1997-1998 El Nino. Interannual sea level variations play an important role in understanding climate phenomena such as the El Nino South Oscillation. These events reflect climatic interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere. The long term sea level records such as those at the Golden Gate, provide not only data for the study of sea level rise, but since climatic events such as El Nino vary in size and global influence from decade to decade, these data sets provide the baseline from which to measure future events. .

Long-term Variations in Annual Mean Sea Level", "text": "The annual means of sea level for the Golden Gate tidal series are available for each year from 1855 through 1998 ( Figure 6). The notable upward spikes in the curve have been identified as years when El Nino events were in progress in the Pacific Ocean. El Nino is the name given to a general warming of the surface waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean that happens at irregular interval of years. It is a meteorological and oceanographic phenomenon. It is characterized by warmer surface water temperatures and higher water levels in the Eastern tropical Pacific Ocean with a lowering of the surface water temperatures and water levels in the Western Pacific. More is discussed later with seasonal-to-interannual-to-decadal variations in sea level. The notable downward spikes have not been addressed but may be associated with years of near drought conditions in the region. The annual mean sea level curve shows a rise in sea level relative to land. The amount of rise relative to land over the 140 years, is estimated to be at least 0.7 feet. The sea level data have been filtered further to eliminate annual variations in the record with a 19year moving average starting with 1855-1873 and ending with 1976-1998. Each 19-year value has been plotted at the mid-year of the 19-year period in Figure 6.

Extreme low water levels have not received as much attention as the highest water levels in the Bay area, but these data are important as they relate to drought periods and salt water intrusion into the fresh water areas of the San Francisco Bay Estuary. The California Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (CADWR, 1970) summarizes the seasonal weather patterns in the bay region that partially drive the variations of the water levels. It is generally dry in summer due to the migrating high pressure systems that deflect storm patterns to the north. In the winter, the high pressures decrease in intensity and move southward and the intrusion of moisture-laden air is no longer blocked. The winter will frequently arrive as a series of storms that move in from the southeast and provide gale winds, heavy rains and large changes in atmospheric pressure."}, {"section_title": "A.

For this report storm surge is defined as the difference between the observed and predicted water levels, both referenced to MLLW. For example, the storm surge for the January 27, 1983 storm event (observed -predicted) is just over 2.0 feet, and for the December 3, 1983 it is over 3.0 feet.

Datum recovery at Sausalito was completed, providing important assessment for one of the Golden Gate tide stations from two different tidal series separated by 100 years. Relative sea level rise determinations and land movements are now accurately measured through the long series at the Golden Gate."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The tide data sets in this report represent the cumulative effort of the National Ocean Service; those who installed and maintained the tide gauges for recording tide measurements and those who analyzed the data, documented the results and summarized them in an accessible manner.

Many types of tide gauges were proposed and constructed in the 19th century. The first selfregistering tide gauge was used in 1831 by Henry Palmer of England. The earliest tide gauges in use are described below:"}, {"section_title": "A. Parts of a Tide Gauge", "text": "The essential parts of a tide gauge are composed of a stilling well to dampen wave action; a time piece and some way of recording the height, either in a continuous manner or at discrete intervals of time."}, {"section_title": "B. Workings of a Tide Gauge", "text": "The motion of the float as it rises and falls with the tide is communicated along the recording portion of the gauge by means of a flexible cord which passes over a grooved wheel (float wheel). The motion is transferred, but on a reduced scale, through some mechanism depending upon the particular kind of gauge, to a pencil which traces a curve upon a moving sheet of paper. The paper is driven or carried along by means of a cylinder connected with a well-regulated clock. The pencil is free to move in a direction perpendicular to the line of the motion of the paper."}, {"section_title": "C. First Coast Survey Tide Gauge", "text": "Joseph Saxton, of the Office of United States Weights and Measures, constructed the first selfregistering tide gauge in the United States used by the Coast Survey. There were two principal movements provided for in Saxton's gauge. The first being a uniform movement, proportional to time, of the record sheet under the pencil, and the second being a transverse movement of the pencil, strictly proportional to its rise and fall of the float. To give a uniform motion to the sheet of paper, a clock-work was used. The moving parts of the old-fashioned eight-day clock, with the striking parts taken out, were employed for this purpose. The clock-work gives a uniform motion of rotation to the cylindrical roller that revolves 360 degrees once in twelve hours. The second principal movement in the gauge originates in the vertical movement of the float, and extends to the recording pencil. The float was an air-tight cylinder or canister-shaped copper box, which was first thoroughly painted for protection. A small ballasting weight was attached to the center of its bottom. On its top was an eye, in which was fastened the end of a wire leading up through the float box. This box was a water-tight wooden case, large enough to permit a free play of the float, and terminating at the bottom in a funnel, with an orifice at its apex, through which the water could pass as rapidly as necessary, but not so as freely as to make the float oscillate sensibly with the surface waves.

By the 1970s, all standard tide gauges operations ceased to be used by NOS. The product of its recordings was a marigram trace of the tide curve. The workings of the standard tide gauge may be found in NOS Publication 30-1 Manual of Tide Observations."}, {"section_title": "Gas-Purging Pressure Tide Gauge (Bubbler Gauge)", "text": "This tide gauge has made it possible to obtain satisfactory records in areas where the installation of the structure-supported tide gauge was impractical. The compact size and relative ease of installation and operation has lead to its use for reconnaissance surveys for tidal datum purposes. This tide gauge was pioneered at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution by Alfred Redfield. It was first used by NOS in the 1960s for use at subordinate stations which is a tide station from which a relatively short series of observations is reduced by comparison with simultaneous observations from a tide station with a relatively long series of observations. The bubbler has been used as a backup tide gauge at control stations starting in the 1970s for use in filling breaks in ADR data records. The workings of the gauge may be found in the NOS publication, \"User's Guide for Gas-Purged Pressure Recording (Bubbler) Tide Gauge.\""}, {"section_title": "Analog Digital Recorder (ADR)", "text": "This tide gauge was first used in the 1960s and finally replaced the standard tide gauge completely in the 1970s. It is a float actuated tide gauge that records the heights at regular intervals replaced (6 minutes) on a digital punch tape. The internal workings of the gauge can be found in NOS publication, \"Special Publication 30-1 Manual of Tide Observations.\"  "}, {"section_title": "Next Generation Water Level Measurement System (NGWLMS)", "text": "The Next Generation Water Level Measurement System began to be implemented into operations in the National Water level Observation Network (NWLON) in the late 1980's and ending with complete implementation at Great Lakes stations in 2000. At most locations, the NGWLMS was operated simultaneously present ADR tide gauge system during a transition period, after which the ADR was removed. The NGWLMS uses state-of-the-art technology that includes self-calibrating downward-looking acoustic water level sensors, back-up pressure sensors, micro-processor based data acquisition and storage, telemetry to the GOES satellite with a telephone as back-up and the capability of automated collection of up to 11 ancillary measurements (meteorological data, for instance). The NGWLMS acoustic sensor does not have the physical contact of a device with the water surface, such as the float with the ADR, and the NGWLMS does require a full mechanical filter known as the stilling well. A large source of systematic error and uncertainty in the older float operated systems that used stilling wells is being eliminated or reduced using the NGWLMS. The stilling well is replaced by a more open protective well, much less subject to nonlinear filtering effects and biofouling, less conducive to density gradient buildups, and more indicative of the outside environment. The rapid sampling (1 -second pulses) possible with the acoustic sensor of the NGWLMS allows the well to be open to the dynamics of the ocean. High frequency waves are removed by digital filtering (by the microprocessor that is part of the water level measurement system), rather than analog filtering through an orifice in the ADR system. A significant improvement with the NGWLMS is that leveling from the bench marks can be done directly to the sensor itself (the head of the transducer at the end of the sound tube). The sensor can also be replaced and re-calibrated. The elimination of the tide observer with the replacement of the ADR with the NGWLMS does away with the systematic errors of observations read from a staff and adjustments to the ADR gauge itself. The NGWLMS does not require simultaneous observations from a tide staff and tide gauge to compute the average monthly difference between the tide staff and marigram zero in the process of referring the water level heights to the station datum. The possibility of timer drift is also eliminated with the replacement of the ADR with the NGWLMS. It is believed that the pier settled because it was resting on a peat foundation. The shore in the region was comprised of marsh and peat bogs which were common in the area. According to NOS historical files of the description of the locality, \"The peat structure near the Fort Point pier was covered in 1859 by gravel and pebbles to give the appearance of greater stability.\" The question that comes to mind also is how piers were constructed in the 1850s. Letters from the National Archives state that the Fort Point wharf was \"constructed on piers of a crib filled with stone.\" On one of these piers the self-registering gauge was placed. In Webster's unabridged dictionary a crib is described as the following: \" In the engineering sense, a crib is a frame of logs or beams to be filled with stones, rubble or the like and sunk as a foundation or retaining wall in the building of docks, piers, dams, etc.\" This is consistent with literature describing the construction of docks and piers in the text, \"The Construction of Harbors' by Thomas Stevenson and published by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1886. Marine organisms contributed to the decay of the timbers forming the cribs. This resulted in the shifting of the timbers as they weakened from the decay. In time, the stones within the confines of the timbers also started to shift. The Fort Point wharf being in a high wave and current energy area also contributed in the wharf sinking."}, {"section_title": "D-1", "text": "Appendix D Water Leveling Crossings of the Golden Gate ."}, {"section_title": "D-2", "text": "A water leveling crossing was made across the Golden Gate in 1877 from Fort Point to Sausalito to establish a relationship between the 1877 tide staff zero at Fort Point with the 1877 tide staff zero at Sausalito.
