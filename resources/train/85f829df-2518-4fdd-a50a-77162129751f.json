[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background-The ability of older persons to function independently is dependent largely on the maintenance of sufficient aerobic capacity and strength to perform daily activities. Although peak aerobic capacity is widely recognized to decline with age, its rate of decline has been estimated primarily from cross-sectional studies that may provide misleading, overly optimistic estimates of aging changes. Methods and Results-To determine longitudinal rate of change in aerobic capacity and the influence of age, gender, and physical activity on these changes, we performed serial measurements of peak treadmill oxygen consumption (peak V O 2 ) in 375 women and 435 men ages 21 to 87 years from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, a community-dwelling cohort free of clinical heart disease, over a median follow-up period of 7.9 years. A linear mixed-effects regression model was used to calculate the predicted longitudinal 10-year rate of change in peak V O 2 , expressed in milliliters per minute, for each age decade from the 20s through the 70s after adjustment for self-reported leisure-time physical activity. A longitudinal decline in peak V O 2 was observed in each of the 6 age decades in both sexes; however, the rate of decline accelerated from 3% to 6% per 10 years in the 20s and 30s to \u03fe20% per 10 years in the 70s and beyond. The rate of decline for each decade was larger in men than in women from the 40s onward. Similar longitudinal rates of decline prevailed when peak V O 2 was indexed per kilogram of body weight or per kilogram of fat-free mass and in all quartiles of self-reported leisure-time physical activity. When the components of peak V O 2 were examined, the rate of longitudinal decline of the oxygen pulse (ie, the O 2 utilization per heart beat) mirrored that of peak V O 2 , whereas the longitudinal rate of heart rate decline averaged only 4% to 6% per 10 years, and accelerated only minimally with age. Conclusions-The longitudinal rate of decline in peak V O 2 in healthy adults is not constant across the age span in healthy persons, as assumed by cross-sectional studies, but accelerates markedly with each successive age decade, especially in men, regardless of physical activity habits. The accelerated rate of decline of peak aerobic capacity has substantial implications with regard to functional independence and quality of life, not only in healthy older persons, but particularly when disease-related deficits are superimposed.

Healthy elderly persons who volunteer for exercise studies may have genetic and lifestyle differences from younger individuals, many of whom will not survive to old age. Nevertheless, because of the relative ease of performing cross-sectional rather than longitudinal studies, the former are often used to predict longitudinal aging changes.\nLongitudinal studies examining age-associated changes in peak V O 2 have generally been limited to small samples within a narrow age range not representative of the general population. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] The majority of such studies have focused on elite male athletes. 12,13,16 -19 Longitudinal rates of decline of peak V O 2 in these studies have varied from 5% to \u03fe20% per decade, dependent largely on the degree to which these athletes maintained their initially intense training regimens over time. These studies provide little insight into the longitudinal changes in aerobic capacity in more typical, nonathletic populations. Furthermore, longitudinal peak V O 2 investigations in untrained women are essentially nonexistent. Finally, and most importantly, no studies have specifically examined whether the longitudinal rate of decline in aerobic capacity increases or remains the same with each decade of advancing age. It is likely that such changes are not linear across the age span, as assumed by both cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies including only individuals within a narrow age range.\nPeak V O 2 has been measured in clinically healthy volunteers from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) since 1978. The present study, therefore, was designed to examine longitudinal changes in peak V O 2 and its components, peak heart rate and oxygen pulse (the product of stroke volume and arteriovenous O 2 difference), in nonendurance-trained BLSA men and women across a broad age range. We hypothesized that longitudinal decline in peak V O 2 would exceed cross-sectional decline and that physical activity levels and body compositional changes would interact with age as determinants of the longitudinal rate of decline in peak V O 2 . Additionally, we assessed the relative contributions of longitudinal changes in maximum heart rate and O 2 pulse to the decline in peak V O 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "Volunteers for the present study were derived from the BLSA. 10, 24 These participants are predominantly white and college educated and live or have lived in the Baltimore-Washington area.

Tests were performed \u05462 hours postprandially, nearly always between 8:30 AM and noon. Tests considered submaximal, as defined by the inability to achieve \u054685% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate or the assessment of the supervising physician that the subject did not exercise to exhaustion (ie, the individual did not appear fatigued and claimed he or she could have continued at least another minute), were excluded from the current analysis. Similarly, observations during which volunteers were using \u2424-blockers were excluded because of the known effects of these drugs to reduce peak V O 2 . 25 Oxygen consumption was measured continuously during a modified Balke protocol with the speed of the motor-driven treadmill usually held constant (at 3.0 mph for women and 3.5 mph for men) and the grade of the treadmill progressively increased by 3% at 2-minute intervals until voluntary exhaustion. In more fit subjects, treadmill speed was increased by 0.5 mph 1 to 3 times during the test.\nExpired gas volumes were measured with either Tissot tanks or a Parkinson-Cowan gas meter. Expired O 2 and CO 2 concentrations were measured with either dedicated O 2 and CO 2 analyzers or a medical mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer MGA-1110), which were calibrated every morning before testing. Oxygen consumption was calculated every 30 seconds, and the highest value was termed peak V O 2 , expressed in milliliters per minute (mL/min) or milliliters per kilogram per minute (mL/kg per minute).

The mixed-effects regression model easily accommodates unbalanced, unequally spaced observations and consequently is an ideal tool for analyzing longitudinal changes in BLSA data. This statistical model allows for the examination of important variables that are associated with changes in peak V O 2 in a long-term longitudinal study. In this model, longitudinal change is represented by the follow-up time (Time) and its interactions with other variables. Significant interaction of a variable with Time indicates a significant effect on the longitudinal change in peak V O 2 . Crosssectional differences across age are represented by terms involving age at first examination (FAge, FAge 2 ) and their interaction with other variables. Separate models were employed to determine the longitudinal decline in maximum heart rate and peak O 2 pulse, the components of peak V O 2 . The Data Supplement contains additional information detailing the definition of variables that are included in the mixed-effects models.\nThe major variables known to determine peak V O 2 that were the focus of the present analysis included age, gender, body composition, and physical activity. To portray the effects of age and time on peak V O 2 , predicted longitudinal changes and cross-sectional differences were plotted per 10 years for each age decade. Longitudinal changes were calculated as the percent difference of the predicted peak V O 2 at time 0 and 10 years later for each age decade. Cross-sectional differences were calculated by the percent difference of the predicted peak V O 2 at time 0 between successive age decades. Similar methods were employed to examine longitudinal changes in the components of peak V O 2 , peak exercise heart rate, and oxygen pulse. In all analyses, a 2-tailed probability value \u03fd0.05 was required for statistical significance.\nTo assess whether a mixed-effects model was providing an adequate model for this data, we calculated the observed per-decade change in peak V O 2 for each participant as 10 \u03eb (last value \u03ea first value)/follow-up time. For each age decade and gender, we constructed 95% confidence intervals for the observed mean per-decade change. The per-decade change in peak V O 2 was also predicted from the mixed-effects model for each age decade and gender and compared with the confidence intervals obtained from the raw data."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "From January 1978 to December 1998, 735 women and 778 men underwent a total of 3379 treadmill tests with respiratory gas analysis; 306 tests were excluded because of submaximal effort. Participants with clinical evidence of coronary heart disease either before their first visit or during the follow-up period were excluded, resulting in a loss of 204 visits and 116 participants. In addition, 102 observations involving \u2424-blocker use were excluded. Finally, data from 205 men and 260 women with a qualifying exercise test on only one visit were excluded. The final sample consisted of 2302 observations in 375 women and 435 men who had at least 2 qualifying visits with peak V O 2 measurement.\nAge distribution of the sample at the time of initial peak V O 2 determination is shown in Table I of the Data Supplement. All age decades from the 20s through the 70s contained \u03fe30 individuals of each gender. Because only 13 men and 11 women initially in their 80s had serial peak V O 2 measurements, their data were combined with those from individuals aged 70 to 79 years in the tables and figures. Baseline characteristics of the sample appear in Table 1 . On average, men were older and heavier than women, performed more high-intensity LTPA, and were more likely to be current smokers or never smokers.\nMaximal exercise results are shown in Table 2 . Both peak heart rate and respiratory exchange ratio were consistent with a maximal effort. Although peak V O 2 per kilogram of body weight was \u03f717% lower in women than in men, this gender difference was reduced to \u03fd4% when peak V O 2 was indexed for FFM.\nThe variables contributing significantly to prediction of peak V O 2 in milliliters per minute in the mixed-effects model are shown in the abridged Table 3 (the full set of variables is included in Table II of the Data Supplement). The mixedeffects regression equations for all variables are provided in the Data Supplement. The significant interaction terms, FAge\u03ebtime and FAge 2 \u03ebtime, allow the longitudinal change in peak V O 2 to change with first age. Similarly, the significant FAge\u03ebtime\u03ebsex interaction allows the longitudinal change in peak V O 2 to depend on both first age and gender. These effects can be clearly seen in Figure 1 . Figure 1a shows the predicted 10-year longitudinal change in peak V O 2 by gender for the 6 age decades, using the mixed-effects model, whereas the lower panel shows the 10-year predicted percent longitudinal change of peak V O 2 for each age decade compared with the respective cross-sectional age declines. A striking feature of Figure 1b is the marked difference between the per-decade cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in peak V O 2 in older age decades.

Nonsignificant effects are retained in this final model because of the presence of significant higher-order interactions. V O 2 Method is 0 for the first measurement method (before December 1990) and 1 for the second measurement method. Although cross-sectional and longitudinal declines in peak V O 2 both average \u03f75% per decade at a starting age of 30 years, the longitudinal declines per decade in women and in men aged \u054670 years are substantially greater than those predicted by cross-sectional analyses. For example, in 40year-old men, baseline peak V O 2 averaged 3114 mL/min and decreased by 260 mL/min (8.3%) over 10 years. In contrast, the 70-year-old men started with a peak V O 2 of 2244 mL/min but lost 521 mL/min (23.2%) over 10 years.\nAge-associated changes in body weight and FFM are important determinants of longitudinal changes in peak V O 2 (Table 3 ). Figure 2 illustrates the linear mixed-effects regression results of longitudinal changes in body weight ( Figure  2a ) and FFM (Figure 2b) as a function of age and gender.\nBoth body weight and FFM change differently with age in men versus women. Figure 2a shows that younger volunteers of both sexes were lighter than their middle-aged counterparts at their initial visit but experienced a much greater longitudinal increase in body weight. Figure 2b shows that FFM remained stable in younger age groups of both sexes but demonstrated an accelerating decline, starting at an age of \u03f750 years for men and 60 years for women. Because of a greater decline in FFM in older men than in older women, the gender difference in FFM narrowed with age after the fifth decade.\nBecause at least 95% of oxygen consumption during exercise occurs in exercising muscles, indexing of peak V O 2 for FFM is more physiological than the conventional indexing for body weight. Figure 3 shows the longitudinal changes in peak V O 2 adjusted for FFM. Gender curves of predicted peak V O 2 per kilogram FFM (Figure 3a) lie much closer to each other than the unadjusted ones ( Figure 1 ). For example, Figure 1 .

Over 10 years of follow-up, 40-yearold men lost an average of only 2.6 mL/kg FFM per minute (5.1%), and 40-year-old women lost 4.6 mL/kg FFM per minute (9.6%). Among those \u054670 years of age, peak V O 2 declined 17.6% over the decade from a starting value of 39.7 mL/kg FFM per minute for men and declined 17.2% in women from an initial level of 36.5 mL/kg FFM per minute. Figure 3b compares the cross-sectional and longitudinal declines in peak V O 2 , indexed for FFM. Similar to the unindexed peak V O 2 data (Figure 1a ), the decline in peak V O 2 accelerates with age, the longitudinal rate of decline being substantially greater than cross-sectional changes.\nHabitual levels of high-intensity physical activity are known to exert a significant influence on peak aerobic capacity. Higher quartiles of LTPA predict higher peak V O 2 ( Table 3 ). Figure I in the Data Supplement shows that high-intensity LTPA declines with age, so it was necessary to determine whether the contribution of this age-associated reduction in LTPA accounted for the accelerated rate of decline in peak V O 2 with advancing decades. Figure 4 shows the predicted longitudinal change in peak V O 2 for the 4 quartiles of high-intensity LTPA reported on the baseline visit, calculated from the final mixed-effects model. Sedentary individuals (Activity 0) demonstrated consistently lower baseline peak V O 2 than more active participants in all age decade curves but appeared to lose aerobic capacity at a rate similar to that of their more active age peers. Thus, even though physical activity declines with age, this decline does not account for the accelerated rate of decline in peak V O 2 in older decades. We performed the same analysis in Figure 4 restricted to participants whose LTPA quartile remained constant across all their visits (262 participants with 745 visits). In this selected subset of individuals, the effect of high LTPA group on peak V O 2 remained the same-ie, the accelerated longitudinal rate of decline of peak V O 2 with advancing age was still present regardless of absolute level of LTPA (data not shown).\nPeak V O 2 is defined by the product of maximum heart rate (MHR), stroke volume (SV), and arteriovenous oxygen difference (A\u03eapeak V O 2 diff). Although the latter 2 variables are not measured directly during routine peak V O 2 determination, the product of SV and A\u03eapeak V O 2 diff, the O 2 pulse (ie, peak V O 2 /MHR), can be derived from the measured variables. Figure 5 shows the predicted longitudinal declines in MHR, O 2 pulse, and peak V O 2 from the linear mixedeffects regression analysis in men and women. Figure 5a shows that MHR decreases over time in both sexes, with a slightly steeper slope with increasing age that is more Longitudinal and cross-sectional changes in peak V O 2 indexed for FFM by gender and age decade, predicted from the mixed-effects model. a, peak V O 2 /FFM declines progressively more steeply with advancing age, with similar declines in men and women. Note that peak V O 2 per kg FFM is only slightly higher in men than women at younger ages, converging by old age. b, Longitudinal declines in peak V O 2 /FFM accelerate dramatically with age in both genders and are substantially larger then cross-sectional changes. pronounced in women. Figure 5b shows the predicted longitudinal changes in O 2 pulse in men and women. The curves have a shape very similar to those for peak V O 2 , with progressively greater longitudinal declines with age and near convergence of the sexes by age 80 because of steeper declines in men. Figure 5c compares longitudinal declines in MHR with those in O 2 pulse and peak V O 2 in men and women. Note that the per-decade percent longitudinal decline in O 2 pulse is 2 to 3 times that of MHR in older adults and closely parallels the declines in peak V O 2 .\nTo determine the fidelity of the mixed-effects model estimates of the longitudinal rate of decline of peak V O 2 , we compared the model estimate with the calculated 10-year change from the raw data. Table 4 presents the per-decade change in peak V O 2 before and after indexing for body weight and FFM in men and women. For each gender-age decade, the pair of numbers in parentheses represents the 95% confidence intervals of the raw longitudinal change per decade; the first number is the predicted change from the mixed-effects model. The predictions from the mixed-effects model are computed by using the mean FAge for the age decade and assuming a nonsmoker with body mass index between 20 and 25; the lowest quartile of high-intensity LTPA; and absence of diabetes, ischemic ST-segment response to treadmill exercise, and cardiovascular medications. Of the 36 confidence intervals and predicted values computed, the modeled estimate lay within the confidence interval for 30 gender-age decade groups (83%). Thus, the mixed-effects model appears to provide adequate estimates of the changes in peak V O 2 when compared with the observed data. In both sexes, the longitudinal decline in peak V O 2 accelerates with age, regardless of how peak V O 2 is indexed."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study demonstrates that the longitudinal rate of decline in peak V O 2 in healthy adults over a median follow-up period of 7.9 years is not linear but accelerates dramatically with advancing decades. A similar pattern of accelerated decline with age was observed in both sexes and in all quartiles of high-intensity physical activity, and it persisted after adjusting for changes in FFM. Of note, longitudinal rates of decline in peak V O 2 in older age decades were 2-to 3-fold as great as those derived from cross-sectional analyses in these same subjects. The present sample of 435 men and 375 women ages 21 to 87 at baseline and free of clinical cardiac disease represents the largest and most heterogenous sample in which longitudinal changes in peak V O 2 have been measured.\nOur prior cross-sectional studies 4,10 showed lower absolute but similar percent declines in peak V O 2 in women versus men, a finding borne out by both the present longitudinal and cross-sectional mixed-effects model estimates and raw data analyses. Recent meta-analyses of cross-sectional data demonstrated per-decade peak V O 2 declines of 8.7% in sedentary men 9 and 10.0% in sedentary women. 8 Taken together, these data suggest similar declines with age in aerobic capacity in men and women when indexed for initial values and body composition. When expressed per kilogram of body weight, peak V O 2 was substantially higher, and its longitudinal decay greater in men than in women. However, indexing peak V O 2 for FFM rather than for body weight largely eliminated these gender differences, which indicates that changes in body composition do not totally explain the accelerated decline of peak V O 2 with advancing age.\nCross-sectional analyses, however, provide an overly optimistic estimation of the true, ie, longitudinal, changes in Figure 5 . Longitudinal changes in maximal heart rate, O 2 pulse, and peak V O 2 by gender, predicted from the mixed-effects model. a, Declines in heart rate are similar across age in men but steepen modestly with age in women. b, O 2 pulse declines progressively more steeply with age, especially in men, leading to near convergence of O 2 pulse in elderly men and women. Note the similarity of these plots to those of peak V O 2 in Figure  1a . c, The longitudinal % change per decade in maximal heart rate is only 4% to 5% per decade across the age span in both genders. In contrast, longitudinal decline in O 2 pulse accelerates progressively with age, especially in men. Note the similarity in the shape and magnitude of the decline in O 2 pulse to that of peak V O 2 . physiological processes. Each succeeding age decade represents a more highly selected group than its predecessor; thus, healthy 70-to 90-year-olds may have been physiologically superior to current 20-to 40-year-olds when they were of similar age. Indeed, cross-sectional analysis of peak V O 2 in the present cohort illustrates this concept in Figures 1, 3 , and 4 by the higher initial peak V O 2 of older cohorts compared with their \"age-matched\" counterparts at the end of the previous decade. These apparent differences between successive age cohorts account for the relatively modest crosssectional declines in peak V O 2 in both sexes because crosssectional age changes were estimated by connecting the initial data points for each age decade. Nevertheless, a constant rate of peak V O 2 loss per year, as assumed by linear regression analysis of cross-sectional peak V O 2 data, actually translates into a larger percentage yearly decline in older adults, given their lower baseline aerobic capacity than younger adults.\nThe role of habitual physical activity on the age-associated decline in peak V O 2 remains highly controversial. Prior cross-sectional 3, 6 and longitudinal studies 12, 13, 16, 17 in small, homogenous samples of competitive athletes have suggested that middle-aged and older men who continue to exercise vigorously experience significantly attenuated reductions in peak V O 2 compared with sedentary controls or athletes who stopped training. Recent cross-sectional meta-analyses, however, demonstrate no effect of training status on either absolute or relative peak V O 2 declines in men 9 and show a larger absolute but similar relative decline in peak V O 2 in endurance-trained versus sedentary women. 8 The present longitudinal data further demonstrate that greater levels of habitual physical activity, though increasing the absolute peak V O 2 at any age, do not appear to prevent the accelerated decline with advancing age.\nWe observed that the age-associated decline in MHR accelerated minimally with increasing age decades, indicating that its contribution to the accelerated decline in peak V O 2 was minor. In contrast, the rate of decline in O 2 pulse accelerated steeply with increasing age, mirroring the decline in peak V O 2 . Because O 2 pulse is the product of stroke volume and A\u03eapeak V O 2 diff, it is unclear whether cardiac or peripheral factors underlie the accelerated longitudinal decline in O 2 pulse with age. Prior data from this healthy BLSA cohort indicate that stroke volume during maximal upright cycle ergometry is preserved across age. 28 Thus, it is attractive to speculate that age-associated reduction in peripheral oxygen extraction is largely responsible for the observed accelerated rate of decline in O 2 pulse, and thus peak V O 2 , with advancing age. Whereas part of the absolute reduction in peak O 2 pulse in older persons is explicable by a reduced lean body mass, the accelerated rate of decline of peak V O 2 with advancing age decades occurs even after accounting for body composition (Figure 3 ). Potential factors implicated in the accelerated decline of peak V O 2 pulse with age include a reduced ability to deliver blood to exercising muscle 29 and changes intrinsic to the muscle itself that impair oxygen utilization. 30 The accelerated loss of aerobic capacity with advancing age has important clinical ramifications. The ability of The first number is the predicted value from the mixed-effects model, using the mean FAge for the decade and assuming a nonsmoker with body mass index between 20 and 25; the lowest quartile of high-intensity leisure-time physical activity; and absence of diabetes, ischemic ST-segment response to treadmill exercise, and cardiovascular medications. Values in parentheses for each age decade represent the 95% CI derived from the observed data.\nolder persons to function independently in the community depends largely on maintenance of sufficient aerobic capacity and muscle strength to perform daily activities. The perceived degree of effort and breathlessness of a given activity is determined by its oxygen cost relative to a person's peak V O 2 . Tasks perceived as requiring substantial effort in deconditioned individuals tend to be avoided, setting off a vicious cycle of further reduction in aerobic capacity, causing further avoidance of physical activity and further loss of muscle mass and strength. Thus, accelerated loss of aerobic capacity translates into low levels of physical activity, slow walking speeds, and early exhaustion-3 of the 5 criteria now used to define frailty. 31 Indeed, the accelerated decline in peak V O 2 with advancing age in the present sample of healthy older adults able to perform a maximal treadmill exercise test is a best-case scenario. The superimposition of chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, arthritis, and neuromuscular disorders on these \"normative\" aging decrements likely results in much larger longitudinal declines and lower levels of aerobic capacity in many older individuals than observed here.\nSome limitations of the present study should be noted. Although we demonstrate an accelerated decline in peak V O 2 across age decades by the present mixed-effects prediction model, our median follow-up period of 7.9 years is short relative to the adult aging process. Longitudinal data over 20 years or more in such a sample are needed to confirm these findings. Next, our lack of corresponding lower body strength data in these individuals precludes our assessing the role of muscle strength in the longitudinal decline of peak V O 2 . However, the strong correlation that exists between muscle strength and FFM 32 suggests that the pattern of accelerating decline in peak V O 2 with age observed here would persist after indexing for strength, just as was observed after indexing for FFM. Furthermore, multiple studies have demonstrated increases in muscular endurance but no change in peak V O 2 after resistance training, even among the elderly. [33] [34] [35] Finally, the predominantly white and upper-middle-class socioeconomic status of BLSA volunteers may not allow direct extrapolation to minorities and lower-income populations. In summary, the present findings demonstrate that longitudinal declines in peak V O 2 are not linear across adult age, as assumed by cross-sectional studies, but accelerate with successive age decades in both sexes, even after indexing for FFM. Although this accelerated rate of decline in peak V O 2 is not offset by greater physical activity, higher habitual levels of aerobic activity are accompanied by higher peak V O 2 levels at any age, an advantage that is maintained over the years. Given the importance of aerobic capacity in activities of daily living, efforts to increase and maintain higher levels of peak V O 2 , in addition to strength training, in older adults would likely improve their ability to live independently with a high quality of life."}]
