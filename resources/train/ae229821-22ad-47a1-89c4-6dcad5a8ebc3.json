[{"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "\"It is easy to forget that important Supreme Court cases involve people; it is even easier to forget they are rooted in particular places.\" Zuni and Gallup-McKinley are both located on or near tax-exempt American Indian reservations. As such, the districts are eligible to receive Impact Aid-federal funding meant to ensure that school districts are not penalized for their inability to raise revenue for education through property taxes. 3 If, however, the Department of Education determines that a state's school finance system equally distributes resources to all students, the state may offset state funding to impacted districts by the KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 56 amount each district receives in Impact Aid. 4 Such was the case for the Zuni and Gallup-McKinley school districts.\nZuni and Gallup-McKinley challenged the Secretary of Education's use of a formula to determine that New Mexico was equalized. The statutory interpretation that led to the Secretary's choice of formula was subject to Chevron review. 5 An integral element of Chevron review is to ensure that the Secretary's interpretation, and its effects, are permissible in light of congressional intent. 6 The Court's compulsion, however, to decide \"who gets to decide\" under Chevron review eclipsed any analysis of the consequences of the Secretary's interpretation and formula choice. As a result, the two districts are now forced to choose between school buildings with running water and hiring experienced teachers able to address the unique learning needs of their Native American students. Although this is the kind of penalty Congress sought to avoid through Impact Aid, the Court ignored the problem altogether. The Court's application of Chevron review in Zuni was too constraining, and produced an outcome misaligned with congressional intent.\nPart II provides the historical context for the case, including a discussion of the challenges inherent in efforts to equalize financial resources in education, New Mexico's efforts to equalize funding within the state, and the federal government's role in ensuring school finance equity through the Impact Aid program. Part II also briefly summarizes the procedural history of the case. Parts III and IV explain Chevron review and how the Court applied Chevron review to the case. Part V analyzes both the constraining nature of Chevron review in the case, and the failure of Chevron review to assist the Court in determining whether agency interpretation was permissible in light of congressional intent and agency expertise. Part V also resurrects calls for replacement of Chevron step two with arbitrary and capricious \"hard-look\" review. This change would have ensured that the Court considered relevant policy implications and the practical consequences of the Department's interpretation when determining whether to extend deference to the Secretary's decision which had such significant adverse consequences for Native American schoolchildren in New Mexico.

School Finance Equity", "text": "The dispute about the equity of New Mexico's school finance system and the appropriateness of the Secretary's equalization formula is a recent development in the long history of battles regarding education and school finance equity. 7 Although the details of school finance systems vary from state to state, most states generally delegate responsibility for raising revenue to individual districts. 8 A district's ability to raise revenue for its schools is usually determined by the wealth of its tax base. Thus, disparities in property wealth yield disparities in educational funding. The role of the state is typically as a partner, ensuring minimum education needs are met.\nStates essentially guarantee inequalities in funding by allowing districts to raise revenue locally for education, particularly when a state has not adopted an equalization program. As such, some school districts become \"enclaves of affluence,\" while other districts are left with minimal fiscal strength. 9 These enclaves have become adept at convincing legislatures that their advantage is justified, leading some scholars to note that the public school system in the United States is not public, but rather \"quasi-public\" or \"quasi-private.\" 10 In this quasipublic system, the interests of wealthier districts are insulated, geographically defined, and protected by state legislatures that refuse to enact school funding programs to equalize resources."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "State court challenges to education financing systems that perpetuate these inequalities proliferated in the aftermath of San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 12 where the Court held that disparities caused by school systems that relied on property taxes were not violations of the United States Constitution because education is not a fundamental right. 13 At the heart of these challenges is concern for the ways in which education finance resources are distributed, and the relationship between spending and student achievement. Several equity principles can be utilized when assessing the distribution of resources, including horizontal equity, vertical equity, and adequacy. Horizontal equity provides that students who are alike should be treated alike, and requires that all students receive equal shares of local and state revenue per pupil. 14 Several statistics assess the level of horizontal equity within a state, including the federal range ratio. 15 The federal range ratio, also referred to as a restricted range ratio, is the formula included in the text of the Impact Aid statute. 16 Vertical equity accounts for the reality that some students need or deserve more services than others, and that providing more services requires more funding. 17 Accordingly, achieving vertical equity requires identifying characteristics that can be used as a basis for distributing additional resources to certain students, or the programs and school districts that educate those students. 18 Student characteristics that justify additional funding include physical or mental disabilities, educational disadvantages stemming from a low-income background, or limited English proficiency. 19 District characteristics that justify additional funding might include, for example, unique transportation costs associated with very large, or very small, districts. 20 School program characteristics, such as vocational programs or magnet schools, may also warrant additional resources. 21 Finally, adequacy is defined as \"the provision of a set of strategies, programs, curriculum, and instruction, with appropriate adjustments for special-needs students, districts, and schools, and their full financing, that is sufficient to teach students to high standards.\" 22 To the extent that adequacy addresses how much is required to educate students based on each student's individual need, adequacy can be partially addressed 14 "}, {"section_title": "2007] BREAKING FREE OF CHEVRON'S CONSTRAINTS 151", "text": "through a combination of horizontal and vertical equity. 23 At the same time, adequacy also addresses the relationship between educational inputs and educational outputs. Educational inputs include \"programs, curriculum, and instruction that are sufficient to teach students to high standards,\" while outputs include \"the measurement of the achievement that results.\" 24 Considering the link between equity and adequacy is integral to ensuring equal educational opportunities for all students. 25 The concept of adequacy, however, has not been without debate. Some have argued that there is no consistent relationship between money input and achievement output, and that to obtain more money for education is simply \"throwing good money after bad.\" 26 This \"production-function\" 27 critique of school finance has its origins in the Coleman report, 28 which was interpreted as indicating that schools have little influence on student achievement independent of family background and social context."}, {"section_title": "29", "text": "The production-function model, however, has been criticized as inadequate when applied to the education system. 30 Moreover, methodological flaws in the research underlying the Coleman report have rendered the report's conclusions a result of flawed 23 . The two concepts of adequacy and equity are often considered interchangeable, particularly in school finance reform litigation where remedies can be justified based on either concept. See Underwood, supra note 7, at 513\u221219 (equating adequacy and vertical equity). But see William The production-function model was first developed and applied to industry. Problems with applying the model to education include confusion about the relevant unit of production (individual pupil, classroom, school, or school district), and whether the chosen unit of production is \"maximizing academic achievement or some other output.\" Id. at 356. Moreover, studies that apply the model do not identify an underlying theory of learning that defines the relationship between school inputs and academic achievement. Id. For example, the studies all \"assume that teacher inputs can be measured by teacher characteristics,\" including education, experience and aptitude, and ignore the way in which these characteristics are actually implicated in the teaching-learning process.\nId analysis, and an inaccurate reflection of the \"underlying behavioral reality.\" 31 Since then, several production-function studies addressed the flaws inherent when the model is applied to education, and found: (1) \"[i]f family income [cannot] be changed, improvement in school outputs require[s] dramatic increases in inputs or significant changes in resource combinations;\" (2) schools are incapable of improving the life outcomes of minorities without changing inefficiencies in expenditures for teacher experience and additional education; and (3) \"money is important in producing higher student test scores when it purchases teachers with strong literacy skills, reduces class size to eighteen students per teacher, retains experienced teachers, and increases the number of teachers with advanced degrees.\" 32 These conclusions indicate that school finance is linked to student academic achievement.\nDespite the ongoing debate, it is obvious to most that, at the very minimum, money can buy educational resources like instructional materials and equipment, new facilities, and increases in the number of highly trained teachers. It is also clear that communities, wealthy and poor alike, value the opportunities that additional money can buy. Indeed, Coons, Clune and Sugarman stated it best when they wrote:\nWe regard the fierce resistance by rich districts to reform as adequate testimonial to the relevance of money. Whatever it is that money may be thought to contribute to the education of children, that commodity is something highly prized by those who enjoy the greatest measure of it. If money is inadequate to improve education, the residents of poor districts should at least have an equal opportunity to be disappointed by its failure. 33 If one agrees that differences in funding do affect the quality of education, it is clear that inequalities in the resources of school districts produce a wide range of educational opportunities afforded to students. It is a question of basic fairness to ensure that students are not penalized in terms of their education just because they are born into a family that is neither wealthy nor fortunate enough to live in a wealthy district. This issue, and the responsibility of a state to address it, is at the heart of the Zuni case.

Like most states that depend on local taxes to fund public schools, differences in wealth among New Mexico's local education agencies (LEAs) 34 have led to inequity in school funding. New Mexico has faced considerable challenges in its effort to address this inequity, including differences in the depth of district tax bases, poverty levels, and enrollment figures.\nOverall, New Mexico ranks forty-eighth out of fifty states in per capita personal income, with 23.78% of public school age children living in poverty. 35 The percent of school-age children living in poverty in the Los Alamos Public School District, however, is a considerably lower 2.53%. 36 In contrast, the percentage of school-age children living in poverty in Zuni Public School District is 48.22%; the percentage in Gallup-McKinley Public School District is 37.11%. 37 In forty-nine of New Mexico's eighty-nine LEAs, the percentage is 25% or higher; twenty-six LEAs have percentages over 30%, and seven LEAs have percentages over 40%."}, {"section_title": "38", "text": "Variations in the number of students enrolled in schools across the state have also impeded efforts to equalize funding.

Rodriguez, 44 a group of plaintiffs in New Mexico filed a lawsuit alleging that the state's education finance system, in which school funding expenditures varied widely based on the wealth of each school district, was in violation of New Mexico's constitution. 45 The case settled before trial when New Mexico implemented the 1974 Public School Finance Act, which required the state to fund the operational costs of all school districts. 46 The Act's funding formula is based on a model developed by the National Education Finance Project in the late 1960s and early 1970s, 47 and includes a \"state equalization guarantee distribution.\""}, {"section_title": "48", "text": "The distribution is \"that amount of money distributed to each school district to ensure that the school district's operating revenue, including its local and federal revenues . . . is at least equal to the school district's program cost.\"\n49 \"Program cost\" is defined as the amount of money determined under New Mexico's funding formula \"to be necessary for a given district with a particular configuration of students and educational programs to provide educational services.\""}, {"section_title": "50", "text": "The funding formula determines each district's program cost by using cost differentials to calculate the price associated with providing educational services to students with differing needs. 51 The inclusion of these cost differentials 42 . 31.1% of public-school students in the state are classified as \"Anglo;\" 54% are classified as Hispanic; 11.1% are classified as Native American; 2.5% are classified as Black; and 1.3% are classified as Asian.

BALL & GARCIA, supra note 50, at 5. A district's training and experience index is based on the academic classifications and the experience levels of teachers in the district. The Federal government has recognized the impediment that taxexempt federal lands, such as Indian reservations, can pose to an LEA's efforts to raise money for public schools through property taxes. Congress addressed this problem by enacting the Impact Aid program in 1950. 63 The program provides funding to those school districts with compromised ability to levy taxes in support of public schools due to the presence of tax-exempt federal property within the district."}, {"section_title": "64", "text": "The program also provides federal funds to local school districts to assist with the costs of providing \"educational services to federally connected children.\" 65 \"Federally connected children\" are defined as those children whose parents are in the military, children who reside on Indian lands or federal property, and children whose parents are employed on federal property. When Congress amended the Impact Aid statute to allow states to consider Impact Aid payments as long as the state ensured that operational expenditures were equalized among LEAs, the job of determining whether a state was \"equalized\" was left to the Secretary of Education.\n71 Accordingly, the Secretary promulgated regulations, the appendix of which outlined several steps for determining whether a state was equalized.

New Mexico noted that the Secretary historically maintained three regulatory options under which a state could qualify as equalized, and that it was at the Secretary's request that Congress even altered the Impact Aid regulatory scheme in 1994. 160 In fact, the Secretary drafted what would become the language of the reenacted Impact Aid program, and that language suggested an equalization method would be placed in the appendix. 161 As such, despite the language of the statute, it would be illogical to believe that the Department was rejecting its own disparity test, or advocating that Congress adopt a disparity test based on a formula the Secretary had already rejected in 1976. 162 Rather, the Secretary's intent to include a weighted ranking in the equalization formula based on student population was imputed to Congress. 163 Moreover, New Mexico argued that the statutory scheme as a whole supports the Secretary's interpretation as illustrated by the fact that Impact Aid awards are calculated using a method which considers the pupil population of an LEA. 164 Finally, Petitioners' formula removed only ten LEAs for purposes of determining equalization. 165 According to New Mexico, the results of Petitioners' formula amounted to an insignificant portion of the student population and failed to completely eliminate anomalous outliers. 166 The Department of Education, as federal respondent, made an additional statutory construction argument in support of the Secretary's interpretation. The same Act through which Congress enacted Impact Aid also enacted the Education Finance Incentive Grant Program (EFIG To be sure, the language of the EFIG statute makes reference only to the body of the Impact Aid regulations, and makes no reference to the weighted ranking requirement included in the appendix of the regulations. 170 Nevertheless, the Department of Education considered the reference to Impact Aid regulations as encompassing the appendix, and argued that Congress could not be considered to have explicitly endorsed the Secretary's Impact Aid formula for EFIG, but implicitly prohibited it under the Impact Aid program."}, {"section_title": "171", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "B.

The fact that only three states, New Mexico, Kansas, and Alaska, even aspire to prove equalized funding for purposes of Impact Aid 199 begs the question of why the Secretary cannot make determinations of equality on a case-by-case basis, thus avoiding the problem of potentially masking funding inequalities.\nOral argument, which focused almost entirely on the doctrinal parameters of Chevron review, did not fare any better than the briefs. The hour largely mirrored briefs submitted in the case, and was limited to the question of whether Congress actually spoke to the precise question at issue, debates on what could be gleaned from legislative history, and the definition of the word \"percentile.\" 200 The latter topic created mass confusion among the Justices. 201 The Court's majority and dissenting opinions continued the trend, analyzing congressional intent, and completely ignoring questions of equity.\nThe nearly exclusive focus on the purely doctrinal aspects of Chevron review in the case was overwhelmingly constraining. The parties' efforts to decide \"who gets to decide\" led to a complete failure to understand the policy implications of the formulas at the level where it counts-public school education in New Mexico. The constraints of Chevron review also eclipsed an opportunity for the Department to prove that its decision-making process was comprehensive, that it brought agency expertise to bear in making a decision, and that congressional goals were achieved through the Department's interpretation.\nThe narrow presentation of the case was particularly problematic as the Court proceeded to step two of Chevron analysis. Conflicting but equally plausible interpretations of the plain language and legislative history of the Impact Aid statute allowed the majority to determine that Congress did not speak directly to the question at issue. 202 203 At the second prong of review, the Court was tasked with determining whether the Secretary engaged in a \"permissible\" interpretation of the Impact Aid statute. Unable to glean a clear answer from legislative history or plain meaning of the statute, the determination of whether the interpretation was \"permissible\" should have involved an inquiry into whether the effects of the Secretary's interpretation were in line with congressional intent upon enacting Impact Aid. 204 Once there, however, the Court had insufficient information to properly determine whether the Secretary's decision-making process was thorough, and whether the Secretary's interpretation, in both theory and practice, furthered congressional intent."}, {"section_title": "A.

The statute was amended in 1974 with the intent of avoiding duplicative compensation to LEAs impacted by federal lands. 210 The statute accomplishes all three goals by providing aid to LEAs while also allowing states to consider the aid received by LEAs if the Secretary considers that state equalized."}, {"section_title": "211", "text": "True to its original purpose, Impact Aid goes to many school districts on or near American Indian reservations. The Aid often comprises significant portions of these school districts' budgets, 212 and helps the districts address unique learning challenges faced by Native American schoolchildren. When cuts to Impact Aid are made, school districts on or near tribal lands often suffer the most, prompting Senator Tom Daschle to note that cuts to Impact Aid make it \"harder for Native Americans to receive [the] high quality education they deserve.\" 213 In the aftermath of Aid cuts, school districts like the Lapwai School District in Idaho, located within the Nez Perce Indian Reservation, have to choose between paying for extra academic programs that help students excel academically and making desperately needed capital improvements. 214.

New Mexico's capital outlay funding system, which has previously been declared unconstitutional due to a failure to abide by the state constitution's \"uniformity clause,\" 221 is continually being monitored by a New Mexico District Court. Through the Public School Capital Outlay Act, the state evaluates the adequacy of facilities in each district and provides funding for facilities based upon relative need."}, {"section_title": "222", "text": "Wealthier districts with higher bonding and taxing capacities, however, are also able to approve additional local property levies, and issue general obligation bonds to independently raise additional resources for capital improvements. In addition, districts with political clout may be able to obtain direct legislative appropriations for capital outlay projects, as was the case Additional funding is also needed to provide housing and salary incentives for teachers in the two districts. 227 In Zuni, where districtprovided housing is often the only option for school employees who are not tribal members, teachers make do with trailer homes. 228 Educators living in the trailers have had to deal with raw sewage backing up into their homes, or deteriorated construction which in one trailer led to a toilet literally falling through the floor. 229 To compound hiring problems, New Mexico's education funding system makes additional payments to those districts that employ advanced-degree teachers. 230 But in districts like Zuni or Gallup-McKinley that depend on national programs like Teach for America to recruit recent college graduates to teach, rural isolation and poor conditions compromise the districts' ability to hire and retain highly-qualified teachers. 231 The result is that wealthier and more desirable districts easily retain their teachers and receive additional funding to support their higher salaries, while the impacted districts do not receive additional funding, but nevertheless have to pay higher salaries to attract instructors. Zuni Superintendent Kaye Peery notes that additional funding is desperately needed to attract and retain highlyqualified teachers for the rural district. Accordingly, the Secretary's formula may allow New Mexico to ignore not a problem of horizontal equity, but one of vertical equity and adequacy. New Mexico's funding formula does result in per-pupil expenditures that are equalized on paper. For the 2000 fiscal year, a perpupil revenue of $3320 placed Zuni at thirteenth in a ranking of districts throughout the state. 233 Although the first ranked Mosquero district still had approximately $3200 more in per-pupil revenues, Zuni's per-pupil expenditure for that year was just above the mean of $3192.08. 234 Nevertheless, the unique needs of impacted districts populated by Native American students warrant additional funding in order to successfully provide adequate educations that result in academic achievement.\nAlthough New Mexico's funding formula does use cost differentials, the hardships suffered by both districts suggest that the formula fails to account for the districts' significant academic, recruiting, and facilities challenges. The funding formula does not, for example, account for the 330 housing units that Gallup-McKinley must provide for its teachers."}, {"section_title": "235", "text": "As one Zuni school board member said, \"educating a student here is not the same as in Albuquerque. It takes a little bit more.\"\n236 If both the Zuni and Gallup-McKinley districts had received Impact Aid for the 2005-06 school year without a corresponding decrease in their state equalization distributions, the districts would have received an additional $4.6 million and $15.6 million, respectively. 237 This would have allowed them to implement special academic support programs and make needed capital improvements. This additional funding would not be the \"duplicative\" compensation that Congress sought to prevent, but the supplemental funding needed by the districts to educate its students in a way that is comparable to other districts in the state with fewer special needs. Moreover, as admitted by New Mexico Education Secretary Veronica Garcia, the $50 million loss incurred by the state due to the inability to take credit for Impact Aid payments is insignificant, As has been illustrated, state aid which supplements a district's shallow tax base may fall far short of the amount needed to educate underachieving, isolated students in a district with deteriorating facilities. Accordingly, the Department of Education cannot use horizontal equity measures alone to accurately assess whether a state's funding system provides enough to meet the fair cost of adequately educating students with special needs. Yet, this is precisely what the Department of Education's equalization formula does. Technically referred to as a \"restricted range ratio,\" 241 the Department's practice of comparing revenue at the ninety-fifth and fifth percentiles assesses the degree of horizontal equity. This is true whether percentile cut-offs are based on the number of LEAs or student population. As such, the formula fails to account for vertical equity or adequacy in New Mexico. 242 Arguably, the Secretary has little control over the equalization formula preferred by Congress. Congressional language mandates the restricted range ratio, and the Secretary cannot independently replace the ratio with a formula that takes better account of vertical equity. The Secretary can, however, consider the consequences of both versions of the restricted range ratio in light of congressional intent. Without the additional aid, Zuni and Gallup-McKinley are forced to address the very situation Congress intended to prevent: an inability to effectively address achievement gaps, maintain adequate facilities, or attract qualified teachers because of the presence of tax-exempt federal lands in the school district. This consequence suggests that use of the harder-to-meet equalization formula, which bases percentile cut-offs on the number of 239.

Most teachers are not familiar with the substantive provisions of the federal programs that regulate their schools, and non-compliance is not considered outside the norm. In contrast, when FDA issues rules regarding medication, the norm is that doctors will become immediately aware of those rules, that there will be a high degree of compliance, and that the agency will be ready to take remedial action should it discover regulations have not been followed. should understand the methodological flaws inherent in the formula it uses to determine equalization among the states. The \"restricted range ratio\" 265 compares revenue at the ninety-fifth and fifth percentiles to assess the degree of horizontal equity in a state school system. The ratio, however, only measures two extreme points in a data set. As such, the restricted range ratio is a poor indicator for assessing the degree of equity in an entire education system, 266 and fails to provide information concerning the entire distribution of per-pupil revenues. As a result, the formula is limited in its ability to detect inequity in a school finance system, 267 and fails to consider the amount of vertical equity needed to provide adequate education for all students.\nAlthough the Secretary cannot mandate the use of an alternate formula, the Secretary can use its understanding of the methodological flaws in the formulas, and the context of equalization in New Mexico, to make a decision about which formula to use. The Secretary is aware that once deemed equalized, a state is likely to reduce its funding to impacted districts by the amount of Aid received by those districts. The Department must also be aware that it is precisely those districts with compromised taxing capabilities that are most likely to be affected when a state exercises its option to offset Impact Aid. Moreover, it is foreseeable that impacted districts populated by Native American students are more likely to have special needs that warrant additional funding to ensure adequacy. In light of the context of equalization in New Mexico, and the knowledge that the formula which bases percentile cut-offs on student population is particularly problematic in New Mexico, the Secretary should have considered using the equalization formula which was harder for New Mexico to meet. The easier standard made it possible for New Mexico to qualify as an equalized state, but resulted in denying additional funding to those students who need it the most. Of course, it is possible that the Department considered the consequences of applying both versions of the equalization formula, and nevertheless decided that its formula was the best option.

The Court and the parties before it, however, could have been released from the constraints of traditional Chevron review and freed to consider these concerns if the Department was required to justify the validity of its statutory interpretation. By requiring the agency to address the policy implications of its interpretation, to illustrate that its interpretation would not result in consequences that clash with congressional intent, and to prove that its decision-making process was thorough, the Court could have avoided rubber-stamping an agency decision that warranted a more rigorous review.\nInsisting that agencies justify their reasoning and policy decisions to a court is hardly a new idea. When reviewing informal agency rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA) \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard, 282 courts have invoked a standard of review that extends deference to the agency but also mandates a \"substantial inquiry\" into the facts. 283 Although a court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency, and the agency's decision is entitled to a \"presumption of regularity,\" 284 a substantial inquiry into whether the decision was made based on consideration of all relevant factors is still required. 285 In elaborating on this standard, the D.C. Circuit has written that close scrutiny of evidence, particularly in complex matters, is meant to educate the court, as the court must understand \"enough about the problem confronting the agency to comprehend the meaning of the evidence relied upon and the evidence discarded; the questions addressed by the agency and those bypassed; the choices open to the agency and those made.\" 286 In this way, a court can determine whether the agency decision was \"rational and based on consideration of the relevant factors.\" 287 "}, {"section_title": "2007] BREAKING FREE OF CHEVRON'S CONSTRAINTS 189", "text": "The application of arbitrary and capricious review is not without challenge, and has been subject to critiques that it contributes to the \"ossification\" of informal rulemaking. 288 According to this critique, arbitrary and capricious review, particularly as performed in the D.C. Circuit, is both too intensive and too costly. 289 To pass the arbitrary and capricious review to which informal rules may be subject under the APA, an agency must explain its reasoning in excruciating detail, respond to every comment, and anticipate which issues will be of most concern to a reviewing court. 290 Moreover, even when agencies take these steps, there is only a 50% chance their process will pass review.\n291 Faced with this daunting task, agencies have become reluctant to use the informal rulemaking process, despite the advantages of prior notice and public participation that informal rulemaking provides."}, {"section_title": "292", "text": "In response to the critiques, scholars and judges alike argue that the effects of arbitrary and capricious review do not warrant any changes in standard. Judge Wald has written that when applying arbitrary and capricious review, courts merely seek \"to ensure that the agencies do what Congress has told them to do and that they exercise discretionary power in a reasonable fashion.\" 293 Additionally, Professor William S. Jordan has found that agency regulatory programs have continued despite failing arbitrary and capricious challenges, and that when rules were remanded under arbitrary and capricious review, agencies tended to recover quickly. KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 56\nDespite the on-going debate, \"hard-look\" 295 arbitrary and capricious review has long been thought to overlap substantially with the second step of Chevron review. Judge Laurence Silberman, a D.C. Circuit Court judge, first noted in 1988 that the second step of Chevron is \"not all that different analytically from the APA's arbitrary and capricious review,\" and that both require a court to ask whether the agency considered and weighed the factors that Congress envisioned it would. 296 Since then, judges have noted the places in which the two doctrines converge and diverge. The D.C. Circuit, the tribunal that hears a significant number of challenges to agency action, 297 has issued a line of opinions that have highlighted the distinction between the two doctrines, including Arent v. Shalala.\n298 Arent noted that although Chevron review and arbitrary and capricious review \"overlap at the margins,\" the two doctrines ask different questions: step two of Chevron review asks \"whether an agency has authority to act under a statute,\" while arbitrary and capricious review asks whether the discharge of that authority was reasonable.\" 299 Similarly, Texas Office of Public Utility Counsel v. FCC, 300 a Fifth Circuit case, has also drawn the distinction, noting that \"'arbitrary and capricious' review under the APA differs from Chevron step two review because it focuses on the reasonability of the agency's decision-making processes rather than on the reasonability of its interpretation.\" 297. Levin, supra note 117, at 1256 (noting that the D.C. Circuit is the forum with the \"greatest frontline responsibility for judicial review of agency action\").\n298 emphasis would be on the second step instead of the first, and would \"[force] agencies to explain why their interpretations are good policy in light of the purposes and concerns underlying the statutory scheme\" in question. 303 Professor Seidenfeld likens this revamped second prong to the D.C. Circuit's arbitrary and capricious \"hard look\" test, and envisions encouraging courts to require \"agencies to identify those concerns that the statute addresses and explain how the agency's interpretation took those concerns into account.\"\n304 Moreover, the agency would be forced to explain \"why it emphasized certain interests\" instead of others, and be required to address \"contentions that its interpretation will have deleterious implications.\" 305 Going even further, Professor Ronald Levin has argued that while step one of Chevron review should encompass all traditional tools of statutory construction, 306 step two of Chevron review should be replaced entirely with arbitrary and capricious review."}, {"section_title": "307", "text": "Professor Levin characterized the second step of Chevron review as vague, 308 verging on internal incoherence, 309 and potentially redundant. 310 Replacing step two with arbitrary and capricious review would transform the second prong from being overly deferential to being a credible step in Chevron review that ensures an agency's decision \"is not only consistent with congressional intent, but also socially responsible.\" 306. This includes textual and non-textual statutory interpretation, statutory structure and purpose, and legislative history.\n307. Levin, supra note 117, at 1254. 308. See id. at 1260 (\"The Court initially framed step two as a question of whether the agency's interpretation is 'permissible,' but that phrasing was circular: obviously an interpretation that is not permitted is prohibited, but on what grounds would the Court refuse to 'permit' an interpretation?\").\n309. See id. at 1260-61 (\"Under the structure of the Chevron formula, a court should not reach step two unless it has already found during step one that the statute supports the government's interpretation or at least is ambiguous with respect to it. In other words, the agency's view is not clearly contrary to the meaning of the statute. If the court has made such a finding, one would think that the government's interpretation must be at least 'reasonable' in the court's eyes. Why, then, is the second step not superfluous?\").\n310.

KANSAS LAW REVIEW [Vol. 56\ndeference to a Department of Labor opinion letter that was not promulgated subject to formal rulemaking procedures. 312 In Mead, a tariff classification ruling by the United States Customs Service was similarly denied deference because of the lack of formal procedures and the sheer volume of tariff classification rulings issued by the department; rulings \"churned out at a rate of 10,000 a year at an agency's 46 scattered offices\" simply could not have the force of law. 313 This was so, despite ambiguity in the relevant administering statute, and the authoritativeness of the agency's position regarding that ambiguity. 314 In FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 315 the Court denied deference to the FDA's assertion of jurisdiction over tobacco products because it involved a policy question that Congress could not have intended for the agency to address unilaterally. 316 Moreover, Barnhart v. Walton suggests that Chevron deference will not always be given uniformly, but will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. 317 Similarly, substitution of arbitrary and capricious review for the second prong of Chevron would deny agencies automatic deference in the face of statutory ambiguity, in an effort to require agencies to justify their decisions and encourage courts to perform nuanced and detailed reviews of the processes used to make those decisions. In the Zuni case, such a detailed look might have denied deference for an agency interpretation motivated by an arguably reasonable, if impractical in application, methodological intent. Nevertheless, the implementation of arbitrary and capricious review in the Chevron framework has significant benefits. Such an application would strengthen the overly deferential nature of the second prong, transforming it into a test which genuinely ensures that agency action is aligned with congressional intent. Moreover, it would remove the artificial distinction drawn between the legal interpretations usually associated with Chevron review, and the reasoned decision-making usually associated with arbitrary and capricious review. At the heart of arbitrary and capricious review is careful examination of an agency's reasoning process; an evaluation, therefore, of the conclusions an agency drew from its interpretation of a statute during its reasoning process is a necessary and integral part of arbitrary and capricious review. 318 Equating step two of Chevron review with arbitrary and capricious review would also deter a court's inclination to review the decisionmaking process employed by an agency without any regard to the policy consequences of that agency's decision. The questionable policy consequences of an agency's interpretation should be among the factors a court considers when reviewing the decision-making process."}, {"section_title": "319", "text": "A decision with absurd, short-sighted, or nonsensical consequences necessarily calls into question the decision-making process, and should prompt the court to require an agency explanation addressing how such a decision resulted from a supposedly rational procedure."}, {"section_title": "D. Applying \"Hard-Look\" Review to Zuni", "text": "Although Respondents framed the issue as one of simple deference to the Department of Education's choice of methodology, Zuni involved the much broader topic of public school finance and how it affects equal access to educational opportunities. Unfortunately, traditional Chevron review constrained the parties' opportunities to educate the Court on the practical effects of the Secretary's formula, thus denying the Court an opportunity to make a proper determination of permissibility at step two of Chevron review. To be sure, wrangling during oral argument and in the briefs about the definition of the word \"percentile\" was important in identifying the intent behind the Impact Aid program, but that determination should not have been made in isolation from a review of the practical effects of a chosen definition. Moreover, there was scant evidence that the agency used its expertise regarding the academic challenges faced by Native American schoolchildren or the methodological weaknesses inherent in the equalization formulas at issue to make a decision in the case.\nReplacing the highly deferential second prong of Chevron review with the \"hard-look\" of arbitrary and capricious review would have required the Justices to \"steep themselves in agency policy and the substantive debate framing the issue,\" 320 and would have given the Department an opportunity to explain why its interpretation was good policy in light of the Impact Aid program's purpose. Levin's model provides the appropriate structure for such a change to Chevron review. At step one of Chevron review, the Court should use all tools of statutory interpretation to determine whether Congress has indeed spoken to the question at issue. In the Zuni case, tools of statutory interpretation did not yield a clear answer: the plain language did not address whether Congress intended for the Department to weight LEAs based on population when ranking those same LEAs in order of per-pupil expenditure; 322 legislative history could have been interpreted both for and against the agency; and review of the statutory scheme in which Impact Aid exists was inconclusive. As a result, the case should have gone to step two of Chevron review.\nArbitrary and capricious review at step two of Chevron review would have resulted in a more nuanced and holistic review of the Secretary's interpretation, starting with a review of process. Such a review would have asked why, for instance, the Department declined to engage in formal notice-and-comment procedures when the statutory language of Impact Aid changed in the 1994 re-authorization. The Court could have also required the Department to detail the alternatives that were considered. For instance, in light of the participation of just three states in the Impact Aid program, did the agency consider making equalization determinations on a case-by-case basis so as to avoid masking un-equalized funding schemes? Alternatively, instead of insisting that its interpretation was the only way to address outliers, could the Department have instead relied on \u00a7 7709(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the statute, which directed the Secretary to consider the costs of unique school districts in its equalization determinations?\nMoreover, did the Department consider the potential inability of its own methodology to fail to remove district outliers?\nStep two arbitrary and capricious review would have also encouraged the Court to consider the practical consequences of the Department's interpretation, and whether those consequences are in contrast to congressional intent underlying Impact Aid. What will be the effect of the Department's interpretation on educational funding for students in New Mexico? In direct contradiction to congressional intent, does the Secretary's interpretation negatively affect students impacted by a federal presence in their school district? Does the interpretation allow 322. Arguably, Congress did not have to speak to this question because it used language explicitly stating that LEAs are to be ranked based on per-pupil expenditure alone. In light, however, of the Secretary's use of weighted ranking prior to 1994, and because of the inconclusive results of legislative history and statutory construction review, a more nuanced review at step two is warranted.\na state to mask a funding system that is not genuinely equalized? In light of evidence that the answer to the last two questions is \"yes,\" why did the Secretary insist on using the agency's easier-to-meet equalization standard?\nFinally, arbitrary and capricious \"hard-look\" review at step two of Chevron review would have addressed the tension regarding agency expertise. Neither submitted briefs nor oral argument in the case suggested that the agency brought expertise regarding education of Native American schoolchildren, methodological flaws inherent in restricted range ratios, or statistical infirmities in the Department's own interpretation to bear in making a decision. 323 Not only would arbitrary and capricious review have allowed the Department to illustrate the extent to which its expertise informed the Secretary's interpretation, but the review would have also provided for the appropriate deference once that illustration was made. After all, arbitrary and capricious review does not allow a Court to substitute its judgment for that of the agency, but rather ensures that a decision was made based on consideration of all relevant factors required to make a decision that both falls within the agency's scope of authority, and heeds the original intent of Congress. 324 Although comedic, the quote illustrates that the Justices were not presented with sufficient information to properly determine at step two of Chevron review whether the Secretary's interpretation was made with the expertise that Congress intended the Department use, or whether the interpretation was in furtherance of congressional intent. To avoid this problem in the future, step two of Chevron review should be fortified with the standards of arbitrary and capricious review so that the Supreme Court itself, or a lower court on remand, can properly consider agency process, policy consequences, pursuit of congressional intent, and agency expertise when 323. The Department did not maintain specific expertise on its part but did argue that \"[t]he uniform view of practitioners in the field of education finance . . . is that a disparity test like the one in the Impact Aid statute must take into account the number of pupils served by an LEA.\" Brief for the Federal Respondent, supra note 71, at 17. The Department did not elaborate, however, on whether such an application is reasonable if it eliminates twenty-five percent of LEAs in New Mexico.\n324.
