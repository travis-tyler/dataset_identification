They want to write the first day they attend school. This is no accident. Before they went to school they marked up walls, pavements, newspapers with crayons, chalk, pens or pencils\u2026anything that makes a mark.\nThe child's marks say, \"I am\" (p. 3).\nIt is important as educators to foster this natural desire, not only because children want and need to express themselves, but also because writing ability has been found to be a key indicator of school success and successful participation in the workplace (Graham, Harris, Fink, & MacArthur, 2001; Norman & Spencer, 2005) . NAEYC (National Association for the Education of Young Children; 2009) defines early childhood as the years from birth through age 8 and suggests that early childhood standards are meant to support teacher preparation of professionals.\nThe National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) report card on writing does not report writing scores for children in this age range, but the scores reported for older children indicate a deficiency in the preparation of writing teachers at the early childhood level and beyond. In 2007, NAEP reported that only 33% of eighth graders in America scored at or above proficient in the area of writing (Norman & Spencer, 2005) . Although fourth graders were not included in the latest 2007 NAEP writing report, the low Writing Development over Time 2 percentage of eighth graders (33%) at a proficient level continues to discourage early childhood writing teachers (Salahu-Din, Persky, & Miller, 2008) .\nThe National Commission on Writing for America's Families, Schools, and Colleges was established in 2002 to focus national attention on the teaching and learning of writing. The first report issued by this commission was titled The Neglected \"R\": The Need for a Writing Revolution (Sterling 2003) . The goal driving this report was to focus attention on the importance of writing for all students in the 21 st century. The report recommended increasing writing time substantially and providing resources to make increased instructional time possible (Sterling, 2003) . The National Commission on\nWriting web site describes this report's recommendations along with resources to help teachers achieve these goals (http://www.writingcommission.org/). Richard Sterling, past director of the National Writing Project, suggests that policy statements and classroom practice are not often closely linked. He believes that it is the creative and thoughtful ideas of teachers that drive the shift towards making writing a priority in early childhood classrooms (Sterling, 2003) .\nDespite national concerns about the importance of writing instruction, little emphasis is placed on teaching writing in most teacher education programs. Although there is a strong research base that recommends the integration of reading and writing (Skeans, 2000) , most teacher certification programs spend the majority of their time focusing on reading instruction and ignoring the importance of preparing teachers to provide writing instruction (Norman & Spencer, 2005) .\nAccording to constructivist theory, preservice teachers' beliefs (i.e., those that influence how they conceptualize teaching) are well-established and resistant to change Writing Development over Time 3\nby the time they enter college (Cross, 2009; Ng, Nicholas, & Williams, 2010) . Although preservice teachers do not receive as much coursework that emphasizes teaching writing to children as they do for teaching reading, they do enter teacher education programs with years of their own writing experiences from their K-12 educations while having observed many examples of writing instruction. These early experiences help shape beliefs and attitudes towards writing and often determine the pedagogical decisions made by new teachers with regard to writing instruction (Norman & Spencer, 2005; Street, 2003) .\nExamining the writing histories of preservice teachers is critical because beliefs and attitudes can have an effect on future teacher performance and student outcomes (Robinson & Adkins, 2004) . In their theory of reasoned action, Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) describe a strong chain of connections that show the evolution of beliefs to attitudes, attitudes to intentions and finally, intentions to actions. Since beliefs and attitudes have been clearly linked to teacher actions (Weinburg, 2007) , understanding the epistemological beliefs of preservice teachers can provide insight into ways of improving teacher writing instruction (Ng et al., 2010) .\nAlthough preservice teachers' beliefs about writing are well-established by the time they enter teacher education programs, promising research has been conducted that suggests their beliefs are evolving and that it is possible to help them develop into \"selfregulated, critically reflective professionals\" (Ng et al., 2010, p. 278) . Courses aimed at influencing the beliefs of preservice teachers have many features in common that help produce desirable change including teachers actually engaging in writing, examining and reflecting on their current beliefs about writing, reflecting on their practice teaching, Writing Development over Time 4 participating in collaborative group work, and learning about alternative teaching models (Beswick, 2006) .\nAs teacher educators strive to help preservice teachers examine and possibly change their beliefs, they not only help develop reflective teachers, but they also help develop teachers with a strong sense of efficacy. Graham et al. (2001) describe teachers' sense of efficacy as the confidence that they can perform actions that lead to student learning. In order to carry out tasks successfully, teachers must also believe in their abilities to accomplish desired outcomes (Tschannen-Moran & McMaster, 2009 ).\nTeachers make judgments of their self-efficacy based on verbal encouragement that they have received, the success or failure of teacher models, perceptions of past experiences of teaching, and the level of emotional connection they feel when they anticipate and practice teaching (Bandura, 1997; Tschannen-Moran & McMaster, 2009) . Although many studies have been conducted that examine the connection between early childhood preservice teachers' attitudes, beliefs, and self-efficacy regarding mathematics and science, little research of this kind has been conducted regarding preservice teachers' attitudes and beliefs about writing.\nIn this article, two focus groups conducted to examine the beliefs and attitudes of preservice preschool and elementary teachers towards writing are described. The focus groups comprise one component of a broader research project that will create and validate a tool for measuring preservice teachers' attitudes towards writing to be used in conjunction with the Writing Orientation Scale (WOS) which measures teachers' beliefs and orientation towards the teaching of writing (Graham et al., 2001 (Lehoux, Poland, & Daudelin, 2006) . The purpose of conducting the focus groups described in this article was to gather information about early childhood and elementary preservice teachers' attitudes and beliefs about writing and their plans for future writing instruction. The results of these focus groups will be used to help create a survey that measures preservice teachers' attitudes towards writing."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 14 preservice teachers ranging in age from 18-22 years at a large state university in central Kentucky. Participants were selected based on their status as student teachers during the semester in which the focus groups were conducted.

The first focus group included eight Interdisciplinary Early Childhood Education (IECE) majors (preparing to work with families and young children, birth-5 years with and without disabilities) and the second focus group included six Early Elementary Education (EEE) majors (preparing to teach Kindergarten-5 th grade). All preservice teachers were currently placed in early childhood classrooms (preschool-3 rd Writing Development over Time 6 grade) to perform their student teaching requirements. They also attended seminars on campus to assist in developing their teaching portfolio to be used for future job interviews."}, {"section_title": "Data Source and Analysis", "text": "A semi-structured group interview or focus group was conducted in two sites. The first focus group (IECE majors) was conducted in the classroom of the participating students following a regularly scheduled seminar. The second focus group (EEE majors) was conducted at a local elementary school following a regularly scheduled student teacher meeting.\nParticipants were recruited for the focus groups during their student teaching seminars on campus. The two instructors of the student teaching seminars were asked to make a class announcement inviting students to speak with a researcher, in a small group setting, about their attitudes towards writing and the effects these attitudes may have on their choice of instructional strategies for teaching writing. After the class announcement, eight students majoring in IECE and six students majoring in EEE volunteered to participate in the groups. The students put their names and email addresses on a sign-up sheet that the instructors then passed along to the researcher. The researcher contacted volunteers through email to arrange the best day and time for each group.\nThe researcher began the focus groups by describing rules and procedures for the Creative opportunities included interesting writing assignments (36%) and freedom when choosing writing topics (50%). When asked to recount a positive writing experience, one participant stated:\nWriting Development over Time 9\n\"Any time when I've had an opportunity to write creatively or choose my topic.\nMy senior English teacher in high school gave us a variety of topics that we could choose from or we could choose our own topic related to the content and we'd come in every day for the 50 min and she'd play music, and she even got our opinion on that, what music we liked and we would just write and she would give us some feedback.\"\nWhen asked to describe a negative writing experience in or out of school, participant answers focused primarily on critical feedback from teachers including the famous \"red marks\" on papers (36%) and instances where students and teachers just did not agree (29%). At times the disagreements were about the quality of work and other times about controversy over content. One participant described her experience:\n\"When I get my papers back and they have red marks all over them, I mean it's nice to have feedback but it still feels negative.\"\nAnother complaint made by participants was feeling uninterested in school writing assignments (14%).

One participant describes her plan for instruction:\n\"I would make time for writing every day but I would be very creative in how I would do it. I would allow opportunities on the computer or through a journal. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Implications", "text": "The data from these focus groups provide valuable information about the importance of examining preservice teachers' attitudes and beliefs about writing. The following three broad themes emerged related to key influences in the development of positive and negative attitudes towards writing: (1) having writing published or showcased increases positive attitudes towards writing (2) creative opportunities and process-oriented teaching strategies provide the most meaningful writing experiences, and (3) negative feedback from teachers adversely impacts self-confidence in writing skills and leads to negative attitudes towards writing.\nCreative writing opportunities have been reported as meaningful in similar studies because they allow for self-expression and reflection (Norman & Spencer, 2005) . With these findings in mind, it is important for teacher educators to consider giving their own students creative writing opportunities and using process-oriented teaching strategies such as the Writing Workshop approach (Tompkins, 2007) . By modeling these effective strategies with their own students, it is more likely that preservice teachers will learn the importance of using similar strategies when they become teachers in the future. These\nWriting Development over Time 15 findings also suggest that teacher educators should model giving positive feedback and praise along with valuing student writing through showcasing and publishing their work. Bandura's (1977) social learning theory describes how people learn from one another through continuous reciprocal interactions with their environment explaining the extreme influence of negative and positive writing experiences over time.\nIt is important to keep in mind that teacher actions (e.g., showcasing work, giving positive feedback) not only affect the self-confidence of developing writers but may also affect the self-efficacy of future teachers (Graham et al.) Tschannen-Moran and\nMcMaster (2009) stated that, \"Teacher self-efficacy is a teacher's perceived capability to impart knowledge and to influence student behavior, even that of unmotivated or challenging students\" (p.228). By helping preservice teachers examine their own attitudes and beliefs about writing, teacher educators can help continue to build, or in many cases, rebuild their students' self-confidence in their writing abilities. Restored self-confidence and increased knowledge of pedagogy will ensure a high sense of teacher self-efficacy in preservice early childhood writing teachers.\nThree themes related to views of writing instruction and pedagogical decisions for the future emerged from the focus groups. These were: (1) embedding writing opportunities throughout the day helps provide quality writing instruction, (2) preservice teachers who struggle with writing mechanics are hesitant about teaching these skills to their future students, and (3) preservice teachers do not agree on one specific methodology for teaching writing or the amount of time that they will teach writing in the future.\nWriting Development over Time 16\nKnowledge of preservice teachers' future plans for writing instruction can be used to further study the relationship between personal attitudes and beliefs about writing and the effects these attitudes and beliefs have on pedagogical decisions. Current research demonstrates that positive writing experiences at the college level can help change wellestablished negative attitudes towards writing (Beswick, 2006) . The findings from these focus groups encourage teacher educators to focus not only on building preservice teachers' confidence in the teaching of writing, but also on helping preservice teachers become better writers themselves. For example, if a student struggles with spelling, a college instructor could model pulling misspelled words out of the student's writing journal to create a weekly individualized spelling test. This strategy would improve the preservice teacher's spelling abilities while also teaching her an effective strategy for helping her students who struggle with spelling in the future.\nFurther research will provide opportunities for both preservice teachers and teacher educators that will enhance literacy courses at the college level (Ng et al., 2009 ).\nBy examining beliefs about writing as well as personal strengths and weaknesses, preservice teachers will understand more about writing development and will possibly become more open to learning about alternative teaching methods (e.g. embedding).\nThrough this same reflective process, teacher educators will learn about the knowledge, skills, and beliefs of their students and be able to use this information to shape coursework and field-based experiences. For example, coursework may focus more on specific research-based methodologies for teaching writing and give preservice teachers clearer expectations of how often and in what ways they should teach writing in their Writing Development over Time 17 future classrooms. Donald Graves (1983) states the importance of seeing yourself as both a writer and teacher before entering the classroom:\nThe teaching of writing demands the control of two crafts, teaching and writing.\nThey can neither be avoided, nor separated. The writer who knows the craft of writing can't walk into a room and work with students unless there is some understanding of the craft of teaching. Neither can teachers who have not wrestled with writing, effectively teach the writer's craft\u2026.There is a road, a journey to travel, and there is someone to travel with us, someone who has already made the trip (pp.6-7).\nKeeping this in mind, it is crucial for preservice teachers to examine their own beliefs about writing before traveling the road of teaching others. Teacher educators must travel with preservice teachers through their college courses on writing and help them learn to develop these two inseparable crafts."}]
