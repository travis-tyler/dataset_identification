[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Two important changes during the 1990s had major implications for borrowing for undergraduate education. First, the price of going to college increased faster than inflation (The College Board 2003a). Second, the 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act increased loan limits for the Stafford loan program, expanded eligibility for need-based aid, and introduced unsubsidized Stafford loans for undergraduates regardless of their financial need. The resulting increase in federal borrowing was immediate and dramatic. After adjusting for inflation, the federal loan volume for undergraduate and graduate borrowing increased by 35 percent the first year after the change (1992-93 to 1993-94) (The College Board 2003b). Between 1992-93 and2002-03, it grew from $20.7 billion (in constant 2002 dollars) to $49.1 billion, an increase of 137 percent. This report uses the 1994 and 2001 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B) to compare the borrowing patterns of 1992-93 and 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients. It also examines their repayment situations and resulting debt burdens (defined as monthly loan payments as a percentage of monthly salary income a year after they graduated). Members of the earlier cohort finished their undergraduate borrowing before the changes in the Stafford loan program were implemented, and most members of the later cohort would have done all of their borrowing under the new rules. The major finding of the analysis was that although both the percentage of graduates who had borrowed for their undergraduate education and the average total amount borrowed (adjusting for inflation) increased, the median debt burden (as defined in the previous paragraph) a year after graduating was about the same for both cohorts. Higher salaries (after adjusting for inflation) and lower payments relative to the amount borrowed for the later cohort (whose payments were kept down by declining interest rates) appear to be the major reason why there was no increase in the later cohort's debt burden. Various alternative payment options could have lowered the payments for some members of either cohort, but comparable data on how the two cohorts used these alternatives are not available. The data presented in this report are nationally representative of bachelor's degree recipients in 1992-93 and 1999-2000. They cover the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, except for the first row in each table, which excludes Puerto Rico. The comparisons made in the text were tested using the Student's t statistic. All differences cited are statistically significant at the .05 level. The amounts borrowed by 1992-93 graduates were adjusted to 1999 constant dollars using the Consumer Price Index for all urban dwellers (CPI-U) to make them comparable to the amounts borrowed by 1999-2000 graduates; the amounts owed, monthly payments, and earnings a year later (in 1994) were adjusted to 2001 constant dollars.\nvii should not exceed 8 percent of their pre-tax income. A comparison of the debt burden of the two cohorts reflects differences not only in how much they borrowed but also in the salaries they were able to command, the prevailing interest rates, and the repayment options they selected. Although the later graduates had borrowed more, on average, than the earlier graduates, the combination of higher salaries and apparent better repayment terms resulted in a median debt burden that was similar for both cohorts (7 percent) (tables A and 14). Goldenberg (2004) estimated comparable levels of debt burden for all borrowers (not only bachelor's degree recipients) in their first year of repayment in all years from 1997 through 2001 (6 to 7 percent) using loan data from a random sample of borrowers in the National Student Loan Data Base and income data from the Internal Revenue Service. Even though the median debt burden did not increase, graduates with large loans or low salaries faced relatively high debt burdens. For example, 1999-2000 graduates who had borrowed $25,000 or more had a median debt burden of 10 percent in 2001, compared with 3 percent for their peers who had borrowed less than $10,000. Also, low salaries understandably make repaying loans more burdensome. For both cohorts, the lower the income category, the greater the median debt burden was. Those with the lowest salaries had a median debt burden of 18 percent in 1994 and 15 percent in 2001, and those with middle and high incomes had median debt burdens in the 4-9 percent range. While the relationship between loan payments and earnings is probably the most important indicator of debt burden, it is useful to look at other details of graduates' financial circumstances and life choices for any signs that undergraduate debt may be creating hardships. Considering graduates who were not enrolled for further education, no systematic differences were detected between those who borrowed various amounts and those who had not borrowed in terms of their living arrangements (table 16) or propensity to  marry (table 18). However, as debt burden increased (i.e., as student loan payments used up an increasing proportion of their salaries) graduates' ability or willingness to take on other financial obligations was affected. For both cohorts, among graduates repaying their loans, those with a debt burden of less than 5 percent were more likely than those with a debt burden of 17 percent or more to have mortgage, rent, or auto loan payments, and when they did, the amounts they paid were generally larger. It is important to understand that these data represent debt burden a year after graduation but that debt burden can change during the repayment period. Interest rates on federal loans are variable and therefore may go up or down, and income and employment status can change because of personal circumstances or changing economic conditions. Thus, the extent to which any group of borrowers is likely to have difficulty repaying their loans depends not only on the size of their loans but also on conditions during the repayment period that are difficult to predict when students and their families make decisions about borrowing. Students whose academic success is uncertain or whose families lack the financial resources to help them repay their loans if they run into difficulty are especially vulnerable to these uncertainties. Finally, it is important to note that although median debt burden a year after graduating has not Executive Summary viii increased, the amount that the average bachelor's degree recipient borrowed, and thus will have to repay, has increased. Although loans help students gain access to undergraduate education by reducing the necessary immediate outlay, they do not decrease the total price of going to college; they simply postpone paying the bill."}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate Borrowing", "text": "The percentage of bachelor's degree recipients who had borrowed from any source to finance their undergraduate education increased from 49 percent in 1992-93 to 65 percent in 1999-2000 (tables A and 2). Among borrowers, the average amount borrowed increased from $12,100 (in constant 1999 dollars) to $19,300. The increase in the percentage who borrowed occurred for males and females and each racial/ethnic 1 and age group. It also occurred for 1 The apparent increase for American Indians was not statistically significant. all categories of enrollment characteristics such as where they first enrolled, where they earned their degree, how long they took to earn their degree, and undergraduate major. Finally, the increase occurred for graduates who had been either dependent or independent and at all family income levels for dependent students. Among graduates who were dependent students, the percentage who borrowed increased from 67 to 72 percent for those in the lowest family income group and roughly doubled (from 24 to 46 percent) for those in the highest income group (figure A).  The increase in the average cumulative amount borrowed occurred at all types of institutions, at each income level, and across all other student and institutional characteristics just mentioned. 2 The percentage of graduates who had borrowed $25,000 or more for their undergraduate education increased from 7 percent in 1992-93 to 26 percent in 1999-2000 (table 3). Debt did not seem to discourage graduates from enrolling in graduate or first-professional education in any major way. In fact, despite their higher debt, 1999-2000 graduates were more likely than their 1992-93 counterparts to have enrolled in a graduate or first-professional program a year later (21 vs. 16 percent) (table 5). Among 1999-2000 graduates who had not enrolled by 2001 but were expecting to attend graduate school later, 5 percent cited undergraduate debt as the primary reason for postponing their enrollment (table 6). Debt also did not appear to discourage the later cohort from entering teaching: despite their greater average debt, they were slightly more likely than the earlier cohort to have taught within a year of graduating (12 vs. 10 percent) (table 7). Nor did higher debt appear to force graduates to take jobs unrelated to their career goals: about 29 percent vi reported taking such jobs, with no detectable increase related to the amount borrowed (table 8)."}, {"section_title": "Loan Repayment", "text": "Borrowers usually must begin repaying their education loans 6 months after they graduate, although they may be able to postpone repaying if they are enrolled in postsecondary education at least half time, are unemployed, are participating in a qualifying service program (e.g., volunteering in the Peace Corps), or have an approved medical or economic hardship. 3 The standard repayment period for Stafford loans is 10 years, but alternative repayment options-graduated, extended, income-based-are available to some, depending on the specific loan program and amount borrowed. These alternatives reduce the monthly payment in the early years, but increase total interest charges. One option is for borrowers to consolidate their loans and obtain a fixed rate as well as extend the repayment period. When interest rates are low, as they are now, students who exercise this option can save substantial amounts over the life of the loan. Just under two-thirds of the borrowers in each cohort were repaying their loans a year after graduating (table 10). Because 1999-2000 graduates had borrowed more, on average, than their 1992-93 counterparts, they also had larger average monthly loan payments a year later ($210 vs. $160 per month in constant 2001 dollars) (tables A and 11). A comparison of the payments relative to the amounts borrowed for the two cohorts suggests that the later cohort had more favorable repayment terms a year after they graduated: the average amount borrowed increased by 60 percent, but the average monthly payment increased by 30 percent. 4 For the later cohort, lower interest rates helped to keep monthly payments down. Interest rates on Stafford loans disbursed before 1992 were fixed and ranged from 8 to 10 percent (although borrowers were permitted to convert them to variable rates later). Interest rates are now variable; they are set annually on July 1 and cannot exceed 8.25 percent. In 2001, the interest rate on Stafford loans was between 6 and 7 percent, depending on the date of the loan. 5 The later cohort also benefited from higher salaries, even after adjusting for inflation. The 1999-2000 graduates had an average salary of $34,100 in 2001, compared with an average of $28,300 (in constant 2001 dollars) for 1992-93 graduates in 1994 (tables A and 13).\nFederal loan borrowers usually must begin repaying their education loans 6 months after they graduate, although they may be able to postpone repaying if they are enrolled in postsecondary education at least half time, are unemployed, are participating in a qualifying service program (e.g., volunteering in the Peace Corps), or have an approved medical or economic hardship. The standard period for repaying Stafford loans is 10 years, but alternative repayment options-graduated, extended, income-contingent, or income-sensitive-are available under some circumstances, depending on the specific loan program and amount borrowed. These alternatives reduce the monthly payment in the early years but increase total interest charges. Repayment terms for loans from family or friends are negotiated by the parties involved and are likely to be informal rather than specifying regular monthly payments. Borrowers were not asked about their repayment agreements with their families or friends. Some data comparability issues exist between the two cohorts. The 1992-93 graduates were asked simply how much they had borrowed from all sources (including education loans and family and friends) and what their monthly payment on this amount was. No distinction was made between education loans and loans from family and friends. The 1999-2000 graduates also were asked how much they had borrowed in education loans and from family and friends but were asked about their monthly payments only for their education loans (i.e., ignoring any monthly payments to family). Thus, to the extent that family loans are repaid using monthly payments, the reported payments of the later cohort would be underestimates of total payments. However, the percentage who owed on family loans in 2001 was relatively low (12 percent had borrowed from family and friends and less than half of these borrowers [46 percent] still owed on these loans in 2001; tables 4 and 9). In addition, it is likely that family loans would have informal repayment plans rather than a monthly obligation. Finally, the sizes of the average monthly payments in 1994 and 2001 (as discussed below) were consistent with the size of the total undergraduate debt and prevailing interest rates. Thus, the reported monthly payments appear to be a reasonably good approximation of payments on education loans for both cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Debt Burden", "text": "Debt burden is defined here as the monthly loan payment as a percentage of monthly income. While this is a commonly used indicator, there is no widely recognized standard of what constitutes an acceptable level of debt burden (Greiner 1996). Scherschel (1998) noted that mortgage lenders frequently recommend that student loan payments 4 While not based on a nationally representative sample of students, a similar pattern of discrepancy was reported by Baum and O'Malley (2003) in the rate of growth in undergraduate debt level and monthly repayments based on data from the 2002 National Student Loan Survey conducted by the Nellie Mae Corporation. 5 While both the amounts borrowed and the monthly loan payments are student reported in a telephone interview and therefore subject to recall error, the two appear to be consistent. The monthly payment on a 10-year loan for $12,100 (the average borrowed by 1992-93 graduates) at 8-10 percent interest would be $147-160; the payment on a 10year loan for $19,300 (the average for 1999-2000 graduates) at 6-7 percent interest would be $214-224.\nUnderstanding the extent to which the payments just described were burdensome requires knowing something about the financial circumstances of the individuals making the payments. It is important to know their employment status (table 12), earnings (table 13), the relationship between their earnings and payments (table 14), and whether they were receiving help from their parents in repaying their loans (table 15)."}, {"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "This report compares the borrowing patterns of two cohorts of bachelor's degree recipients and examines their debt burdens (defined as monthly payments as a percentage of monthly salary income) a year after they graduated, using data from the 1993/94 and 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond Studies (B&B:93/94 and B&B:2000/01).

First, the price of going to college increased faster than inflation (The College Board 2003a). Second, the 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act increased loan limits for the Stafford loan program (the major source for undergraduate loans), expanded eligibility for need-based aid, and introduced unsubsidized loans for undergraduates regardless of their financial need. The resulting increase in federal borrowing was immediate and dramatic. After adjusting for inflation, the federal loan volume for undergraduate and graduate borrowing increased by 35 percent the first year after the change (1992-93 to 1993-94) (The College Board 2003b). Between 1992-93 and 2002-03, it grew from $20.7 billion (in constant 2002 dollars) to $49.1 billion, an increase of 137 percent. This increase in borrowing has fueled long-held concerns about potentially negative consequences of students' borrowing. In addition to their concerns about default, many educators, policymakers, and others have worried that student debt may limit borrowers' choices with respect to graduate or first-professional education, restrict their ability to choose careers such as teaching that are important to society but have low earnings potential relative to other careers open to college graduates, or cause them to alter their family or lifestyle goals (Hansen 1987;Davis and Merisotis 1998;Joyner 1998). This report describes the borrowing patterns of two cohorts of bachelor's degree recipients (1992-93 and 1999-2000) and examines their repayment situations and resulting debt burdens a year after they graduated (i.e., in 1994 and 2001). Debt burden is defined here as monthly loan payments as a percentage of monthly salary income. The report also looks at the relationship between borrowing and teaching, enrollment in graduate and first-professional degree programs, job choices immediately after college, and selected lifestyle choices once the graduates begin repaying their loans. Introduction about the same for both cohorts. Higher salaries (after adjusting for inflation) and lower payments relative to the amount borrowed for the later cohort (whose payments were kept down by declining interest rates) appear to be the major reason that debt burden did not increase. Various alternative payment options also may have lowered the payments for some members of either cohort, but comparable data on how the two cohorts used these alternatives are not available. 1\nWhile loans promote access, they also entail risk. Families must make decisions about borrowing without knowing what the interest rates will be during the repayment period. They also cannot be certain that the students will graduate, get jobs, and earn enough to meet their repayment obligations. For students who do not perform well academically (and thus are at risk of not completing college) or whose families lack the financial resources to help them if they cannot meet their financial commitments during the repayment period, borrowing is more risky than it is for students who are academically and financially secure. Because this analysis covers only students who completed bachelor's degrees, it cannot address the difficulty that borrowing may cause for students who drop out before finishing their education or who earn associate's degrees or certificates rather than bachelor's degrees."}, {"section_title": "Student Loan Programs", "text": "The federal government helps students borrow by guaranteeing the loans and, for students who qualify for need-based aid, by paying the interest while they are enrolled. 2 After students graduate, the federal government helps lighten students' repayment burden by providing deferments for hardships and offering various alternatives to the usual repayment schedule of equal payments over 10 years that reduce payments in the early years. The alternative repayment options provide a short-term solution for students who have difficulty making payments, but they increase the total interest charges the borrower must eventually pay. In addition, the federal government has programs that forgive a portion of students' debt in exchange for working in certain occupations or geographic areas. The Stafford loan program is now the major federal loan program for undergraduates. (Its forerunner was the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program established by the Higher Education Act of 1965.) Federal student loan programs were originally designed to help students with financial need attend college, but as the price of attendance increased during the 1970s and 1980s, Congress responded by raising both loan limits and income ceilings. Since 1992, all students, regardless of income or financial need, have been permitted to take out federally guaranteed student loans. For a student who qualifies for need-based aid, the federal government pays the interest on the loan until the student begins repayment (usually 6 months after graduating or leaving school). Students who do not qualify for need-based aid may take out unsubsidized Stafford loans. Interest on these loans starts accruing as soon as the loans are disbursed, but students may postpone paying the interest until they leave school. Of the $49.1 billion borrowed through federal student loan programs in 2002-03, $42.3 billion was borrowed (by undergraduates and graduates) through the Stafford loan program ($22.4 billion as subsidized loans and $19.9 billion as unsubsidized loans) (The College Board 2003b). The maximum Stafford loan limits vary by undergraduate class level and dependency status. In 1992-93, dependent students could borrow a maximum of $17,250, and independent students could borrow up to $37,250. The 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act raised the limits on the total amount borrowed to $23,000 (subsidized plus unsubsidized) for dependent students and to $46,000 for independent students (no more than $23,000 of which may be subsidized). These limits are still in effect. The reauthorization currently under consideration has stimulated vigorous debate about Stafford loan limits (Burd 2003). Proponents of higher loan limits argue that students and their families have greater financial need now than they did a decade ago and are being forced to borrow from private sources that provide less attractive terms than federal student loan programs. Those opposed to raising the loan limits argue that students are already borrowing large amounts and that any increased federal aid should be distributed in the form of grants rather than loans. The Perkins loan program, originally the National Defense Student Loans (NDSL) established in 1958, is the smallest federal loan program for undergraduates. It provides loans to students with exceptional need. Funds are limited, and institutional financial aid administrators have considerable discretion in determining who receives them. In 2002-03, students (undergraduate and graduate) borrowed $1.3 billion in Perkins loans (The College Board 2003b). Parents of dependent undergraduates may borrow through the federally sponsored Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) program. Before the 1992 reauthorization, the loan limit was $20,000; since the reauthorization, parents have been permitted to borrow up to the full price of attending (minus any other aid). In 2002-03, parents borrowed $5.4 billion through this program (The College Board 2003b). Nonfederal student loans totaled $7.6 billion in 2002-03 (The College Board 2003b). Some of this borrowing was through state loan programs, but most of it was through banks and other private lenders."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This report uses the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Studies (B&B) conducted in 1994 and 2001 to examine the borrowing patterns and debt burdens of 1992-93 and 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients. The B&B Studies tracked the experiences of two cohorts of bachelor's degree recipients after they graduated. They are the most recent nationally representative longitudinal studies of bachelor's degree recipients. All participants were first interviewed as part of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Studies conducted in 1992- 93 and 1999-2000(NPSAS:93 and NPSAS:2000. The earlier cohort was interviewed again in 1994, and the later one in 2001 (B&B:93/94 and 2000/01). 3 For most respondents, the B&B interview took place approximately 1 year after they graduated, but the time frame was somewhat longer for those who graduated early in the academic year. For convenience, the terms \"a year later\" or \"after a year\" are used in this report, although the actual time frame is not exactly 12 months for all graduates. The NPSAS studies included about 1,100 institutions and were based on a nationally representative sample of all students enrolled in postsecondary education institutions, including undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional students; each NPSAS study represents more than 16 million undergraduates who were enrolled at some time between July 1 and June 30 of the respective survey year. The survey frames for NPSAS were built from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Systems Institutional Characteristics file (IPEDS-IC) for 1990-91 and 1998-99; lists of students were obtained from each participating institution. The estimates presented in this report are based on the results of interviews with approximately 10,000 bachelor's degree recipients each year from sampling frames of about 12,500 in 1992-93 and 11,600 in 1999-2000. These bachelor's degree recipients represent the approximately 1.2 million Excluded from the final sample were students who were determined during the B&B interview or from transcripts not to have earned a bachelor's degree during the relevant academic year (760 in 1992-93 and 70 in 1999-2000). See appendix B for more detail. The weighted overall response rate for B&B:2000/01 was 74 percent (taking into account an institution response rate of 90 percent from NPSAS:2000). The weighted response rate for B&B:93/94 was 81 percent (taking into account an institution response rate of 88 percent for NPSAS:1993). The data presented in this report cover the 50 states, District of Columbia (D.C.), and Puerto Rico, except the first row in each table, which includes only the 50 states and D.C. (excluding Puerto Rico). In most cases, comparable data exist for both cohorts of bachelor's degree recipients. In a few cases where the definition of a variable is not exactly the same for both cohorts, the discrepancy is noted along with an explanation of the expected direction of any bias. When comparable questions were not asked of both cohorts, data for the 1999-2000 cohort are presented. The glossary in appendix A provides a complete description of each variable presented in the tables. All comparisons made in the text were tested using Student's t statistic. All differences cited were statistically significant at the .05 level. The formula used and more detail on significance levels are provided in appendix B.

The amounts borrowed by 1992-93 graduates were adjusted to 1999 constant dollars using the Consumer Price Index for all urban dwellers (CPI-U) to make them comparable to the amounts borrowed by the 1999-2000 graduates; the amounts owed, monthly payments, and earnings a year later (i.e., 1994) were adjusted to 2001 constant dollars. 4 Dollar amounts cited in this report from other sources describing loan limits or loan volumes were not adjusted for inflation. The two B&B cohorts had relatively similar student and institutional characteristics, but a few statistically significant shifts occurred. Members of the later cohort were more likely than the earlier one to be female, to be from a minority racial/ethnic group, 5 to have majored in the humanities or social science or in \"other\" fields, and to have graduated from a public 4-year doctoral institution (table 1).

Debt burden is defined as monthly loan payments divided by monthly salary income. Members of the earlier cohort finished their undergraduate borrowing before the changes in the Stafford loan program introduced by the 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act were implemented, and most members of the later cohort would have done all of their borrowing under the new rules. The major finding of the analysis was that although both the percentage of graduates who had borrowed for their undergraduate education and the average total amount borrowed (adjusting for inflation) increased, the median debt burden a year after graduating was about the same for both cohorts (7 percent). Higher salaries (after adjusting for inflation) and lower payments relative to the amount borrowed for the later cohort appear to be the major reasons why there was no increase in the later cohort's debt burden. The payments of the later cohort were kept down by declining interest rates. Various alternative payment options also could have lowered the payments for some members of either cohort, but comparable data on how the cohorts used them are not available. Higher debt did not seem to discourage the graduates from enrolling in further education in any major way. Among 1999-2000 graduates who had not yet applied or enrolled but were expecting to attend graduate school later, 5 percent cited undergraduate debt as the primary reason for postponing further education. Higher debt appeared neither to discourage the later cohort from entering teaching, nor to encourage graduates to take jobs that they did not consider to be the start of a career in that occupation or industry. It is important to understand that these data represent debt burden a year after graduation but that debt burden can change during the repayment period. Interest rates on federal loans are variable and therefore may go up or down, and both income and employment status can change because of personal circumstances or shifts in economic conditions. Thus, the extent to which any group of borrowers will have difficulty repaying their loans depends not only on the size of their loans but also on conditions during the repayment period that are difficult to predict when students and their families make decisions about borrowing. Students whose academic success is uncertain or whose families lack the financial resources to help them repay their loans if they run into difficulty are especially vulnerable to these uncertainties. Finally, it is important to note that although median debt burden a year after graduating did not increase, the amount that the average bachelor's degree recipient borrowed, and thus will have to repay, has increased. Although loans help students gain access to undergraduate education by reducing the necessary immediate outlay, they do not decrease the total price of attending; they simply postpone paying the bill. When students first consider enrolling and must make decisions about borrowing, they often do not know what career they will choose or how much they will need to borrow in total, both of which have implications for their ability to repay their debt.

The 1999-2000 graduates were also asked to indicate how much they had borrowed through any education loan program (including federal programs), through federal programs specifically, and from family and friends. Because this detail is lacking for the earlier cohort, only the total amounts borrowed by the two cohorts can be compared. This section first describes undergraduate borrowing (with more detail for the later cohort) and then examines the relationship between borrowing and various outcomes a year after graduating, such as enrolling in graduate or first-professional degree programs, teaching, and taking jobs unrelated to their career goals. Note that the borrowing described here does not include borrowing by parents and consequently does not represent the total amount families borrowed to pay for undergraduate education."}, {"section_title": "Who Borrows and How Much", "text": "Whether students borrow and how much they borrow depends on their financial need (which, in turn, depends on the price of attending their chosen institution and their financial resources), their willingness to borrow, and the availability of loans. Reflecting the increased price of attending and changes in the federal loan programs, the percentage of bachelor's degree recipients who borrowed to pay for their undergraduate education and the average amount borrowed both increased. The percentage who had borrowed at any time during their undergraduate years increased from 49 percent for 1992-93 graduates to 65 percent for 1999-2000 graduates (table 2). Among those who borrowed, the average cumulative amount borrowed (adjusted for inflation) rose from $12,100 to $19,300. The percentage who borrowed increased among both males and females and for all racial/ethnic 6 and age groups. It also increased at all types of institutions where graduates first enrolled or earned their degree (figure 1), for each of time-to-degree category, and for all undergraduate majors. The increase also occurred among graduates who had been either dependent or independent in the year they graduated and at all family income levels for dependent students (figure 2). Among graduates who were dependent students in the year that they graduated, the percentage who borrowed increased from 67 to 72 percent for those in the lowest family income group and roughly doubled (from 24 to 46 percent) for those in the highest income group. The increase in the average cumulative amount borrowed occurred at all types of institutions (figure 3), at each income level (figure 4), and across all other student and institutional characteristics shown in table 2 except among American Indians, whose apparent increase was not statistically significant and possibly associated with a small sample size or large standard errors, or both. In both cohorts, the relationship between borrowing and student characteristics followed the same patterns. For example, White and Asian bachelor's degree recipients were less likely than Black or Hispanic graduates to have borrowed, which is consistent with the fact that Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to have financial need (Berkner et al. 2002). Bachelor's degree recipients 25-29 years old were more likely than those who were younger or older to have Bachelor's degree recipients in both cohorts who took more than 6 years to finish college were more likely than those who completed within 4 years to have borrowed: 59 versus 41 percent for 1992-93 graduates and 70 versus 60 percent for 1999-2000 graduates. However, the graduates who took more than 6 years to finish borrowed less, on average, than those who finished within 4 years: $11,000 versus $13,100 for 1992-93 graduates and $18,800 versus $20,500 for 1999-2000 graduates. Graduates who had been dependent students from families with the highest incomes were less likely than their counterparts from lower income families or those who had been independent Dependent students to have borrowed: 24 versus 34-67 percent for 1992-93 graduates and 46 versus 62-72 percent for 1999-2000 graduates. However, when graduates from higher income families did borrow, they borrowed larger amounts, on average, than other graduates: $15,300 versus $10,800-$12,700 for 1992-93 graduates and $23,300 versus $17,800-$20,100 for 1999-2000 graduates. The greater amounts borrowed by students from high-income families reflect, in part, the fact that these students are more likely to attend institutions with higher prices and are less likely to be eligible for need-based grants. Bachelor's degree recipients from private not-for-profit non-doctoral institutions were more likely than those who graduated from other types of institutions to have borrowed: 58 versus 45-50 percent in 1992-93 and 71 versus 63-65 percent in 1999-2000. However, among borrowers in both cohorts, graduates of private not-for-profit doctoral institutions borrowed the largest amount, on average. Graduates who began their postsecondary education at public 4-year institutions were the least likely to have borrowed. Among borrowers, those who had begun at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions borrowed the most, on average.  Consistent with the larger average amounts borrowed in 1999-2000 than in 1992-93, the distribution of borrowers by the amount borrowed also shifted over time. Between 1992-93 and 1999-2000, the percentage of graduates who had borrowed less than $10,000 (in 1999 constant dollars) decreased from 52 to 23 percent, and the percentage who had borrowed $25,000 or more increased from 7 to 26 percent (figure 5 and table 3). Among borrowers in both cohorts of graduates, Hispanics were more likely than Whites or Asians to have borrowed less than $10,000. In addition, graduates of private not-for-profit doctoral institutions were more likely than those at any other type of institution to have borrowed $25,000 or more (16 vs. 3 to 10 percent in 1992-93 and 42 vs. 17 to 27 percent in 1999-2000). This difference is consistent with the higher average price of attending this type of institution (Berkner et al. 2002).  As already indicated, the borrowing described here does not include borrowing by parents. Although graduates were not asked about parental borrowing, information on PLUS loans is available through federal records. Among 1999-2000 graduates, 14 percent of their parents had taken out PLUS loans, up from 6 percent for the 1992-93 cohort. 7 Among those whose parents used this program, the average cumulative amount borrowed increased from $7,500 for the earlier cohort to $14,900 for the later one.

Alternatively or in addition, family or friends may provide the cash needed to enroll but expect students ultimately to be responsible for paying some or all of their educational expenses. Table 4 shows the percentage of graduates who borrowed from each source and the average amounts computed in two ways: first, using only those who borrowed the specific type of loan as the base (to demonstrate the size of the average loan), and second, using all borrowers as the base (to show the relative contributions of loans from the various sources to the total amount borrowed). Sixty-five percent of all 1999-2000 graduates borrowed during their undergraduate education, 62 percent took out education loans (totaling an average of $17,800 among those with education loans), and 58 percent took out federal loans (totaling an average of $16,200 among those with federal loans). Twelve percent borrowed from family or friends, either alone (4 percent) or in combination with student loans (8 percent). 8 Among those who borrowed from their families (either alone or in combination with student loans), the average amount borrowed from their families was $13,800. Considering only graduates who had been dependent students while they were enrolled, borrowing patterns varied with family income. Those from families with incomes in the lower half of the income distribution were more likely than those from families with higher incomes to have taken out education loans. However, among those who were dependent students and had education loans, the average amount borrowed was about $17,000 at all family income levels. This lack of variation probably reflects program limits for dependent students. Using all borrowers as the base for computing the average shows the relative importance of each loan source. Of the average total amount borrowed ($19,300), $16,800 was in education loans (of which $14,600 was in federal loans), and $2,500 was from family and friends. At each income level, between 11 and 13 percent of graduates who had been dependent students had borrowed from families or friends. However, the amount borrowed reflects the capacity of their families to provide this kind of help, with those from the highest income families borrowing the largest amounts, on average. Borrowing patterns also varied across types of institutions. For example, graduates of private not-for-profit non-doctoral institutions were the most likely to have taken out federal loans and graduates of private not-for-profit doctoral institutions were the most likely to have borrowed from their families.

Therefore, it is useful to examine enrollment in graduate and first-professional programs and plans to enroll for any signs that undergraduate debt discourages graduates from seeking further education. Previous studies of the relationship between undergraduate debt and either plans to enroll and actual enrollment have not produced entirely consistent results, with findings varying according to the measures, methods, population, and data used (Millet 2003). Among researchers who have controlled for factors other than undergraduate debt that could influence plans or enrollment, some have found undergraduate debt to have a discouraging effect for at least some groups of students (Fox 1992;Millet 2003), while others have found no effect (Ekstrom et al. 1991;Schapiro, O'Malley, and Litten 1991;Weiler 1991), or only a very marginal effect (Heller 2001).

Nevertheless, members of the later cohort were more likely than members of the earlier one to have enrolled in a graduate or first-professional degree program by the time they were interviewed again approximately a year after graduating (21 vs. 16 percent) (table 5). 9 For both cohorts, several characteristics were associated with a greater likelihood of pursuing graduate or first-professional education, including time to degree, undergraduate major, grades, parents' level of education, and type of institution attended. Graduates were more likely to have enrolled in a graduate or first-professional degree program if they had completed their bachelor's degree within 4 years than if they had taken longer. Compared with graduates with other majors, those who had majored in engineering, mathematics, or science were generally the most likely and those who had majored in business and management the least likely to have enrolled.

Graduates who had at least one parent with an advanced degree were more likely than those whose parents had less education to have enrolled, as were graduates of private notfor-profit doctoral institutions compared with graduates of other types of institutions. In both 1994 and 2001, nonborrowers were more likely than those who borrowed amounts less than $20,000 to have enrolled, 10 suggesting that undergraduate debt might discourage graduate enrollment. This finding should not be considered conclusive, however, because it does not take into account the interrelationships between other student and institutional characteristics that could have confounded the effect of borrowing on enrollment detected here. If undergraduate debt were the major barrier to graduate enrollment, one might expect to find declining enrollment rates as debt increased, but this was not the case. No difference was detected between the enrollment rates of those who borrowed $20,000 or more and those who borrowed $10,000-19,999; moreover, those who borrowed less than $10,000 were even less likely to enroll than those who borrowed $25,000 or more. More complex multivariate analyses (which were beyond the scope of this report) would be needed to understand the relationship between undergraduate debt and graduate enrollment. Using the 1992-93 B&B data, Heller (2001) constructed a set of logistic regression models to examine the relationship between various factors and graduate school enrollment, controlling for their interrelationships. He found the level of undergraduate borrowing to be only marginally negatively related to graduate school enrollment by 1994. 11 Degree expectations were the most influential factor, with undergraduate major and grade point average also important. Race/ethnicity, income, and parents' education were not statistically significant when other factors were taken into account. A number of other factors not measured here (or in other studies) might also affect graduates' decisions to pursue graduate education. These include, for example, aspects of their undergraduate experience, actions taken by graduate schools to attract students, and the availability of grants and loans for graduate study (Schapiro, O'Malley, and Litten 1991)."}, {"section_title": "Plans to Enroll in the Future", "text": "The 1999-2000 graduates who had not enrolled in a graduate or first-professional degree program by 2001 were asked if they expected to enroll in the future, and 67 percent reported that they did (table 5). Some of the characteristics associated with enrolling within a year of graduation were also associated with expecting to enroll in the future. For example, graduates with a GPA of at least 3.00 in their major were more likely than those with lower grades to have enrolled within a year (24 vs. 15 percent) and also, if they had not enrolled, to be considering doing so in the future (69 vs. 60 percent). Some characteristics, however, were related differently to immediate enrollment and future plans. For example, education majors were less likely than engineering, mathematics, or science majors to have enrolled within a year (19 vs. 29 percent) but were more likely to be considering enrolling in the future (78 vs. 70 percent).

Another 17 percent gave financial reasons unrelated to undergraduate debt as the primary reason, 17 percent wanted a break from school, and 9 percent cited family responsibilities. Five percent reported that undergraduate debt was the primary reason. Thus, undergraduate debt was less likely than other factors to be the primary reason graduates gave for postponing graduate studies.

Despite having borrowed larger average amounts, 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients were slightly more likely than their 1992-93 counterparts to have taught at a K-12 school within a year of graduating (12 vs. 10 percent) (table 7).

The most commonly provided reason for taking the job was that they were \"just paying the bills\" (38 percent). No differences could be detected in the likelihood of taking a job that was not the start of a career related to the total amount borrowed, but it is important to keep in mind that many factors other than undergraduate debt contribute to job choices. Controlling for these other factors might lead to a different conclusion.

The 1992-93 graduates were borrowing primarily in the late 1980s and early 1990s, at which time interest rates on Stafford loans were around 8 percent (fixed rate). Interest rates are now variable; they are adjusted annually on July 1, but cannot exceed 8.25 percent. In 2001, when the 1999-2000 graduates were interviewed, interest rates were between 6 and 7 percent, depending on the date of the loan. Since then, interest rates have continued to fall, and by 2003-04, had dropped to 4-5 percent for most borrowers, depending on the date the loans were disbursed. Therefore, the required payments for borrowers with variable interest rates are lower now than they were in 2001. However, interest rates may rise before these graduates' loans are repaid, in which case their payments would increase. Students have various options to reduce their monthly payments. Stafford loans normally have a 10-year repayment period, with fixed payments. However, depending on the type and amount of the loan, borrowers may be able to elect a graduated, extended, or income-based repayment option. 17 While the number of 1992-93 and 1999-2000 graduates electing these options is unknown, approximately one-quarter of all borrowers in the federal Direct Loan program did so in 1999-2000, especially those with large loan amounts (U.S. Department of Education and General Accounting Office 2001). 18 One option is for borrowers to consolidate their loans and obtain a fixed rate as well as extend the repayment period. When interest rates are low, as they are now, students who exercise this option can save substantial amounts over the life of the loan. Increasing numbers of borrowers are consolidating their loans (U.S. General Accounting Office 2003). Reflecting the larger amounts borrowed, 1999-2000 graduates were making larger monthly payments a year later, on average, than 1992-93 graduates ($210 vs. $160) after controlling for inflation (table 11). In 2001, the average monthly payment ranged from $100 per month for graduates who had borrowed less than $10,000 to $310 for those who had borrowed $25,000 or 16 Information on the history of Stafford loan interest rates is available at http://www.nchelp.org/elibrary11/main/10-refmaterial/ 10A-rateinfo/default.htm. 17 The graduated and income-based repayment plans were introduced in 1992. The extended payment option was available only to new borrowers after 1998, and only to those whose accumulated loans totaled more than $30,000 after that date (U.S. General Accounting Office 2003). 18 Federal Direct Loan borrowers are a subset of all federal loan borrowers. In this analysis, it is not possible to identify which type of federal loans students had. more. 19 A comparison of the payments relative to the amounts borrowed for the two cohorts suggests that the later cohort had more favorable repayment terms a year after they graduated: the average amount borrowed increased by 60 percent (from $12,100 to $19,300, table 2), while the average monthly payment increased by about 30 percent (from $160 to $210, table 11). 20 While both the cumulative amounts borrowed and the monthly loan payments were student reported in a telephone interview and therefore subject to recall error, the average payments appear reasonable for the average amounts borrowed. Assuming the standard 10-year repayment option, amortization tables show that the monthly payment on a $12,100 loan (the average borrowed by 1992-93 graduates) at 8-10 percent interest would be $147-160; the payment on a $19,300 loan (the average for 1999-2000 graduates) at 6-7 percent interest would be $214-224. In 1994, about 58 percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were repaying their loans were paying less than $150 per month (in 2001 constant dollars): 33 percent were paying less than $100, and 25 percent were paying $100-149 per month (figure 6). In the later cohort, about 34 percent were making payments of less than $150 per month (17 percent were paying less than $100 and 17 percent were paying $100-149). The later graduates were more likely than the earlier ones to be paying $200 or more per month (about 50 vs. about 28 percent). For both cohorts, graduates of public 4-year institutions were generally more likely than graduates of private not-for-profit institutions to have a monthly loan payment of less than $100 21 and were less likely to be paying more than $300 (table 11). They paid less on average as well. 19 It may seem counterintuitive that the average monthly payment at each level of borrowing was lower in 2001 than in 1994. This reflects the fact that the later borrowers faced lower interest rates for a given amount borrowed. The overall average monthly payment was higher for the later cohort than the earlier one because there were more graduates who had borrowed at the higher levels. For example, 25 percent of the later borrowers had borrowed $25,000 or more, compared with 7 percent of the earlier borrowers (table 3). 20 While not based on a nationally representative sample of students, a similar pattern of discrepancy was reported by Baum and O'Malley (2003) in the growth rate of undergraduate debt level and monthly repayments based on data from the 2002 National Student Loan Survey conducted by the Nellie Mae Corporation. 21 However, the difference between public doctoral and private not-for-profit non-doctoral institutions was not statistically significant among 1999-2000 graduates.

Why members of the later cohort were more likely to be employed full time is unclear. Possibilities include, for example, more favorable economic conditions for bachelor's degree recipients, a greater need to work full time to meet loan payments, or simply that a greater number of graduates chose to work full time for personal reasons. Among those repaying their loans, 11 percent of the earlier cohort and 6 percent of the later one were employed part time a year later. For both cohorts, approximately 6 percent of those making payments were unemployed or out of the labor force.

While this is a commonly used indicator, there is no widely recognized standard of what constitutes an acceptable level of debt burden (Greiner 1996). Scherschel (1998) noted that mortgage lenders frequently recommend that student loan payments should not exceed 8 percent of their pre-tax income. Baum and O'Malley (2003) pointed out that the payment-to-income ratios associated with the federal income-contingent option for repayment provide a useful benchmark and that they increase with income. The repayment schedule provides for a ratio of 6 percent at the $10,000 income level, rising to 13 percent at $20,000, 15 percent at $30,000, and 18 percent at $70,000. As already indicated, the average monthly payment was higher in 2001 than in 1994 (adjusted for inflation) (table 11), but the average income was higher as well (table 13). The net result was that median debt burden did not increase. For both 1992-93 and 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients who were employed and repaying their loans a year after they had graduated, the median debt burden was about 7 percent (table 14). Goldenberg (2004) estimated comparable levels of debt burden (6 to 7 percent) for all borrowers (not just bachelor's degree recipients) in their first year of repayment for all years from 1997 through 2001 using loan data from a random sample of borrowers in the National Student Loan Data System and income data from the Internal Revenue Service. Among 1999-2000 graduates, 28 percent had a debt burden of less than 5 percent, and about 85 percent had a debt burden of 12 percent or less (figure 8). Another 7 percent had a debt burden of 13-16 percent, and 9 percent had one of 17 percent or more. Graduates in the earlier cohort were more likely than graduates in the later cohort to have a debt burden greater than 12 percent and were less likely to have one in the 9-12 percent range. Low salaries understandably make repaying loans more burdensome. For both cohorts, the lower the income category, the greater the median debt burden (table 14) was. Those with the lowest salaries had a median debt burden of 18 percent in 1994 and 15 percent in 2001, and those with higher incomes had median debt burdens in the 4-9 percent range. In addition, 61 percent of the earlier cohort and 47 percent of the later one who had salaries in the lowest quarter of the salary distribution had debt burdens of 17 percent or more, compared with 2-3 percent of those with the highest earnings. Part-time employment (with its corresponding lower salaries) was associated with greater debt burden. For example, members of the 1999-2000 cohort who were employed part time had a median debt burden of 11 percent, compared with 7 percent for those employed full time. Large amounts borrowed necessitate larger payments and therefore a greater debt burden. For example, graduates in the later cohort who had borrowed $25,000 or more had a median debt burden of 10 percent, compared with 3 percent for those who had borrowed less than $10,000. Reflecting smaller amounts borrowed, graduates of public 4-year institutions were more likely than graduates of private not-for-profit colleges/universities to have a debt burden of less than 5 percent and were less likely to have one of 17 percent or more.

Among 1999-2000 graduates who were repaying their loans, were under 30 years old, and had living parents, 12 percent reported that their parents were helping them with their payments in 2001 (table 15). Note that this may not represent all parents who will ever help. Some graduates who can meet their repayment obligations initially might later run into trouble and receive help. Help from parents was related to parents' income, the amount borrowed, and graduates' salaries. Certain graduates were more likely than others to receive help from their parents, including those who had been dependent students from upper middle-and high-income families while enrolled (vs. those who had been independent students or were from families in the lowest income group); those who had borrowed $25,000 or more (vs. those who had borrowed less than $10,000); and those with the lowest salaries (vs. those with the highest salaries). Help from parents was also related to graduates' employment status and debt burden. Graduates who were employed part time or unemployed were about twice as likely as those employed full time or out of the labor force to have parents who helped them repay their undergraduate education loans (22 vs. about 10 percent). Some 18 percent of graduates who had a debt burden of 17 percent or higher had parents helping them with repayment, in contrast to about 10 percent of graduates who had a debt burden below 17 percent."}, {"section_title": "Other Indicators of Debt Burden", "text": "The relationship between loan payments and earnings is probably the most important indicator of debt burden. However, it does not take into account other types of debts such as credit card balances (which may increase repayment stress) or budgeting skills (which may reduce it) (Scherschel 2000). Therefore, it is useful to look at other details of graduates' financial circumstances and life choices for any signs that undergraduate debt may be creating hardships for them. This section looks at graduates who were not enrolled for further education and compares those who borrowed various amounts with those who had not borrowed in terms of their living arrangements, other financial obligations, propensity to marry, and spouse's debt for undergraduate education.

Among 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients who were not enrolled for further study, 82 percent had their own house or apartment, 16 percent lived with parents or relatives, and 2 percent had other living arrangements a year after graduation (table ). Compared with 1992-93 graduates, 1999-2000 graduates were more likely to live on their own and were less likely to live with parents or relatives even though they were more likely to have borrowed and to have borrowed larger amounts (table 2). Age was a major factor related to the living arrangements of the 1999-2000 graduates. For example, 21 percent of those age 24 and under when they graduated were living with parents or relatives in 2001, compared with 3 percent of those age 30 and above (table 16). Salary level was another major factor. Graduates with the highest salaries were more likely than others to have their own house or apartment and were less likely to be living with parents or other relatives. Among 1999-2000 graduates not enrolled a year later, 89 percent of those with the highest salaries lived in their own house or apartment and 10 percent lived with parents or relatives. In contrast, among their counterparts with lower incomes, 68-83 percent lived on their own and 16-28 percent lived with parents or relatives. For both cohorts, the likelihood of living in their own house or apartment did not appear to be systematically related to the amount borrowed. However, debt burden was a factor. For example, 1999-2000 graduates with a debt burden of less than 5 percent were more likely than those with greater debt burdens to live on their own (89 vs. 77-84 percent) and were generally less likely to live with parents or other relatives (11 vs. 15-21 percent). 22"}, {"section_title": "Other Financial Obligations", "text": "Detailed information on graduates' financial circumstances are not available, but graduates did report on their payments for mortgage or rent and auto loans. Among bachelor's degree recipients in each cohort who were not enrolled for further education, about 78 percent had a mortgage loan or rent payment (table 17). Of 1999-2000 graduates who had such payments, the average amount was $690, which was greater than the average amount paid by 1992-93 graduates ($570, in 2001 constant dollars). The percentage with auto loan payments declined (from 54 to 51 percent), even though the responses for the later cohort may have included payments for a spouse's auto loan as well. 23 The likelihood of having such payments and their size were related to graduates' salaries. The relationships were not linear, but there was always a difference between graduates with the highest and lowest salaries. For example, among 1999-2000 graduates, those with the highest salaries were more likely than those with the lowest salaries to be making mortgage or rent payments (87 vs. 62 percent) and to be paying more, on average ($830 vs. $640).

As debt burden increased (i.e., as student loan payments used up an increasing proportion of their salaries) graduates' ability or willingness to take on other financial obligations was affected. For example, among 1999-2000 graduates repaying their loans, those with a debt burden of less than 5 percent were generally more likely than those greater debt burdens to have a mortgage or rent payment, 24 and when they did, the average amount they paid was larger. In addition, those with a debt burden of less than 5 percent tended to have a larger average auto loan payment than those with greater debt burdens. 25 There was some relationship between other financial obligations and age, reflecting the fact that the passage of time provides more opportunity to take on such obligations and to have earned enough money to take them on. For example, for both cohorts, graduates who had finished college when they were age 25 or older were more likely than those who had finished at age 24 or younger to have mortgage loan or rent payments and if they did, to have larger payments."}, {"section_title": "Marriage", "text": "Among both 1992-93 and 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients who were not enrolled for further education a year later, about 27 percent were married when they graduated (table 18).

In 1994, refers to respondents' employment status in April 1994. Four categories were used in 1994: working full time, working part time, unemployed, and out of the labor force. In 2001, more detailed information was collected about why a respondent was not working, including whether he or she was waiting to report to work, laid off, a homemaker, or disabled. The distinction between working full or part time was self-reported in both years. In 2001, the remaining categories were constructed to approximate as closely as possible definitions used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). BLS defines persons as \"unemployed\" only if they are also looking for work; other unemployed persons are considered \"out of the labor force.\" (More information about the BLS definitions of these concepts are available at: http://stats.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm.) Respondents in 2001 who reported that they were waiting to report to work or had been laid off were not asked whether they were looking for work; they were coded as \"unemployed\" (i.e., it was assumed that they were looking for work). Those who reported that they were homemakers or disabled also were not asked whether they were currently looking for work; they were categorized as being \"out of the labor force\" (i.e., it was assumed that they were not looking for work). The four categories used for each year were as follows: Respondents enrolled in one program were categorized as enrolled full or part time based on their self-report. The few respondents who were enrolled in more than one program were put in a separate category. In 2001, only a very small number of respondents were enrolled in more than one program, and the majority of them were enrolled full time in at least one program; therefore, they were considered enrolled full time in this report. In 1994, respondents who were enrolled in more than one program were considered \"full time\" if their enrollment was full time at least for one of the programs enrolled; otherwise, they were considered \"part time.\" Three categories were used in this report: Not currently enrolled Enrolled part time Enrolled full time Other arrangements Military; housing from job (nonmilitary), religious housing, or other (2001); school-owned housing, employer-provided residence, sorority/fraternity house, or other type of housing (1994). The NPSAS sampling design was a two-stage design in which eligible institutions were selected at the first stage and eligible students were selected at the second stage within eligible, responding sample institutions. At both stages, sampling was stratified and implemented with probabilities proportional to the corresponding sizes in order to make the sample be representative of the relevant population in the United States and Puerto Rico. For sampling purposes, institutions were stratified according to type of control (public, private not-for-profit, and private for-profit) and level (less-than-2-year, 2-year, and 4-year). The B&B interviews were done between June and October in 1994 and between July and November in 2001.

Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data. Readers interested in efforts to minimize nonsampling errors for estimates used in this report should consult the methodology reports referenced earlier in this appendix."}, {"section_title": "Item Response Rates and Bias Analysis", "text": "Weighted item response rates were calculated for all the variables used in this report by dividing the weighted number of valid responses by the weighted population for which the item was applicable. Overall, most of the items had very high response rates. Items with weighted item response rates below 90 percent are shown in table B-1. Five variables had weighted item response rates below 85 percent. In one of these cases (CECURJOB, the primary reason that the respondent did not consider his or her current job the start of a career), the low weighted response rate is due largely to the fact that the variable was applicable to a small proportion of the sample population, yet that proportion included a relatively high percentage of respondents with incomplete interviews. Such respondents are considered to have indeterminate responses, as are respondents who give invalid responses (such as \"Refused\" or \"Don't know\"). Incomplete interviews thus make up a relatively high proportion of the indeterminate responses for this item. However, it is highly likely that the majority of incomplete interviews would have been excluded from the item had their information been gathered, considering that the item applies only to a small proportion of the sample population. When incomplete interviews were excluded from the calculation of the item response rate, the response rate for CECURJOB changed from 81.8 to 97.5 percent. Therefore, for this variable, it is unlikely that reported differences are biased because of missing data. GPAMAJ (grade point average in undergraduate major) from B&B:2000/01 is one of the remaining four variables that has an item response rate below 85 percent. Because this variable was used only once in this report and was presented as a row variable for table 5 on graduate school enrollment a year later, respondents who were missing on GPAMAJ could actually be examined directly and separately (as already done in the table). Respondents missing on GPAMAJ had a graduate school enrollment rate similar to the rate of respondents with a GPA less than 3.0 (17 vs. 15 percent) , both of which were lower than the rate for respondents with a GPA of 3.0 or higher (24 percent). However, the reverse was observed when considering the likelihood of attending graduate school in the future if respondents had not yet done so (67, 60, and 69 percent, respectively). Because respondents missing GPA information appear to differ from those with this information, \"missing\" is shown as a response category. One of the three remaining variables with an item response rate below 85 percent, ALLOWER (monthly payment on undergraduate loans) from B&B:93/94, had a response rate of 84 percent. This variable was used as a column variable (table 11) and to compute EDPCTR. A bias analysis was conducted to determine whether the cases missing values for this variable differed from those with positive values. Cases with missing and positive responses were compared with each other for all the row variables in table 11: GENDER (gender), RETHNIC (race/ethnicity), BAMAJOR (undergraduate major), INCQUTIL (dependency and family income), SECTOR_B (degree-granting institution type), TOTDEBT (total undergraduate debt), and B2EN9404 (enrollment status in 1994). Each of these comparison variables had a response rate of 96.6 percent or higher. Results show that compared with respondents who had positive values on ALLOWER, those with missing values for this variable were less likely to be dependent students from the lowest family income group (14 vs. 21 percent), more likely to have been dependent students in the two highest family income groups (15 and 11 percent vs. 9 and 6 percent), and more likely to have graduated from private not-for-profit doctoral institutions (17 vs. 13 percent). These characteristics were associated with higher monthly payments (table 11). This suggests the possibility that the average reported in the table might have been underestimated-that is, the average would have been higher if the response rate for ALLOWER had been higher. However, respondents with unknown values for ALLOWER were less likely than those with known values not to be enrolled (85 vs. 93 percent), but they were more likely to be enrolled full time (9 vs. 3 percent), which would likely lead to a lower monthly payment (table 11). Nonetheless, in neither possibility of potential bias were the differences between respondents and nonrespondents considerable in magnitude, meaning that if there were any biases, they would have had a limited effect on the overall sample. When combining this with the fact that among all applicable cases for ALLOWER, only 16 percent of them had a missing value, it is unlikely that the estimates reported in table 11 would be seriously biased. For EDPCTR from B&B:2000/01, which measures debt burden (monthly payment as a percentage of monthly income), cases with missing and valid responses were compared with each other for all the row variables in table 14: GENDER (sex), MAJORS4 (undergraduate major), SECTOR9 (degree-granting institution type), TOTDEBT (total undergraduate debt), EMPOLF (employment status in 2001), and CEANNERN (income quarters of salary in 2001). Results show that compared with respondents who had valid values on EDPCTR, those with missing values for this variable were more likely to be male (47 vs. 43 percent) and to have majored in business and management (28 vs. 20 percent) and conversely, they were less likely to be female (53 vs. 57 percent), and to have majored in education or humanities (7 vs. 9 percent and 23 vs. 29 percent, respectively). Since males had lower median debt burden than females did, as did business management majors in comparison to their education or humanities counterparts (table 14), it is possible that by excluding cases that were missing on EDPCTR, data presented in table 14 could have been overestimated. Furthermore, respondents missing on EDPCTR were less likely than their counterparts to have borrowed $25,000 or more (19 vs. 26 percent); thus, they logically could potentially bring down the numbers reported in table 14, had their true values been captured by EDPCTR. However, this possibility of overestimating might have been more or less offset by the fact that respondents with missing values for EDPCTR were more likely than those with known values to have graduated from private, not-for-profit, nondoctoral institutions (24 vs. 19 percent) and less likely to have finished up their bachelor's degree at public non-doctoral institutions (17 vs. 20 percent), which means a possible downward bias since the former had higher median debt burden than the latter did (8 vs. 6 percent, table 14). Because EDPCTR is a critical variable, to further illustrate the potential impact of the missing cases on the statistics reported in table 14, the upper and lower bounds of the possible bias were examined. First, if one assumes that all missing cases happened to be males who had majored in business and management, had borrowed less than $25,000 in total for their undergraduate education, and had graduated from public non-doctoral institutions, then by assigning them each the average value on EDPCTR among respondents with those same characteristics and recalculating the median for the entire sample, one would get the lower bound of the estimate for the true median debt burden in 2001 among all bachelor's degree recipients of year 1999-2000 who were in repayment at the time. Likewise, the upper bound could be obtained by defining all missing cases as females who had majored in education or humanities, had a total undergraduate debt of $25,000 or above, and had completed their bachelor's degree at a private, not-for-profit non-doctoral institution. Using these projections, the lowest and highest bounds for the median estimate of 6.9 reported in table 14 are 5.0 and 9.8. That is, the maximum possible bias could produce estimates between 5 and 9.8 for the median debt burden. The final variable requiring a bias analysis is NBMARR (marital status at NPSAS interview) from B&B:2000/01, which had an item response rate of 77 percent. Like ALLOWER, NBMARR was used only once in the report; it was presented as a column variable in table 18. Therefore, a bias analysis identical to that for ALLOWER was done by comparing nonrespondents with respondents for all the row variables used in the table (table 18): TOTDEBT (total amount borrowed for undergraduate education), CEANNERN (annual salary income), and EDPCTR (debt burden). Nonrespondents differed from respondents only in two respects. First, respondents with missing values for NBMARR were slightly more likely to have borrowed a total of $15, 000-19,999 (13 vs. 11 percent). However, borrowers at this level were as likely as the average students in the cohort to be married at the time of the NPSAS interview (22 vs. 27 percent). Second, nonrespondents were more likely than respondents to have a debt burden averaging between 13 and 16 percent of their monthly income. Nonetheless, as shown in table 18, debt burden was not associated with the likelihood of being married at the time of bachelor's degree receipt. Thus, it is unlikely that those with missing values on NBMARR would have caused much, if any, bias on the relevant statistics reported in this study."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis System", "text": "The estimates presented in this report were produced using the B&B:93/97 and B&B: 2000/01 Data Analysis Systems (DAS).

Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFTs) for each variable in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account the stratified sampling method used in the NPSAS surveys. 2 The B&B samples are not simple random samples, and therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by balanced repeated replication of the sampled population. The procedure is typically referred to as the \"balanced repeated replication technique.\" Table B-2.-Standard errors for table 2: Percentage of 1992-93 and 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients  Table B-2.-who borrowed for their undergraduate education and among those who borrowed, average Table B- The DAS can be accessed electronically at http://nces.ed.gov/DAS.

Differences between estimates are tested against the probability of a Type I error, 3 or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the Student's t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing (p<0.05). Student's t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula: (1) where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates. When estimates are not independent, a covariance term must be added to the formula: t = E -E se + se -2(r)se se 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 (2) 3 A Type I error occurs when one concludes that a difference observed in a sample reflects a true difference in the population from which the sample was drawn, when no such difference is present. where r is the correlation between the two estimates. 4 This formula is used when comparing two percentages from a distribution that adds to 100. If the comparison is between the mean of a subgroup and the mean of the total group, the following formula is used: (3) where p is the proportion of the total group contained in the subgroup. 5 The estimates, standard errors, and correlations can all be obtained from the DAS. There are hazards in using statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of respondents in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in using statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a \"false positive\" or Type I error. In the case of a t statistic, this false positive would result when a difference measured with a particular sample showed a statistically significant difference when there is no difference in the underlying population. Statistical tests are designed to control this type of error, denoted by alpha. The alpha level of .05 selected for findings in this report indicates that a difference of a certain magnitude or larger would be produced no more than one time out of 20 when there was no actual difference in the quantities in the underlying population. When researchers test hypotheses that show t values below the .05 significance level, they treat this finding as rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two quantities. Failing to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., finding no difference), however, does not necessarily imply that the values are the same or equivalent."}]
