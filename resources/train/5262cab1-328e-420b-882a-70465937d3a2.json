The state of Delaware is especially vulnerable to the impacts of coastal storms due to low elevation and that no geographical location in the state is farther than 12.9 km (8 miles) from tidal waters (Runkle et al., 2017). The Delmarva coast was found to be the most vulnerable area on the U.S. East Coast to storm-induced erosion (Zhang et al., 2001). Land subsidence exacerbates the problem resulting in local sea level rise almost double the global sea level rise rate (Bason et al., 2009). These issues, along with the fact that Delaware can be affected by both hurricanes and nor'easters, establish a need to understand the impact of these storms to improve coastal planning and resilience. Coast-related activities have be shown to be critical to the state economy with respect to total industry production, jobs, and tax revenue (Latham & Lewis, 2012). The meteorological behavior and resulting impact vary between the two storm types, as hurricanes tend to cause more damage than nor'easters but for a shorter duration. The duration of intense forcing for a hurricane is typically on the time scale of hours, while the duration of a nor'easter can last for days. Nor'easters usually occur over many tidal cycles and the associated storm surge can be especially destructive during spring tides. The erosion potential for a nor'easter can be similar, if not greater, compared to a hurricane due to the longer duration of intense forcing (Davis & Dolan, 1993;Zhang et al., 2001). The Delaware coastline is often void of offshore sandbars (Roberts et al., 2013), causing initial wave breaking close to shore. Therefore, the beach face acts as a 'first line of defense' against storms while dunes act as a 'last line of defense' to protect coastal infrastructure. In general, the erosional vulnerability of a beach is dependent on the morphological geometry (Aagaard et al., 2005;Wright, 1980). For example, reflective (steep) beaches are more vulnerable to erosion due to subharmonic resonance which can lead to berm overtopping, while dissipative (flat) beaches require strong infragravity (low frequency) oscillations that penetrate to the backbeach (Wright, 1980). The coupling of increased water levels and increased offshore wave heights can drastically change the geometry of the beach during a storm event, often steepening the beach face and depositing sediment offshore in the form of a sandbar. This resultant profile is commonly referred to as a bar-type (or storm) profile, whereas a pre-storm berm-type (or swell) profile has a wide subaerial beach face and no evident offshore sandbar (Komar, 1998) as shown in. Bar and berm-type profiles are also referred to as winter and summer profiles, respectively, due to their seasonal occurrence (Bascom, 1953;Shepard, 1950). However, the common lack of sandbars at Delaware beaches results in an almost evenly distributed planar nearshore deposit (Roberts et al., 2013). Storm-induced berm erosion and the absence of protective sandbars can lead to an increased vulnerability to the backbeach and dunes along the Delaware coastline. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the hydrodynamic forcing and resulting morphodynamic beach response during storm events to properly assess the risk posed to coastal infrastructure. Various in situ sensors were deployed to quantify the hydrodynamic forcing and resulting beach response during extreme storm events at Bethany Beach, Delaware. The sensors were deployed from seaward of the prestorm berm to the dune toe. Various past efforts (Aagaard et al., 2005;Almeida et al., 2013;Harley et al., 2017;Senechal et al., 2011;Stockdon et al., 2006;Vousdoukas et al., 2012) have used remote sensing (e.g. LIDAR and video cameras) or real-time kinematic global positioning units (RTK-GPS) to measure the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics during storms. However, the amount of in situ data collected during a storm across the beach is limited due to the challenging environment. Sensors can become buried or lost, the structures which the sensors are deployed (i.e. scaffold pipes) can fail, and the short time notice of an approaching storm can make logistics difficult. Despite these difficulties, in situ data collection during storm events is needed to understand important physical processes that occur during storm events and thus improve predictive modeling capabilities (Elko et al., 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Storms", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Nor'easter Riley & Nor'easter Toby", "text": "The Delmarva Peninsula was affected by a month-long (March 2018) winter event dubbed \"The Four'easters\", as there were four nor'easter storm events.

Accurate and timely storm impact predictions can be used to inform residents of coastal communities to make the necessary preparations for a storm event or to evacuate their homes entirely. The most well-known storm impact scale is the Saffir-Simpson scale used for hurricanes (Saffir, 1977;Simpson, 1971). The Saffir-Simpson scale ranks hurricanes from Category 1 (minor) to Category 5 (major) depending on the wind speed magnitude. While the Saffir-Simpson scale is appropriate to classify hurricanes due to large wind speeds and duration on the scale of hours, it is not an appropriate classification scale for nor'easters where wind speed magnitudes are rarely that of a hurricane and the duration is on the scale of days. In response, various storm impact scales for nor'easters (Table 1.1) have been proposed that use a combination of offshore wave conditions, duration, storm surge, and storm tide (Dolan & Davis, 1992;Kriebel & Dalrymple, 1995;Zhang et al., 2001). Dolan & Davis (1992) proposed a nor'easter intensity scale based on storm power ( ) calculated as: where is the maximum significant wave height and is the storm duration. Here, a storm was defined as having offshore significant wave heights greater than or equal to 1.5 m. To include the effects of storm surge, Kriebel & Dalrymple (1995) proposed a nor'easter risk index ( ) as: where is the maximum storm surge during the nor'easter. It should be noted in Equation 1.2 that the storm duration is raised to the 0.3 power to reflect a weak dependence on storm duration. An important parameter that Equations 1.1 and 1.2 fail to include is storm tide, the sum of the astronomical tide and storm surge. Multiple studies (Balsillie, 1986(Balsillie, , 1999FitzGerald et al., 1994;Hughes, 1983;Hughes & Chiu, 1981;Steetzel, 1993;Wood, 1982) have shown that a rise in water elevation during a storm event can have a large impact on beach and dune erosion. Zhang et al. (2001) proposed a storm erosion potential index ( ) that includes the effects of storm tide as: where 2 is storm surge values greater than two standard deviations, is the water elevation greater than the MHHW (mean higher high water) and \u0394 is the time interval between measurement values.

Using this measured amount of time and the known speed of sound in air, the sensor-to-target distance ( ) can be calculated as: where is the speed of sound in air, and is the measured transit time of the emitted acoustic energy.

This sensor was referred to as a Photocell Array (PCA, Figure 2.1) as it used a vertical array of 30 photocells, spaced 0.04 m apart, to quantify bed elevation change. When a photocell is exposed (i.e. not buried) ambient light excites the cell, generates an electrical current which flows across a resistor, and the resultant electrical voltage can be recorded by a data logger. However, a major drawback of this sensor is that it would only be viable to use during daylight hours when enough ambient light is present to excite the exposed photocells. Originally, the PCA used programmed Arduino boards to record data from the photocells as Arduino boards were low-cost and compact. However, this required a custom written program to successfully operate the Arduino boards. Also, extreme care had to be taken when transporting the PCA as the wired connections from the photocells to the Arduino boards were delicate and could easily be damaged. The drawbacks of the original PCA prototype inspired the use of a traditional data logger in place of the Arduino boards. This approached seemed to be more successful than the original.

Similar to a standard weather forecast, wave height forecast accuracy decreases as the prediction time relative to the present time increases. Oftentimes the final decision to execute a rapid-response field deployment would be made two to three days prior to the storm event. Visiting the field study site daily at low tide was necessary to adjust or retrieve sensors, obtain cross-shore beach elevation profiles, and perform any other work that was needed. This required accommodation near the field study site to be considered and secured during the logistical planning of the deployments. That said, accommodation near the field study site during Nor'easter Toby was not able to be secured and resulted in less than ideal results. A JFE sensor was lost, no cross-shore elevation profiles throughout the storm were obtained, and sensors were not able to be adjusted to optimize data collection.

An algorithm was previously proposed using an ultrasonic sensor similar to the ADM to measure bed elevation change on a wave-by-wave time scale in the swash zone (Turner et al., 2008). The algorithm identifies bed elevation from water elevation measurements through the application of the following criteria equations: "}, {"section_title": "Data Cleaning", "text": "The recorded water and identified bed elevation data directly from the ADM was found to be noisy, especially during the violent storms such as Nor'easter Riley, and required systematic data cleaning. Some of the raw identified bed elevation values were not realistic due to voltage saturation appearing in the data (Figure 3.3). Voltage saturation can be attributed to the minimum distance limit being exceeded, measurement error due to water contact on the sensing transducer, and delayed sensor response. Despite the numerous invalid bed elevations, realistic bed elevations were successfully identified by the algorithm and could be used to quantify bed elevation change during the storm events. The first data cleaning technique applied, herein referred to as \"RBR Filter\", used a first pass threshold value and the standard deviation of water surface data measured by the RBR sensor. The first pass threshold value eliminated any unrealistic bed elevation values greater than the determined critical elevation. In the case of Figure 3.3, the used first pass threshold value was 1.9 m.  The second data cleaning technique that was applied, herein referred to as \"Sigma Filter\", using Equation 3.3: where \u2032 is a segment of bed elevations over a prescribed time interval, \u0305 is the mean of \u2032 , is the standard deviation of \u2032 , and is a prescribed filter weight. Bed elevation values within segment \u2032 are eliminated if true by Equation 3.3. The Sigma Filter was applied to eliminate any identified bed elevation values that are not close in magnitude to other bed elevation values within a given time interval (Figure 3.5). Various filter weights and time intervals were used for each deployment station and storm event (Table 3.1 and Table 3.2).   (Figure 3.6), herein referred to as \"CLFF Filter\". Bed and water elevations were eliminated using Equation 3.4 and Equation 3.5, respectively: where \u2032 is a CLFF segment over a prescribed time interval, \u2032 is a segment of water elevation over a prescribed time interval, 2 \u2032 is the variance of \u2032 , ( ) is a prescribed upper (lower) filter weight for bed elevations, and is a prescribed filter weight for water elevations. The CLFF Filter was used as a final method to eliminate unrealistic bed and water elevation values (Figure 3.7). The filter used the water elevation variance during 20-minute time intervals and multiplication weights to determine upper and lower limits for bed elevations and lower limits for water elevations. Various filter weights were used for each deployment station and storm event (Table 3.3 and Table 3.4).    The remaining bed elevation data from the aforementioned data cleaning techniques were again low pass filtered at a higher frequency (0.25 Hz) to obtain a second CLFF. The second CLFF allowed for the calculation of water depth which accounted for bed morphodynamics (Section 3.3.3). However, when bed elevations are not able to be identified due to continuously submerged bed, the CLFF does not accurately represent instantaneous bed elevation and cannot be used.   \nAs described in section 2.1.2, the JFE sensing unit was initially deployed 0.10 m above the pre-storm bed elevation and was adjusted to 0.10 m above the day-time low tide bed elevation in response to a naturally dynamic bed. Due to the rapid morphodynamic beach response during a storm event, it was imperative to eliminate recorded velocity data at the time when the JFE sensing unit was buried due to accretion or at an elevation too high to be submerged by the uprush or backwash (Figure 3.14). A CLFF of bed elevations, measured water elevations, and GPS surveyed bed elevation assisted in determining invalid JFE velocity data. Equation 3.7 provides the condition to eliminate invalid JFE velocity data between times of day-time low tide. The condition is updated every day-time low tide due to JFE adjustment of 0.10 m above the present bed elevation at that time. where is the CLFF of bed elevations, is the JFE sensing unit elevation ( + 0.10 m), is a tolerance distance for bed elevations applied to the JFE, and is a tolerance distance for water elevations applied to the JFE.  \nThe use of fixed in situ pressure sensors in the swash or inner surf zone to measure water depth has drawbacks due to bed morphodynamics during storm events. The effects of bed morphodynamics can result in the mismeasurement of water depth when the bed below the fixed RBR sensor elevation rises or falls. Similarly to the JFE sensor, the RBR sensor became buried due to accretion and the time of burial had to be determined to properly clean the measured depth data (Figure 3.18). The data cleaning technique applied to determine the RBR time of burial is similar to Equation 3.7 that was applied to determine JFE time of burial. Equation 3.8 is the condition to eliminate invalid RBR depth data between times of day-time low tide.

It can be seen in Equation 4.1 that is simply the ratio between the beach or coastal structure slope and the square root of the deep water wave steepness ( ).

The fact that has been empirically confirmed and derived using various numerical schemes has justified the parameters importance. Numerous empirical formulas used in coastal engineering to quantify processes such as run-up, run-down, and reflection are dependent on the parameter (Battjes, 1974;Battjes & Roos, 1975;van Gent, 2001;Hunt, 1959;Mase, 1989). A major development made by Battjes (1974) was to use values to quantitatively indicate the wave breaker type (Table 4.1) and not just as a binary wave breaking criteria. The wave breaker types that were assessed included spilling breakers, plunging breakers, and collapsing/surging breakers (Galvin, 1972). Spilling breakers occur during a highly dissipative beach state, while collapsing/surging breakers occur during a highly reflective beach state (Wright & Short, 1984). The deep water wave length was calculated using Equation 4.2: where is the measured peak period obtained from the wave buoy. The measured wave height from the wave buoy had to be reverse shoaled, if necessary, to accurately estimate the deep water wave height. Reverse shoaling was applied to the measured wave height if the deep water condition (Equation 4.3) was not true. The water depth where wave measurements were obtained was 30 m. Reverse shoaling involved calculation of the shoaling coefficient (Equation 4.4) and the application of the shoaling coefficient to the measured wave data (Equation 4.5). where is the wave number ( = 2 ).

Spectral analysis involves transforming time series data (e.g. wave height or run-up) to the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform. Examining data in the frequency domain is advantageous and allows the generation of physical processes to be identified. It is common practice in coastal engineering to calculate the total energy of a wave field by integrating the energy density spectrum which is obtained through spectral analysis (Dean & Dalrymple, 1991). Spectral analysis has been performed on a time series of hydrodynamic data (e.g. water elevation or water velocity) during storm events to study the propagation of low frequency energy (i.e. infragravity waves). Infragravity waves have periods ranging from 20 s -300 s and have been shown to play a role in offshore bar formation and migration, coastline erosion, and beach cusp formation from specific types of infragravity waves known as edge waves (Aagaard, 1990;Holman, et al., 1978;Russell, 1993;Senechal et al., 2011). Studies conducted to measure vertical run up elevation have also examined the role of spectral energy within the infragravity frequency band ( < 0.05 Hz), as vertical run up within the incident frequency band ( > 0.05 Hz) has been shown to saturate even as offshore wave heights increase due to wave breaking (Baldock & Holmes, 1999; R.T.

In situ data collection was attempted during a second extreme storm event (Nor'easter Toby) but was unsuccessful due to structural failure, emphasizing the necessity to deploy sensors with extreme structural integrity and to frequently visit the study site for sensor adjustment and retrieval. Despite the drawbacks experienced during Nor'easter Toby, the field studies during Nor'easter Riley and the Easter Eve Storm demonstrated the ability to successfully collect in situ field data during storm events and to identify possible research areas for future studies. The ADM proved to be useful in the Nor'easter Riley and Easter Eve Storm deployments with the ability to measure water and bed elevation. Water depth was able to be calculated using a CLFF of measured bed elevations, when bed elevations were able to be identified, and showed to be more accurate than measuring water depth in situ due to a dynamic bed. Water velocity proved to be difficult to accurately measure, as the continuous submergence and emergence of the JFE EM resulted in unrealistic velocities during calm conditions. Bed elevation measurements from the ADM allowed for nearly instantaneous measurements to study morphodynamics during storm events. The primary morphodynamic processes measured during Nor'easter Riley and the Easter Eve Storm was berm erosion and the resulting beach face steepening. While the effects of storm wave forcing on beach erosion is well known, berm erosion proved to also be an important factor to backbeach vulnerability. The largest amount of measured berm erosion was 0.8 m (Nor'easter Riley) and 0.47 m (Easter Eve Storm). Morphodynamic change was measured at the more landward deployment stations following berm erosion coupled with increased wave heights and wave periods compared to pre-storm conditions. The morphodynamic feedback associated with intensified wave forcing and berm erosion was shown to increase backbeach vulnerability but could also increase dune vulnerability during more intense storms. Through spectral analysis an increase in low frequency (infragravity) energy was measured during the storm events, suggesting an importance to berm erosion and backbeach morphodynamic change. The in situ field data collected during Nor'easter Riley were used to calibrate the numerical model, XBeach. The calibration of five input parameters were performed and evaluated based on the highest resulting BSS value. The calibrated input parameter values are shown in Table 5.3 and should be applied to other storm events on the Delaware coast to evaluate their validity. The types of collected in situ field data during Nor'easter Riley and the Easter Eve Storm are fundamental in understanding the complexity of beach response to extreme forcing, which in turn can be used to improve predictive numerical models (e.g. XBeach, CShore) and coastal management decisions. Despite successful data collection, areas of improvement have been identified and should be implemented in future studies. These areas include a more accurate way to measure water velocity in the swash zone during storm events, the inclusion of more cross-shore transects to measure alongshore coastal processes, and the development (and inclusion) of a sensor, similar to the PCA, to continuously measure bed elevation even when the bed is submerged."}]
