[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Using a nationally representative sample of kindergarteners and first graders, this study asks if native-language test translations help English language learners (ELLs) demonstrate their mathematics skills. ELLs frequently encounter testing hurdles because they are not proficient in English, the predominant language of assessments. Low scores on these assessments can limit ELLs' academic opportunities through inappropriate track placements and decreased confidence. This study uses a rigorous quasi-experimental design (regression discontinuity design) and finds that Spanish-speaking ELLs perform significantly better on mathematics assessments when tested in Spanish (instead of English) in kindergarten and first grade (Cohen's ds > 0.85). Because these and other findings suggest that test translations may provide ELLs with opportunities to demonstrate their mathematics knowledge, policy makers should consider adding translations to the list of available accommodations."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "nglish language learners (ELLs)-students not yet proficient in English, according to school criteria-are one of the fastest growing student populations and also one of the lowest achieving populations in both reading and mathematics (Reardon & Galindo, 2009; Reardon & Robinson, 2008) . One major contributing factor to this perceived underperformance is the linguistic complexity of the assessments (see, e.g., Abedi, Hofstetter, & Lord, 2004; Abedi, Lord, & Hofstetter, 1998; Kieffer, Lesaux, Rivera, & Francis, 2009; Kopriva, 2000; LaCellePeterson & Rivera, 1994; Rivera, Collum, Willner, & Sia, 2006; Solano-Flores, 2008; Willner, Rivera, & Acosta, 2008) . By definition, ELLs have not attained English proficiency. Thus assessments given in English may impair ELLs' test performance simply by making the content of the questions inaccessible and, in turn, rendering the assessment results (and their uses) invalid. It is important to note that linguistic complexity can affect test performance in fields other than language arts, such as mathematics and science.\nIn mathematics, accommodations (e.g., bilingual dictionaries, simplified English, extra time, and setting adjustments) are often provided for ELLs because we question whether the unaccommodated test possesses construct validity, in the sense that the score reflects the student's knowledge of the underlying construct intended to be measured (i.e., mathematics) and not unintended constructs such as English language proficiency. Thus accommodations are intended to reduce the influence of factors that are irrelevant to one's mathematics knowledge (e.g., English language proficiency), which would otherwise add constructirrelevant variance to the measure (for an in-depth discussion of construct validity and other threats to it, see Messick, 1989b) . Indeed, as the linguistic complexity of mathematics and science items decreases, the gap in test scores between ELLs and non-ELLs diminishes, suggesting that the lack of English proficiency for ELLs biases their test scores downward, resulting in underestimation of their true mathematical and scientific knowledge (e.g., Abedi, 2002 Abedi, , 2004 Abedi & Lord, 2001; Abedi et al., 1998 ).\nYet using an accommodation raises questions about the effectiveness and validity of the accommodation itself . For an accommodation to be effective, it should improve the measured outcomes (e.g., mathematics test scores) of individuals given the accommodation relative to the outcomes of otherwise identical individuals not given the accommodation. For an accommodation to be valid, providing the accommodation should improve outcomes only for the target population (e.g., ELLs), the group for whom we believed the unaccommodated test to have construct-irrelevant difficulty; otherwise, if nontarget populations also benefit from the accommodation, then they should receive it too. For example, extra time may be effective for ELLs, but it would not be a valid accommodation if non-ELLs also benefitted from extra time and were not provided with the accommodation (as in Abedi, Lord, Hofstetter, & Baker, 2000) . Unfortunately, many accommodations for ELLs tend to be ineffective (Kieffer et al., 2009 ) and may have questionable validity ; but see Kieffer et al., 2009) .\nThe current study deals with the effectiveness of translating a mathematics test from English into the student's native languagea promising, yet greatly understudied, accommodation cf. Kieffer et al., 2009; Rivera et al., 2006; Willner et al., 2008) . Although the focus of the study is on effectiveness, the likely validity of the specific translation used here is discussed later. To date, rigorous research on the effectiveness of mathematics test translations is severely lacking: Only one such study exists, an experiment conducted on eighth graders in Southern California, which suggested that the language of the assessment should match"}, {"section_title": "The Effects of Test Translation on Young English Learners' Mathematics Performance", "text": "Joseph P. Robinson novembeR 2010 583 the language of instruction (Abedi et al., 1998; . In the current study, I examine whether native-language test translations in mathematics can improve test scores for a nationally representative sample of Spanish-speaking kindergarten and first-grade ELLs. Young ELLs have their entire academic trajectories still ahead of them and therefore arguably have the most to lose from artificially low test results.\nSystematically underreporting the mathematical skills of ELLs has serious consequences for the individual students and their schools. The use of (and even deference to) assessments in student promotion (Jacob, 2009 ) and tracking decisions (Robinson, 2010; Sol\u00f3rzano, 2007) means that these students will likely experience unnecessarily repeated content and inappropriately low track placement, which is associated with slower paced instruction and less new content coverage (Oakes, 2005; Rowan & Miracle, 1983) . Also, by scoring low on tests, these students will repeatedly receive signals that their mastery of mathematical concepts is lower than they believed it to be (and than it in fact is), potentially affecting their self-efficacy in mathematics (Bandura, 1997) , which can (a) adversely affect their mathematics performance (Bandura, 1993; Pajares & Miller, 1994) and (b) make them less likely to choose a mathematics-related college major (Hackett & Betz, 1989) . Moreover, there is evidence that prior mathematics achievement is a stronger predictor of mathematics self-efficacy for Hispanics than for Whites (Stevens, Olivarez, Lan, & Tallend-Runnels, 2004) , suggesting that Hispanics may be more affected by negative signals than their White peers are. Negative instructional experiences as early as first grade have been linked to much later outcomes, such as dropping out of high school, even after conditioning on a host of other risk factors (Alexander, Entwisle, & Horsey, 1997) ; thus very early assessments may have a dramatic impact on students' academic trajectories. In addition to the negative consequences for individual students, systematic underreporting of the scores of even one demographic subgroup (here, ELLs) can result in sanctions for an entire school (Abedi, 2004; Bryant et al., 2008) because of recent increases in school-level accountability under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act.\nLamentably, a number of the accommodations used (e.g., flexible scheduling, setting adjustments) have been borrowed from the special education literature, without strong evidence of their effectiveness for ELLs (LaCelle-Peterson & Rivera, 1994; Willner et al., 2008) . The problem is that accommodations developed for other student populations were intended to improve the test's construct validity for those populations, not to address the source (or sources) of construct invalidity for ELLs. What are needed are \"ELL-responsive\" accommodations (Rivera et al., 2006) , which provide linguistic support intended to address the source of construct-irrelevant bias for ELLs (i.e., unnecessary linguistic complexity); a native-language mathematics test translation is an example of such an accommodation.\nAlthough it appears intuitive that children from Spanishspeaking homes could benefit from test translations (cf. Rivera et al., 2006) , prior related research casts doubt on whether translating the test would lead to better scores. First, mathematics is believed to be language neutral, and other ELLresponsive accommodations (e.g., simplified English) have not been very effective Kieffer et al., 2009 ). Second, recent work has shown that some bilingual children, especially those from Spanish-speaking families of low socioeconomic status, do not speak Spanish very well (P\u00e1ez, Tabors, & L\u00f3pez, 2007) . Thus if their Spanish language skills are not well developed, translating the test for them may not help. Third, even if these children's Spanish skills are adequate, they may not have mathematics-specific knowledge in Spanish (Butler & Stevens, 1997; cf. Kieffer et al., 2009; Solano-Flores, 2008) . Fourth, research by Kopriva, Emick, Hipolito-Delgado, and Cameron (2007) suggests that accommodations are most effective when tailored to meet the specific needs of the individual child rather than when a single blanket approach such as translation is used. Given the numerous reasons to expect little or no effect, a finding that test translations actually improve achievement scores would provide compelling evidence that translations should be seriously (re)considered by educators and policy makers alike.\n"}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "The study capitalizes on a unique feature in the assessment design of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), a longitudinal data set collected by the U.S. Department of Education. The ECLS-K includes 21,399 students, a sample that is nationally representative 1 of U.S. kindergarteners in 1998-1999 (for further details, see supplemental document available on the journal website, Text 1). In the ECLS-K, a student's score on the English-proficiency screening test (i.e., the Oral Language Development Scale [OLDS]) determined if a student living in a home where a language other than English was spoken understood English well enough to receive assessments in English (see online supplemental document, Text 2). Spanish-speaking students scoring 36 points or less (on the OLDS scale from 0 to 60) were given the mathematics assessment in Spanish, whereas Spanish-speaking students scoring 37 points or more were assessed in English. 2 Students who score 36 points or less in the prior test period (e.g., fall of kindergarten) are given the OLDS assessment in later test periods (e.g., spring of kindergarten) until they score at least 37 points. The ECLS-K data set includes 1,815 Hispanic students who live in homes where Spanish is spoken and for whom there are available OLDS scores, mathematics scores, and sampling weights from at least one period of the study (n = 1,618, n = 1,079, and n = 576 in the fall of kindergarten, spring of kindergarten, and spring of first grade, respectively). The 1,618 students in the fall of kindergarten came from 701 different classrooms in 294 different schools across the nation. Note that students could remain in the analytic sample only if they had available English OLDS scores in that wave, meaning that they did not attain an English OLDS score of at least 37 points in a prior wave. Thus the reduction in sample size from fall kindergarten to later waves of data is primarily not the result of attrition, but rather an artifact of the study design; regardless, the reduction in sample size does not bias the study's estimates (see online supplemental document, Text 5, for additional details)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Procedures", "text": "The ECLS-K mathematics assessments were created by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) based on existing and educational ReseaRcheR 584 commonly used commercial assessments, including the Test of Early Mathematics Ability-Third Edition, the WoodcockJohnson III, and the Peabody Individual Achievement TestRevised. To avoid the threats to item-level comparability that have beset prior research on translation-based accommodations (Hambleton, 2005; Kopriva, 2000 ; see also Abedi et al., 2004 , for a review), ETS used a rigorous approach to item translation and validation (see online supplemental document, Text 4). This process involved translating the original English-version items into Spanish, then back-translating them into English, followed by differential-item-functioning analyses, a review of items by developmental and Spanish language experts, comparisons of actual versus predicted item performance, and item-responsetheory fit statistics-all of which revealed no consistent evidence of item-level effects and were found to \"support the conclusion that the two versions of the test are functioning in a similar manner\" (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2002, Section 5, p. 15) . Given the rigorous process used in ECLS-K, the typical problem of questionable item-level comparability is negligible in this case, meaning that it is very unlikely that any effects observed here are caused by poor item translation.\nWhether assessed in English or Spanish, each student was administered the untimed mathematics assessment by an ECLS-K employee (i.e., someone unfamiliar with the student), either in a quiet section of the classroom or elsewhere in the school (see online supplemental document, Text 3). Examiners of Spanish-speaking students were bilingual speakers and from the same region of the United States (to reduce dialect differences). Moreover, examiners were trained by the U.S. Department of Education and were familiar with the wording of the English and Spanish mathematics items. The session began with the examiner administering the English OLDS test and recording the child's responses on a computer. The computer calculated the child's score and indicated whether the mathematics assessment would be in Spanish or English. The sequence of the assessments during a session for English OLDS \"passers\" was English OLDS, literacy assessment (in English), mathematics assessment (in English), followed by other assessments. For English OLDS \"nonpassers,\" the session sequence was English OLDS, Spanish OLDS, mathematics assessment (in Spanish), followed by other assessments. Thus, for each group, the mathematics assessment was the third given in the sequence. Also, regardless of a child's score on the literacy assessment (for English OLDS \"passers\") or Spanish OLDS (for English OLDS \"nonpassers\"), children were still given the mathematics assessment in the language determined solely by the English OLDS score. Note that all assessments in a session (e.g., English OLDS, mathematics test) were given to one child in a single session, not over a period of sessions (and not switching examiners).\nFor each item of the mathematics assessment, the examiner read the question (e.g., \"What number is this?\" in English versus \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 n\u00famero es \u00e9ste?\" in Spanish) while the child saw only the stimulus (e.g., the number \"14\") on an easel. The examiner recorded the child's responses to each test item on a laptop computer. At the end of the assessment, the examiner was not informed of the child's score and neither was the child or the child's teacher."}, {"section_title": "Design and Statistical Analyses", "text": "The design of this study can be thought of as a \"natural experiment.\" We can assume that students with OLDS scores of 36 and 37 (i.e., who differ by only 1 point on a 61-point scale) are virtually identical, so we can treat language of assessment as a coin toss.\n3 This allows us to assess how the test language affects these students' ability to demonstrate their mathematics skills. A first approach to this estimation is to restrict the analysis to students scoring 36 or 37 points on the OLDS and compare (e.g., with a t test) the mathematics scores of these otherwise identical groups of students to find out the effect of the language of the assessment. A second approach is to broaden the range of students included in the estimation and then model the relationship between mathematics scores and the full range of OLDS scores but still estimate the effect of the assessment language at the screening test threshold (here, 36.5 points, halfway between 36 and 37). 4 This latter approach, referred to as a \"regression discontinuity design,\" uses more data than the simple t-test comparison in order to (a) gain precision in estimation and (b) stabilize the estimate if the data are noisy near the threshold. Regression discontinuity is viewed as the closest approximation to an experimental design that can be obtained from nonexperimental data (Bloom, 2010; Murnane & Willett, 2010; Robinson & Reardon, 2009; Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002) . Moreover, I used flexible, local linear regression models to estimate the regression discontinuity effects. Local linear regression is essentially a series of smaller linear regressions, each using data from a narrow bandwidth of screening test scores (see Hahn, Todd, & van der Klaauw, 2001 ). This advanced approach yields estimated effects that are determined by the actual data rather than by the researcher's assumptions about the correct functional form of the model. Even this nonparametric method, however, requires the researcher to decide on how wide the \"bandwidth\" (i.e., the window of data points included in each miniregression) of the local linear regression should be. This article follows the recommended practice of presenting several sets of estimated effects , each with a different choice of bandwidth. If the estimated effects are similar in magnitude and significance across a reasonable set of bandwidth options, this suggests that the effects are robust and not driven by modeling assumptions.\nIn this article, three different bandwidths were used for the local linear regressions (\u00b11, \u00b12, and \u00b13 points on the OLDS assessment). For instance, with a \u00b11-point bandwidth, a series of miniregressions with mathematics scores as the outcome are estimated using data from students within a window of 2 OLDS points (1 point below to 1 point above) from a given point. Specifically, if estimating the mathematics score of students with an OLDS score of 20, we would fit a linear regression using data from students with scores of 19, 20, and 21; then, we would move to estimating the mathematics score at an OLDS score of 21, fitting a regression using data from students scoring 20, 21, and 22 on the OLDS test. This is repeated for all values of OLDS scores up to the screening test threshold, and a smoothed curve is obtained. A separate smoothed curve is obtained linking the estimated regression for all OLDS values above the threshold. Of interest to this study is the vertical distance (i.e., the difference in novembeR 2010 585 mathematics scores) estimated between students at the screening test threshold, where the change in test language occurs.\nThe results from the three different bandwidth specifications were similar (and were also similar to a simple t test at the threshold), as shown in Table 1 . For brevity, the main text of this article refers to the results (e.g., Cohen's d effect sizes, p values) only from the models with a bandwidth of \u00b12 points. However, the fact that any approach attempted yielded the same results (shown in Table 1 ) underscores the robustness of the findings. Also of interest, Figure 1 illustrates the logic of the regression discontinuity design, using local linear regressions with \u00b12-point bandwidths (see online supplemental document, Text 5, for additional details on the methodologies).\nThe overall mathematics outcome measures have been normalized to a mean of 0 and a pooled standard deviation of 1 throughout the English OLDS spectrum within each assessment period (see online supplemental document, Text 5). This is done to facilitate interpreting the main results as effect sizes (i.e., Cohen's d; . Finally, all analyses use the appropriate NCESprovided cross-sectional child-sampling weight to account for the complex sampling design of this nationally representative study."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Effects on Mathematics Test and Subcomponents", "text": "In the fall of kindergarten, Spanish-speaking students exhibited no effect of the language of assessment (p = .49; Figure 1 , left panel). To see why this is the case, I explored the types of items that students in each condition answered correctly-specifically, determining which item types students were likely to be \"proficient at,\" meaning they could likely answer correctly more than half of the time (see online supplemental document, Text 6). Table 2 shows that, in the fall of kindergarten, regardless of the assessment language, students near the screening test threshold had a high probability of being proficient at answering simple one-digit counting questions (M Spanish = 0.77 versus M English = 0.82, p = .59) but not the more challenging and language-intensive questions regarding relative size, sequence (which contains simple word problems), and simple addition/subtraction, probably because those concepts had not been taught yet. It is not surprising to see no testing language effect on the simple counting items because their language-processing demands are low. Thus the effect of the testing language may not appear because these children are likely only guessing at the more advanced, language-intensive material; the testing language should matter more when they can move beyond guessing at these questions.\nHowever, in the spring of kindergarten, when students near the screening test threshold did have a good chance of correctly answering more difficult and linguistically taxing questions, a large negative effect (Cohen' Note. Jackknifed standard errors (SEs) appear in parentheses below estimated effects. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) appear in square brackets below the standard errors. The p value is based on a two-sided alternative hypothesis. All estimates use the appropriate sampling weights provided by the National Center for Education Statistics. Local linear regressions use an Epanechnikov kernel. Bandwidth refers to the size of the bandwidth used when fitting the local linear regression at any point. The effects obtained using local linear regressions with bandwidths of \u00b12 points are referred to in the main text of the article. Regardless of estimation strategy, the translation effects are not significant in the fall of kindergarten (ps > .490) but are significant in the spring of kindergarten (ps < .032) and in the spring of first grade (ps < .050).

Also, it is worth reiterating here that similar effect sizes were obtained across the various bandwidth choices of the regression discontinuity models as well as the t tests; thus the magnitude of these results is not an artifact of the model specification."}, {"section_title": "Assessing the Plausibility of Alternative Explanations for the Observed Effects", "text": "In principle, it is possible that these results are due to some anomaly, such that students with lower mathematics skills just happened to cluster above the OLDS threshold. An initial concern may be that students were purposely placed into one condition or the other on the basis of prior knowledge of the individual student's potential performance in the different conditions. Although this is a common concern in regression discontinuity designs (McCrary, 2008) , it is extremely unlikely here for several reasons. First, the ECLS-K examiners have never met these children before and have no incentive to intentionally place children into one condition or the other; plus, the outcome of the test itself has no ramifications for the students in the study. In addition to this justification, we can examine the empirical distribution of observations (McCrary, 2008) . Specifically, if one condition (e.g., testing in Spanish) were clearly preferred to the other, then we should see a substantial shift in the density of observations clustered on one side of the discontinuity. This clustering does not occur in the least (see online supplemental document, Figure S2 ), further suggesting that manipulation is not a concern here. Aside from condition manipulation, one might ask whether factors other than testing language changed sharply at the discontinuity and whether we were thus misattributing the observed effects to the difference in test language (Shadish et al., 2002) . In this study, this concern is also unwarranted. First, the ECLS-K documentation makes it clear that no other accommodations or conditions changed at the OLDS threshold. The second piece of evidence that students in the English and Spanish versions of the test were similar at the time of the assessment comes from an independent measure of mathematics achievement. That is, the ECLS-K asked each student's teacher to rate the student's mathematics skills, solely on the basis of the teacher's in-class impressions of the student's skills and demonstrated abilities (see online supplemental document, Text 7). Note that teachers were never informed of any student's OLDS score, the language of the mathematics assessment, or direct cognitive assessment scores. Therefore, there was no reason that teachers should rate the skills of students scoring 36 points on the OLDS any differently than they rated students scoring 37 points, unless they perceived some true difference in skills between the groups. As expected, there were no differences at any time point between the English-and Spanish-version test takers (at the screening test threshold) in teachers' ratings of students' mathematical skills (ps > .36), or even literacy (ps > .40) or general knowledge (ps > .31; see online supplemental document, Table S2 ). This provides direct evidence that students near the language-screening threshold had similar mathematical skills (and even similar other academic skills); however, assessing their mathematical skills in English prevented these ELLs from demonstrating their skills."}, {"section_title": "No Evidence That the Language of Instruction Moderates the Effect of the Translation", "text": "In addition to exploring the overall effect of an accommodation, it is important to determine if certain classroom conditions moderate the accommodation effect, such that a particular accommodation is differentially beneficial under certain circumstances Fall kindergarten . For example, prior research on eighth graders suggested that the language of instruction moderates the translation effect and is more important than the language of the home when determining language of assessment. That is, if the eighth-grade ELLs were instructed in a bilingual classroom, where Spanish was regularly used for instruction, they exhibited a positive effect of the Spanish translation. However, the ELLs in mainstream English classrooms did better when assessed with the original English version . Focusing on a much younger population, however, the current study finds substantial overall effects of the translation in the spring of kindergarten and first grade and finds no evidence that the language of instruction moderates the effect of the translation in the spring of kindergarten (p = .90) or first grade (p = .75). That is, regardless of whether students receive instruction partly in Spanish or solely in English, the effect of being assessed in English is in the negative direction. However, the tests for differential effects have relatively low power; thus this topic should be explored in future research (see online supplemental document, Text 8 and Table S3 ). Unlike the conclusions drawn for older students, the significant overall translation effects in this study suggest that the home language in the beginning years of formal schooling is an important factor and should be considered when deciding language of assessment. As mathematical terminology and concepts become more complex in later grades, it is more likely that parents will rely on schools to teach the curricular material rather than helping their children learn the advanced material at home-thus it is not surprising that older students may perform better when tested in the language they are instructed in rather than the home language."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Using a nationally representative data set, a high-quality test translation, and a series of rigorous regression discontinuity designs, this study finds that native-language test translations can help very young ELLs demonstrate their mathematics skills. In the spring of kindergarten and first grade, students tested in Spanish (i.e., their home language) performed significantly better on mathematics assessments than did students tested in English, despite the fact that both groups of students had similar English language ability and teacher-reported mathematics skills. In addition to contributing quasi-experimental estimates to the limited existing literature on the effects of mathematics test translations, this article extends the focus to younger students whose academic trajectories may be greatly influenced by very early assessments. (Willner et al., 2008) . Although most states' assessments begin after first grade (typically, in second or third grade), it is plausible that the effects observed here extend to ELLs in the early years of state-mandated assessments. In addition, even ELLs in first grade will likely experience some form of district assessment. The results of this study highlight a tension for district administrators: If the objective of the district is to predict how well students will perform on state assessments, then they should provide accommodations for ELLs that match the accommodations structure of state assessments; however, if the goal is to obtain valid measures of students' actual knowledge, this may require using accommodations on the district tests that are not offered on the state tests. Note that this tension exists with respect to older ELLs as well, as districts will often implement their own assessments in addition to state assessments (Jacob, 2009; cf. Rivera et al., 2006) . Clearly, this issue affects policy makers at all levels (federal, state, and district), and the interplay between policies at the various levels warrants further study."}, {"section_title": "Test Translation Policies and Their Implications for Various Stakeholders", "text": "Yet individual students and the schools that serve them are not the only ones affected by invalid measures of student assessment. This question of valid assessments lies at the heart of virtually all education policy (e.g., NCLB, Race to the Top, value-added modeling). As the proportion of non-native English speakers grows and policies are increasingly likely to tie teacher evaluations to student performance, valid assessments for these students (and the ramifications of invalid assessments) will become vitally important to teachers as well. Furthermore, any research that relies on invalid measures of student achievement is compromised. Note. The estimated average item-cluster proficiency probabilities for students tested in Spanish and English are derived from regression discontinuity models. E -S is the difference between the average estimated probability for students at the screening test threshold taking the English version and those at the screening test threshold taking the Spanish version.

This study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of test translation in a particular context, but it does not speak directly to the validity of this translation. Translation validity could be empirically assessed with a comparison group of non-ELLs who are equally proficient in English and Spanish . If this group of non-ELLs performed equally well in the Spanish and English versions of the test, we would be confident that the construct being measured was not altered by the translation; thus the translation would be considered valid. In the context of the current study, however, accommodation validity can only be assessed indirectly (and rather informally) by assessing the quality of the translation. The documentation suggests the test translation quality is very high (U.S. Department of Education, NCES, 2002), implying that this specific test translation should be valid. Nevertheless, a more direct study of translation validity would be preferred."}, {"section_title": "Subsequent uses of test scores.", "text": "An important aspect of test validity concerns the subsequent uses of the test results (AERA, APA, & NCME, 1999; Messick, 1989a Messick, , 1989b Messick, , 1995 ; but see Borsboom, Mellenbergh, & van Heerden, 2004 , for a different perspective). For instance, how are the ability-grouping structures of the classroom influenced by students' test scores, and how does providing an accommodation alter the ability groups through its effect on test scores? Unfortunately, this issue cannot be addressed with the ECLS-K data set, as the test results were never reported to the teachers and could not possibly affect the placements or trajectories of these students. In one respect, this bolsters the causal warrant of the regression discontinuity design because there is no incentive to manipulate the OLDS rating-score variable; yet this disassociation from the assessment-teaching feedback loop means that we cannot explore the effect of test translation on instruction.\nGeneralizability. Although the fact that the ECLS-K is nationally representative facilitates generalizations to the broader kindergarten and first-grade population of Spanish-speaking children, other features of the study may hamper generalizability. First, as noted before, students in both the English and Spanish conditions were administered the test one-on-one, orally, and with no time limit. Although these other testing features were common to both conditions (and thus do not affect the causal claims of this article), they may limit generalizability of the results to situations where the testing context was similar to that in this study. Second, this study cannot answer how effective native-language test translations would be for non-Spanish-speaking language minority children. As the language minority population becomes more numerous and more diverse, this question must undoubtedly be addressed. One potential issue, however, concerns the considerable cost and time-consuming nature of creating highquality translations in a variety of languages (Hambleton, 2005; Stansfield, 2003) ; future work should produce cost-benefit analyses whenever possible. Third, because the regression discontinuity design estimates the testing language effect at the OLDS threshold (where the testing language changes), the effects estimated here are generalizable only to students with a certain intermediate level of English proficiency. Future research should explore the effects of test translation among students of lower English proficiency, who may benefit even more from translations."}, {"section_title": "Is Test Translation a Catchall Solution?", "text": "Even though this article demonstrates that young ELLs can benefit from high-quality translations for mathematics assessments in given contextual settings, translations may not be a panacea. Undeniably, the ELL population is an extremely heterogeneous group of students (August & Hakuta, 1997), varying not only in languages spoken but also in countries of origin, immigrant-generational status (Reardon & Galindo, 2009 ), length of time in the United States (Conger, 2009) , level of English proficiency in various modalities (Solano-Flores & Trumbull, 2008) , and dialect of native language spoken (Solano-Flores, 2006) , to name just a few dimensions of diversity empirically related to achievement. Each one of these variables can influence how a student benefits from (or is harmed by) an accommodation. Thus concern is warranted that no single type of accommodation should be assumed to serve the needs of the full spectrum of ELLs (cf. Kopriva et al., 2007; Willner et al., 2008) . Indeed, Kopriva et al. (2007) suggest a targeted approach to providing accommodations, because different students are likely to benefit from different types of accommodations. This argument has direct implications for the current study, as the students tested were not provided targeted accommodations. As a consequence, it may be that some of the students in this study would have benefited more from other types of accommodations (e.g., simplified English). However, absent such targeted accommodations, the higher scores of students in the Spanish-version condition do suggest that translation may be an effective means of improving the validity of young ELLs' mathematics assessments.\nAlthough it is insufficient for translations to be the only accommodation option, the effectiveness of test translations demonstrated in this article suggests that policies must incorporate test translations as an option (among others) in order to best serve the growing ELL population in both the short and long term. While research is in the process of refining methods to identify the best match between accommodations and the specific needs of each child (such as the work of Kopriva and colleagues), it would be best for policy to make a variety of effective accommodations available. Thus, for the short term, our existing policies should not prohibit an accommodation with such large effects as translations while we research the accommodationchild match. Moreover, for the long term, once methods for determining the most appropriate accommodation are widely implemented, test translations must undoubtedly be an available option in the accommodations tool kit.\nnovembeR 2010 589"}, {"section_title": "NoTEs", "text": "This research was supported by a grant from the American Educational Research Association (AERA), which receives funding for its AERA Grants Program from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Center for Education Statistics of the Institute of Education Sciences (U.S. Department of Education) under NSF Grant No. DRL-0634035.

I would like to thank Daphna Bassok, Andrei Cimpian, Michael Kieffer, Sarah Lubienski, the editors, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on previous drafts.\n1 The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), used a complex stratified sampling design. Each child's probability of being sampled was calculated on the basis of a number of demographic dimensions (e.g., race, socioeconomic status, school sector). Essentially, each child's sampling weight (calculated by the National Center for Education Statistics [NCES] and reported in the ECLS-K data set) reflects the number of demographically similar students in the broader population. Thus NCES recommends using the provided sample weights to ensure that analyses conducted with the ECLS-K data set are nationally representative. For additional details, please see U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (2001) . All analyses in this article use the appropriate crosssectional sampling weights in each regression and t test so that the results are nationally representative of Spanish-speaking kindergarteners and first graders.\n2 Of course, not all English language learners (ELLs) come from homes where Spanish is spoken. The ECLS-K translated the Englishversion mathematics test only into Spanish (i.e., no other languages) because the small sample sizes of students speaking other non-English languages made native-language assessments impractical. The mathematics skills of students from homes where a language other than English or Spanish was spoken were not assessed if they failed to attain at least 37 points on the English Oral Language Development Scale (OLDS; i.e., if they could not be assessed in English). 3 In the analytic data set, the English OLDS has standard deviations of 18.93, 16.61, and 14.75 points in the fall of kindergarten, spring of kindergarten, and spring of first grade, respectively. A 1-point difference (i.e., going from 36 to 37 points) in the OLDS scale represents 0.05, 0.06, and 0.07 standard deviations in the respective waves. Thus even the t-test analysis comparing students with 36 and 37 points on the OLDS is comparing very similar students in terms of measured English proficiency. The regression discontinuity design analysis extrapolates the regression lines from above and below the discontinuity to, in effect, statistically condition out even the 1-point difference in English OLDS scores. 4 Regression discontinuity designs estimate a treatment effect at the point where two separate regression lines meet. Here, children from Spanish-speaking homes who scored 36 points or less were assessed in Spanish, and those who scored 37 or more were assessed in English. The interval between 36 and 37 points necessarily contains no observations, and the regression must be extrapolated to a point within that region. Because it is halfway between 36 and 37, 36.5 was chosen as the point at which to estimate the effect, thus minimizing the extrapolation required of either regression. Another approach was also used, which estimated the effect as the difference between the values estimated at 36 and 37 points on the OLDS; that is, there was no extrapolation. This latter approach yielded the same conclusions; the estimates from this approach are available from the author upon request. However, because the latter approach is somewhat unconventional, the results from the conventional regression discontinuity design (estimating the effects at 36.5) are presented in the main article."}, {"section_title": "Supplemental Document", "text": "Joseph P.

This two-stage process was used to reduce the length of the assessment for the students while focusing the second-stage items on the appropriate difficulty level to Specifically, DIF focuses on item-level effects conditional on overall mathematics achievement: For example, given two children who have the same overall mathematics achievement, is the child taking the English version more likely to answer a specific test item correctly? In contrast, the regression discontinuity analysis in this article deals with overall mathematics achievement conditional on English proficiency: For example, given that two children have nearly identical English-language proficiency, is the overall mathematics achievement of the English-version-test taker higher or lower than that of the Spanish-version-test taker? In other words, the DIF analysis does not take English proficiency into account: To compare the item-level effects of English-version-and Spanish-version-test takers, the English-version-test takers may have an average OLDS score of 45 on a scale of 0 to 60, while the average OLDS score of the Spanish-version-test takers may be 20. Although English proficiency is irrelevant to the DIF analysis, it is the critical component in the regression-discontinuity analysis, ensuring that the overall mathematics score comparison is made between the subset of the Englishversion-test takers and Spanish-version-test takers with nearly identical English proficiency (i.e., those scoring close to 37 points on the OLDS)."}, {"section_title": "Text 5: Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Analytic Sample", "text": "Beginning with the full sample of 21,399 student observations, students whose home language was reported as Spanish in any wave (fall of kindergarten, spring of kindergarten, or spring of first grade)\nwere retained for analyses, reducing the sample to 1,995.

One student did not have valid math scores in any wave of data collection, and 12 other students did not have positive (i.e., non-zero) sampling weights.\nThe final analytic sample was 1,815 Hispanic students from Spanish-speaking homes, with available mathematics score, OLDS scores, and sampling weights in at least one wave of data collection.\nRoughly half of the sample was male in each wave (50.2% in fall of kindergarten, 51.4% in spring of kindergarten, and 52.4% in spring of first grade).\nVariables in the analytic data set are described in Table S4 ."}, {"section_title": "Sample Sizes at Different Waves", "text": "Note that the sample size becomes smaller in each wave, from 1,618 students in the fall of kindergarten, to 1,079 in the spring of kindergarten, to 576 in the spring of first grade. In many longitudinal studies, this is due to attrition; and to some extent, attrition is at work here. However, the primary reason for the sample size reduction in the current study is that students who scored 37 points or higher on the OLDS in a prior period were not given the OLDS in subsequent periods. That is, any student to the right of the threshold in an earlier wave will necessarily be omitted from the sample in later waves. Listed below are the sample sizes for spring kindergarten (SK) and spring first grade (S1) and the resulting total analytic sample: As can be seen here, actual attrition was rather low and was also offset by some students with missing data in prior rounds who have complete data in the current round. Also demonstrated here, the primary reason for the reduction in sample size was students' passing the English OLDS in a prior round and thus not having an English OLDS score in subsequent rounds. Without a current English OLDS score, a student cannot be included in the regression discontinuity design, or even the t test.\nNote that ECLS-K is a longitudinal study, but the current research does not employ a longitudinal design. The important thing for the current research is that students in the study (in any single wave of data collection) are on either side of the English OLDS threshold (so that a regression discontinuity design estimate can be calculated), but it is inconsequential whether those students appeared in previous or future waves of data. That is, the data for the regression discontinuity design are used in a purely cross-sectional manner, not in a longitudinal one. These cross-sectional estimates will be unbiased with or without attrition. Thus attrition, although low here, is not a cause for concern."}, {"section_title": "Standardizing the Outcome Variable to Aid Effect-Size Interpretation", "text": "Using the appropriate sampling weights, the T-scores on the mathematics test in the original ECLS-K data set have been standardized throughout the English OLDS score distribution on the analytic sample in each wave to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation (SD) of 1. This was done so that the results of the analyses could be interpreted as effect sizes. Using Cohen's suggestions for interpretation, effect sizes of 0.2 SD are considered small, those of 0.5 SD are considered medium, and those of 0.8 SD are considered large.\nThe pooled standard deviation is created through a regression. Because (a) the regression discontinuity design (RDD) uses data from students across the spectrum of OLDS scores, and (b) we expect math scores to vary as a function of OLDS scores (but particularly so at the threshold where treatment condition changes), the standardization should occur throughout the OLDS score range and should also take into account the treatment/control design of the study. A flexible parametric regression model (with fourth-order terms for the English OLDS score above and below the discontinuity point) is estimated, and the error term is assumed to be heteroskedastic:\nThe root mean squared error (RMSE) is then calculated from the residuals ( \u0302 ) of the above estimated regression:\nThe new outcome variable, which is the standardized math score in a given wave of data collection, is then created:\nThis process simply scales the unstandardized math score into a more understandable metric (i.e., the standardized score) to aid interpretation of effect sizes."}, {"section_title": "The t Test (or Simple Linear Regression on Either Side of the Threshold)", "text": "When one compares students just on either side of the OLDS threshold (i.e., the subset scoring either 36 or 37 points on the OLDS), the assessment of ELLs' mathematics skills in English versus Spanish can be viewed as a \"tie-breaking experiment.\" That is, although the design was not intentionally experimental, if students with English OLDS scores of 36 and 37 are viewed as virtually identical, then we can treat language of assessment as a coin toss (e.g., 36 is tails and 37 is heads, where heads gets assessed in English). To analyze the effect of the English assessment, a simple regression (i.e., with one dependent variable) is performed; this is analogous to a t test, but I write out the regression equation\nhere so that this approach can more easily be compared with the regression-discontinuity approach:\n(1)\nIn Equation (1), is the mean mathematics achievement score for ELLs who did not pass the English OLDS (i.e., those scoring 36 points), is the effect of taking the English mathematics test (instead of the Spanish version) for students just barely passing the OLDS test (i.e., those scoring 37 points), and is a random error term for student ."}, {"section_title": "Regression Discontinuity (Using Local Linear Regression)", "text": "Regression discontinuity is viewed as the method yielding the closest approximation to an experimental design, and its assumptions are relatively innocuous in comparison with other nonexperimental methods for inferring causality . It is used here\nto obtain more precise estimates (i.e., smaller standard errors) and to stabilize any spurious relationship seen with just a t-test approach by using information about the relationship between mathematics score and OLDS score for the broader Spanish-speaking sample. Instead of using only the data on students at the 36-point OLDS value, we can use the data on students scoring 0 to 36 points in order to carefully model the relationship between OLDS score and mathematics score. We still are interested only in the predicted value at an OLDS score at the screening test threshold-yet with this way of estimating that value, we are making use of the additional information from nearby students. Similarly, we use the information from students scoring 37 to 60 points to model the relationship between OLDS score and mathematics score for students taking the English test; but again, this is done to obtain an estimated precise effect at the OLDS threshold, where there is a known and sudden change in the language of the assessment associated with getting 1 additional point on the screening test.\nThe generic form of the regression discontinuity is ,\nwhere is a function of the OLDS score (e.g., a linear function, a quadratic function, a quadratic function with interactions, or a local linear regression function). Because passing the OLDS means a child is assessed in English, is the effect of being assessed in English (instead of in Spanish)\nfor children at the OLDS threshold.\nThe validity of the effect estimate ( ) depends on correctly estimating the relationship between the screening test score and the mathematics score. In practice, researchers often assess how sensitive the estimates are to alternative parametric specifications ). More recently, regression discontinuity designs have become more sophisticated ), attempting to remove virtually any influence the researcher could have to affect the results. That is, rather than assuming that the relationship is a parametric function (e.g., linear, quadratic, or cubic across a broad range of screening test scores), researchers have used nonparametric methods (e.g., local linear regressions), which fit a series of smaller linear regressions, each using data from a narrow bandwidth of screening test scores. The latter approach yields a model that is determined by the actual data rather than by the researcher's assumptions about the correct form of the model. Even the nonparametric method, however, requires the researcher to decide on how wide the bandwidth of the local linear regression should be. In practice (as in this article), several sets of estimated effects are presented, each with a different choice of bandwidth. If the estimated effects are similar in magnitude and significance across a reasonable set of bandwidth options, this suggests the effects are true and not driven by modeling assumptions.\nFor this study, I chose three different bandwidths (\u00b11 point, \u00b12 points, and \u00b13 points on the OLDS scale), each using an Epanechnikov kernel for fitting the local linear regression. For instance, with a \u00b11-point bandwidth, a regression is estimated using data from students with OLDS scores \u00b11 point away. Specifically, if estimating the mathematics score of students with an OLDS score of 20, we would fit a linear regression using data from students with scores of 19, 20, and 21; then, we would move to estimating the mathematics score at an OLDS score of 21, fitting a regression using data from students scoring 20, 21, and 22 on the OLDS test. This is repeated for all values of OLDS scores up to the screening test threshold, and a smoothed curve is obtained. A separate smoothed curve is obtained linking the estimated regression for all OLDS values above the screening test threshold. Again, of interest to this study is the vertical distance (i.e., the difference in mathematics scores) estimated at the screening test threshold, where the change in test language occurs. Figure S1 demonstrates that the results of this study do not hinge on bandwidth choice. In the fall of kindergarten, there is no significant effect of the test translation regardless of whether a \u00b11-point, \u00b12-point, or \u00b13-point bandwidth is used. In the spring of kindergarten and first grade, there is a significant effect of the test translation-again, this is regardless of the bandwidth used. These findings, along with the significant effects found in the simple t tests (see main text, Table 1 , column 1), strongly suggest that the translation effects in the spring of kindergarten and first grade do exist and are not the product of idiosyncratic modeling assumptions."}, {"section_title": "Jackknife Standard Errors", "text": "When using a nonparametric regression discontinuity design with sampling weights, an empirically based standard error must be derived because there is currently no theoretically based standard error.\nTwo common \"resampling\" methods for obtaining empirically based standard errors are \"bootstrapping\"\nand \"jackknifing.\" Because the ECLS-K sample is not a simple random sample but rather a complex stratified sample, jackknifing was chosen over bootstrapping for its ability to easily incorporate sampling weights into the estimation.\nThe jackknife is a nonparametric technique for estimating the standard error of a parameter estimate (e.g., ). The process involves removing a single observation (the In addition to its clear benefit when estimating standard error for the nonparametric models (given that no theoretically based estimates exist), the jackknife standard error has the added advantage that it does not make any of the assumptions that the t test or parametric regression discontinuity (using ordinary least squares regression) does, such as homogeneity of error variance or normally distributed error terms. For consistency, and to avoid making even these assumptions, jackknife standard errors are used throughout for all analyses. Note, however, that whenever the theoretically derived standard errors could be calculated (e.g., t test, parametric regression discontinuity), the jackknife and theoretically derived standards were always extremely similar, although the jackknife standard errors were, if anything, slightly more conservative."}, {"section_title": "Text 6: Item-Cluster Proficiency Levels", "text": "Items in the mathematics assessments used in kindergarten through first grade can be grouped into five \"item-cluster proficiency levels\":\n\uf0b7 Level 1 (\"count, number, shape\"): identifying some one-digit numerals, recognizing geometric shapes, and one-to-one counting up to ten objects;\n\uf0b7 Level 2 (\"relative size\"): reading all one-digit numerals, counting beyond ten, recognizing a sequence of patterns, and using nonstandard units of length to compare objects; The item-cluster groupings were decided in consultation with mathematics curriculum experts. These levels and skills are referred to in the main text; but bear in mind that the short label alone does not capture the full range of skills within the item-cluster proficiency category.\nAlthough the proficiency probabilities have been used in other research (Fryer & Levitt, 2006) , there is a drawback to their use: They are a function of the total number of items a child answers correctly on the mathematics test. For example, a child who attains an IRT scale score of 31 on the mathematics test is predicted to perform at least as well on each item cluster as a child who scores 30 scale-score points, even if the specific patterns of items answered correctly differed for these students (e.g., if the student scoring 30 answered more \"add/subtract\" items correctly). This type of model was necessary for ECLS-K because no child saw all the questions-a result of the two-stage testing procedure (used to efficiently and precisely estimate a child's overall mathematics ability). ECLS-K states that attaining proficiency in a higher level first occurs about 5% of the time and that such a difference can be due to random guessing error (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2002).\nThus a cautious interpretation of the proficiency probabilities is that they are suggestive of the types of questions students are answering correctly. Even in that case, the item-cluster proficiency probabilities are helpful in indicating that very few children near the OLDS threshold are likely to correctly answer questions beyond simple one-digit counting in the fall of kindergarten. In the spring of kindergarten, children generally are able to correctly answer more challenging mathematics items, which are also the more linguistically demanding items that contain word problems.\nThe results of these analyses are presented in Table 2 (in the main text) using a bandwidth of \u00b12 points; Table S1 presents the results using bandwidths of \u00b11, \u00b12, and \u00b13 points. Regardless of bandwidth choice, the results are similar, highlighting the robustness of the findings."}, {"section_title": "Text 7: Teacher Rating Scale", "text": "The teacher rating scale (as I call it in the article) is referred to as the \"academic rating scale\"; for mathematics it consists of seven questions in the spring of kindergarten (see the Appendix).\nNote that in mathematics the correlations between teacher ratings and direct cognitive scores are r = .41 (fall kindergarten), r = .53 (spring kindergarten), and r = .56 (spring first grade), suggesting that these two different measures (teachers and direct assessments) are measuring similar constructs.\nThe two tables of questions presented in the Appendix come directly from the questionnaires that went to kindergarten and first-grade teachers.

For example, the mathematics score in the spring of kindergarten must be estimated at the OLDS threshold for Spanish-version test takers instructed in Spanish. It must also be estimated for English-version test takers instructed in Spanish. These average performance values are subtracted to obtain the estimated effect of being assessed in English (instead of Spanish) for students receiving part of their instruction in Spanish. Then, the same is done for students instructed solely in English. Finally, the language-of-assessment effect for students instructed solely in English is subtracted from the effect for students who received part of their instruction in Spanish. This estimated differential effect (i.e., \u0394 ) is interpreted as the additional effect of being assessed in English (instead of Spanish) on students who are partially instructed in Spanish, above and beyond the language-of-assessment effect on students instructed only in English. Prior research on eighth-grade students would suggest that students instructed in English should have a positive effect of being assessed in English, while students instructed in Spanish should have a negative effect of being assessed in English. In the terms of the equation above, we should expect 0 and 0, leading to \u0394 0.\nFollowing the differential effect coefficient estimation, jackknife standard errors and the corresponding p values were calculated. This process of estimating the effects was done repeatedly, varying the bandwidth of the local linear regression, to determine if the estimated differential effect \u0394 was sensitive to the choice of bandwidth. The results suggest that the choice of bandwidth is inconsequential: That is, regardless of how it is modeled, there is no evidence that the language-ofassessment effect depends on which language children are instructed in. This is shown in Table S3 .\nIn fact, Table S3 shows that the estimated effects of being assessed in English (instead of Spanish) for students instructed in English are in the negative direction (i.e., 0), which clearly demonstrates that prior work finding significant positive effects on eighth graders instructed in English should not necessarily be assumed to hold for students in much lower grades.\nIt is important to note, however, that the test of differential effects has relatively low power. That is, the estimates are imprecise relative to the anticipated differential effects. Future research should explore the possibilities of a differential effect for young ELLs. Yet the negative point estimates for the language-of-assessment effect regardless of language of instruction found in the spring of kindergarten and first grade in the current study suggest that we should not assume that the conclusion reached for older ELLs (i.e., that the language of assessment should match the language of instruction, as suggested by necessarily generalizes to younger ELLs. Note. Bolded estimates are significant at the 5% level; italicized estimates are significant at the 10% level. Note. No estimate is significant at even the 10% level. The main text refers to p values estimated using a local linear regression of bandwidth \u00b12 OLDS points. Note that teacher ratings of student proficiencies ranged from 1 (not at all proficient) to 5 (proficient). The estimated effects (i.e., \"Estimates\" rows) presented here are not in SD effect sizes but rather are the raw difference in teacher ratings between students tested in English and Spanish (at the threshold).
