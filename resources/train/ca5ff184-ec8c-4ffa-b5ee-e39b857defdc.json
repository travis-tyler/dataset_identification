[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The international surveys of pupil achievement -PISA, TIMSS, and PIRLS -have been widely used to compare socioeconomic gradients in children's cognitive abilities across countries. Socioeconomic status is typically measured drawing on children's reports of family or home characteristics rather than information provided by their parents. There is a well established literature based on other survey sources on the measurement error that may result from child reports. But there has been very little work on the implications for the estimation of socioeconomic gradients in test scores in the international surveys, and especially their variation across countries. We investigate this issue drawing on data from PISA and PIRLS, focusing on three socioeconomic indicators for which both child and parental reports are present for some countries: father's occupation, parental education, and the number of books in the family home. Our results suggest that children's reports of their father's occupation provide a reliable basis on which to base comparisons across countries in socioeconomic gradients in reading test scores. The same is not true, however, for children's reports of the number of books in the home -a measure commonly used -while results for parental education are rather mixed.\nJEL classification: C21, C81, I24"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There has long been interest in how child outcomes are associated with family background.\nParents with better education, higher occupations and greater income can invest more in their offspring and provide other stimuli to child development (e.g. Haveman and Wolfe 1995) .\nThe international studies of children's cognitive achievement -the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) -have led to increased interest in how and why these socioeconomic gradients in one important outcome vary across countries. Countries can be placed in a comparative context, showing whether the gradient in any one country is particularly large, and the impact of differences between countries in institutional structures and policies that may limit disadvantaged children's achievement can be explored. There has been research into variation in socioeconomic gradients at a given age (e.g. OECD 2001, Marks 2005 , Sch\u00fctz et al. 2008 , Woessmann 2008 , Jerrim 2012 , Hermann and Horn 2011 and whether gradients steepen as children move through their schooling (e.g. Ammermueller 2006 , Waldinger 2007 , Jakubowski 2010 , Jerrim and Micklewright 2012 . See also the reviews in Hanushek and Woessmann (2011) .\nThe information on family background that has been used by analysts of these surveys is typically collected from the children rather than from their parents. (The children are aged 9/10 in PIRLS, 9/10 and 13/14 in TIMSS, and 15 in PISA.) All three surveys are conducted via schools and parental questionnaires are either only an optional supplement that countries can include if they wish (and with their own problems of non-response), or, in the case of TIMSS and in early rounds of PISA and still in later rounds for many countries, are not part of the survey at all. There is a well-established literature drawing on other datasets which shows that children may report their parents' and other home characteristics with error. Looker (1989) suggests that children have particular problems reporting parental education. Lien et al. (2001) find that agreement between parental and child reports is reasonably good for occupation, but only 'fair' for education. West et al. (2001) take an optimistic view when considering occupation but emphasise the importance of the fieldwork conditions when collecting the data. Buchmann (2002) , citing work by Koretz (1992) , notes that the correlation between parent and child reports of home possessions can be low, and that discrepancies 'raise serious questions about the accuracy of these data' (p181). If children's reports of their family background are inaccurate, and this information is used to obtain estimates of socioeconomic gradients in cognitive achievement, then bias in the estimates can be expected.\nIn this paper we consider the implication of using the children's reports to estimate the variation across countries in socioeconomic gradients. Research on measurement error in family background in the international achievement surveys has either used data from small scale field trial surveys of parents simply to illustrate the association between parent and child reports (e.g. Adams and Wu 2002, Schulz 2006) , or in the important work by Kreuter et al. (2010) on the reporting of parental education, has analysed just one country (Germany).\nAlthough insightful, these investigations do not show the differences across countries and do not compare different SES measures. The purpose of this paper is to fill these gaps.\nWe consider three measures of socioeconomic status (SES): parental education, father's occupation, and the number of books in the family home. The first two are standard SES measures. The number of books is a less obvious measure, but has become an increasingly common SES proxy in cross-national research given its presence in all three of the international surveys of children's achievement, PISA, TIMSS and PIRLS, as well as other international surveys (e.g. Ammermueller 2006 , Waldinger 2007 , Sch\u00fctz et al. 2008 , Ammermueller and Pischke 2009 , Machin 2009 , Evans et al. 2010 , Jakubowski 2010 , Ermish and Del Bono 2010 , Hermann and Horn 2011 , Brunello et al. 2012 , Jerrim and Micklewright 2012 . We have some doubts about the validity of books in the home as a measure of SES but we do not pursue the issue in this paper, accepting that -rightly or wrongly -this is a widely used measure.\nIn Section 2 we discuss the circumstances under which measurement error in SES variables leads to bias in estimates of cross-national differences in SES gradients in test scores. Section 3 describes the data from the two international surveys we use, PIRLS and PISA. PIRLS has always included a parental questionnaire which provides information on books in the home that can be compared with child reports on this measure for most countries. In recent survey rounds PISA has collected reports from parents as well as children on parental education and occupation for a subset of countries.\nSection 3 also describes our methods: we first assess the extent of parental and child agreement for the three SES measures. Then, for each measure, we compare the picture obtained of differences across countries in SES gradients in test scores from use in regression models of the parent reports with that obtained from use of the child reports. Since parent reports of SES may also be subject to error, we cannot be sure that the data reveal the extent of measurement error in the child reports or of its impact. Hence our emphasis is on 'robustness' of conclusions: does the switch from child to parent reports make a difference? Section 4 presents our results and Section 5 gives our conclusions and recommendations."}, {"section_title": "Measurement error and cross-national comparisons of SES gradients", "text": "What difficulties do measurement errors in SES cause in international comparisons of SES gradients in children's test scores? For ease of illustration, we assume a simple bivariate linear model:\n( 1) where Y i is the test score of child i, is the child's true (perfectly measured) SES, and \u03b5 i is a random term. The OLS estimate of is given by:\n.\nwhere lower case 'cov' and 'var' refer to the sample values. Assume that we observe not , but a misreported measure, X i :\nwhere v i is the measurement error. The standard treatment of measurement error is to assume that it is 'classical' in form: X i is just a noisy measure of SES, with v i uncorrelated both with the true value , and with \u03b5 i (and hence Y i ). In this case (and suppressing the individual child sub-script i from now on), the OLS estimate becomes:\nThe estimate of the SES gradient is biased downwards in absolute size -the textbook case of 'attenuation bias'. The proportional bias in the probability limit of the estimate of \u03b2 depends on the ratio of the population variances, VAR(v)/VAR(X * ), the so-called noise-to-signal ratio (e.g. Cameron and Trivedi 2005:903) .\nIf the child reports of SES in each country are subject to 'classical' error, then the estimates of the SES gradients in test scores based on these reports will all be biased downwards. Whether the estimated pattern of differences across countries in these gradients is biased depends on the cross-country variation in noise-to-signal ratios. Were these ratios all the same, estimates of the relative differences in the SES gradients would be unaffected. The estimate of the gradient in each country would be too low, but conclusions based on the data of the type 'the SES gradient in Country A is twice that in Country B' would be unaffected.\nIn this case, one could assess appropriately the relative differences across countries despite the measurement error in the data.\nHowever, it seems reasonable to expect some variation in the noise-to-signal ratios.\nFor example, consider children's reports of parental education in England and Germany.\nThere are comparatively few exit points from the school system in England, and a quite limited number of educational routes. Germany, on the other hand, has a greater number of different educational pathways and qualifications. As a result, there may be a higher probability of children misreporting parental education in Germany. Another example of variation in noise-to-signal ratios could be when different survey instruments are used to collect data in different countries. Despite the significant resources invested to ensure comparability in national instruments in international surveys, it is possible that national variations are not always perfectly captured. A more substantial problem may arise when using a set of country-specific surveys (e.g. the growing trend for comparisons between longitudinal datasets drawn from different countries that have not been designed to be comparable).\nBut a more fundamental objection is the reliance on the textbook assumption that measurement error in children's reports is 'classical', uncorrelated with the true value of SES or with the child's test score. In their major survey paper on measurement error, Bound et al. (2001) note that this assumption tends to 'reflect convenience rather than conviction' and argue that 'the possibility of non-classical measurement error should be taken much more seriously by those who analyze survey data'. Mason et al. (1976) discuss this issue of nonrandom measurement error with specific reference to children's reports of socio-economic characteristics. Kreuter et al. (2010) draw upon cognitive theory of response behaviour to argue that children who score highly on achievement tests are more likely to report parental SES measures correctly. Using a follow-up of the PISA 2000 sample in Germany which collected SES information from parents, they find some evidence of this for parental education (assuming parents reports to be free of error). They then shed doubt on the assumption that reporting error is uncorrelated with the true SES value: children with the highest value of parental education as reported by their parents (a university degree), can only provide the same information or under-report, while those with the lowest values reported by parents (no qualifications) can only provide the same information or over-report. Hence\nKreuter et al. argue that a more realistic assumption is that the higher the true value of SES, the more likely the reporting error to be negative.\nWhat are the implications of these patterns of measurement error? Kreuter et al. (2010) note the expression for the OLS estimator in the presence of measurement error that is not restricted to be 'classical' in form: children only so we cannot use this survey here. We restrict ourselves only to considering OECD member countries (it is these countries that form the core of PISA). where parent and child reports of parental occupation can be compared.\nThe descriptions given by respondents were converted by the survey organisers into four digit ISCO codes (the ILO categorization of occupations). 6 We recode the data in a similar manner to Marks (2005) . This leads to five social class groupings: high professional, low professional, routine white collar, skilled manual, and semi-skilled or unskilled manual."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "We also comment on results under possible alternatives, including the continuously measured occupational status index proposed by Ganzeboom and Treiman (1996) . We focus on results for father's occupation, which has been widely used to study SES differences in the \nNote that parents were not asked to discriminate between levels of education below ISCED 3A (a level that implies the parent completed high school in the USA). We therefore combine children's reports of parental education below ISCED level 3A into a single group so we have the same set of five categories for child and parent reports: ISCED level 5A/6, level 5B, level 4, level 3A, below level 3A. We then calculate a 'highest parental education' variable which is based upon the highest qualification achieved by either of the child's parents."}, {"section_title": "Books in the home", "text": "We have to switch to PIRLS data to investigate our third SES measure -the number of books in the family home. 9 Books in the home have been widely used in analyses of SES gradients in children's test scores based on PIRLS and TIMSS in particular, but also PISA. PIRLS is the only study among the three where information on books in the home is collected from both children and parents. Children in PIRLS are asked: It is important to recognise that children in PIRLS reporting this information are younger than children reporting parental education and occupations in PISA. If we find that books in the homes is the least consistently reported SES measure when comparing child and parent reports, this could be due to younger children being less able to provide reports of home and family characteristics than are older children (see Looker 1989 ) rather than to the number of books in the home being particularly difficult for children to estimate.\nThe main body of the paper investigated the consistency between parent and child reports of father's occupation. We extend this analysis by considering mother's occupation, using the same PISA 2006 data (recall that the parental questionnaire included questions about mother's and father's occupation only in this year). Table A .1 provides details on missing information. As noted in Section 3, much non-response is due to the entire parental questionnaire not being completed. However, comparing with Table 1 in the main paper, it seems missing information is a bigger problem for mother's occupation than for father's occupation in some countries due to greater item non-response, e.g. Italy, Korea, and most notably Turkey (the reporting of occupation for mothers not in work may be an issue).\nAdditional analysis, not presented for brevity, suggests that children with missing data achieved lower PISA reading test scores on average. All results presented in this appendix are based upon the subset of children with both parent and child reports available.\nAppendix Table A .2 presents kappa statistics for the consistency between parent and child reports, together with the percentage agreement (parents and children reporting the same occupational group). These are based upon the same five occupational groupings described in Section 3 (high professional, low professional, routine white collar, skilled manual, and semi-skilled or unskilled manual). It seems that information on maternal occupation provided by children is reasonably consistent with that provided by their parents.\nKappa statistics in most countries sit around 0.65, with relatively modest cross-national variation (though estimates are notably smaller in South Korea, 0.48, and larger in Turkey, 0.84, than other countries). These findings are similar to those for father's occupation in Section 4.\nIn Figure A .1 we investigate whether children with higher PISA reading test scores are more likely to agree with parental reports of their mother's occupation (i.e. an indication of how the measurement error varies with the response, ). As described in Section 3, we create a binary variable that takes a value of 1 if parent and child reports agree, and 0 otherwise. Average reading test scores are then compared across the two groups. Recall that for father's occupation, differences in average reading test scores were not statistically different from 0 at the 5% level in nine of the ten countries considered (see Figure 2 ). Yet the same does not seem to hold true for maternal occupation. In five out of the ten countries (Poland, South Korea, New Zealand, Iceland, Germany) average reading test scores are significantly higher amongst children who report the same maternal occupation category as their parents. However the estimated 95% confidence intervals continue to overlap for most countries, suggesting only limited evidence of cross-national variation in this result.\nIn Figure A .2 we re-estimate the regression model described in Section 3 using mother's occupation as the chosen measure of socio-economic status. The SES gradient is taken to be the average difference in points scored between the semi-skilled/unskilled manual group and the high professional group. Estimates when using children's reports are on the xaxis, and those using parental reports on the y-axis. The data points are generally quite close to the 45 degree line, with a correlation of 0.86 between the two sets of results. Although this correlation is slightly weaker than for father's occupation (0.94 -see Figure 3 ), it nevertheless suggests that cross-national comparisons of SES test score gradients based upon maternal occupation are quite robust to who reports this family background characteristic.\nThe results in Figure A .2 refer to differences in average test scores between children from the most (high professional) and the least (semi-skilled/unskilled) advantaged backgrounds. We now check the robustness of our results to the selection of other pairs of maternal occupation categories. In each case we re-compute the correlation coefficient for the set of country SES gradients based on child reports and the set based on parent reports. We do this for all possible pairs of categories. (The procedure is as for father's occupation described in Section 4.) Results are given in Table A .3. Most of the correlations are high, standing at 0.85 or above in all but one case. The exception (where the correlation is 0.56) refers to the comparison between the two lowest socio-economic groups (skilled manual and semi/unskilled manual). Thus the SES test score gradient seems robust to who provides information on mother's occupation, regardless of the categories that are compared. And overall, our results in this appendix for mother's occupation do not depart notably from those for father's occupation in the main paper. Notes: the graph shows the difference in average reading test scores, controlling for other variables included in the regression model, between children with the highest ('high controller') and lowest ('semi/unskilled manual') levels of mother's occupation. The units are national standard deviations. The correlation between the two sets of estimates is 0.86. Two letter country abbreviations are given in Table 3 . The data refer to 2006."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "In all three cases -occupation, education, and books in the home -there are limits in practice to the assessment of measurement error in children's reports by comparing their responses to those of their parents. First, the information provided by parents may also contain error (including as a result of proxy reporting e.g. the mother reporting the father's education). We expect this to be especially important for the number of books and least important for occupation. In practice we can therefore only investigate the consistency of children's and parents' reports of our SES measures.\nSecond, there is the problem of complex family structures. The PISA questionnaire provides the following guidance to responding children: No such guidance is given in the parental questionnaire. 11 This could result in child reports referring to one person (e.g. the biological father) while parental reports refer to someone else (e.g. a step father) thus weakening the observed association between the two variables.\nFinally, there is the practical matter of missing reports of SES, either from children or, much more commonly, from parents -notably due to non-response to the parental questionnaire. We show the extent of this problem in the PISA and PIRLS data for 2006 in Table 1 .\n< Table 1 PISA data to use the child reports of SES, an incentive that is already high given the relatively few countries administering the 'home' questionnaire. Missing information is less common for books in the homes (in PIRLS) -the modal country has complete information for 89% of cases -although there are very large numbers of missing parental reports in a small number of countries: in 30% or more cases in the Netherlands, Spain, New Zealand, Scotland, and England. Recall also that no parental questionnaire is issued in the USA.\nParents and children who fail to report SES may be systematically different to those who do provide this information. children with missing parent or child reports of SES have lower average test scores (the differences are almost always statistically significant). 12 The extent of this selectivity seems to vary across countries; for instance there is a stronger association between missing information on parental education and occupation data in Germany (0.7 to 0.8 standard deviations) than in Luxembourg (0.3 to 0.4 standard deviations).\n< Table 2 here > In principle, we could take into account the selectivity of the missing data problem.\nBut the relevant methods rely on strong assumptions. 13 Consequently, we undertake a 'complete case' analysis, where we restrict our sample to those children where both parent 12 PISA data for 2009 contain more information on family structure and show that (i) the great majority of children without a father present in the household do report their father's characteristics, and (ii) controlling for single parent status does not appreciably reduce the sizes of the differences in Table 2. 13 If there were a variable within the dataset that could predict well non-response to the parental questionnaire but not the outcome of interest (children's reading achievement), one could use this as an instrument to correct for sample selectivity. This particular specification has been chosen for consistency with the existing literature (e.g. Sch\u00fctz et al. 2008) . Formally, we estimate the model:\nwhere T is the child's reading test score and SES is the measure of socio-economic status of interest. Gender is a dummy variable indicating the child's gender (reference = girl), Age is a continuous variable indicating child's age in months, and Imm is a dummy variable indicating the child is either a first or second generation immigrant. Since SES is a categorical variable it is entered as a vector of dummy variables, with the most disadvantaged group as the reference group (e.g. semi/unskilled manual occupation). When using the books variable, we combine the bottom two categories (0-10 and 11-25 books) to form the reference group due to the sparse number of observations in the lowest category. The parameter estimate for the most advantaged group (e.g. high professional occupation) provides our estimate of the SES gradient in test scores (we check the robustness of our results to this choice).\nWe estimate the model twice for each country for each of our three SES measures of interest, once using child reports of the variable (education, occupation, or books) and once using parent reports. Comparison of the results from the two sets of regressions shows whether the cross-country pattern of SES gradients is robust to who reports SES -the child or the parent.

Values were reasonably high (averaging 0.69) and again showed only moderate variation across countries."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The extent of agreement between parents and children", "text": "Our results show that agreement between parents and children is best for parental occupation and least good for books in the home. 16 The lower agreement for books may reflect the younger age of the children in PIRLS than in PISA (although Vereecken and Vandegehuchte (2003) find children only a little older than the PIRLS children giving reports on parental occupation that agreed well with those of their parents). Or it may reflect the difficulty people of all ages have in estimating numbers of books, whether a child or an adult, implying parental as well as child error is to be expected. By contrast, we would expect the least parental error -including error due to proxy responses by mothers -for reports of father's occupation."}, {"section_title": "Differential measurement error", "text": "Do children whose SES reports agree with those of their parents have better test scores? In the terminology of Section 2, this provides an indication of how the measurement error varies (cells in the cross-tabulation that are further away from the leading diagonal). The overall pattern in the graph was unchanged. 16 We checked the sensitivity of this conclusion by restricting attention to the five countries (Italy, Iceland, Poland, Germany and New Zealand) with data on each of the three SES measures; books in the home still showed the lowest levels of consistency between parent and child reports, and father's occupation the highest. The pattern for books in the home is quite similar to that for parental education.\nChildren who report the same category of number of books as their parents tend to have higher maths test scores (in only two countries does the 95% confidence interval include zero). Cross-national variation is again moderate, with the confidence intervals overlapping for most countries. The outliers include England (GB(E)), where children who agree with their parents' reports of books score on average 0.35 of a national standard deviation more on the PIRLS reading test (the difference is significantly greater at the 5% level than in the majority of other countries). 17 This suggests that estimates of the SES gradient based on child reports in PIRLS may be subject to pronounced downward bias in England, resulting from negative covariance between the measurement error in the reports and the test score -the term in the numerator of equation (4). However, this conclusion ignores any offsetting biases resulting from the negative covariance expected in the denominator of (4). A cross-tabulation of parent and child reports for England demonstrates this pattern in Table 4 . When parents report the lowest category (0 to 10 books), 79% of children report a higher one. On the other hand, 46% of children report a lower figure when parents report the highest category (more than 200 books). We emphasised in Section 2 that the net result of these two effects is an empirical issue, to which we now turn.\n< Table 4 here >"}, {"section_title": "Robustness of the SES gradient to the switch between child and parent reports", "text": "We now investigate whether the pattern of differences in SES gradients in test scores across countries depends on the choice of child or parents reports on which to base the SES measure.\nWe start with father's occupation, the measure for which child and parent reports appear the most consistent. We estimate the regression model in equation (5), entering father's occupation as a series of dummy variables. We summarise the SES gradient by the estimated coefficient on highest level of occupation ('high professional'), which measures the average difference in reading score between children with fathers in this group and children with fathers in the base category, the lowest occupational group ('semi/unskilled manual'), controlling for other variables in the model. Figure 3 shows estimates when using children's reports of father's occupation on the horizontal axis and when using parental reports on the vertical axis. The data points are all close to the 45 degree line (the correlation coefficient is 0.94). The size of the gradient varies greatly across countries, from less than 0.5 to over 1.0 national standard deviations. However, the close correspondence between the two sets of estimates indicates that the pattern and size of the differences in the SES gradient across countries is robust to the choice of child or parental reports on which to base the measure -in line with our finding of a high degree of 17 Our restriction to cases with complete data means that we are excluding half the sample in England (see Table  2 ).\nconsistency between the reports. We checked the sensitivity of our results to use of other occupational measures -the Ganzeboom and Treiman (1996) index and the ISCO nine major groups -based on the same underlying data collected from parents and children. The correlation between SES gradients based on child and parent reports remained around 0.9."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "< Figure 3 here > We now turn to parental education. We enter a series of dummy variables for parental education in the regression models (in place of those for father's occupation). The SES gradient is taken as the average difference in points scored between those who reported a low level of parental education (ISCED below level 3A -did not complete high school) and those who reported a high level (ISCED 5A and above -university degree), controlling for the other variables in the model. Estimates using children's reports are on the horizontal axis of Figure 4 and those using parental reports on the vertical axis. Since we are now using data for Figure 4 is that almost all the data points (17 out of 19) sit above the 45 degree line; the estimates are larger when using the parental reports. If the goal is to estimate the size of the SES gradient within any one country, then use of data on parental education reported by children will lead to an underestimate (assuming the parent reports are error-free). In terms of the direction of bias, this is consistent with measurement error in the child reports being classical in form although our analysis in Section 3 suggests this not to be the case. The magnitude of the bias is typically about 0.1 of a standard deviation but is larger in some countries, notably New Zealand. However, the similarity in the apparent bias across most countries means that that the correlation between the two sets of estimates of the SES gradient is quite high (r = 0.83). Consequently, conclusions on the differences across countries in the SES gradient are moderately robust to whether child or parent reports of parental education are used.\nFinally we consider the number of books in the home ( Figure 5 ). The SES gradient is estimated as the average difference in the test scores between children with many books in the home (more than 200) and those with few books (0 to 25), controlling for the other variables in the regression. There are many more data points than in Figures 3 and 4 as information for books in the home is drawn from the PIRLS surveys where parental questionnaires were administered in a much larger number of countries than in the PISA surveys.\n< Figure 5 here >\nThe correlation between the estimates based on parent reports and estimates based on child reports is clearly lower than for the other two SES measures (r=0.37). Moreover, there is no obvious overall pattern of an upward or downward change in the estimates based on the parent reports compared to those based on the child reports: there is a fair amount of scatter around the 45 degree line. There are a number of outlier countries where there is a large change in results, e.g. Italy and Greece. The cross-country pattern of differences in SES gradients is not that robust to the switch between child reports and parent reports. It is difficult to have confidence in the finer details of the pattern of estimates when using books in the home, particularly when trying to identify the countries where SES gradients in test scores are atypically large or small.\nTo illustrate this point, we highlight the case of England. Using TIMSS data, Sch\u00fctz et al. (2008) found England to have a particularly strong association between books in the home and children's test scores, a finding that has been widely cited (e.g. Chevalier et al. 2009 , Machin 2009 , Crawford et al. 2011 , Ermisch and Del Bono 2010 , Jerrim 2012 ). Yet\nEngland is a notable outlier in the Figure 5 results based on PIRLS; it is only when using children's reports that SES differences stand out as large in England compared to those elsewhere. The estimate for England based on parental reports is about 40% smaller, and below the international average."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "The results in Figures 3-5 refer to differences in average test scores (controlling for other characteristics in the regression model) between children in the top and bottom categories of each of the SES variables, i.e. the most and the least advantaged backgrounds.\nWe now check the robustness of our results to the selection of other pairs of categories for each SES measure. For example, we can redefine the SES gradient as the average difference (conditional on the control variables) between test scores in the top category of a variable and an intermediate category, rather than the bottom category. In each case we re-compute the correlation coefficient for the set of country SES gradients based on child reports and the set based on parent reports. We do this for all possible pairs of categories for each SES measures (Table 5 ). The circled figures refer to the correlations reported earlier for Figures 3-5.\n< Table 5 For books in the home, the correlations range from 0.51 to a low of 0.07, with all but one of the six figures below a modest 0.40. This re-iterates the point made earlier: crossnational comparisons of SES gradients in test score based on books in the home seem to be quite sensitive to whether the child or the parent provides the information on the number of books."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We have investigated whether estimates of differences across countries in SES gradients in test scores in international surveys of children's reading achievement are robust to who reports the SES information, parent or child. Using data drawn from PISA and PIRLS, we have considered SES measures based on parental occupation, parental education, and the number of books in the home. This is an important exercise given the reliance on the child reports in much research with the international surveys. Analysts of these surveys either must use the child reports to construct SES variables (TIMSS or early rounds of PISA) or may choose to do so in order maximise the number of countries under investigation (PIRLS and, even more the case, later rounds of PISA) and the number of cases with complete information (we have shown there to be substantial non-response to the parental questionnaires, especially in PISA).\nThere is substantial agreement between parental reports of father's occupation and those of their 15 year old children in the PISA data for the 10 countries that we have been able to analyse. In only one country did average reading test scores differ significantly between children reporting the same category of father's occupation (out of five possible categories) and those reporting a different category, suggesting a lack of any systematic reporting bias linked to reading ability. The differences across countries in SES gradients in test scores seem robust to whether the child or the parent reports are used as the basis for the SES measure. Although we would like to see these findings replicated for a larger number of countries, we think these results imply that children's reports of parental occupation provides a reliable basis with which to explore cross-national differences in SES test score gradients.\nWe are less sanguine about books in the home. There is much lower agreement between parent and child reports over the number of books in the home than for parental occupation, although we cannot tell to what extent this is due to the data relating to a younger group of children, 9/10 year olds. In all but one of the 24 countries in our PIRLS data, less than 50% of children report the same category of books in the home as their parents (out of five possible categories). Children reporting a different category from their parents have average reading scores that are almost always significantly lower than those reporting the same category, suggesting that reporting error -assuming the parental reports to be closer to the truth -is not 'classical' in form. Estimates of cross-national differences in the SES gradient of reading test scores are quite sensitive to who provides the information, the parent or the child, with some countries moving dramatically in the international rankings e.g.\nEngland. Hence we advise caution with the use of this variable when estimating SES differences in children's test scores. (This is without questioning its validity as an SES measure.)\nThe appropriate conclusion regarding parental education is not quite so obvious.\nAlthough the consistency of the information given by parents and children was reasonable, reports given by children in some countries appear better than in others. The pattern of differences across countries in the SES gradients was fairly robust to the choice of parent or child reports when comparing the most and least advantaged groups, yet not all such comparisons based on the reported data were quite so encouraging. The evidence available does not seem strong enough for us to either clearly reject or support the use of this SES measure.\nInformation on family background is a key component in any survey of school children. Collecting that information from children only is likely to remain an attractive lowcost option. Our recommendation to the PISA, PIRLS and TIMSS survey organisers is that further efforts be made to validate the quality of children' reports of SES measures, encompassing all participating countries. Researchers using data from these surveys to investigate SES differences in test scores should take heart from some of our findings while proceeding with caution given others. At least some of the information available on family background seems to be quite well reported by children, judging by the yardstick of their parents' reports of the same information. 5547  93  3  3  2  100  Turkey  4942  88  2  10  1  100  Portugal  5109  78  3  17  2  100   Italy   2177  3  77  2  20  2  100  Germany  4891  69  7  18  7  100  Iceland  3789  59  3  34  4  100  Luxembourg  4567  59  7  28  6  100  New Zealand  4823  57  7  27  9  100  Denmark  4532  55  3  37 5 100 Slovakia  5337  95  1  3  0  100  Belgium  (Flemish)  4552  95  2  4  0  100  Italy  3581  94  2  4  0  100  Poland  4854  93  4  3  0  100  Slovenia  5337  93  2  5  0  100  Austria  5067  92  3  5  0  100  Denmark  4001  91  2  6  0  100  Sweden  4394  90  3  7  1  100  Luxembourg  5101  89  1  10  0  100  Hungary  4086  89  2  9  1  100  France  4404  87  5  7  1  100  Norway  3837  85  7  7  1  100  Belgium (French)  4552  84  6  9  1  100   Canada   2056  5  81  4  14  1  100  Germany  7899  80  7  10  4  100  Iceland  3673  73  2  23  2  100  Netherlands  4156  67  1  31  1  100  New Zealand  6256  60  3  33  3  100  Spain  4094  60  2  35  2  100  Scotland  3775  51  1  47  2  100  England  4036  46  1  52  2  100 Note: unweighted data.

Consistency between parent and child reports of mother's and father's education", "text": "In the main body of the paper we investigated the consistency of parental and child reports for the highest level of parental education. This appendix provides separate results for the education level of the mother and the education level of the father. All analyses are based on the subset of children with complete information -the extent and pattern of missing data is very similar to that reported elsewhere in the paper (see Table 1 and suggests that the measurement error in children's reports may be differential, under the assumption that parental reports are closer to the 'truth'. This is consistent with results for highest level of parental education presented in the main body of the paper (see Figure 2 ).\nThe regression model described in Section 3 is now estimated using either mother's education (left hand panel) or father's education (right hand panel) as the chosen measure of socio-economic status. The SES gradient is taken to be the average difference in points scored between those who reported a low level of mother/father education (below ISCED level 3A) and those who reported a high level (ISCED level 5A and above). Results can be found in Figure B .1. Estimates when using children's reports can be found on the x-axis, with parental reports on the y-axis. One can see that almost every data point (for both maternal and paternal education) sits above the 45 degree line. Thus the general pattern of attenuation reported in the main body of the paper (Figure 4 ) continues to hold. However, the correlation between the two sets of estimates is slightly stronger for father's education (r = 0.88) than it is for mother's (r = 0.81).\nFinally, rather than simply defining the socio-economic gradient as the difference in test scores between the top and bottom SES categories, we now look at the consistency of results when drawing comparisons between all possible combinations of socio-economic groups. For instance, with parental education we no longer solely focus on the test score difference between the ISCED 5A/6 category and the ISCED below 3A groups, and whether this particular estimate varies between parent and child reports. Rather, we also look at difference between (say) the ISCED 5B and ISCED 3A categories as well. Our results are presented as Pearson correlation coefficients (analogous to those in Table 5 discussed in the main text) and can be found in Table B .3. Results are somewhat mixed, with particularly low correlations for comparisons involving the ISCED level 3A group. Otherwise, the correlations are generally satisfactory (around 0.70 to 0.80). This holds for both mother's and father's education.\nThese results are consistent with those for highest level of parental education presented in the main body of the paper. Indeed, the same conclusion regarding the robustness of SES test score gradients hold whether one focuses on mother's education, father's education, or the higher of the two. Notes: SES gradients in reading test score have been estimated using every possible pair of categories within each measure. For each SES measure, the figures give the correlations between the two sets of estimates of gradients, one based on child reports of maternal/paternal education and one on parent reports. For example, the circled figure in panel (a) refers to the gradients estimated using father's education and the 'ISCED 5A' and 'ISCED Below 3A' groups (that is the difference in average reading test scores between these two categories, controlling for other variables in the regression model described in Section 3).
