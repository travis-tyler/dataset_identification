[{"section_title": "Displaying the Big Picture", "text": "In the following, the focus on agriculture research performance and funding sponsored by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is subordinated to the \"big picture\": context in which Federal policymaking occurs. I offer a collection of \"exhibits\"data and commentarythat illustrate the policy context and illuminate the issues and choices that confront us all. The exhibits are self-explanatory. They have been sequenced to proceed from (i) an overview of the Federal research system, to (ii) a highlight of the Clinton Administration's R&D initiatives, (iii) a consideration of policies that concentrate and distribute research funds by State and institution, and (iv) strategies for making agriculture a research priority. Finally, it is important to note the difficulty in measuring the returns on the Federal investment ($73 billion in fiscal year 1993) in R&D. Various characteristics of the portfolio remain elusive: balance, risk-taking, and performance are all relative terms. If viewed as a public good, certain expectations about returns, i.e., shortterm financial benefits, are inappropriate. 8 But if the R&D portfolio is seen as a contribution to the nation's economic well-being, then R&D clearly competes with other missions. Indeed, R&D is deeply implicated in the mission of competitiveness. For better and worse (as it were), agriculture is on the cusp on that mission. 8 For reflections on this line of analysis, see Edwin Mansfield, How Do We Measure What We Get When We 'Buy ' Research,' The Sclentist, vol. 4, Aug. 19, 1991, pp. 11, 17;and Keith Pavitt, What Makes Basic Research Economically Useful?\" Research Policy, vol. 20, 1991, pp. 109-119. -5- "}, {"section_title": "Funding of Big Science (or Megaprojects)", "text": "Are the SSC, Space Station, and the human Genome Project distortions of research priorities by effective lobbies, and therefore an expression of political will that should go unchallenged?

Small Science Squeeze If practitioners of \"small science\" are looking for confirmation of their fear that Zbig science\" is threatening their livelihood, they will find it in a staff memorandum prepared by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). CBO points out that the three biggest civilian science and technology projects-the space station, the Earth Observing System, and the Superconducting Super Collider-account for two-thirds of the Administration's proposed fiscal year 1993 increase in the budget category known as Function 250, which includes the National Science Foundation, much of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the general science programs of the Department of Energy. What's worse for small science devotees is that this year's proposal may be only the thin end of the wedge. CBO projects that the annual budgetary needs of the three mammoth projects will double between 1992 and 1997-yet the Administration's budget assumes flat funding for Function 250 beyond 1993. If those projections turn out to be correct-a big if-the result isn't hard to figure: Small science gets squeezed (see chart). Some relief would come from allowing Function 250 to grow. But, as CBO points out, there will be increasing pressure to cut total government spending to hold down the ballooning federal deficit, with the result that \"by 1995, the cumulative cuts will be so large that Function 250 is unlikely to escape without any reduction.\"  State (1985) and at Universities and Colleges (1989) Cumulative distribution of Federal R&D obligations by State: 1985 Billions of dollars 60  Includes in-state R&D performance of industry, universities, associated federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), and Federal agencies and the federally funded R&D performance of nonprofit institutions."}, {"section_title": "EXHIBIT 10", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Academic Earmarking", "text": "Is the pursuit of pork barrel funding of facilities and equipment a result of inadequate Federal attention to these infrastructure needs?

But today the sums appropriated forR&D on it are tiny in comparison with those allocated to space or health. While appropriations for many agencies have expanded greatly since 1955, those for R&D in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have remained at about $780 million in terms of constant dollars. Most of these funds have been spent intramurally by the Agricultural Research Service. Some have gone to state activities. The USDA did not initiate competitive grants activities until 1978. At that time, the appropriation for them was only $15 million. Annual appropriations grew slowly to about $44 million in 1988. There is no question about the major contribution made by the R&D supported by USDA during the past hundred years. And for much of that time, U.S. agriculture enjoyed special advantages of fertile soil, innovation in farm machinery, and low-cost petroleum products. But today strong global competition is with us. Imports of food into the United States are increasing. Other countries, including developing nations, are successfully engaging in research. Advanced countries are devoting relatively more attention to agriculture than is the United States. The percentage of total R&D funds devoted to a category that included agriculture, forestry, and fishing in 1988 were: United States, 1.9; Japan, 6.5; Germany, 3.1; France, 4.6; and United Kingdom, 5.5. Yields of food grains in other countries often exceed those in the United States. In some countries labor or fertile land is cheaper than in the United States. If the United States is to maintain or increase its favorable balance of trade in agricultural products, it must enhance the quality of its agricultural products and increase production efficiency. To do this will require devoting a larger share of its creative talent to basic agricultural research. A means to this end would be to expand the USDA competitive grants program. A rationale for doing this and legislation authorizing it are already in place. In 1989 the rationale for an enlarged competitive grants system was supplied by the Board on Agriculture of the National Research Council (NRC). It issued a report* that was unusually effective. The document won approval from the Bush administration and led to action under Public Law 101-624 to foster a National Competitive Research Initiative. Recommendations of the NRC were followed quite closely in the crafting of the legislation. The NRC report spotlighted six targets: plant systems; animal systems; nutrition; food quality and health; natural resources and the environment; engineering, products, and processes; and markets, trade, and policy. The legislation also targeted the six. Descriptions of the six targets were similar. In the legislation, the following appears specifying an area to be supported: Plant systems, including plant genome structure and function; molecular and cellular genetics and plant biotechnology; plant-pest interactions and biocontrol systems; crop plant response to environmental stresses; unproved nutrient qualities of plant products; and new food and industrial uses of plant products. Equally broad scope characterized specifications of the other areas. The legislation also specified, \"in seeking proposals for grants...and in performing peer review evaluations of such proposals the Secretaries shall seek the widest participation of qualified scientists in the Federal Government, colleges and universities, State agricultural experiment stations, and the private sector.\" The legislation authorized appropriations of$ 150 million for fiscal year 1991, $275 million for 1992, $350 million for 1993, $400 million for 1994, and $500 million for 1995. To date that schedule has not been met. The actual appropriation for 1991 was $73 million and for 1992 and 1993 it was set at $97.5 million. A cap of 14% for overhead has been set. Nevertheless, there have been so many proposals that only about 22% could be funded for an average slightly over $50,000 per year. It is early to ask about accomplishments. However, as one example, the tools and methods that were developed by National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation investigators are being rapidly and successfully applied to plant and animal genomes and to detection of disease processes in both plants and animals.

Public and private sectors in the United States have been major partners in an multibillion dollar agricultural research, development and extension effort that has made possible the impressive rate of technical change seen in the sector over this century. Despite a widely-acclaimed record of high rates of return to public investment , the share of the public partners (USDA and state agricultural experiment stations) fell from 40 to 34 percent over the decade of the eighties (Huffman and Evenson 1993, Table 4.1), due to sporadic cuts in public support levels that are mainly traceable to exogenous budgetary pressures. Over the same period total expenditures increased, however, from 3.9 to 4.8 billion dollars (at 1984 value) due to an increase in private expenditures. The budget cuts are the most obvious but not necessarily the most important forces for change. Other pressures for more fundamental changes in the nature of agricultural research structures is being engendered by qualitative changes in the social demands made on the agricultural research and extension system, in the scope and nature of scientific opportunities for discoveries, and in the potential rewards for researchers. In this paper we consider the implications of these changes for the nature of public and private agricultural research. We focus on land grant institutions like U.C. In what follows, we first consider the nature of the changes in demands on the agricultural research system. Then we review in Section 2 the reasons why both the public sector and the private sector have valid economic roles in the research and extension system. In Section 3 we consider public and private sector responses to the new research demands and opportunities.

Conclusions follow."}, {"section_title": "The Evolution of Research Demands", "text": "Historically, the politically expressed demands on the agricultural research system have focused on efficiency in agricultural production and post-harvest activities, and the promotion of rural prosperity and parity with other sectors of the economy.' The cost-decreasing and/or yield-increasing innovations the system produced for farmers satisfied the supply requirements so effectively that market forces placed downward pressure on the equilibrium price of farm commodities (Cochrane 1958). This in turn led to effective political action by the farm lobby to obtain protection from price reductions via government intervention to support prices. On the other hand the distributional concern for relative prosperity of the rural population, featured so prominently in political rhetoric, has not been discernible among the major objectives of public agricultural research, which have remained focused on technical and economic efficiency. Improvements in efficiency clash with the achievement of rural prosperity when the induced increases in supply depress market prices so much as to reduce the net returns to rural suppliers of labor, land, and other inputs. Now, however, society's effective political demands of the farm sector have become much more complex. Consumers wish to reduce the actual or perceived health risks of chemical residues in foods, and of herbicides and pesticides released into the environment by farmers. Other concerns include the effects of erosion on 'Clear statements of the broad objectives of United States agricultural policies are surprisingly difficult to find. For our purposes, the following extract from the Hatch Act of 1955 is relevant: \"Sec. 2. It is further the policy of the Congress to promote the efficient production, marketing, distribution, and utilization of products of the farm as essential to the health and welfare of our peoples and to promote a sound and prosperous agriculture and rural life as indispensable to the maintenance of maximum employment and national prosperity and security. It is also the intent of Congress to assure agriculture a position in research equal to that of industry, which will aid in maintaining and equitable balance between agriculture and other segments of our economy.\" (U.S. Congress, 1980, p. 18-22) land and water quality, pollution by animal wastes and most recently the effects of methane emitted by belching ruminants on global warming. Standards for animal rights are being advocated for veal calves and poultry. Clearly the farming process itself is increasingly being subjected to direct social constraints, rather than being viewed as only indirectly socially relevant as the means to achieving a prosperous farm sector and a cheap and secure food supply. (See the accompanying chapter by Busch for more on this.) At the same time, consumers with increasing incomes and no intention of eating or drinking more are looking for higher quality, novelty, variety and constant availability in their foods. These objectives are not obviously mutually consistent, especially if the research continues along the path that produced high yield and low costs. Scientists and innovators are being asked to furnish production processes, and new products, that respond to these multiple social concerns, and there will be an increasing demand for products and services that can help management in this complex and dynamic environment. Indeed the multifaceted interactions that constitute an agricultural system will increasingly be the subject of analytical attention. Beyond biotechnology lies the challenge of ecologically appropriate agriculture. This is far more demanding than the more narrow, often organism-specific, focus seen in much of extensive research effort in moder medicine, for example, and also characteristic of that part of agriculture that has in the past achieved the greatest yield increase, the cultivation of a plant or animal species via the exclusion of competitive species by some artificial means. Fortunately these challenges come at a time when the research capacity is being transformed by the revolutions in biotechnology and information processing. Besides improving the prospects for pursuit of the traditional productivity objectives, the new biological techniques make possible previously unimagined qualitative transformations of plants and animals. They seem to expand greatly the potential for satisfying the new demands for benign production processes, on the one hand, and an array of improved consumption characteristics on the other. Already scientists have been able, for example, to transfer the pesticidal qualities of Bt into agricultural plants, which might help reduce chemical pesticide use. On the other hand genetic manipulation has also made possible delivery of betterripened fruit, such as the Calgene tomato, with less damage and wastage. A slew of more impressive breakthroughs can be anticipated in the years ahead. 2 Through biotechnology agriculture will expand to produce new higher-quality forms of existing products, and entirely new agricultural products, many of them beyond the traditional range of agricultural commodities. The term \"pharming\" refers to the use of plants as factories for biological and chemical products. The biological production of fine chemicals and fibers may offer a less costly alternative to the use of finite or ecologically sensitive environmental resources. Scientists have genetically engineered plants to manufacture a wide variety of materials, including human proteins such as albumin and interferon, alpha-amylase, a bacterial enzyme that is widely used in the food processing industry and natural polymers, including a type of polyester (Moffat 1992). The advent of the new biotechnological innovations has been fostered by new legal protections in the form of the Plant Variety Protection Certificate (PVPC), established in 1970 and extended in 1980, and subsequently the expansion of patent protection to life forms by the Supreme Court in Diamond v. Chakrabarty in 1980. 3 Similarly the market for software and databases has been sufficiently (if not optimally) developed under the evolving law regarding copyright protection that it has made the personal computer a productive and popular management tool for farmers and farm advisers. However the legal system also poses new challenges for the modem biological products developed under its protection. The marketing of the Calgene Flavr-Savr tomato may be hindered by legal challenges or the threat thereof, or more generally by adverse publicity regarding the safety of foods containing new genetic material. Already its major backer, Campbell's, is backing away from plans to use this product. In sum, the agricultural research system is faced with new challenges, but also with an exciting new array of opportunities. How should the agricultural research system be structured in this new environment? 2. Why Public Research and Extension?"}, {"section_title": "General Arguments", "text": "As a preliminary, it is helpful to keep in mind the reasons why we have a public research system at all. After all, we rely on the private sector to produce other products, including food, with profits from private sales as the incentive. Public provision of research and extension has been justified by the argument that the private incentives for research and extension fall short of the public gains at the margin. Important \"externalities\", benefits (or costs) not captured in private profits, are associated with public research inputs, outputs, or the process itself. This argument has much greater force for some areas of effort than others. It is widely accepted that pure knowledge, not embodied in any product, is a \"public good\", the benefits of which are properly made available free of charge because they are \"non-rival\"; use by one does not reduce the supply available to others. The product of successful basic research is of this type. The desirability of free provision is fortunate, for it is very difficult to exclude non-purchasers from acquiring such \"disembodied\" information, and since the information is often of quite general use the number of potential \"free riders\" is often very large. It follows that basic research is mostly produced in, or at least supported by, the public or non-profit sectors. Basic research findings feed into the applied research areas, which tend to be more industry-specific. In many areas the fruits of applied research are at least partially capturable by its producer, for two quite different reasons. The creator of disembodied applied process discoveries reaps the benefits to the extent that it dominates the industry that uses the process. For example, an advance in irrigationequipment manufacturing techniques would be likely to benefit a major manufacturer of such equipment. Furthermore, much applied research and development produces innovations that are embodied in products, such as machines or drugs, that can be sold for profit in private markets, and protected from copying by patents or secrecy. In these cases the derived private demand for applied research may well be adequate, if not optimal. In agriculture, the producers of applied research have historically had little scope for capturing sufficient compensation from the market to justify their efforts. Most advances have been either yield-increasing or cost-reducing. Some of these advances are embodied in plants or animals that can reproduce, passing on the advances to later users, and spoiling the innovator's prospects for lucrative sales in the absence of effective legal protection. Others are process advances such as new techniques of crop cultivation that can be easily copied by diligent observers. Given the extremely competitive nature of agricultural production, the rewards accruing from use within the innovator's own farming operation are typically a tiny fraction of the full social value. There are of course prominent exceptions to these generalizations. Private hybrid corn innovators have prospered because their product cannot be successfully reproduced by their customers. New hybrid chicken varieties are also produced privately. Mechanical and especially chemical farm inputs, originating in other sectors, have historically had patent protection. This has not always been very effective. Eli Whitney's (or was it Catherine Greene's? See Warrick 1992 pp. D3-D4) cotton gin, to take a famous example, was so widely copied, despite patent protection, that it was necessary to award him a prize to provide him, ex post, a significant return for his innovation. Given the anticipated opportunities for innovation, on the one hand, and the lack of privately appropriable returns from many types of applied innovations on the other, the public sector role in supporting agricultural research has been unusually large, and has included the applied development and dissemination of techniques and products that in other sectors is left in the hands of the private sector. Thus the historical role of the public agricultural research complex covers the whole range from basic scientific investigation to the farmer's field. In the United States the land grant universities cover this span, in large part integrated within a college of agriculture and/or natural resources."}, {"section_title": "The Logic of the Land Grant System", "text": "Three aspects of the structure of the land grant agricultural research system suggest the types of externalities important to their mission. The first is that it is a decentralised system of vertically integrated individual institutions, dispersed across the states with substantial funding from state as well as federal sources. Second, its basic structure is program-oriented rather than project-oriented, in that its staffing is predominantly on a permanent basis. Third, the research mission is pursued in concert with an educational mission; researchers are also university teachers and students and others involved in public education. Decentralization of research and extension to the state level has traditionally been rationalized by the argument that it reflects the fact that many applied research problems are locally specific. Pests, diseases, plant varieties and cultivation practices differ across states and even counties. An institution that is close to the problem is more likely to respond effectively. Thus dispersion of the applied research function makes sense. The dispersion of the basic researchers along with their applied colleagues, as in the land grant universities, allows both types to take advantage of the knowledge externalities available due to close informal contact. The experience of institutions set up with a more exclusively applied focus, such as the International Rice Research Institute, apparently has led them to an increasing appreciation of a permanent, in-house, more basic research capacity. Concentration on local problems also reflects the fact that their solution receives the greatest political support from local agricultural interests. Yield increases and cost reductions supplied gratis to all producers in an industry tend to reduce output prices rather than increase profits. But to the extent that the effect is only on local producers, the price reduction response is muted, and the local benefits to the sector are more likely to be positive. Given productivity increases offer greater benefits if they occur on a national or international scale, but the benefits would tend to go to consumers, who have little influence on the system. The result is that local problems get the most attention, and the spatially decentralized research system is well suited to addressing them. The permanence of the research and extension staffing means that there is an accumulation of institutional capacity in the form of knowledge and expertise to respond quickly and effectively to emergency problems, such as the poinsettia whitefly or the abruptly-apparent selenium toxicity to waterfowl at Kesterson reservoir in California, as they arise. This \"option value\" could be important to the extent that the same response cannot be had as efficiently from the private sector in the form of temporary consultants or contractors. When the whitefly struck California, would it have been better for each affected farmer to have sent out for bids from private flyproblem-solvers? The argument for public provision of quick access to a standing capacity for flexible emergency response seems similar to the argument for a publicly supported standing army or fire brigade (granted some would argue against the latter). The argument has force if in-house performance incentives are more appropriate, if the externalities from easy contact with and access to basic researchers are important, and/or if it would be difficult to know what contractor to choose if the expertise were not already present in the public sector. The association of research with teaching is a practice that is widespread across the academic spectrum. As Ruttan (1982, p. 110) reports, \"Over time, a consensus seems to have emerged in the United States that research is highly complementary to graduate education, but less so to undergraduate teaching.\" But the interplay between functions is difficult to analyse and not well understood. Obviously class time competes with research time, for faculty and students. On the other hand the functions are complementary; in a sense each offers positive externalities to the other. Students who learn how to apply their classroom learning by participating in real research in a critical environment under the supervision of their professors can reap educational and motivational rewards. Furthermore their work has an actual social contribution, in contrast to fictional educational exercises. Their experience might also help students make better and earlier choices about the direction of their careers. Such benefits would normally become more available as the student advances in his or her academic career. For professors and other teachers, involvement with institutional research helps keep their teaching relevant to current problems. This is likely to be more important for advanced undergraduate and graduate classes where there is usually more discretion about choice of subject matter and teaching tends to be more focused on research challenges. As researchers, their involvement in teaching, especially in advanced courses, helps broaden their perspective beyond their currently pressing research challenges to comprehend current work in other corers of their academic field, and in related specializations. Since scientific progress often results from drawing links between lines of investigation, involvement in teaching can encourage faster progress in research. The above discussion has focused on some rationales for the current structure of agricultural research, as seen in the land grant system in particular. The features noted have their drawbacks, of course. Decentralization means inevitable duplication of some research (especially basic research) and of teaching functions. Permanent employment on a program basis makes it possible for deadwood to accrue and for the institutional culture to tolerate sloth and lack of responsiveness to social demands in both education and research. Teaching demands can divert bright minds from vital research tasks, and, on the other hand, research demands are currently being blamed for neglect of undergraduate teaching in the universities and colleges in general. The social optimality of the land grant approach to agricultural research in trading off the advantages and disadvantages of its institutional design has not been scientifically established, of course. But its contribution to American agricultural productivity is well recognized. (See, for example, Nelson andWright, 1992, p. 1947.) The relevant question now is how the existing structure of public and private collaborative research will respond to changes in the social, institutional and scientific environment."}, {"section_title": "Private and Public Sector Responses to the New Environment", "text": "We have some evidence already about the private sector response to the new opportunities. There has been an explosion in the private creation of new varieties after they were covered by the PVPA (Evenson 1983), and this occurred with conventional technology; it was not caused by the new possibilities associated with genetic engineering (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1992). One might have anticipated this private sector response from the history of successful private production and marketing of hybrid corn varieties, which had some natural protection from unauthorized duplication by customers. New advances in biotechnology have opened up a whole new technological frontier, and patented life forms and other genetic engineering products are already being marketed to agricultural producers as well as to other industries including prominently those in the health sector. Furthermore there is a complementarity between the institutional and technological advances. Modem analysis of DNA is likely to make policing of life form patents more effective. The ability to patent and copyright has also changed the marketing possibilities for public and non-profit research institutions and the researchers who are employed in them. Whereas previously they had few opportunities to sell their output (as distinct from their services as research inputs) the institutions, and their employees, now face very significant rewards for success in meeting market needs, the diversity of which is reflected in the fact that two of the most successful to date are the Cohen-Boyer genesplicing patent and Gatorade. An agricultural example is the domination of the market for strawberry varieties by the University of California, Davis."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Institutional Structure", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Vertical Integration of Public Agricultural Research", "text": "The new opportunities to sell the property rights to embodied research outputs will affect the public and private research structures in many dimensions. Perhaps the most obvious is that private for-profit applied research is more feasible for these new innovations, so that the public role need not be vertically integrated right down to the farm gate, as it has been for other agricultural innovations without capturable property rights. Somewhere between basic research and extension, an interface can develop between the public and private innovation institutions. The transfers will tend to be vertical, with the private party downstream. If the transfer happens at the pretechnology stage, before the knowledge is embodied in a marketable product, it is similar to the public provision of technology to farmers, in that the private party acquires a free good. In this case, though, it is an input to further (private) research and development, rather than directly to the production process itself. This distinction can be crucial. The purchaser(s) of university research output are likely to be corporate entities with substantial market power, not competitive farmers. To the extent that the clientele of university research is dominated by large powerful firms, administrators of land-grant institutions may have a \"potentially massive public relations problem\" (Kenney et al 1982 p. 52). As noted above, market power in the relevant final product is essential where developmental expenditures are significant and any results are not protected by patents. If a potential purchasing firm is unprotected by pre-existing market power, it might well be reluctant to invest in the development of the technology to the marketing stage, for fear that others equally free to acquire the public technology gratis might beat it to the punch, or even copy the technology if it is too applied to pass the novelty and non-obviousness tests required for patenting. The more novel the innovation, the less likely the availability of pre-existing market power to protect it. This might explain why the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia found that they literally could not give their technology away. A policy of exclusive licensing was adopted to elicit greater interest in adoption of its discoveries by the private sector. Where this consideration is important, the public/private interface will tend to lie beyond the stage at which the first property right is acquired. Significant patenting will occur in the public part of the research sector. Private participation will replace some public efforts at the applied end of the research spectrum. This is already happening in other technological areas such as irrigation, where the dealers are the final agents of information transfer to farmers; a major part of extension ends at the dealer's yard. But substitution of private for public research will remain concentrated in the development stage, where further patenting is a possibility. Another obstacle to direct technology transfer, found by Postlewait, Parker, and Zilberman in a survey, is the reluctance of in-house research departments to encourage the purchase of technologies that were not developed in the company itself. As a result, licenses to some of the most advanced technology developed in the U.S. have not been purchased by local companies. For example, a Stanford researcher invented an music chip for electronic keyboards. Despite the technology's obvious potential to revolutionize the industry, no American company wanted to license the chip, and eventually Yamaha licensed the technology and dominated the market. Where the private innovator has market power, its research may, as mentioned above, extend up towards basic research, even without the legal protection of property rights. In this case the innovator may well be a large firm with a structure of bureaucracy possibly similar to that of a public institution. Some other large firms take the opposite tack, acquiring technology by purchasing small companies that were developed around a certain innovation. Some large chemical companies lurk around trying to absorb promising innovative companies. In turn, these young companies need the marketing capacity of the big companies and they may seek an adopting parent. In effect some of the big companies are marketing organizations that rely on small R&D companies to develop a diversified product mix. They may also be potential customers for university research rights. Increasingly, extension personnel are becoming more involved in giving policy advice to government and to public agencies, and in the facilitation of environmental management and controls. In these roles they extend knowledge produced by university research. As the downstream reach of extension is rolled back in some areas of technology, it is expanded in other areas to meet changing needs."}, {"section_title": "University Marketing Arrangements", "text": "The possibility of patenting research findings in a public institution such as a land grant university raises many issues, among which are: \u2022 How will the rights be marketed? * Who shares in the revenue? * Should the university participate in development investment? Answers to some of these questions already exist (at least provisionally) in the structure of the \"Office of Technology Transfer\" (OTT) or of the \"Office of Technology Licensing\" (OTL), themselves institutional innovations seen in several universities. The leader is Stanford, whose OTL is available for patenting and licensing the research of any faculty who wish to use it. The proceeds are divided as follows: After 15 percent is taken off the top to finance the OTL, net royalties are split into one-third shares for the inventor, one third for the inventor's department, and one-third for the university. In fiscal 1992, Stanford received $25.5 million in royalties and fees. (Barnum 1992) The University of California has a similar systemwide office that awards university employees on a sliding scale, with 50 percent of the first $100,000 of net royalties, 35 percent of the next $400,000 and 20 percent of any higher amounts going to the inventor. Total revenues to the University from patents and royalties were $28.8 million in 1992 (Barnum 1992). In contrast to Stanford, faculty at the University of California, which has a central OTL, must use university services to patent university research. Some campuses, including Berkeley, are now developing their own campus-based OTL's to offer better service to their faculty. Thus researchers at both public and private universities can stand to gain a substantial share of the realised value of their discoveries , and their departments and the whole institution also stand to gain. Paradoxically, the explicit incentive appears greater in these public institutions than in the typical large private firm, where the patents of employees are routinely assigned to the firm via prior contractual commitments and there is usually no significant explicit reward to the patent recipient. What has been created is a monetary market for those types of innovation output that can obtain legal protection, within the context of the hierarchical bureaucratic structure of the university. Given the current popularity of markets as allocators of resources, the potential significance of this institutional innovation, for the university as well as for the researcher, should need little elaboration. One benefit of these companies is that, by their proximity and their personal links to the university, they are often good sources of employment for students and graduates. They also enable the university to continue to employ high-quality research professors while paying them less than the market value of their services. But can the university design contracts that give it a greater share of the wealth which it helps to produce, off-campus, via its indirect contribution of prior research, expertise and other services? This is a challenge for the future, not unlike the challenge of optimal design of contracts for university research undertaken for the private sector. In both cases there are real pitfalls, including the danger of exposure of the university to legal actions (as seen previously in the tomato harvester case) and the danger of distortion of the university's research mission by private interest that \"free ride\" on university research efforts. (See Ulrich, Furtan and Schmitz (1986) for a discussion of free-riding by private-sector brewing companies on public research in Barley in Canada.)"}, {"section_title": "Implications for University Performance", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Efficiency", "text": "As noted, the frontier technologies we have been discussing happen to offer unusual opportunities for market returns due to patent and copyright protection. Patents and copyrights are very effective at encouraging the researcher to use his or her own information, informed by market pressures, to choose between research topics according to his or her capabilities, research costs, the probability of success, and the value if successful. Since research resource management is characterized by uncertainties and informational shortages, this utilization of the researcher's information and his or her market expectations is extremely important. The disclosure mandated under patent law also makes the information discovered more accessible for other members of society who can use it in further innovation efforts. If instead a prize (money or promotion) is the reward for achieving a prespecified goal, the researcher's information about the market value of success is unused unless an effective means of gathering it is found by the prize-setter. This does not matter if the latter has accurately identified an appropriate social goal. Some  Ruttan, 1978). Prizes for achievements defined ex ante do not reward such skills. If we assume the prize setter has similar skill and the latitude to use it, there may be no problem, but this is a big assumption. On the other hand, if research contracts are awarded by competitive bids (an increasingly popular trend), private information about capabilities and success prospects is also lost to management. When the research process is managed by central direction of research inputs including personnel, all of the private information about capabilities costs, probabilities, and market returns may be neglected. (For more on this see Wright 1983Wright , 1985 But patents, copyrights and similar awards have their problems as research motivators. The race to be first to patent may involve wasteful duplication of effort on similar projects by personnel within or between institutions, especially if the resources devoted to a given line of research are very responsive to economic incentives (Barzel, 1968, Wright 1985. Duplication is made more likely by the need for secrecy about research strategies in preserving a competitive advantage. Collaboration with complementary research colleagues may be discouraged for the same reason. This problem will be particularly severe in large teams such as a research laboratory where individual contributions are difficult to verify. In addition the patent incentive might be too powerful in the sense that it distracts attention from other important tasks with less direct motivations. For university personnel, these could include teaching, advising and other institutional services, on the one hand, and research (such as more basic investigations) which yields non-patentable knowledge. Similar kinds of objections to providing value-based rewards for innovation are increasingly expressed in the business management literature, largely influenced by recent Japanese thinking associated with the \"Kaizen\" (gradual improvement) system. They may also explain the observation that large private firms in the United States generally choose less high-powered, more implicit, rewards for their employees than the arrangements now becoming popular in research universities. In the case of universities, it should be borne in mind that many of the problems with the new incentives, including duplication, envy, and misdirection of effort already exist in the system of rewards based on implicit criteria imposed ex post by deans and/or academic peers, from tenure and merit increases to general prizes such as the Nobel Prize, reflected in the adage \"Publish or Perish.\" The advent of a parallel system of market-determined rewards might to some extent offset the distortions of the traditional implicit incentive structure. For example, the fact that researchers worry that the patent incentive biases research toward applications (Blumenthal et al. 1986 p. 1364) might be good news to those like Ed Schuh who claim that university research has lost a sense of relevance (Schuh 1986(Schuh , 1991. In principal, this issue should be amenable to empirical resolution for specific cases."}, {"section_title": "Social Externalities", "text": "The market transfer of knowledge has been emphasized above. Two points are worth bearing in mind about the associated social contribution. First, an innovation, even if patented, usually transfers benefits to society greater than what the consumer pays. An innovator will often reduce, directly or indirectly, the price of some consumer goods, generating consumer surplus. Furthermore, the disclosure inherent in the patent process furnishes a knowledge externality, as mentioned above. In short, monetary returns do not necessary constitute adequate rewards for invention, even in some cases where a strong patent is obtained. In these cases, public employment of researchers, and/or other incentives such as prestige might be beneficial.

We can expect that this will result in less vertical integration of public research in several areas including production of new plant varieties, leaving a greater role for the private sector in applied research. In other areas, the role of university research and extension may well expand. "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "When I was an undergraduate at Purdue University in the mid-1950s, I first met the director of an Agricultural Experiment Station (AES). I held several jobs to support myself and family. One of them was helping with research on forages and dairy cattle nutrition, both in the laboratory and in the field. On this particular summer day I was at the Purdue dairy center working in the field with dairy cows on an intensive experiment comparing forage management systems of continuous grazing, daily strip grazing and green chopping of forage. The project was co-led by Professor G. O. Mott of agronomy and Professor D. L. Hill of the dairy husbandry department. On this hot summer afternoon they had brought AES Director Norman J. Volk and a dairyman from Indiana to see the project in action. They even asked me, the lowly student worker, to tell what I was doing on the project. I learned some time later that they had a request in to Director Volk for additional funds for the project. Apparently Director Volk was favorably impressed by their proposal because he approved the request for funding. The project went on and I continued to have a job. This simple story suggests at least four things: (1) the AES Director was important; (2) he had control of funds; (3) he had the authority to act on his judgments; and (4) he was interested in the input of a farmer-user. Let me point to another example of the former paradigm for priority setting, this one from proceedings of the 100th anniversary of the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station: \"The attitude here at Wisconsin was best expressed in the words of Professor E. B. Hart -that the station worker in cooperation with the station director take a practical farm problem of importance in a local region or state and then dig as deep as he can in science to find the answer to the problem.\" (emphasis mine) Let me hasten to add that I happen to believe that there is much merit in this philosophy. I hope that when translated into contemporary terms, it still can be the foundation of the AES process. However, much has changed from those simpler times. Another example of priority setting is the PIPD, or Problem Identification, Program/Project Development system used effectively at some SAES. In this system the AES administrators and scientists seek input from clientele as well as extension workers and station scientists to get input for identifying high priority problems. Then, by sitting down together, they develop projects to address those problems. There is a risk associated with such a close linkage and implied immediacy of response. Caution should be used in entering into such a planning and program identification process unless you have control of the resources and are prepared to respond positively! I am suggesting that in the new paradigm (which I'll discuss in some detail later) we go outside to learn real world problems and link that with a joint effort to seek help in attracting funds to address the problems. This experiment station system, based largely on federal (Hatch and McIntire-Stennis) formula funds plus state funds, and near autonomy of the director, was very productive. However, the paradigm has shifted for some SAES, is shifting for 2 many others, and likely will shift for all by the year 2000. In my view these shifts are not inherently either good or bad. They simply are reality and our challenge is to deal effectively with them to identify the high priority problems and assist in obtaining funds to address them. With that hint of how I intend to approach my assignment, let me make just three introductory points: 1) I don't pretend to have the formula for setting priorities in State Agricultural Experiment Stations (SAES). Even the ideas I will be sharing with you certainly are not mine alone, but a composite of where I'm at in my synthesis and thinking process. 2) I will talk about some key components of a priority setting process which seem to me to be important wherever we may be. 3) Priority setting, in terms of both parameters and process, has changed and likely will be dramatically different tomorrow than it is today. I suggest that our challenge is to be prepared \"to do the best of things in the worst of times.\""}, {"section_title": "Changes and Impacts", "text": "Of course many things have changed over the years. Here are just a few that come to mind: -In the 1950s to 70s, AES funding was largely federal formula funds and state funds. -Today more sources are involved and many of them priority setting implications. -Funds directly to a Station are more limited and restricted. -Directors have less \"power\" in the sense that funds controlled represents power. -The priority setting process is more complex and there are many more stakeholders. -SAES are not nearly as centrally managed (and funded) as are the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) laboratories and international centers. -Science has greatly advanced and has become much more sophisticated and expensive to conduct. -An expanded. more diverse groups of stakeholders are asking questions, such as: -is too much emphasis is being placed on research at the expense of teaching. -what about public vs. private roles. -is too much emphasis is being placed on \"farming\" at the expense of neglecting other increasingly visible areas related to our mission (and where our graduates go for employment!). Here I'm thinking of things like: diet and health; food safety; environment and water quality; waste management etc. Need to be cognizant of such concerns and to recognize that these priority issues must be evaluated as well. [There is something of a paradox here. Farming or production agriculture makes up less than 3% of the food and agricultural sector, but still has more \"clout\" than that in terms of getting things done.] These changes have several impacts relevant to priority setting and implementation in SAESs today. -Less ability to fully fund research projects out of resources controlled by the AES. -More emphasis on using the limited flexible resources to \"jump start\" programs of new faculty members, provide start-up packages, and as matching requirements to get additional funds. -Greater reliance on outside funds, which dampens any singular effort or plan to set priorities."}, {"section_title": "Priority Setting", "text": "Needs and opportunities always exist. Research is conducted on some topics and not on others. Priorities are always there; the question is who selects them. Without a well thought out timely plan, pressures are in charge and the present gets undue attention, not the future; fighting brush fires become the priority of the day; defense is the game, not offense; infighting rules, not meeting outside needs, threats and opportunities."}, {"section_title": "Levels of Priority Decision Makingi", "text": "At this point I'll simply introduce this topic, so we all can think about as we examine the process in more detail in the remainder of this paper. -National level The process of priority setting and establishing categories for funding tends to be more long-term considering impact and appropriation of funds. The SAES community expends considerable time and effort by in \"tending\" the system. There have been some big payoffs for the efforts. For example, the start of the competitive grants program in 1977 and the influx of additional funds for biotechnology in 1985. This program was grown further with the initiation of the National Research Initiative (NRI) in 1991. The Water Quality Special grant is another example of the success of initiatives by the Land Grant Agriculture community. While there has been debate about whether emphasis should be placed on \"formula funds\" or \"competitive grants\", it is interesting to note that in recent years the only times there have been increases in formula funding was in those years where a major competitive grant program was started or \"grown\". Although arguments showing the importance of, and impressive returns from formula funds, Congress has favored research funding options where they have more control over the agenda. -State and Local Some states realized significant growth in state funding for AES during late 70s and early 80s Unfortunately not all of it has \"stuck\" as states got into fiscal trouble. However, it a very critical point today, whether to maintain what we have or in some cases to actually capture some growth. -A simple outline of various kinds of funds used in AES programs is shown in Table 1: \"Funding Sources and Uses\""}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "Principal strategies Next I would like to discuss some of the critical points for \"priority setting\" in these times of shifting paradigms."}, {"section_title": "Mission.", "text": "The first and foremost strategic decision which each SAES must make is determination of its purpose or mission. Failure to determine that and determine it well leaves the SAES with no focal point or central thrust for lining up the organization's energies and resources to accomplish the most desirable ends. We need to realize that an organization cannot really determine its mission or purpose in isolation; the client or \"customer\" makes this determination! Therefore, to be effective in developing our mission statements and subsequent strategies and tactics we must proceed from the outside (the client and the world in which we must operate) to the inside (management's response to the client's needs and wants). (McConkey, 1981) To determine the mission of any organization it is necessary to carefully answer three major questions: 1. What is our present purpose? 2. How will the future impact on our present purpose if we make no changes? 3. What should our purpose become? (Of these, number two is more important than number one and number three is the critical one.) Infrastructure at the strategic level. Where and how to allocate scarce, flexible resources, or base funding in the AES, is key. By this I mean faculty, facilities, and core operating budgets. Since most universities and SAES are in a re-allocation rather than in a growth mode, it is important to make such decisions at \"targets of opportunity\" when transitions can be least disruptive to the \"losers.\" Strategic Allocation of Faculty Positions: -Faculty members (or AES scientists, if you prefer -I'll come back to this distinction later) comprise the \"engine\" which powers the entire system. Thus wise allocation of scarce faculty positions is critical. Deciding which areas of expertise to capture in a faculty position is key area for strategic placement of resources. The impact is long-term because a faculty member (and the area of expertise carried with that person) may be with us for 25 years or more. In our Purdue Agriculture system, all open positions created by retirements or persons leaving the university for any reason, revert to the Dean's office. To prepare for the strategic allocation of scarce faculty positions, departments have developed long-term (10-year) staffing plans and they are asked to update them periodically. Once (or in good times, perhaps twice) per year department heads are invited to submit their high priority requests for positions, along with justification. The Dean and Directors make decisions about which positions will be allocated. Occasionally, a very high priority position will be acted upon immediately upon learning of the (impending) vacancy, but that is rare. Any downsizing (rightsizing) 6 that is to occur is accomplished by decreasing the number of positions in the pool, not by making such decisions on a position by position basis as the vacancy occurs. Thus, departments technically do not have \"open positions\" until a position is (re-) allocated to them. Also, they have not lost any specific positions; it may not have been requested, it may be a possibility for later consideration etc., but positions are not collapsed at the Department level by this system of allocating scarce faculty positions. Now let us get on with factors involved in the process of deciding which positions are to be allocated. Areas of expertise needed for the teaching function may be the more important driver, or the aspect receiving first consideration today. Guidelines I use in evaluating the priority of the position for my input in terms of the priority of research component of a position (especially if more that 25% time assignment to research) include the following: * Opportunity for outside support to develop and sustain a productive research program. A more detailed version of this list in the format of an evaluation guide is shown in Table 2. Selecting the individual faculty member. -Some traits may be universally required, but many have to be specific to the position. -Overall, priority is given to: * Excellence in their field. * Evidence of strong productivity * Communication abilities (and ability to relate their work to a variety of audiences). * Entrepreneur with a team spirit. -A self starter who can develop nationally recognized programs. -Yet, one who will work effectively as a team member for at least part of their research. * Ability to handle multiple responsibilities. -Education and research -More than one area at a time. (For example, to conduct basic and applied projects at the same time; individual project and a team project.)"}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "A candidate for a faculty position in the plant sciences area that we were interviewing recently described the situation rather nicely. I had asked her a question about how she would select particular specific problems to work on. She responded, \"There is a tendency for scientists, especially recent graduates or postdocs, to think, well I have these abilities, techniques, capabilities, let's see what problem I can find to use them on.\" She added that she believes it would be much better to go out and listen to what the problems (of farmers) are, and then design investigations to solve those problems. She had the insight to add, \"I'd better go out and tell people what I'm doing If people don't know what you're doing, they may think you're dispensable.\" I would simply add, that statement applies as well to research programs as it does to individual faculty members! More vigorous approaches to informing clientele and the general public about what we're accomplishing to help them are necessary. We need to capture and communicate the excitement and relevance of discovery."}, {"section_title": "Faculty members or Station Scientists?", "text": "There are significant differences in philosophies and operational models among the Land-grant colleges of Agriculture and each institution must address this issue in their own context. However, it is becoming much more common for an individual to carry responsibilities in two of the functional areas of teaching, research and extension. Or to put it another way, it is common for an individual to have responsibilities for both education and discovery. Faculty members participating in the AES at Purdue (and I believe in most settings) must be \"complete\" faculty members in context of the definition appropriate for each of our respective universities. Most AES Scientists (i.e. faculty members with AES appointments) also have a responsibility to participate in education (classroom teaching and/or extension education). It is generally accepted that teaching is the fundamental function for a college or university. Over time, some so-called \"research universities\" developed a pattern where some faculty did not teach, spending all their time on research and related scholarly activities. On the other hand, most predominately teaching colleges and universities have expected their faculty members not only to teach, but also to be involved in some research or scholarly activity. In the new paradigm, I believe that every faculty member -even those at research universities or with an AES appointment -will be expected to participate more fully in the education mission. It seems to me that this is an appropriate expectation. But, considering the purposes of this paper, I do not wish to digress into a discussion of the synergism between research and teaching. Rather, I would like to focus on the unique research responsibilities of a faculty member with an AES appointment. Such a faculty member is expected to do more than simply \"conduct research\" and to obtain some funds to conduct research or engage in a scholarly activity of his/her choosing. The AES faculty member already has part of his/her salary paid and time assigned to conduct research. It is part of the contract for such an appointment. In addition, that research is to be directed to jointly determined thrusts. This is done not to stifle creativity, but to provide focus. Creativity should be encouraged and rewarded. Changes in the defined thrust can be made by means of revisions in the AES projects. I would suggest that the AES faculty members have fundamental responsibility for the kinds of research related activities listed here. Note, a specific faculty member may be involved in 1 and/or 2, and/or 3, but all will be expected to be involved in 4 and 5. 1) Mission oriented basic research 2) Applied research and site specific systems development. 3) Consumer-report type research activities. 4) Educating and training graduate students 5) Communicating to a variety of \"publics\" (and not just to colleagues). Operating Resources. The level of operating resources and funds to put around faculty members is another important component of infrastructure. Strategic decisions in this area also are critical. The funding process used at Purdue places most of the core or base funding in the departments. The department head has responsibility to allocate and manage those resources in the context of that departments research program as defined by their AES projects. The cost of conducting research varies among the disciplines encompassed by agriculture. This needs to be taken into account when an AES Director evaluates the equity of funding provided to various departments. I have developed some estimates of costs by discipline/department, starting with expenditures data for several SAES and making some adjustments based on known anomalies. More precise estimates of the cost by discipline would be very helpful. Part of the charge I was given when invited to prepare this paper, was to identify areas where the NC-208 Regional Research committee could contribute to the priority setting process. Here is one example. We need better estimates of the cost of doing research in various disciplines and in department composites. Another strategic decision which must be made is the allocation of scarce resources to faculty positions versus operating funds. Institutions vary in the flexibility that exists at the College or Station level. In situations where the College has significant flexibility in moving funds between positions and operating funds, a critical strategic question is, \"At what point should some faculty positions be eliminated and the funds re-allocated to support programs and projects?\" It was noted that faculty is the engine which drives the research machine, not only in terms of creativity and productivity, but also in getting grants! But at what point on the curve of shrinking resources available to put around faculty members to make them productive (and somewhat direct the research program) should the decision be made to decrease the size of the engine in order to fuel it for more effective operation? Not at all an easy decision, but one that is crucial! Multi-State Programming. Another strategy which needs to be considered is to build and expand on Regional research, developing innovative ways to enhance multi-state programming. Typically in regional research a topic or problem is identified and then the Stations divide up the effort for solving the problem. Regional research often involves most all of the states in the region and increasingly may involve Stations from other regions as well. Alternative models for multi-state planning should be pursued. In terms of alternatives to regional research, there are (at least) two other kinds of Multi-State Planning needs, usually involving 2 to 4 contiguous states who may choose to get together and target areas to: (1) Cooperate by picking different parts of the puzzle on which to work, OR (2) Cooperate by agreeing to work on different puzzles. Such bordering state coalitions require a shared vision for a need to get together and seriously consider how to do things more efficiently. (1) Pursue, and ultimately agree on, problem and model to be pursued. (2) Develop truly integrated efforts in specifically targeted areas. May involve both research and extension and perhaps teaching. (3) The process often may start with discussions among Deans and /or Directors. (4) Next need to get together with department heads. Keep faculty informed by each department head and invite input and ideas. (5) Faculty planning and implementation (with appropriate administrators to facilitate and to uphold the pledge). (6) Note, some of these activities could go the route of establishing regional research projects, but the appropriateness of keeping linkages from targeted states need to be met. It may be difficult under the formal regional research system to achieve some of the flexibility and speed of response required by the \"virtual corporation\". NOTE, THE MODEL: the \"Virtual Corporation\". book by William H. Davidow and Michael S. Malone (1992) (Also highlighted in Business Week, February 8, 1993, cover story on pp. 98-103) The Virtual Corporation can be defined as a temporary network of companies that come together quickly to exploit fast-changing opportunities. It can be the ultimate in adaptability. The key attributes of such an organization are: (1) Excellence; (2) Technology; (3) Opportunism (partnerships will be less permanent, less formal, and more opportunistic); (4) Trust (these relationships make companies far more reliant on each other and require far more trust than ever before ); (5) No borders."}, {"section_title": "Capitalize on contemporary issues and concerns.", "text": "Agricultural research needs to be both forward looking (basic research) and also active in solving the important problems of the day (applied and adaptive research). Thus, it is obvious that the leaders and scientists have a responsibility to conduct research on problems of concern. However, there is another reason to vigorously address contemporary issues and concerns. Agriculture no longer has the political clout it once had. To gain the public and political support necessary to achieve research funding, it is necessary to build coalitions with groups who have captured the imagination of large segments of the general population. Current high priority issues include the environment; food safety, diet and health; competitiveness; rural community and economic development; and upgrading skills of individual citizens. Most of the disciplines within Agricultural Experiment Stations can participate in productive research addressing these problems. It is especially critical that we build coalitions to develop plans to address these contemporary issues and concerns."}, {"section_title": "Building an Empowering a Constituency within the State.", "text": "The following discussion is based on a presentation I made to the New Directors' Workshop sponsored by USDA-CSRS in Washington, D.C. on April 22, 1992.

What is the essence of building a constituency? Communicate: -In the real estate business it is said that three things are important: Location, Location and Location. -In advocacy efforts for a public entity such as an AES, three things are important: Communication. Communication and Communication. It is extremely important to remember that communication means, \"--the interchange of concerns, opinions, and information --.\" Thus, communication must involve listening as much as talking. 1) Communication: Ask, learn, know the concerns of those we exist to serve and whose support we need. In terms of both the \"need to\" and the \"how to\" of listening to our customers, I refer you to a paper written by John Gerber, while he was Assistant Director of the Illinois AES. Tom Peters (of In Search of Excellence fame) writes, \"to begin with, good listeners get out from behind the desk. Good listeners construct settings so as to maximize naive listening, the undistorted sort.\" Similarly we need to get out with our \"customers\" and listen to their interests and concerns. 2) Communication: Develop a crisp plan of how your group (AES) can be an important part of the solution to the problems they see.  6) Communication: Continuous, although intensity may vary. It is very important to maintain contacts especially when you don't want them to do anything. One of the key reasons (Applies to legislators, their staffs, and to user or support groups.) 7) Opportunities can be created to keep clientele informed and seek their input on various relevant processes. For example, ESCOP has an elaborate planning process to develop research priorities (which are then inserted into the Joint Council and the USDA planning and budget development processes). The SAES directors vote to develop the final ranking for ESCOP each year. I have found it helpful to seek input from various groups in Indiana in terms of ranking these priorities."}, {"section_title": "II.

Environmental and food safety concerns have surfaced with greater intensity. The decline in the number of farms and farm population slowed during the 1970s, but they declined sharply again during the 1980s. Production of agricultural commodities has become increasingly concentrated regionally and in specialized farming units that are much larger and run by increasingly sophisticated farm businesses. Within the agricultural economics profession, concerns have been expressed that SAES research has become too \"disciplinary\" and needs to return to more effective linkages between research, extension, and teaching (Bonnen 1983;Schuh 1986). Numerous studies have confirmed good overall rates of return to public agricultural research expenditures (e.g., , but significant problems have been demonstrated with the allocation between pretechnology and applied sciences and between plant and animal oriented research (see Huffman and Evenson 1993, Table 9.1). With the economic recession starting in 1990 followed by a slow recovery and reduced real expenditures by state governments on SAES research and extension and by the federal government on extension, deans of colleges of agriculture and directors of agricultural experiment stations and cooperative extension services have turned to generally tighter central control with more emphasis on setting priorities, review of proposals, and management (also see Office of Technology Assessment 1991). Some land-grant institutions have reorganized their structures to separate administration of extension from teaching/research or of extension/research from teaching in order to enhance direct relationships with the field. At the same time, federal funding of the land-grant system has tended to shift to competitive grants and contracts, and administrators have shifted from resistance to encouraging pursuit of both public and private grant and contract funds. These changes raise a number of issues about the future of agricultural research and extension in the United States. In an earlier paper, Just and Huffman (1992) presented some principles dealing with the structure and management of U.S. agricultural research and education. This paper extends the examination of new economic and political incentives facing land-grant administrators and agricultural scientists and presents econometric evidence about the effects of current changes in structure and management of public agricultural research on U.S. agriculture. First, some important issues facing land-grant agricultural research and extension are examined and then hypotheses are formulated. Second, evidence is presented showing selected organizational and structural characteristics of SAES research and then econometric evidence is presented showing what determines structure and management of SAES research and how structure, management, and funding of SAES research affect state agricultural multifactor productivity. While measures of performance other than multifactor agricultural productivity may be important and of interest (e.g., number of scientists trained, effects on environmental quality), we leave those areas of inquiry to future investigations. Some Important Issues Vertical Integration of Science Bonnen (1986), Schuh (1986), and others have argued that the land-grant system has become unresponsive and SAES research has become \"too disciplinary\" in its orientation. They argue that the activities in each of the fields or departments supported by colleges of agriculture and agricultural experiment stations have become increasingly focused on output indicators and rewards cherished by the respective scientific societies, e.g., journals of the American Agricultural Economics Association, American Society of Agronomy, etc. These arguments focus on horizontal linkage of the applied agricultural disciplines, including activities in teaching, research, and extension. 1 From another perspective, the agricultural disciplines may be viewed as inadequately linked vertically. That is, U.S. agricultural R&D is part of a much larger public and private R&D system. Strong upstream linkages to the general sciences and the parent disciplines which produce the knowledge that fuels pretechnology sciences and downstream technology development in agriculture may be needed. 2   argue that these vertical linkages among disciplines need strengthening. When applied agricultural sciences become disconnected from pretechnology sciences, the flow of new innovations dries up rapidly. For example, weak ties of SAES research to general and pretechnology sciences was a barrier in the early 1980s to applications of biotechnology to agriculture. Both vertical and horizontal linkages appear to be required in order to have a longterm successful science and technology system. In order to identify changes that enhance the organization of the public system, perspective is needed on how the general R&D system functions and how public agricultural research fits into this larger system. Hypothesis 1. Integration of pretechnology and applied sciences and extension activities does not enhance public agricultural research productivity."}, {"section_title": "Formulas, Grants, and Earmarks: Allocations of Federal Funds", "text": "Arguments for and against both formula and competitive grant funding of SAES research have been made for many years (Rockefeller Foundation 1982;National Research Council 1989 The merit or peer-review system has several characteristics argued to be advantages and others that are disadvantages. Proponents claim that (1) experts used in the reviewing and ranking process are highly knowledgeable and make good absolute and relative judgements about the scientific merit and competency of principal investigators, (2) only high quality proposals and competent researchers are funded, and (3) research funds can easily be channeled into new areas. However, the merit or peer review process also appears to have disadvantages. First, the disbursement of federal research funds supporting peer-review programs is concentrated in relatively few institutions and states (Office of Technology Assessment 1991, p. 125-26). Second, Chubin and Hackett (1990) have documented that peer-review processes are burdened with many hidden and major conflicts of interest that tend to subvert the process and make it political. Experts and review panels make evaluations that cannot be refuted by principal investigators, panels tend to take narrow views of acceptable procedures and rank too highly proposals of \"friends and associates.\" Third, the proposal writing and evaluating process consumes large amounts of scientists' time that could be allocated to other productive activities. Academic earmarking, sometimes called pork-barrel funding, provides funds for particular research projects directly allocated by Congress, are not subjected to peer review, and are not competitively awarded (Office of Technology Assessment 1991, p. 87). These funds have grown rapidly since 1980 and apparently have been used by universities to build major new research facilities, to undertake large research projects than otherwise would not have been undertaken, and to add significantly to research capacity in new areas or regions. Academic earmarks are a channel by which some institutions and states may be able to expand their research capacity quickly and ultimately become more competitive in peer reviewed proposals (e.g., the Soil Tilth Center at Iowa State University, the Soybean Laboratory at the University of Illinois). Some groups see disadvantages of earmarks from politizing science, reducing the average quality of research, and diverting research funds away from federal peer-review or formula research programs (Office of Technology Assessment 1991, p. 88). In reality, all mechanisms for allocating federal research funds suffer from political considerations whereby characteristics other than scientific merit matter (Chubin 1992); and formula, competitive, and earmarked funding each contain some good and some bad incentives. The net advantages of a federal competitive-grants system of agricultural funding, however, may be exaggerated. First, the competitive-grant process places a major burden on agricultural scientists for conducting the reviews upon which granting decisions are made. Bredahl, Bryant, and Ruttan (1982) note that the cost of entreprenuring and managing competitive grants falls mostly on the researchers compared to the cost of entreprenuring and managing formula funds that falls mostly on administrators. Second, less than 50 percent of all written proposals (e.g., in the National Research Initiative) are awarded funds, and some of the time spent on these activities represent socially wasted resources. Third, the size of awarded grants is almost always significantly less than the marginal cost of a project, which means that resources from other sources must be used to complete the project (e.g., from time otherwise allocated to other research projects, teaching, or leisure). Fourth, projects are funded for short duration (often for one year, and never more than five years) although some projects take 10 years or longer to complete, e.g., crop rotation and beef-cattle crossbreeding experiments. This causes inefficiency when successful research requires a long-term sustained effort or a group of scientists with specialized skills. Fifth, institutions must generally carry out-dated scientists on teaching appointments and new scientists on \"star\" scientists' projects, e.g. as postdoctoral researchers or research associates. Terminating tenured university (and government) scientists is just as difficult with competitive-grant funding as with formula-funded research. Sixth, the criteria for allocating federal research funds have a political (or nonscientific) factor which reduces the claimed advantages for competitive-grant funded agricultural research. Thus, the issue of whether to fund research with competitive grants, formula funds, or earmarked funds is difficult to answer. The answer may depend on the particular circumstances. Hypothesis 2. Competitive grant funding and earmarked funding of agricultural landgrant research is no more productive than traditional formula funding."}, {"section_title": "Managed Public Research", "text": "The production of scientific discoveries is an area where implicit contracts rather than elaborate formal written contracts dominate. Short, formal written contracts generally accompany inter-institution transfers of funds for research. These contracts usually state in general terms that some type of advance in knowledge is to be attempted and that a written report summarizing the activity will be prepared at the end of the project. Detailed contracts are almost always impractical because they are unenforceable. Defining contracts is a common labor-management problem, and managers of firms in the private sector have found the most efficient way to deal with labor contacts is to have implicit contracts that create incentives for \"good performance,\" [e.g., rewards by promotion to a position with more responsibility and higher rate of pay (Elliott 1991;Goldin 1990, p. 114-115)]. 3 Such contracts represent an application of Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" to R&D. Application of this principle by public research administrators suggests developing incentive schemes to insure diligence and productivity toward long-term objectives. Given the somewhat unspecified nature of most scientific tasks, public research administrators may enhance research productivity by establishing clear economic incentives for their scientists by defining expectations about the quantity and quality of outputs from the R&D activity but leaving the exact choice and specification of the problems, choice of methods, and timing of work to the scientists (Schultz 1985). This principle goes against the top-down administration of scientists, at least for discoveries in the general and pretechnology sciences. It also suggests that elaborate research priority setting activities are likely to be unproductive because they are both used and misused as instruments of topdown research management. In applied research and technology development, on the other hand, the final product is more clearly defined, so administrators at this level might be more effective in top down management. Heretofore, however, empirical evidence has not shown that one system is definitely better than another. Hypothesis 3. Top-down management of land-grant research and development is no less productive than competitive choice of problems and methods by scientists in response to financial and professional incentives."}, {"section_title": "Administrative Structure", "text": "The administrative structure in the SAES system is quite different from the USDA. Both systems have been in place, although changing, for over 100 years. The USDA's research agencies primarily have one large national research agenda and receive almost all of their research funds from the federal government. In contrast, the SAES system has more than 50 different research plans associated with about 50 separate agricultural experiment stations at land-grant universities (exceptions are the New Haven station and others in the U.S. Territories). Although all SAESs receive significant CSRS-administered funds (so-called regular federal funds), are monitored by CSRS, and frequently cooperate with USDA research agencies, the SAES system is mostly a state-run system with more than 50% of funding from state government appropriations. In contrast to criticisms of Schuh (1986;, Bonnen (1986), Rockefeller Foundation (1982 and others of the SAES system, Schultz (1985, p. 15-17), , and  conclude that the SAES system has been a relatively successful system and the future looks promising. The primary reason for success of the SAES system appears to be its decentralized nature which provides sufficient flexibility and incentives to adapt to local or state needs. Specific reasons are: (1) agricultural technology and agricultural problems are frequently geoclimatic-specific so each state has somewhat unique needs which can be addressed only by scientists working locally Evenson 1992), (2) SAES researchers are close enough to local problems that their research can help to solve local problems, (3) the SAES research is located in almost all cases in the center of a scientific community where advances in science are occurring regularly, and (4) SAES research, training of new scientists, and graduate education are conducted as complementary activities that facilitate inter-field and inter-layer scientific information exchange (Huffman and Evenson 1993, Ch. 3). The SAES in every state, as well as the land-grant university and all other public institutions in a democratic society, are continually facing competing social-political-economic pressures (Weimer and Vining 1992). Some of these pressures come from the federal government, some from local and national clientele groups, and some from their staff. This is not a new phenomena facing state agricultural experiment stations or land-grant universities, which have responded to such pressures over a 100 year tradition (Huffman and Evenson 1993, Ch. 1 and 9). One perspective is that public institutions like the SAES can survive over the long term only by responding along lines suggested by interest group theories of behavior (see Becker 1983;Reid 1977;Evenson and Rose-Ackerman 1985). However, institutions should be structured so social-political-economic markets do not fail due to public good characteristics of scientific knowledge or due to diversion of public resources to private wealth enhancement of public employees and officials. Because political and administrative careers are short relative to the length of time over which research outputs have their impacts, the political process can significantly underinvest in general and pretechnology science relative to applied science and other more immediate goods and services. These considerations also give rise to an interaction between public research funding and the research agenda. These are reasons why federal formula, competitive-grant and earmarked funding; private sector funding; selling new innovations for profit; and including clientele groups directly into agenda setting are burning issues in the SAES system today. Methods and sources of research funds invariably affect the incentives for particular types of work. Also, the environment in which scientists work undoubtedly affects their creativity (Price 1986;Schultz 1985;Berry 1980;Bonnen 1986). 4 Hypothesis 4. The administrative structure does not directly affect productivity of public research and extension. Hypothesis 5. Administrative structure does not affect problem choice and the allocation of research funds."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Evidence", "text": "Before presenting statistical analysis, we first present some variables used to measure structure, management, and funding of SAES research. The empirical evidence is then presented investigating the five hypotheses given above."}, {"section_title": "Data Characterizing SAES Structure, Management, and Funding", "text": "Structure. Management. In doing research, the selection of research problems and projects are key decisions.  conducted a survey of 1,876 SAES and USDA scientists in 1978 regarding research procedures and problem selection. Table 1 transforms their data for individual scientists' responses to influences on choice of research problems into station averages. Two types of indexes are created, one for influence of department chairs and SAES directors and another dealing with more general external versus internal control over research problems. The role of department chairs and experiment station directors in choosing research projects of scientists is reflected in the two far righthand columns of Table 1. Department chairs and directors represent a larger share of total research personnel in smaller stations, and in general, their influence is greater in smaller stations (e.g., CT, NH, WY, OK, NM, NV, MT). Exceptions are Florida, Georgia, and Vermont. Furthermore, department chairs (or heads) were generally rated as having more influence than the SAES director (or director of the institute) (exceptions are HI, ID, IL, RI, and SC). The rating by SAES scientists for degree of influence (7 point scale) by immediate supervisor in their choice of research problem represents the influence of department chairs (SD). The average index for degree of influence by an institute director represents the influence of SAES directors (SAD). An average index of \"external downstream\" influences on scientists' choice of research problems was derived from responses to eight questions (7 point scales). An average index of \"internal influences\" or \"own preferences matter\" in research problem choice was derived from responses to seven related questions. 5 Then, an index of relative external downstream influences on scientists' research problem choice was derived as the ratio of external to internal influences (E/I). This index of relative external downstream influences on research problem choice shows that California, Wisconsin, and several other stations that have a reputation for scholarly research programs have low external downstream influence ratings. That is, the scientists' preferences or assessments matter relatively strongly in research problem choice relative to external downstream influences. In these stations, the administrators are also a smaller share of total research personnel than in small stations which might contribute directly to reduced influences. Stations known for diverse outputs and tendencies toward central control, e.g., Oklahoma, Florida, and most smaller stations, show relatively high external influence on scientists' research problem choices. Many stations, however, have E/I values that are relatively close to the mean; 32 are within one standard deviation. Funding. Agricultural experiment stations differ significantly in the relative importance of alternative funding sources. Table 2 presents information on the share of funds received from (1) all USDA contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements, (2) other federal contract and grant funds, (3) contract and grant funds from private business, commodity groups, and other nongovernmental sources, and (4) state government appropriations. The average share is computed by summing relevant totals for 1970, 1975, and 1980 before dividing. For all states, the largest share of SAES funds comes from state government appropriations. Several SAESs have an average share from state government appropriations that is less than forty percent (e.g., Indiana, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Tennessee). Even before the 1980s, several states had moved heavily into contract and grant funding of SAES research. On average, the share from federal contract and grant funds outside the USDA (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency, National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation) was larger than the share obtained from the USDA. These federal contracts and grants from outside the USDA accounted for more than 12 percent of the SAES funds in Colorado (25%), Rhode Island (22%), Oregon (20%), Wisconsin (18%), New York (15%), Indiana (15%), California (14%), and Tennessee (13%). On the other hand, the states that received the largest share of SAES funds from USDA contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements were Maine (8%), Iowa (7%), Nebraska (7%), Arizona (6%), Colorado (6%), New Mexico (6%), and Utah (6%) (see Table 3)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Evidence", "text": "We now examine the hypothesis that structure, management, and funding sources of public agricultural research affect the productivity of agricultural research as reflected in state level multifactor productivity statistics. Subsequently, we consider whether structure, management, and the federal grant share of funding are exogenous. Testing exogeneity is important for easing concerns about direction of causality. The productivity data and standard explanatory variables are taken from     data represent influences on problem choice during the mid-1970s and no other survey of this type exists for other years, (2) a 10-year period provides a large enough sample size to provide confidence in the empirical results, and (3) the Huffman and Evenson data set does not extend beyond 1982. While many land-grant universities have been re-evaluating their administrative structures, some have been making changes and scientists in institutions change, these measurement errors are likely minor compared to variations among states so that results are not greatly affected. All of the variables used in the analysis are described briefly in Table 4."}, {"section_title": "Productivity.", "text": "Our major interest is in how the structure, management, and funding of agricultural research affects the productivity of agricultural research as agricultural research and other public polices impact multifactor productivity. For this investigation, we modify the Huffman and Evenson (1992;1993) model. In their model, state multifactor productivity is expressed as a three equation model. The three equations are for multifactor productivity in the U.S. crop sector, livestock sector, and aggregate agricultural sector. To provide empirical evidence about the effects of structure, management, and funding of public agricultural research, the variables in Tables 1-3 were added to the Huffman and Evenson model (1992;1993). Selected regression results from fitting the multiple-equation model to state multifactor productivity data for 1973-82 are reported in Table 4. The results show that the productivity of the scientific discovery and technology development processes are affected by the organization of agricultural research. First, other things equal, a larger average share of SAES funds received from federal contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements uniformly reduces agricultural productivity in all sectors. This result is highly significant and implies rejection of Hypothesis 2. Alternatively, the results suggest inefficiencies associated with public contract and grant funding and earmarked funding compared to formula funding. It also may reflect problems associated with redirecting SAES research away from state needs. 6 A larger share of nongovernment contract and grant funds, on the other hand, increases crop sector productivity, but reduces livestock sector and aggregate productivity. One possibility is that nongovernment contracts and grants involve considerably lower transactions costs on scientists' time (e.g., reviewing activities) than federal grants and contracts. Another possibility is that private sector crop research and some forms of SAES testing of crop varieties and pesticides are highly complementary activities. Thus, private funding of SAES crop research may raise local agricultural productivity because of geoclimatic specificity of crop technology. Similar localized benefits and complementarities with private research are apparently much less important for livestock production. Second, the results in Table 4 suggest that traditional administrative structures which do not separate agricultural research, extension, and teaching in some way are more effective for enhancing local agricultural productivity. However, the results are not statistically significant except marginally for livestock. Thus, Hypothesis 4 is not rejected. The coefficient of DB2 (1 for nontraditional type) is far from significantly different from zero in the crop sector and aggregate productivity equations. Thus, this evidence does not suggest that the administrative type is a major research efficiency factor, except possibly in the livestock sector. 7 This paper argues that scientific discovery is an abstract, human capital intensive, creative process that is difficult to routinize and most likely thrives in a decentralized but supportive environment with economic incentives that promote diligence, cooperation, and creativity. While the results show that the administrative structure does not matter greatly, different channels of influence on scientists' choice of research problems are important. Apparently, alternative administrative structures can be both used effectively and misused. The results show that greater administrative influence on choice of scientists' research problems raises the productivity of public applied research but reduces the productivity of public pretechnology science research. These conclusions are based on the signs of the coefficients of the interaction terms for In (SD x SAD) with In APP and In SC. The direction of the effect is the same in all three productivity equations. Thus, moving from applied to pretechnology and general scientific research, the comparative advantage of administrators for \"directing\" problem choice appears to decrease. These results are all highly significant in the sector specific results. Thus, Hypothesis 3 is firmly rejected with respect to pretechnology science but is not rejected with respect to applied research. The second type of influence on problem choice is the index of relative downstream influence (E/I). Roughly, scientists can be viewed as choosing projects because of downstream influences such as issues raised by clientele and feedback from extension personnel, or because they are important in their own assessment (to their own professional career or to the development of innovations). The results suggest that greater relative external influence on scientists' research problems reduces the productivity of public applied research but increases the productivity of public pretechnology science research. These results suggest that applied scientists tend to be sufficiently familiar with needs in the field to choose where their productivity is greatest on the basis of scientific discoveries available in pretechnology sciences in absence of interest group pressures. However, for research of the pretechnology type, the results suggests that research is more productive when scientists have a \"sense of importance\" that can be obtained from considering external downstream influences. Scientists doing pretechnology research can in principle undertake any of a huge range of scientific investigations, but many of them will not lead to discoveries that are useful for enhancing local agricultural productivity. Recall that the E/I index is much more comprehensive and subtle than the direct measures of administrative influence SD and SAD. Taken together, the result that greater external influence reduces applied research productivity but increases pretechnology research productivity implies that overall research productivity is enhanced by greater vertical integration of the sciences. 8 Furthermore, these results are all significant beyond the 1 percent level and thus lead to rejection of Hypothesis 1 that vertical integration is unimportant. These results offer empirical support for the land-grant philosophy that productivity follows from communication among general pretechnology sciences, applied sciences, and application activities in the field. The importance of integration of the land-grant activities is further suggested by the interaction terms, In APP x In SC and In APP x In EXTG. The coefficients of these terms imply that applied and pretechnology sciences are significantly complementary for crop research and that applied research and extension activities are highly complementary for livestock research. The lack of complementarity among applied research and extension for crops may suggest that much of the benefits of new technology for crops are embodied in inputs and accompanying information provided by private marketers. Conversely, the lack of complementarity between pretechnology and applied sciences for livestock may be due to the fact that most advances in livestock productivity over the past two decades have not had strong roots in pretechnology sciences and (perhaps as a consequence) productivity growth for livestock has been comparatively weak ). 9 Exogeneity. To investigate the validity of the results in Table 4, exogeneity tests were performed on the variables representing structure, management, and funding. As is well known, endogeneity can cause simultaneous equations bias in coefficient estimation. Thus, we consider the possibility that structure, management, and funding are jointly determined with (or caused by) productivity First, we examine the index of relative external downstream influences on scientists' research problem choices (E/I). Geoclimatic conditions and distance from central markets have a major impact on the geographical location of agricultural production (USDA 1957;). Thus, variables representing the share of each state's land area included in 16 major geoclimatic regions might be an important determinant of the management of agricultural research. These variables capture much of the effects of geoclimatic conditions and distance to markets. Also, the SAES administrative structure (DB2) might impact research problem choices. Column (1), Table 6, presents some econometric evidence on the determinants of E/I. These results show that administrative structure, as represented by a dummy variable DB2 for nontraditional land-grant administrative type, does not affect E/I. Furthermore, we find only weak evidence that geoclimatic variables impact E/I. In particular, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients of DB2 and all the geoclimatic region variables are jointly equal to zero. Under the null hypothesis, the sample F-value is 1.79, but the critical F-value is 2.03 at the 5 percent significance level. Thus, we conclude that the index of relative external influences on scientists' problem choices (E/I) is relatively exogenous. 10 A related issue is whether the land-grant administrative structure (DB2) is affected by scientists' research orientation (as represented in E/I) and geoclimatic variables. If the E/I index is really exogenous, then scientists might change the administrative structure to a form that is most productive for them. In Table 5, column 2, evidence is presented on this issue. Although the estimated coefficient of E/I is positive, suggesting that relatively strong external influences increase the likelihood of nontraditional administrative structure, the coefficient is not significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level. Furthermore, the geoclimatic region variables do not have much power for explaining DB2. In particular, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients of E/I and all of the geoclimatic region variables are jointly equal to zero. The sample value of the F statistic is 0.67, but the critical value of the F statistic is 2.03 at the 5 percent significance level. Thus, we conclude that structure, as represented by DB2, is relatively exogenous. Currently, the share of SAES funds that comes from federal grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements (SHFD), or so-called federal nonformula funds, are receiving attention as the National Research Council exerts pressure on Congress and Office of Management and Budget against formula funding of agricultural research (National Research Council 1989). In the previous section, we showed that SHFD contains relatively large variation across the states and over time. What might be some of the reasons? In the past, SAES directors and department chairs have frequently expressed negative opinions about these research funds because they feel some loss of local control over the direction of research or that state funds for agricultural research are diverted to research of little local value (i.e., little local geoclimatic specificity) as a result of taking federal nonformula research funds (see discussion in ). Also, it seems likely that geoclimatic and locational factors are important in competing for these funds. Thus, we examine the relationship between SHFD and the index of influence of departmental chairs (SD), SAES directors (SAD), and relative external influences on scientists' research problem choices (E/I) and the geoclimatic region variables. These results are reported in Table 5, column 3. The results show that larger relative external downstream influences or stronger influence by department chairs or directors on scientists' problem choices is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the average share of federal grant, contract, and cooperative agreement funds for SAES research. One can interpret these results as suggesting that external downstream and local administrative influences are biased against nonformula federal research funds. Also, many of the geoclimatic region variables are individually significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level and are highly positive for regions 8 and 15 and highly negative for regions 11 and 14.11 The hypothesis that the regression equation for SHFD has no explanatory power is rejected. The sample value of the F statistic under the null hypothesis is 34.1 whereas the critical value of the F statistic is 1.67 at the 5 percent level. Thus, evidence suggests that SHFD is not totally exogenous. Accordingly, caution is suggested for interpretation of the SHFD coefficient in the multifactor productivity analysis of Table 4. While the results of Table 4 do not suggest a strong productivity effect of administrative structure, the final results of Table 5 suggest that administrative structure affects the allocation of funds. In the fourth column of Table 5, the share of the stock of public applied crop and livestock research in the total stock of public agricultural research is regressed on E/I, SD, SAD, DB2, SHFD, SHPR, and 15 geoclimatic region variables. The most interesting result is that the share of applied research is reduced when extension is administered separately from agricultural teaching and research functions (DB2 has a negative effect with t-ratio 6.8). This result lends credibility to the argument that a combined land-grant administrative structure promotes integration of research and extension and helps to keep research activities relevant."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "During the 1990s, U.S. public agricultural research, extension, and higher education have been hit again with economic hard times. Land-grant administrators are looking for new sources of funds and prioritizing research which leads to tighter control over research projects undertaken. As the extension and research problems of agriculture and rural areas have expanded beyond traditional agricultural interests, the administrative structure in land-grant universities has been modified in many states. The administration of extension in a number of states has moved to a university official above the dean of agriculture. Similar changes in administration of experiment stations have occurred in some states as directors have struggled to gain access to biotechnology expertise in other colleges. As a result, simple traditional administrative lines have been modified in a way that most likely weakens the incentives for cooperation across traditional teaching, research and extension activities. Our work suggests some economic and political consequences of changing the structure, management, and funding of agricultural research in land-grant universities. Tighter control over research problem choice may enhance applied research productivity but significantly reduces productivity from pretechnology science research. While modifications of general administrative structures within the land-grant universities do not appear to have major direct impacts on the overall productivity of agricultural research and extension, administrative separation of land-grant activities can cause research efforts to be directed away from applied work. The current trend toward competitive grant and earmarked funding, as opposed to formula funding from federal sources, apparently reduces productivity of research expenditures and/or shifts the focus of scientific inquiries and technology developments away from innovations that raise local agricultural productivity. In the long term, this type of change in focus can be expected to erode local political support for SAES research. It might, however, increase politcal support for national funding of agricultural research. The results of this paper emphasize the importance of maintaining a vertically integrated agricultural science establishment. In the short run, pretechnology sciences and applied sciences may be somewhat independent, but in the long term progress can only occur when vertical linkages exist and function well. Pretechnology scientists are more productive when they are aware of practical needs, and applied scientists are more productive when they are informed and literate in the parent sciences. Historically, the applied sciences in agriculture have tended to become disconnected from the parent sciences due to increasing sophistication. As a result, agricultural faculties of land-grant universities have been poorly prepared to assimilate new scientific developments, for example, in biotechnology. The results of this paper also emphasize the importance of scientist directed research at least in the pretechnology sciences. Prediction of advances in most areas of science and technology is difficult. This means that micro-management of R&D is most likely an unproductive activity, and research management approaches that follow a research priority setting methodology are likely to fail because they ignore the realities of the scientific discovery process. Although the production of scientific discoveries is uncertain, it is unreasonable to assume an equally likely probability of a discovery in all areas. Working scientists are most likely the best judge of their own ability to make a breakthrough. Research administrators, recognizing these realities, can effectively \"direct\" the use of research funds by setting appropriate incentives for useful outputs and the \"riskiness\" of the research enterprise. Previous work has not examined quantitatively the implications of alternative land-grant funding mechanisms, management, and administrative structures. The work reported in this paper represents only a beginning to this area of inquiry that contains many unanswered questions. However, the results suggest that several current directions may be counter-productive and deserve further examination. For example, Bonnen (1986) and Schuh (1986) have charged that incentives in land-grant universities have been far too skewed in favor of refereed journal articles.

Introduction", "text": "The Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) and the application of utility patents (UPs) to plants are currently the topic of considerable controversy among plant breeders, business people, environmentalists and others. The primary goal of the seed industry is eliminate \"farmers rights\" to sell protected varieties. Seed firms feel they are losing money because seed firms posing as farmers are selling protected varieties without permission from or royalties to the owner. A second goal of the seed industry is to strengthen the rights of variety owners by disallowing certificates for varieties that have only minor changes. This goal is embodied in the clause on \"essentially derived\" varieties in the 1991 UPOV treaty. Public sector scientists and some private firms are concerned that the application of utility patents to plants will have a negative impact on the exchange of information and germplasm between scientists within the U.S. and world wide. In order to decide whether the U.S. should strengthen or weaken current intellectual property rights on plants, policy makers need information on the impact of IPRs on public and private research. This paper attempts to measure the impact of recent changes in IPRs on the amount and direction of U.S. private R&D."}, {"section_title": "II. Model of R&D by Private Firms", "text": "To place IPRs in their proper perspective it is important to remember that they are only one factor a firm considers when investing in a research program. In fact, the primary factors in many early models of R&D, which were based on the work of Schumpeter, were firm size and market power. In these models the larger the firm the more research it conducts both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales or other measures of firm size. Many of the early empirical studies in this literature found an inverted U shaped relationship between R&D and firm size, with small and large firms spending less R&D per sales than the medium size firms. The role of demand in influencing investment in R&D was emphasized by Schmookler (1966) in several important studies in the 1960s. He tried to show that the growth in demand in an industry stimulated R&D with a certain time lag. More recent studies have incorporated Schmookler's ideas on the role of demand and have divided the Schumpeterian emphasis on industry structure into two factors: appropriability and technological opportunity. Thus, the three main factors influencing a private firm's investment in research to develop new products are: (1) the expected demand for the products; (2) the technological opportunity for developing new products through research and (3) the ability of the firm to appropriate some of the benefits which users of the new products receive (see Griliches 1984). The demand for new varieties of crops is a derived demand based on the expected demand for the crop and the productivity of the new variety. The quantity demanded is also influenced by farmers' ability to reproduce seed of the crop. Some crops like alfalfa are virtually impossible for farmers in many regions to produce themselves while other seeds such as wheat and rice are easy to reproduce and store. The technological opportunity for firms to develop new varieties depends on the costs of the research inputs, the skill and level of technology used by their plant breeders, and the germplasm and information available from public research, from other private research and abroad. The major change in technological opportunity in recent years is the application of molecular biology to plant breeding. This has increased the productivity of conventional plant breeding and led to the production of transgenic plants with genes from other species and even from bacteria and animals. Technological opportunity can also be changed by changes in the spillovers of information from other firms and the public sector due to changes in intellectual property rights. The more easily germplasm and information are available from other firms and government research programs, the more research a firm will do ceteris paribus. Appropriability is a function of the firm's ability to keep other seed companies and farmers from duplicating or making close substitutes for their variety. It is thus a function of the technical characteristic of the variety, the structure of the seed industry, and intellectual property rights. Firms have greater appropriability in crops in which hybrid varieties are used 2 . Firms can, with careful management, keep the parental lines of hybrids secret, and farmers and other seed companies can not produce hybrid seed by simply multiplying hybrid material purchased from the owners of the hybrid. Without intellectual property rights firms have little appropriability of new pure line varieties 3 . Farmers and seed companies can easily reproduce such new varieties. Intellectual property rights provide firms the right to exclude other firms and farmers from reproducing the varieties which they develop. This gives the firm a temporary monopoly on the sale of the protected variety which allows the firm to charge higher prices for seeds of the variety than if other firms are also selling the variety. In this way the firms profit from the research they used to produce the new variety. The concept of patents contains a built in contradiction. Spillovers stimulate research because they increase the productivity of each firm's researchin other words they increase technological opportunity. However, more spillover means less appropriability and this may discourage research. This is precisely the debate that is going on between scientists over whether plants should be patentable under the utility patent law. Those who oppose it fear that the spillovers allowed under PVPA will be eliminated since there is no explicit research exemption in utility patent law. Economic theory provides little help. Thus, empirical research is necessary to determine the impact."}, {"section_title": "III. IPR Laws Covering Plants", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A Legislation", "text": "The Plant Patent Act (PPA) when passed in 1930 was the first legislation to provide intellectual property rights in plants. It covered new and distinct asexually propagated varieties excluding tuber-propagated plants such as potatoes. Application forms are straight forward and can be filled out by breeders. More than 80 percent of the applications are approved. Table 1 presents a summary of the coverage and characteristics of different types of IPRs. The U.S. Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA), which was passed in 1970, provides owners with the exclusive rights for 18 years to novel, sexually propagated varieties and inbred lines of hybrids. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers PVPA, checks applications against the descriptions of varieties in its data bank. If the variety is assessed to be different, a certificate is issued. PVPA has two explicit exemptions from protection. First, farmers can reproduce seed for themselves and sell seed as long as seed sales are less than 50 percent of total production of that variety on their farm. Second, the owners of a variety can not prevent researchers from other companies or public agencies from using that variety to produce a new variety. Like Plant Patents PVPA application forms are straight forward and can be filled in by breeders. About 90 percent of PVPA applications are approved. Plant varieties, engineered genes, and hybrid varieties have been subject to utility patents since the Ex parte Hibberd ruling by the Patent and Trademark Office's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in 1985. UPs provides exclusive rights for 17 years for inventions that are novel, nonobvious to others in the field and useful. Protection can be much broader than under PVPC or Plant Patents. It can include a group of varieties that all have the patented characteristics while only individual varieties could be patented under PVPA. No explicit research or farmers exemptions exist in UPs. Farmers can not sell seed and theoretically farmers must pay royalties to the holder of the UP if they plant the variety as second year using their own saved seed. Scientists who use a patented variety to produce another commercial variety could either be prevented from selling the second variety or would have to pay a royalty to the owner of the first variety. Patents are unlike Plant Patents and PVPA in several key aspects. They require enabling disclosure of the inventions so that other can use the knowledge to make other inventions. The U.S. Patent Office requires a deposit of seed, if a variety is being patented and this seed must be made available to others for research use. Patent applications are different in that they usually require lawyers to fill out the forms which increases the cost of applying considerably. Of the applications which include claims on plants 22 percent have been granted. In addition it takes several years to grant patents while only a few months are required for PPs and PVPCs. There is no explicit research exemption in UP law. However, the courts recognize the right of legitimate research who are not attempting to produce a commercial product with their research to use patented products in research. In addition since a patent case takes about four years and costs about $1 million a year few companies will take researchers to court unless they think the researchers will seriously cut into their market. Trade secrets are the fourth type of IPR that are used to protect plants. Trade secrets are governed by state laws, but they go back to the English common law tradition. They provide protection for an invention as long as the secret is not disclosed in a nonconfidential manner. They have primarily been used to protect Fl hybrids in which the inbreds lines are kept secret. "}, {"section_title": "B. Case Law", "text": "Case law and rulings by the patent system have evolved to help define the protection offered to plant breeders. To enforce the U.S. PVPA firms must identify violators and bring them to court to seek injunctions against further infringement, royalties and punitive fines. Adherence to the law has varied over time. When the law was passed, firms ran a publicity campaign to educate farmers and other firms about the provision of the law. In most cases when companies discovered violations, they just needed to write the farmers or cooperatives informing them about the provisions of law and the violations stopped. Adherence to the law weakened gradually. Specific cases defined farmers rights more broadly than most companies wished. For example, Asgrow vs. Kunkle 1987 found that even very large sales by farmers were legal as long as the farmer sold less than 50% of his crop as seed for reproductive purposes. The weakness of the law were emphasized recently by Pioneer Hi-Bred's well publicized closure of its hard red winter and hard red spring wheat program (Newlin). In contrast to the self pollinated crops, property rights for corn and other hybrids and potatoes were strengthened during the 1980s. Firms speculated that the plants could be covered by Utility Patents immediately after the Chakravarty case in 1980. A number of firms sent applications to the patent office in the early 1980s. The ex Parte Hibbard ruling officially gave firms the ability to patent plants for the first time in 1985. At the same time the use of trade secrets to protect inbreds to be used to produce hybrid corn was validated in the courts for the first time in the 1987. (Pioneer Hi-bred Int'l v. Holden Foundation Seeds, Inc. No. 81-60-E, slip op. (S.D. Iowa, Oct.29, 1987))."}, {"section_title": "C. Proposed Changes", "text": "The top priority of the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA) is to eliminate the current farmers' exemption in PVPA. ASTA members are not opposed to farmers saving their own seed, but they do oppose the farmer's right to sell seed. The other change currently under consideration is to amend PVPA so that it conforms with the 1991 UPOV Convention. Varieties that are \"essentially derived\" from a protected variety would also be owned by the breeder of the protected variety. Depending on how essentially derived is defined, acceptance of this provision could reduce the scope of the research exemption and increase appropriability considerably. A series of committees within ASTA is working to develop an acceptable definition of \"essential derived.\" The most likely changes in U.S. utility patent legislation are changes that would bring the U.S. in line with the rest of the world. Specifically, the rule on priority of patent claims might change from \"first to invent\" to \"first to file\" which is the rule in most of the rest of the world. This would reduce patent litigation in the U.S. because much litigation centers on who and when a new product or process was invented. At a recent meeting in Washington 4 some public sector scientists have suggested that plants should not be subject to patents or that there should be a research exemption in the utility patents for plants. However, little support was expressed for this position by representatives of the private sector. Those who supported this position seem to have been in the minority."}, {"section_title": "IV. Previous Evidence of Impact of IPRs", "text": "Two surveys of seed companies were conducted in the early"}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "Meeting on \"Intellectual Property Rights: Protection of Plant Material\" was sponsored by the Crop Science Society of America, the American Society of Horticultural Science, and American Society of Agronomy and the Soil Science Society of America. 26-28 January 1993 to answer the question of the impact of PVPA (Perrin et.al.1983 &Butler andMarion 1985). Figure 1 shows R&D expenditure divided by the value of the crop which holds demand constant in order to show the impact of appropriability. As expected, the ratios of self pollinated crops like wheat and soybeans increased about the time PVPA was passed. In addition crops in which hybrid seeds are widely used such as maize and sorghum have higher research: value ratios than self pollinated crops. This is due to property rights in the form of trade secrets and greater demand for the seed of these crops because hybrids can not be reproduced by farmers. Both Perrin et al and Butler and Marion conclude that PVPA had a positive effect on private plant breeding for small grains and soybeans, but were puzzled why small grains breeding increased before the PVPA was passed 1970. Recent research indicates that the increase in small grains research documented in Figure 1 was only partially due to PVPA. Most of the research on small grains was on wheat. The history of hybrid wheat by Knudson (1990) indicates that most wheat breeding in the 1960s and 1970s was undertaken with the expectation that hybrid wheat would be successful. As firms gave up on hybrid wheat they tried to market improved wheat varieties protected by PVPA. When they could not make profits on varieties most firms stopped breeding hard red wheat entirely. Thus, the increase in cereals R&D was largely due to the expectation of increased appropriability due to hybrids rather than PVPA. There have been no empirical studies of the impact of utility patents on plant breeding. In 1987 OTA surveyed 39 seed firms, biotechnology firms, universities and USDA about their views on the different types of IPRs. On the basis of this survey OTA concluded that utility patents were important in stimulating biotechnology firms to do research on plants (OTA 1989:85) "}, {"section_title": "V. Empirical Evidence on Impact of IPRs", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Survey of Private Research", "text": "To measure the impact of IPRs on private research since 1980 we conducted a survey similar to the one conducted by Perrin et al (1983). The first part of the survey requested R&D expenditures and sales by crop. The second part asked about the impact of PVPA and utility patents on profits, R&D, spillovers from public to private research and spillovers between private firms. The survey was sent to 564 companies who were active members of the American Seed Trade Association as of March 1, 1991. An additional 90 surveys were sent out to non-ASTA members. In total 654 firms were sent questionnaires and 237 responded. 121 stated that they did not have plant breeding programs. 90 of the responses were from firms with plant breeding programs who completed the entire questionnaire. 5 firms with breeding programs chose not to provide sales and R&D data, but completed the second part of the survey. 4 of the surveys were returned with a note that the firm had undergone a merger or acquisition and 17 of the surveys were classified as undeliverable. In 1990 the 84 participating firms reported seed sales of approximately $ 1.8 billion and R&D of $137 million (Table 2). R&D as a percentage of sales (research intensity) was around 8 per cent. This is larger than the 59 firms that replied to the Perrin et al. survey. It is less than the 157 firms that replied to a short questionnaire sent out by three private sector scientists (Kalton, Richardson and Frey 1989. That survey asked only about number of scientists, broad classes of R&D expenditure and no information on sales. Kalton et al do make a rough estimate of total R&D expenditure in 1989 of $272 million. If Kalton et al are correct, our study includes about half of the private seed research conducted in the U.S. The share of R&D of different crops is similar to Kalton except for wheat and other cereals which appear to be underrepresented in out survey. The information on PVPCs (below Table 4) suggests this sample underestimates wheat and soybeans. "}, {"section_title": "B.

Figure 2 shows the PVPCs of the four most important field crops which are held by the private sector. One of the most significant changes between the 1970s and the 1980s is increase in certificates for corn varieties. Table 5 shows the distribution of the utility patents issued in 1985 through 1988. In contrast to PVPCs the most utility patents were issued for two crops in which the commercial seed is primarily Fl hybridscorn and sunflowers.  1931-19621963-196819691974-1978(Washington, DC: American Association of Nurserymen, 19631969;1974;1981).

Most firms in our sample believed it was in their interest to use PVPA. 51 firms held at least one PVPC. Only 11 firms held a utility patent on a plant or plant part. To find out more about firms' perception of PVPA and UPs, the survey included questions about the impact of intellectual property rights on R&D, profitability and on spillover. Firms perception of the impact of PVPA and UPs is shown in Table 6. Firms were asked to rate the impact of PVPA and UPs on types of spillovers and on profits from plant breeding on a scale from -3 to 3. The table below reports both the mean score and the number of firms that rate the impact as positive, negative or none. PVPA appears to have increased the flows of information and perhaps germplasm from government R&D and from other private firms. Of the firms that thought PVPA did have an impact 25 "}, {"section_title": "Soybean, Cotton & Corn", "text": "thought the impact on information from the government was positive and only 9 thought it was negative. Regarding information from other firms, 34 thought PVPA had a positive impact compared to 17 that thought the impact was negative. Firms were about evenly divided about the impact on germplasm movement. In contrast, utility patents may have decreased the spillover of germplasm while they were neutral on information exchange. 30 firms (38%) felt that the effect of utility patents on exchange with the public sector was negative, 14 thought it was positive, and 36 felt there was no impact. This finding is quite worrying, although as the public sector becomes more familiar with patents this may become less of a problem. Regarding spillovers within the private sector, 28 firms (35%) felt that UPs limited germplasm exchange between private companies, 17 felt this effect to be positive, and 35 reported that there was no impact. If IPR's positive impact on a firms' ability to appropriate the gains from research outweighed the negative impact of reduced spillovers, firms profits from R&D should increase and R&D should increase. 67 firms reported that the PVPA increased their ability to profit from breeding new varieties, while 24 reported that it had no impact and only one reported a perceived negative impact on profitability. Firms were less sure about the impacts of utility patents -43 said utility patents increased profitability, while 8 reported a negative impact. Since there is data to analyze the impact of PVPA on breeding but it may be too early to estimate the impact of the Hibberd ruling of 1985 which permitted UPs on plants, the survey asked firms about the impact of UPs on research. Firms reported that the extension of utility patent protection to plants had little effect on breeding efforts. Only 6 reported that the availability of utility patent protection increased their research expenditures and one more commented that they had increased research before 1985 in anticipation of the ruling. Eight firms reported a decrease in R&D, with 76 firms reporting no change total expenditures. In addition 14 firms reported that research priorities changed after 1985 due to the availability of UPs.

Intellectual property rights for hybrids increasing during the 1980s due to ex parte Hibbard and the court ruling on trade secrets. Property rights in some self pollinated crops such as wheat and cotton in some areas were declining because of the ease with which farmers could reproduce seed and court rulings that specified the extent of the farmers right to sell seed. Thus, R&D and R&D/sales should be increasing in hybrids and declining in some self pollinated crops. Different types of seed firms may have quite different research expenditure patterns due to different levels of appropriability that they face. Table 7 shows the different levels of R&D and R&D/sales for several different types of seed firms. These differences could be due to the structure of the industryvegetable varieties may be easier to control because there are a small number of seed companies and a small number of growers (Foster and Perrin 1990). Their research expenditure may also be different at different stages in the life cycle of the firms. When the firm is just starting up, it will invest money in research but have little or no sales. Finally, certain types of firms are primarily research firms. Foundation seed companies will have very high research intensity because they have low seeds sales and some of their research is essentially contract research for other firms."}, {"section_title": "Changes in Technological Opportunity and Demand", "text": "In addition to the changes in intellectual property rights the other major variable that changed since 1980 was technology opportunity due to advances in molecular biology. Many firms and government institutions have applied biotechnology techniques such tissue culture and genetic mapping to plant breeding in the mid 1980s. Using these techniques they are improving the efficiency of plant breeding and producing varieties resistant to pests and herbicides. The public and private sectors are also working on transgenic plants some 300+ of which are in field trials. So far no transgenic crop varieties are available commercially. The extent of biotechnologies impact on private plant breeding is indicated by the 1989 study by Kalton et al. They found 252 PhDs working on biotechnology related to plant breeding compared to 580 PhDs working on conventional breeding. The pattern of biotechnology research by seed firms is shown in Table 8. Corn biotechnology attracted three times the research resources of any other individual crops and twice as much resources as all vegetables together. This pattern reflects the size of the market for various types of seed and firms' perception of intellectual property as well as differences in technological opportunity between crops. The other factor that our model suggests would influence R&D is demand for seed. Firms should do more research in crops which have rising seed prices and quantity demanded is rising. Table 9 shows the value of seeds planted and Figure 3 the trends in seed prices and quantity demanded of the major crops. Corn was by far the most important crop in terms of value of sales and it also led in growth of value between 1974 and the present. Figure 3 shows that the value of seeds sold of corn, sorghum and soybeans grew rapidly between 1974 and 1985 and then declined or levelled off. The value of cotton seed sale grew until 1981 and then declined. Wheat is only one of these crops that declined in the 1970s and 1980s and ended with its value in nominal dollars in 1990 lower than in 1974.  6 Firms that specialize in field crops and had seed sales greater than $50 million a year in 1990. 7 Firms that specialize in field crops and had seed sales less than $50 million a year in 1990. 8 Firms that specialize in the production of foundation seed. 9 Firms that were established or entered the seed business after 1980. 1 0 Firms that specialized in the production of the following groups of crops. A few start-up companies are included in these categories. "}, {"section_title": "Trends in R&D", "text": "During the 1980s one would expect corn R&D to grow the most rapidly of the five main crops because IPRs of corn and sorghum were strengthen the most, the value of seed grew the most and the most biotechnology R&D was conducted on corn. Wheat should do the worst in the 1980s because IPRs were weakened, hybrid wheat turned out to be commercially impractical, and the value of wheat seed purchased by farmers declined. R&D by the other three crops should be somewhere in between possibly led by sorghum, then soybeans and cotton. Table 10 shows that hybrid corn accounted for the largest share of total R&D in 1990, followed by the class of vegetable crops, soybeans, forage crops, hybrid sorghum and wheat. Hybrid corn was also the individual crop for which firms held the most Plant Variety Protection Certificates (PVPCs) and was again followed by soybeans. Firms held 252 certificates for vegetables, which is nearly equal to the total for the major grain crops. Thus, PVPCs were primarily used to protect innovations in corn, vegetables, and soybeans. Two-thirds of the utility patents were used to protect corn varieties or characteristics. The rest were scattered among a number of crops. Seed research in total has grown rapidly since 1979 or 1980 (Table 10). Perrin's estimate of $54 million (1982 $s) for 1979 R&D is probably closer to the industry total than our estimate of $35 million (1982 $s) for 1980.11 Using either estimate real research expenditure in some crops grew very rapidly. Corn research grew rapidly as expected -at least doubling in real terms. Cereals which includes wheat declined as expected. 11. Firms that went out of business between 1980 and 1990 would not have been included in our sample. 1980 research by firms that merged may also not have been reported by the new firm.

R&D on vegetable grew by 326 percent."}, {"section_title": "Figure 3 Indices of Seed Sales", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "B.2. Regression analysis", "text": "Regression analysis was used to try to sort out the relative influence of these different factors on private R&D. Two dependent variables were used. First, R&D by firm was regressed on demand, IPR variables, spillover variables and characteristics of the firms. Second, R&D by crop and firm was regressed on the public R&D by crop, IPR variables and industry demand variables. The results are shown in Table 11. None of the industry demand variables, such as growth in value of sales of seeds by crop in the previous five years, were significant. Public sector plant breeding R&D by crop of five major crops from 1972 to 1988 from USDA CRIS was also insignificant in all specifications. The sales variables is consistently positive and sales squared is negative in different specifications and with both the firm and crop R&D as dependent variables. This indicates the inverted U type relationship between research intensity and size of firm found in the early empirical tests of the Schumpeterian theory. Hybrids are positive and significant at the ten percent level in the crop R&D equations. When hybrids are used as a dummy variable in the firm R&D equations, they are negative but insignificant. In the firm R&D analysis specification 3 they are positive and significant in interaction with sales. The positive sign on the interaction term seems plausible because larger firms make more money from hybrids because they have the legal departments or the resources to hire the lawyers needed to enforce trade secrets and apply for and enforce utility patents. Various dummies were used to try to capture the impact of utility patents with mixed results. In both data sets the dummy for 1985 and 1990 was positive and significant at the 5 or 10 percent level which provides some support for the hypothesis that utility patents increased R&D. The impact of utility patents was also estimated by the using the firms' responses on the questionnaire on whether they though UPs increased their profits from plant breeding. The firms that thought UPs increased profits had higher levels of R&D than other firms using both firm and crop R&D. In the third specification in Table 11 the time dummies were 1 for 1980 and 1 for 1985. Thus, they were expected to have a negative effect if firms were gradually convinced of the increased importance of utility patents. In interaction with sales they do have a negative and significant impact on R&D which implies that the slope of the sales variable is higher in the later years after utility patents became an accepted tool for increasing appropriability. The dummies for some types of firms shown in Table 7 were significant. Foundation seed firms and the large integrated firms had to largest increases in R&D over grass seed firms which were represented by 0. They were significant at the 5 percent level as were the other industry dummies except flower seed. The regression indicates that some of variables used to represent utility patents and firms perceptions of utility patents did have a positive impact on R&D. Firm size has a positive impact and certain types of firmsfoundation seed firms and large integrated firmsalso had a positive impact. However, several other variables which we believe affect R&Dpublic R&D and growth in demanddid not have significant impacts probably due to the fact that they were crop level variables rather than firm level variables."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The data on private research suggests that private firms and were induced to conduct more research on the crops in which intellectual property rights were strengthened most. PVPA did not, however, cause as much increase in R&D as earlier studies suggested because they had neglected to correct for the firms' mistaken belief that hybrid wheat would be profitable. Firms did not find that germplasm exchange or information was reduced by PVPA. About 38% of the firms surveyed felt UPs hampered their exchange of germplasm with the public sector and 35% said it reduced the exchange of germplasm between firms. This problem may decline as firms and universities get more experience with UPs, but at the moment there does appear to be a decline in information and germplasm exchange. However, over half of the firms indicated that UPs would increase the profitability of plant breeding while less than 10 percent thought the impact would be negative. This suggests that overall the firms felt utility patents were a good thing. The trends in R&D expenditure by crop were generally consistent with trends in IPRs, demand and technological opportunity. Corn research grew rapidly as expectedat least doubling in real terms. Cereals which includes wheat declined as expected. Soybean research between 1979 and 1990 grew 228 percent, which was more than corn and more than expected. Sorghum did not grow. The regression analysis suggests that UPs did stimulate research by seed firms as well as by new biotechnology firms. Those firms that stated UPs had increased profits from breeding did do more R&D than those who thought it was neutral. Other dummies such as time and hybrid dummies also indicate the stronger property rights lead to more R&D. In conclusion, it appears that stronger intellectual property rights in the form of utility patents and trade secrets have increased the amount of R&D in the U.S. despite the concerns about declining spillovers. In addition firms confirmed the findings of earlier studies that PVPA did have a positive impact on profits from R&D on plant breeding. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the strengthening property rights further through measures such as eliminating farmers rights to sell seed and adopting UPOVs convention on essentially derived varieties would increase R&D.

If the goal is to distinguish between those changes in output due to technical changes arising from research (or any other productivity-enhancing factor) and those arising as a consequence of changes in the mix of inputs and outputs due to shifts in their relative prices, then a more general concept of productivity is required. Aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) can be defined as where TFP expresses an output aggregate, Q, produced per unit of an input aggregate, X, for a given state of technology. Obviously some suitable means of aggregating across different types of outputs and inputs is required when calculating a TFP no matter how small the unit of production under analysis. Unfortunately we encounter the inevitable index number problems. Changing relative prices will cause optimizing producers to alter their mix of inputs and outputs and, unless steps are taken to mitigate these effects, such responses to prices can result in a change in measured TFP even in the absence of technical change. The method commonly used to minimize the impact of relative price changes when forming aggregate quantity indices is to use a Divisia indexing procedure. As Richter (1966) and Hulten (1973) describe, the Divisia index is desirable because of its invariance property; if nothing real has changed (e.g., the only input quantity changes involve movements around an unchanged isoquant) the index itself is unchanged. The formula for an index of aggregate inputs where XIb is the index value of the base period, b. If the economy of interest-measured at either the sector, industry or even farm level-is moving along an unchanged transformation surface, the changes in inputs, AX, weighted by current factor prices, W, will be approximately zero; the index will be unchanged. If the economy's transformation surface is shifting, current price-weighted changes will be different from zero leading to changes in the index value. This invariance property is, one should note, dependent upon a maintained assumption of optimizing agents. Unfortunately, the calculation of a Divisia index requires continuous measurement of input prices and quantities. In any discrete approximation, some information is lost, but the advantage of using a chained index always reduces to the notion that recent quantity changes are weighted by the most recently observed prices. Intuitively, these indices are attempting to evaluate current behavior in the light of current prices. In proceeding from the base period to some distant period t, the small steps are chained together, to minimize the measurement error that is possible when only base-period prices, and period t prices, are used to evaluate real input quantity changes. There are, of course, many possible discrete approximations to the Divisia index. We have chosen to use the Trnqvist-Theil approximation that uses both current and lagged cost shares in weighting quantity changes yielding where wit sit, .1 (3) m x.

To minimize the possibility of confounding substitution effects with real changes in aggregate output and aggregate input we collected the output and input variables to a much higher degree of disaggregation than is found in previous studies. In this regard we gave particular emphasis to finding state-level prices for both outputs and inputs since the economic rationale for using Divisia price indices is based on the idea that input and output mixes change in response to changes in the relative prices actually faced by producers. 2 A special effort was made in the construction of the labor, capital, and land variables to account for the substantial but spatially uneven changes in these primary inputs since 1949. To avoid biased indices, we avoided using any preaggregated measures of either output or input if an alternative was available. 3 The aggregate output measure reported here is a T6rnqvist-Theil Divisia index that includes 15 field crops, 9 livestock products, 24 horticultural (fruit and vegetable) crops, plus a greenhouse and nursery marketings aggregate. The quantity components of the index represent state-level quantities produced and these are weighted using state-specific prices received by farmers. 4 To measure labor in agriculture and account for quality change in the labor input, we 2 Using the same output data set described here, Craig and Pardey (1990) showed that state-level growth rates were significantly lower when state-level output indices were formed using national price weights instead of local ones. Drechsler (1973) advocated the use of characteristic prices on the grounds that one should use the price weights most specific to the economic activity being measured. 3If quantities and/or prices of different items within an input category such as labor do not move in parallel, there will be aggregation bias. For example, if rates of change in higher quality labor exceeds rates of change in lower quality labor, the rate of growth of the labor aggregate is biased downward relative to an index treating high and low quality items as separate components (Star 1974). constructed measures of hours worked and implicit wage series for each of 32 distinct types of labor within each state. We differentiated between hours worked by hired workers, family members, and 30 classes of farm operators with different age and education profiles. Census of Agriculture data on the age characteristics of farm operators was used in conjunction with statelevel Census of Population data on the number and earnings characteristics of rural males in various age-education classes to construct opportunity cost measures of the earnings profiles for farm operators within each state. We also incorporated data from the Agricultural Census on days worked off-farm by farm operators to take into account the substantial but uneven shift toward part-time farming. 5 Farm Labor data were used to measure hours of family labor. An implicit quantity measure of hired labor was derived from ERS data tapes reporting state-level expenses for hired labor. The state-specific price for hired and family workers is a wage rate for hired workers reported in Farm Labor. To measure capital's contribution to agricultural inputs we had to deal with the usual problem of inferring service flows from measured stocks of capital on farms as well as accounting for the heterogeneity of capital within each of nine capital classes. 6 To handle both problems we relied heavily on market values as reflections of the relative effectiveness of different types of capital within each capital class and as indicators of the rental values of capital. As a first step, we derived estimates of depreciation and lifespan parameters for a numeraire machine type in each capital class using blue book values of new and used machines. These parameter values were combined with information about the average age and quality of capital within each class to adjust published stock figures and to construct rental series for each capital class. When working with Agricultural Census data on physical counts of undifferentiated capital of a given capital class, we converted the published numbers to counts of a new numeraire type assumed to be of constant quality over the sample. When no information was available about the mix of types within a class --as was the case for biological capital, cars, trucks, and forage equipment -the published figure was taken to be an accurate count of the used numeraire capital type of the likely average age. Using the parameter of depreciation for the class, these counts were then discounted to arrive at counts of new numeraire machines. For tractors and combines a more sophisticated quality adjustment was possible. After 1963, unpublished data from FIEI on state-level purchases of tractors of 21 horsepower types and combines of 8 different types made it possible to form a much more accurate measure of the average age and type of tractor and combine in use in each state. Prior to 1964, the average horsepower of tractors in use for the country as a whole was used along with an assumed average age to convert census counts to new numeraire equivalents for both tractors and combines. When working with the total current market value of a capital class, as in the case of buildings, we constructed physical quantities by dividing the total value by the market value of the typical used structure. The latter price series was based on a price series of a typical farm structure and an assumed pattern of depreciation of buildings. To impute rents for the numeraire within each capital class, we used the relationship between market values and rents. For all capital classes we employed the same constant real discount rate. But the factor of proportionality that was used to convert market values of new numeraire capital types into rents differed across capital classes with different rates of depreciation or lifespans. The land input is the service flow from land of three basic types: pasture or rangeland, nonirrigated cropland, and irrigated cropland. The measure we used differs from the land in farms figure commonly used by others in that ours excludes non-grazed forest and woodlands, which are land in farms but not in agriculture. Our measure also includes tracts of federallyowned (e.g., Bureau of Land Management) land that was rented or leased for rangeland grazing purposes. The price weights used in aggregation were annual, state-level, cash rents. When missing observations made it necessary, imputed rents were calculated using the correspondence between observed rents and land values. By separating land into the three types and constructing a different rental series for each, we hope to have a more accurate measure of the quantity and quality of land in agriculture. There are nine broad classes of purchased inputs used in this study. They include fertilizers (further disaggregated into elemental nitrogen, phosphorus and potash), a preaggregated pesticides, herbicides and fungicides category, purchased seed, purchased feed, fuels and oils, electricity, repairs, machine hire, and a miscellaneous input category that preaggregates a long list of disparate inputs such as fencing, veterinary services, insurance costs and so on."}, {"section_title": "Output and Input Trends", "text": "A useful way to assess a new data series is to compare it with previously available estimates that purportedly measure the same thing. 7 But often this is not a wholly satisfactory exercise.

With these caveats in mind we follow with some selected comparisons of our series with previously published estimates."}, {"section_title": "Aggregate output", "text": "The national output aggregate formed with state-level prices and quantities grew by 1.78% per annum during the 1949-85 period. Underlying this figure there is considerable regional variation. Output increased by 2.94% annually in the South East, but decreased in the smaller northeastern states. 8 States with average annual output growth at or above 3% are Florida, Delaware, Georgia, California, and Arkansas. By contrast, output decreased over this period in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and West Virginia. In the aggregate, our rate of growth in output is higher than the 1.44% obtained by Capalbo and Vo (1988) for 1948-83, but lower than the 2.38%, 1.92%, and 1.98% annual growth rates, obtained by , Gollop (1992), andBall (1985), respectively. 9 Input Aggregates 7 Gardner (1992) recently reminds us that appearances can be deceiving in this respect. 8 See table 8 for a grouping of states into 11 production regions. 9 Huffman and Evenson's estimates are from 1950-82, Gollop's from 1947-85, andBall's from 1948-78. Labor: According to Ball's (1985) estimates the value share of labor in U.S. agriculture was around 54.6% in 1948 and declined to 20.8% by 1979. This represents an annual rate of decline in labor use of 3.17%. Capalbo and Vo (1988) report a 1949 labor share figure of 36%, declining to 9.5% by 1983. By contrast, our data suggest a much more modest long-run contraction in quality-adjusted labor shares down to 27.2% in 1985 from a 1949 figure of 44.7% (table 2). And, according to our estimates, quality-adjusted labor shares actually rose during the 1981-85 period. Apparently the increase in labor quality over the post-war period has partially offset the decline in total hours in agriculture. Capital: Our data have the share of quality-adjusted capital services (including services from mechanical inputs, service structures, and biological capital) in U.S. agriculture at around 11.4% in 1949 growing to 14.4% in 1985 (table 3). This translates into a relatively small increase of 0.59% per annum, which contrasts with other studies such as Ball (1985) whose capital share almost doubles from 13.2% in 1949 to 25.9% in 1979. Our estimates of the rate of increase in capital use in U.S. agriculture are in line with Capalbo and Vo's more modest growth from 23.7% in 1949 to 27.7% in 1983.10 For our data the largest increase in capital services occurred in the Delta, Appalachian, and Southeastern states. Land: Using a land in farms measure, Capalbo and Vo report a steep increase in the land share from less than 6% in 1950 to more than 40% in 1981. Ball's real property (i.e., land and structures) share is quite volatile, ranging from 2. 9% in 1949 to 31% in 1973, 9.3% in 1975, and 17.6% in 1979. In our case the cost share of quality-adjusted land services at the national level is remarkably stable over time ranging from 18.3% to 19.7% (table 4). But this stability at the national level masks a good deal of cross-state variability. The Mountain states have land-intensive farms with cost shares around 30% while less than 7% of the farming costs Total Inputs: A summary measure of the real inputs used in agriculture is given in table 5. Taking the U.S. as a whole, aggregate input use declined marginally for all sub-periods except during the latter half of the 1970s when it grew by 2.4% per annum. On balance aggregate input use since 1949 grew by 0.18% per annum at the national level, 1.2% per annum in the Pacific region, and contracted in the smaller Northeastern states as well as the Appalachian and Delta regions."}, {"section_title": "Productivity Growth", "text": "National estimates: The TFP estimates presented in table 6 (and graphically in figure 1) give a rough indication of the quantitative differences in the most widely used series. These series are not strictly comparable since the Ball and Capalbo and Vo figures were derived using national aggregate data while the other two series were formed using state-level data. But, they do indicate that the rate of growth of measured TFP may differ substantially depending on methods used and commodity coverage. The growth in TFP calculated using our data is higher than Capalbo and Vo's estimate but some 14% below those of other studies. One feature to note is that, despite historically high rates of growth in real output during the late 1970s, measured TFP actually contracted during this period given the commensurately large increase in input (particularly purchased inputs and capital services) use. The rather large productivity gains in the early 1970s and early 1980s came from increases in real output coupled with a decline in aggregate inputs. Regional and state estimates: The stateand regional-level data display large spatial variations in input, output and measured productivity trends since 1949. For the Northeastern states measured TFP actually increased because the decline in aggregate inputs was even more rapid than the decline in aggregate outputs. In the mid-western states moderate productivity growth was brought about by increases in both inputs and outputs. In the Southeast and Delta regions, aggregate input use for some states such as Alabama and Mississippi declined markedly, resulting in high rates of growth in measured TFP despite slower growth in aggregate output. By contrast, Florida had the largest increase in aggregate output of any of the contiguous 48 states but this was offset by a relatively large increase in inputs so that the measured growth in TFP was not so dramatic. Regional comparisons of measured TFP are given in table 7. The Evenson, Landau and Ballou (1987) series (as used by  provide the only other published estimates of state-level TFPs for U.S. agriculture. We compared these state-level TFP estimates with our own, and --with the exception of seven states (Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Nevada, New York and Utah) --found their rates of TFP growth were much higher than our own estimates.

The sequence of relative efficiencies of capital assets of different ages is given by the hyperbolic fucntion: where L is the service life of the asset and P is a curvature or decay parameter. The calculated value of this function gives the productive capacity of an asset r years after the purchase date expressed as a proportion of the original invstment. Subtracting this value form unity yields the proportion of accumulated physical depreciation t years after the purcahse date. This function incorporates many of the of the commonly used forms of depreciation as special cases. The upper limit on p is 1. This corresponds to the \"one-hoss shay\" form of depreciation where an asset is fully productive until it reaches the end of its service life, at which point it productivity falls to zero. As the value of P approaches zero, decay occurs at an increasing rate over time. If p is zero, the function corresponds to the formula for straight line depreciation where physical decay occurs in even increments over the life of the asset. Finally, if P is negative, decay occurs more rapidly in the early years of service corresponding to accelerated forms of depreciation such as the geometric or declining balance patterns. Problems arise as to the value that should be chosen for P in order to accurately reflect efficiency loss. Little empirical evidence is available to suggest a precise value. Much of the justification for assuming an accelerated form of depreciation is based on studies which detail the resale of used assets in secondary markets. Typically, these studies find that the value of an asset does decline most rapidly in the early years of service. However, these studies fail to distinguish between physical depreciation and the decline in the value of an asset. To illustrate this point, consider the example of a light bulb. If we expect no decline in output (illumination) over a given period, say 1000 hours, the relative efficiency follows a one-hoss shay pattern. Yet the value, assuming a zero rate of discount, is proportional to the hours in service. That is, after 100 hours in service, the replacement value of the light bulb is nine-tenths of its original value. Therefore, if we look at economic depreciation, the maximum value of p is zero. If there is a positive discount rate and future capital services are discounted to the present, we find that the value of the asset declines exponentially. Thus, the empirical evidence does support the theory that the value of an asset declines at an accelerated rate. However, there is no justification for extending this argument to conclude that efficiency also declines at an accelerated rate. On the contrary, there are both technological and economic arguments that support the theory that efficiency decay occurs more rapidly in the later years of service. If one observes a capital asset in use it appears that efficiency is uniformly high in the early years of service. Only after some time does the asset begin to deteriorate. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are required to maintain efficiency. As the asset ages, greater efficiency loss occurs and required expenditures for repairs and maintenance reach such a level that many are foregone, and the efficiency of the asset declines to the point where the asset is scrapped or sold. In this study, repairs and maintenance expenditures are defined to be of a minor or nature. They do not include major repairs which both increase the efficiency of an asset and extend the useful life. This is consistent with the accounting practice of treating minor repairs as current expense and major repairs as as capital expenditures. Two studies provide evidence that firms attempt to maintain efficiency until such time as technological obsolescence or efficiency decay warrent a decision to scrape the asset. At that point, the asset is allowed to decay with little effort to maintain efficiency. Utilizing data on. Utilizing data on expenditures for repairs and maintenance of 745 farm tractors covering the period 1958-74, Penson, Hughes and Nelson (1977) found that the loss of efficiency was very small in the early years and increased rapidly as the end of the asset's service life approached. More recently, Romain, Penson and Lambert (1987) compared the explanatory power of alternative capacity depreciation patterns for farm tractors in a model of investment behavior that also included the price of capital services. They found that the concave depreciation pattern better reflects actual investment decisions. Given the above discussion, it seems appropriate to restrict the value of 3 to lie between zero and one. It was assumed that the efficiency of structures declines slowly over most of their service life until the point is reached where the cost of major repairs exceeds the discounted value of the increased service flows derived form the reapirs. At this point, structures were assumed to deteriorate rapidly. In the case of machinery, the efficiency loss was assumed to occur over a larger proportion of the service life. The final values chosen for 1 were 0.50 for machinery and equipment and 0.75 for structures. Each type of asset consists of a homogenous group of assets for which the service lives differ due to quality differences, maintenance schedules, etc. For each asset, there exists some mean service life L around which there exists some distribution of actual service lives. In order to determine the amount of capital available for production the actual service lives and their frequency of occurence must be determined. It was assumed that this distribution could accurately be depicted by the normal distribution. One problem in using the normal distribution to calculate the frequence of occurence of each of the service lives is that the distribution extends infinitely in either direction from the mean. Without some adjustment, the distribution would yield cases where assets were discarded prior to the initial investment date or assets with unrealistically long service lives. To eliminate these extremes, the distribution was truncated at a point two standard deviations before and after the mean. Two standard deviations correspond to 0.98 times the assumed mean service life. This dispersion parameter was chosen to conform to the observation that assets are occasionally found that are considerable older than the mean service life and that a few assets are accidently damaged when new. The area under the truncated normal curve was then adjusted upward within the allowed range of asset lives. Asset service lives correspond to 85 percent of Bulletin F lives. Once the frequence of occurence of a particular service life was determined, the efficiency function for that service life was calculated using the assumed value of P1. This process was repeated for all possible service lives. An efficiency function for the investment cohort was then constructed as a weighted sum of the individual efficiency functions using as weights the frequency of occurence. This function not only reflects changes in efficiency, but also the discard distribution around the mean service life of the asset. We construct the stock of land in farms as an implicit quantity index using as prices land values (excluding buildings) per acre. In an effort to obtain a constant quality land series, we compiled data on land area and land values for each Crop Reporting District in each state. Acres of cropland, pasture and other land were handled separately in the 17 Western States, as was irrigated/nonirrigated land. The acreage of the components is reported in the Census of Agriculture; USDA compiles annual estimates of total land in farms. The distribution of land in each use category was interpolated between the censuses. The stock of producer-owned inventories is constructed in a similar manner. The number and average value of animals on farms at the beginning of the year are available from annual surveys. Data on stocks of grains and oilseeds are also available. However, no distinction is made between producer-owned and commercially held stocks. We estimated producer-owned stocks at yearend 1978 as the quantities stored on the farm plus producerowned stocks stored off the farm; quantities of commodities used as collateral for outstanding Commodity Credit Corporation loans were subtracted. Stocks were then moved forward to 1989 by adding, and back to 1960 by subtracting, the estimated annual changes in stocks.

Following Coen (1975), we define F as the present value of the stream of capacity depreciation on one unit of capital according to the mortality distribution m; that is: The real rate of return r in the above expression was calculated as the nominal yield on corporate bonds less the rate of inflation as measured by the producer price index for gross domestic product. An ex ante rate was obtained by expressing observed real rates as an ARIMA process. We then calculated F keeping this ex ante real rate constant for each vintage of capital goods."}, {"section_title": "Output", "text": "The data on crop output consist of quantities sold (including unredeemed Commodity Credit Corporation loans) plus additions to farmer-owned inventories and the quantity consumed in farm households during the calendar year. The USDA collects annual data on quantities of crops sold. However, the accounting period often differs from the calendar year. When this occurs, we use data on the monthly distribution of sales to distribute quantities sold during the crop year to the calendar year. In the case of livestock, the measure is the estimated weight gained on farms and in feedlots. The value of farm output reflects the value to the producing sector; that is, subsidies are added and indirect taxes are subtracted form the market value. Prices received by farmers, as reported in USDA's Agricultural Prices, include an allowance for net Commodity Credit Corporation loans and purchases by the Government valued at the average loan rate. However, direct payments under Federal commodity programs are not reflected in the data. Average prices for wool, mohair, and program crops are constructed as ratios of cash receipts plus subsidies to quantities sold; dairy assessments are subtracted from receipts. We then calculate the value of output by multiplying adjusted prices by the output quantities."}, {"section_title": "Intermediate Inputs", "text": "Intermediate inputs comprise all goods (other than fixed capital) and services consumed by the sector. Goods which were produced within the sector are recorded as intermediate input only if they have also been recorded as output. Feed crops produced and consumed on the farm are excluded from both output and intermediate input. In the case of livestock, only the costs incurred in the transaction are recorded as intermediate input. This accounting procedure is designed to prevent the full value of a live animal being included as both output and intermediate input every time it moves from one farm to another."}, {"section_title": "Feed, Seed, and Livestock", "text": "Expenditure data for livestock feeds are available from the Census of Agriculture and annual surveys. In an effort to measure the nonfarm value added, the USDA uses Census of Manufacturing data to estimate the margin between the farm value of feed crops and the value of manufactured feeds. The margin is intended to capture the value of salt, minerals, and other additives, as well as processing and transportation services added in the nonfarm sector. An estimate of the nonfarm value added in constant prices is obtained by dividing by the prices paid index for livestock feeds. The farm value of purchased livestock feeds is subtracted from the measure of sectoral output. For seeds, the nonfarm valued added is based on the difference between prices paid for seed and prices received for crops, while the nonfarm valued added in livestock purchases is the difference between purchases from hatcheries and receipts for hatching eggs. The AAEA task force rejected the value added measure advancing arguments similar to those outlined above. Instead, the AAEA recommended that feed crops consumed on the farm, as well as purchased livestock feeds, be included in the measure of intermediate input. Gross production of feed crops would be included in output from the sector. An objection is that this approach counts feed crops twice--once as crop production and again as embodied in livestock output. The approach adopted here is to include the full value of purchased feed and seed. We construct Tornqvist price indexes as deflators. Livestock purchases consist of imports of live animals."}, {"section_title": "Agricultural Chemicals", "text": "For fertilizer and lime, the basic data are annual estimates of the tonnage consumed of nitrogen (N), phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 0 5 ), and potassium oxide (K20) as reported in Commercial Fertilizer Consumption. Consumption of lime was obtained from the National Lime Institute. To aggregate the plant nutrients, we use estimates of the prices of plant nutrients consumed in the form of bulk materials (fertilizer materials that contain a high concentration of a single plant nutrient). Several nitrogenous materials are available. A weighted average price for a ton of nitrogen is constructed using as weights the quantities of nitrogen supplied by each material. Prices for the two remaining plant nutrients are derived from the prices for concentrated super phosphates (46 percent P 2 0 5 ) and muriate of potash (60 percent K20). The measure of pesticides is based upon current expenditures as estimated by the USDA. Estimated expenditures are deflated by a Tornqvist price index constructed from data provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency."}, {"section_title": "Petroleum Fuels, Natural Gas, and Electricity", "text": "Data on fuel consumption in agriculture by type of fuel and agricultural sector are taken from the National Energy Accounts: Energy Flows in the United States compiled by the Office of Business Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce. Data are reported for the years 1947, 1954, and 1958-85. For succeeding years, we estimate fuel consumption based on expenditure and price data taken from annual issues of Farm Production Expenditures and Agricultural Prices, respectively. For the intervening years, fuel consumption is estimated as the sum of fitted values for consumption in both crop and livestock sectors. Consumption of natural gas and liquified petroleum gas was a function of specific production activities, including grain drying, irrigation, and livestock brooding. Consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel was regressed on stocks of gasoline and diesel tractors, stocks of gasoline and diesel self-propelled harvesting equipment, and time. We estimate electricity consumption by dividing expenditures for electricity by the average price per kilowatt hour provided by the Rural Electrification Administration."}, {"section_title": "Other Purchased Inputs", "text": "There remains several purchased inputs that account for a relatively small share in total intermediate input expense. Included are expenditures for contract labor, purchased machine services, machine and building repairs and maintenance, transportation services, irrigation fees paid to public sellers of water, and purchases of farm supplies such as small hand tools, baling twine, etc. The deflator for contract labor expenditures is the piece rate reported by the USDA. For purchased machine services, we construct a Tornqvist price index of rental rates for durable equipment, petroleum fuels, and the wage paid to hired farm workers. Expenditures for transportation services are deflated using the implicit price deflator for the trucking and wharehousing industry (SIC 42). The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for automobile repairs is used to obtain the series on machinery repairs in constant prices; the CPI for building repairs and maintenance is used to measure expenditures for building repairs and maintenance in constant prices. The index of operating and maintenance costs computed by Bureau of Reclamation is used to deflate irrigation expense. Finally, expenditures for farm supplies are deflated by the Consumer Price Index for hardware items."}, {"section_title": "Total Factor Productivity", "text": "Using equations ( 5) and ( 6), we compute indexes of total output, total factor input and productivity for U.S. agriculture and for selected states. The indexes are reported for the period 1900-89 along with average rates of growth for the 1960-89 period and intermediate periods. These correspond to peaks in business cycles. Looking first at the results at the national level, we see that total output from the sector grew at a 2 percent annual rate. All of the increase in output was accounted for by increases in productivity. Total factor input actually declined modestly over the 1960-89 period. Two intermediate periods are of particular interest. The first period is that spanning the years 1973-79. Total output grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent. Growth in input use accounted for most of the growth in output with productivity growth stagnant. This period is bracketed by the two oil embargoes which resulted in dramatic increases in energy prices and prices of other purchased inputs. The second is the period 1979-89. Growth in total output slowed during this period. however, this relatively modest rate of growth in output was sustained while total input use actually declined at a 1.5 percent annual rate. Growth in total factor productivity was almost 3 percent per annum."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "A comparison with the nonfarm sector, done by Jorgenson, Gollop and Fraumeni (1987), found only the communications industry achieved greater rates of productivity growth than agriculture. Also presented are results for selected states. The regional disparities in growth of the agricultural sector is striking. For the five states where data are complete, the annual growth rates ranged from a low of 1.8 percent in Illinois to 3.35 percent in Colorado. Productivity growth, while clearly cyclical, exceeded the annual rate for the U.S. in each of the five states. With the exception of California, productivity growth rates exceeded 2 percent annually. Productivity increases exceeded 4 percent annually in Nebraska."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusion", "text": "Measures of total output, total factor input and productivity are constructed for the United States and selected individual states for the period 1960-89. The rate of growth in total output exceeded 2 percent per annum. All of the growth in output was accounted for by growth in productivity. The index of total input declined modestly. Regional disparities in growth rates of total output were striking. These ranged from a low of 1.8 percent annually in Illinois to a high of 3.35 percent annually in Colorado. Differences in rates of growth of productivity were similarly striking. This underscores the need to develop regionally disaggregated production accounts. "}]
