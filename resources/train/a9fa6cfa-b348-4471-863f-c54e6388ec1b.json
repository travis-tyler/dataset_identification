[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease is a firmly incurable and progressive disease. The pathology of Alzheimer's disease usually evolves from cognitive normal, to mild cognitive impairment, to Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this paper is to develop a Bayesian hidden Markov model to characterize disease pathology, identify hidden states corresponding to the diagnosed stages of cognitive decline, and examine the dynamic changes of potential risk factors associated with the cognitive normal-mild cognitive impairment-Alzheimer's disease transition. The hidden Markov model framework consists of two major components. The first one is a state-dependent semiparametric regression for delineating the complex associations between clinical outcomes of interest and a set of prognostic biomarkers across neurodegenerative states. The second one is a parametric transition model, while accounting for potential covariate effects on the cross-state transition. The inter-individual and inter-process differences are taken into account via correlated random effects in both components. Based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set, we are able to identify four states of Alzheimer's disease pathology, corresponding to common diagnosed cognitive decline stages, including cognitive normal, early mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease and examine the effects of hippocampus, age, gender, and APOE-4 on degeneration of cognitive function across the four cognitive states."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. The most common early symptom of AD is short-term memory loss, also referred to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Patients at MCI state have high likelihood to transit to dementia or AD within a few years. 1 Despite an increasing attention to its growing public threat, the cause of AD remains poorly understood. Thus, it is of great interest to discover or validate prognostic biomarkers that may identify subjects at great risk for future cognitive decline and investigate the functional effects of various biomarkers on the conversion from cognitive normal (CN) to AD. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study began in 2004 and it collected imaging, generic, clinical, and cognitive data from subjects under CN controls and subjects with MCI or AD in order to delineate the complex associations among various characteristics of the clinical spectrum of AD. The ADNI-1 recruited approximately 800 subjects according to its initial aim and has been extended by three follow-up studies, namely, ADNI-GO, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3. More information on ADNI can be obtained in the official website (www. adni-info.org). Functional assessment questionnaire (FAQ), an assessment of abilities to function independently in daily life, is widely used to monitor the decline of cognitive ability over time. Patients with higher FAQ scores have lower cognitive ability. The FAQ scores of each subject were obtained at baseline and then every 6 months across 9 years multiple study phases. Figure 1 plots the individual trajectories of FAQ scores for 20 randomly selected samples, which were initially diagnosed as CN, MCI, and AD, respectively. The cognitive decline patterns are apparently distinct over the groups, suggesting at least three (and probably more) distinct neurodegenerative states existent underlying the observations of FAQ score. Thus, for this longitudinal study, several central questions are naturally raised as follows: (1) How many hidden pathophysiological states exist in the progression of AD? (2) Which factors should contribute to the neurodegenerative pathology from one state (e.g., MCI) to another (e.g., AD)? (3) Whether the identified risk factors are equally good predictors of cognitive decline at each state? Given these questions, there is a particular need for the development of statistical models that delineate cognitive decline in terms of the pathophysiological states of AD.\nHidden Markov models (HMMs) are well suited to the characterization of longitudinal data in terms of a set of hidden states. [2] [3] [4] HMMs consist of two components: a transition model to describe the dynamic transition of hidden states and a conditional regression model to examine state-specific covariate effects on responses. Owing to their ability to simultaneously reveal the longitudinal association structure and dynamic heterogeneity of the observed process, HMMs and their variants have attracted significant attention from the medical, behavioral, social, environmental, and psychological sciences. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In particular, HMMs have previously been applied to investigate diseases progression to identify latent pathophysiological states. For instance, Albert et al. 10 used HMMs to analyze multiple sclerosis disease across relapse and remission states (see also Altman and Petkau; 11 "}, {"section_title": "Altman", "text": "12 ). Ip et al. 13 identified 10 disable states on the basis of a 10-year follow-up study of late-life disability in elder adults, and examined the patterns and risk factors for transition among disable states. Song et al.\n14 revealed the dynamic change of treatment effectiveness in preventing cocaine use across three cocaine addiction states.\nDespite the rapid development and wide applications of HMMs, existing literature has mainly focused on parametric HMMs, in which the forms of covariate effects on responses and on transition probabilities are pre-specified. One problem of parametric models is that they may be too restrictive to reflect correctly the reality because the complex relationships among variables are seldom known a priori, and a pre-specified parametric form tends to overlook the subtle pattern of a function. A more comprehensive analysis can be performed by incorporating nonparametric functions into HMMs so that the functional effects of interest can be discovered.\nOne of a few exceptions in this direction is the development of Yau et al., 15 which considered a Bayesian nonparametric HMM, in which the sampling distribution of the observations arising in each state was assumed unknown and formulated through a mixture of Dirichlet process (DP) model. Although such an approach enables the nonparametric modeling of the distribution of an observed process, it cannot reveal the functional effects of potential predictors on the outcome of interest.\nIn this study, we propose a Bayesian HMM to analyze the ADNI-1 data set. Similar to conventional HMMs, the proposed model consists of two major components. The first component is a state-dependent semiparametric regression to investigate linear and nonlinear covariate effects on the clinical outcome of cognitive decline (e.g., FAQ score). The second component is a mixed continuation-ratio logit transition model to examine covariate effects on the probabilities of transitioning among neurodegenerative states. We introduce a random effect in both models in order to account for interindividual differences and allow the random effects to be dependent by assigning a joint distribution for them. Such joint random effects enable the model to accommodate the situation where some omitted factors influence both the observed process and the hidden transition process. 16, 17 We develop a full Bayesian approach, along with Bayesian P-splines procedure and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, for statistical inference. Available works in Bayesian HMMs include, but are not limited to, Scott et al. 6 for investigating the health state of schizophrenia and comparing the effectiveness of two antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia, Yau et al. 15 for relaxing the distribution assumption of the observation process through a DP model, Scott 18 for introducing recursive computing and MCMC sampling into HMMs, and Johnson and Willsky 19 for analyzing sequential data in an unsupervised setting with the use of a hierarchical DP hidden semi-Markov model. Nevertheless, these studies were developed either in the parametric setting or for the purpose of extending the distributional assumptions on observed and/or hidden processes. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the neurodegenerative pathology of AD and examine the possible functional effects of its potential risk factors in each pathophysiological state of AD.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the model and discusses model identifiability issues. Section 3 introduces the Bayesian inference procedure. Section 4 illustrates the use of the proposed model in the analysis of the ADNI data set. Section 5 demonstrates the empirical performance of the proposed methodology through a simulation study. Section 6 concludes the paper.

Moreover, the subject-specific random effect w i1 permits additional dependencies elicited from other sources and thus avoids a large number of hidden states caused by possible residual correlation among responses."}, {"section_title": "Continuation-ratio logit transition model", "text": "Let p itus denote the transition probability from state Z i,t\u00c01 \u00bc u at occasion t -1 to state Z it \u00bc s at occasion t for individual i.

Then, the transition across the ordered states can be described by continuation-ratio logits 20 as follows:\nThe parameterization in equation (3) is intended to facilitate the interpretation of transition to a state rather than to a better one. To examine the effects of potential predictors on the transition probabilities, we consider a continuation-ratio logit transition model as follows\nwhere us is a state-specific intercept, d it is a h \u00c2 1 vector of covariates, a is a h \u00c2 1 vector of regression coefficients that can be interpreted as conditional log odds ratios in a logistic regression, w i2 is a subject-specific random effect that is distinct from but correlated with w i1 , and w i \u00bc \u00f0w i1 , w i2 \u00de T is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution N\u00f00, (\u00de. Similar to the proportional assumption in a cumulative logit model, a in equation (4) is assumed to be independent of u and s in order to maintain the order of the hidden states and avoid a tedious transition model, in which every transition elicits a set of parameters for all possible states of origination and destination. This outcome, in turn, greatly reduces the complexity and enhances the interpretability of the transition model. Moreover, unlike the existing literature that usually treats w i1 and w i2 separately, we accommodate their possible correlation by assigning a joint distribution for w i \u00bc \u00f0w i1 , w i2 \u00de T . Consequently, the possible correlation between the heterogeneities existent within the two stochastic processes can be appropriately addressed and examined through the covariance matrix (."}, {"section_title": "Model identification", "text": "The proposed model is not identifiable because of the following three model indeterminacies. The first is caused by the additive nonparametric functions involved in equation (1), in which each unknown function is not identifiable up to a constant.

Let sm and c it,m denote the mth element of c s and c it in equation (1), respectively. The second model determinacy is caused by the fact that if c it,m is a constant, then s , sm , and w i1 are not simultaneously identifiable. Given that the mean of w i is assumed to be 0, we can absorb sm into s to address the problem. Then, model (1) becomes an identifiable random intercept model with a nested error structure. [23] [24] [25] The last model determinacy is the label switching problem elicited by the invariance of the likelihood function to a random permutation of the state labels, which results in a multi-modal posterior under a symmetric prior specification. We follow Fru\u00a8hwirth-Schnatter 26 to conduct a permutation sampler to address this issue."}, {"section_title": "Bayesian inference 3.1 Nonparametric modeling", "text": "The first critical issue in the Bayesian analysis of the proposed model is to estimate the nonparametric functions involved in equation (1) . We consider the use of Bayesian P-splines. [27] [28] [29] The basic idea is to estimate the unknown smoothing functions through a sum of B-splines basis functions 30 given a large number of knots in the domains of predictors. Specifically, f sj \u00f0x it,j \u00de, the functional effect of the jth covariate at state s for subject i at time t, can be approximated as follows\nwhere L is the number of splines determined by the number of knots, b sj \u00bc \u00f0 sj,1 , . . . , sj,L sj \u00de T is the vector of the unknown parameters, B\u00f0\u00c1\u00des' are cubic B-splines basis functions, and B\u00f0x it,j \u00de \u00bc \u00f0B 1 \u00f0x it,j \u00de, . . . , B L sj \u00f0x it,j \u00de\u00de T . Usually, L sj taking a value from 10 to 30 provides sufficient flexibility in fitting most smooth functions.\nOne problem of applying equation (6) to approximate an unknown smooth function is the overfitting caused by the use of a large number of knots. Eilers and Marx 31 suggested the penalization of the coefficients of adjacent B-splines basis functions to prevent the overfitting. Such penalization can be implemented in the Bayesian framework by applying random walk priors to b sj . 22, 28, 29 "}, {"section_title": "Prior distributions", "text": "We assign a truncated Gaussian priors for b sj as follows\nwhere sj is a smoothing parameter for controlling the amount of penalty, K sj is a penalty matrix derived according to the random walk penalties proposed, L sj is the rank of K sj , 1 n s is an n s \u00c2 1 vector with all elements equal to 1, n s is the sample size at state s, B sj is the sub-matrix of B j \u00bc \u00bdB l \u00f0x it,j \u00de nT\u00c2L without the rows where Z it 6 \u00bc s, and the truncation term incorporates the identifiability constraint (equation (5)) into the splines approximation (equation (6)).

We instead work on p\u00f0h, Z, WjY\u00de and use the Gibbs sampler to implement the posterior simulation. Owing to the nonlinearity of the continuation-logit transition model and the existence of the nonparametric functions in the conditional regression, some full conditional distributions, especially those related to the transition model, have complex forms. MCMC methods, such as the forward filtering and backward sampling algorithm 2 and the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm, 32, 33 are employed to sample from them. The details are provided in the online Appendix.

In this regard, a relevant question is how to determine the number of hidden states in the analysis of ADNI data. Celeux et al. 34 explored several versions of deviance information criteria (DIC) 35 for model comparison in the presence of incomplete data. They pointed out that DIC 4 is the best performing one among all the evaluated versions of DIC.

For each subject, we included his/her clinical and genetic variables at the four time points. The clinical characteristics include gender (0 \u00bc male; 1 \u00bc female), age at baseline, and FAQ score. We considered apolipoprotein E (APOE)-\"4 as a covariate because it has been identified as a risk factor for early onset of AD. 36 APOE-\"4 is coded as 0, 1, and 2, denoting the number of APOE-\"4 alleles. Furthermore, the logarithm of the ratio of hippocampal volume over whole brain volume was included as a covariate because published reports [37] [38] [39] revealed that the atrophy of the hippocampal formation was a significant diagnostic marker of clinical dementia. The aims of this ADNI data analysis are (I) to identify the hidden states of the neurodegenerative pathology, (II) to reveal potential covariates that influence the between-states transition, and (III) to investigate the linear and/or functional covariate effects on cognitive decline across the hidden states of the AD progression.\nWe fitted the proposed model with the FAQ score as the response y it , age and hippocampus that are directly associated with the FAQ score as covariates in x it , and typically individual characteristics, such as gender and APOE-\"4, as covariates in d it . Three continuous variables, FAQ score, hippocampus, and age, were standardized prior to analysis. We first determined the number of hidden states. We considered five competing models M k , k \u00bc 1, . . . , 5, where M k represents a model with k states. A total of 24 equidistant knots were used to construct cubic P-splines, and the second-order random walk penalties were used for the Bayesian P-splines to estimate the unknown smooth functions. Given the lack of prior information, we assign the hyperparameters in equations (9) and (10) to reflect vague prior information as follows: 2 , fa 0 is a vector with all elements being zero, and H \u00bc I 3 , where I r is a r-dimensional identity matrix. We used the random permutation sampler to search for a suitable identifiability constraint to solve the label switching problem. The MCMC algorithm converged within 2000 iterations for all competing models. We collected a total of 10,000 observations after discarding 10,000 burn-in iterations to calculate DIC. > 1) are not computed on exactly the same observed data; the latter involves additional covariates d i in the transition model. Nevertheless, an apparent heterogeneity of the data can be revealed by Figure 1 . Second, the value of D\u00f0h\u00de is greater for M 5 than for M 4 . After checking the results further, we found that one of the states in M 5 included only five individuals. Such an extremely small-sized state leads to unreliable results and implies nonexistence of five states in this application.\nTo examine the necessity of the random effects in the proposed model, we considered another competing model M N : a four-state model without random effects. The DIC value suggests an evident advantage of the proposed mixed effect model in the presence of high dependency/heterogeneity in longitudinal observations. Thus, M 4 was selected for the subsequent analysis. The estimation results obtained under M 4 are reported in Table 2 (parametric part) and Figure 2 (nonparametric part) .\nWe have the following observations. First, 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 are ranked in an ascending order, indicating that patients in state 1 got the lowest score of FAQ, whereas those in state 4 got the highest. That is, patients' ability to function independently in daily life steadily deteriorated from state 1 to state 4. According to the existing literature, 40 state 1 to state 4 can be explained as CN, early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and AD, respectively.\nSecond, the functional effect of hippocampus on FAQ exhibits a descending trend as hippocampus grows regardless of states. Specifically, in CN state, people with bigger hippocampus volume tend to have slightly better memory. This finding is in line with the common sense that hippocampus plays an important role in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory. In EMCI, LMCI, and AD states, the descending trend of the functional effect of hippocampus on FAQ becomes much more pronounced, implying that atrophy in hippocampal volume increasingly impairs patients' cognitive ability during the progression of EMCI-LMCI-AD. The published reports [37] [38] [39] also indicate that the volume loss of the hippocampus is greatly associated with clinical dementia.\nThird, the effect of age on FAQ is nonsignificant in CN, EMCI, and LMCI states, implying that age affects cognitive function mainly in AD state. Elderly AD patients (say, over 85 years old) suffer from more increasing neurodegeneration than relatively young patients. Such age effect was also discovered by previous studies. 41, 42 Fourth, in the transition model, APOE-\"4 alleles have negative effects on the probability of transitioning from a state to a better one, indicating that APOE-\"4 alleles are important risk factors for the development of AD. This result agrees with those obtained by previous studies. 43 However, the effect of gender on the transition probability is inapparent.\nFifth, the variances of the two random effects are significant, reconfirming the necessity of the random effects proposed. However, the covariance between the two random effects is nonsignificant, showing that some omitted clinical or genetic indicators influenced outcomes of the observation process or probabilities of the transition process but did not affect the two processes simultaneously.\nMoreover, we estimated the hidden states of all patients at four time points based on equation (11) . Around 98.1% posterior transition patterns are from a state to a severer one, which is in line with the common knowledge of irreversibility of AD. Table 3 reports patients' estimated hidden states and their diagnosed status by doctors. For CN, LMCI, and AD states, a majority of the estimated states are consistent with those diagnosed by doctors. For EMCI state, however, 809 (65%) EMCI patients diagnosed by doctors were classified into CN state by our procedure. Such vague demarcation between CN and EMCI was also found and discussed in the literature (e.g., Petersen 44 ).

Although HMMs and their variants have already been extensively used for longitudinal data analysis, a majority of applications restrict analysis in a parametric framework. Nonetheless, examples of using HMMs to characterize the neurodegenerative states of AD pathology are not prevalent, especially in a semiparametric context. In this study, we extended parametric HMMs to accommodate the functional effects of hippocampus and age on cognitive decline across four neurodegenerative states. Our model incorporates correlated random effects to account for individual and/or contextual differences in the progression of cognitive decline and in between-state transition. As we demonstrated in the ADNI study, accounting for such differences can dramatically improve model fit, as evidenced by an apparent improvement in DIC value between models with and without random effects. In addition, the correlation between the random effects enhances the model capability of accommodating the situation where some omitted covariates influence both the state-dependent observation process and the hidden-state transition process. Another appealing feature of this study is that it implements a full Bayesian analysis along with efficient MCMC methods. The sampling-based Bayesian approach is not only applicable to the current parameter-rich model but also possesses potential to address highly complex problems with which huge challenges are confronted by ML-based procedures.\nThis study can be extended in several directions: First, we considered the nonparametric modeling only in the conditional model. Generalizing the parametric transition model to a semiparametric/nonparametric one can further enhance model flexibility and analytic power. However, the statistical analysis of such comprehensive models can be challenging because the computational burden and sample size often limit the complexity of candidate models. Thus, the feasibility of this extension requires further investigation. Second, in the application to the ADNI data set, a highly comprehensive characterization of cognitive function is to group the FAQ, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, and Mini-Mental State Examination into an integrated latent construct through multivariate techniques such as factor analysis. Finally, this study did not consider missing data. Given that missingness is very common in longitudinal settings, accommodation of missing responses and/or missing covariates in the context of the proposed model framework is both of scientific interest and of practical value. These advances certainly require substantial efforts for further investigation."}]
