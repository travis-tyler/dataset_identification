[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "At the end of 2013, roughly 51,000 persons living with HIV (PLWH) lived in nonmetropolitan areas of the United States (communities of 50,000 residents or fewer), accounting for 6% of all HIV/AIDS cases. 1 HIV prevalence rates in rural areas will increase for two reasons. First, increasingly efficacious ART regimens will extend survival for many rural PLWH. 2 Second, many rural PLWH (33 to 50%) engage in high HIV transmission risk behaviors that further spread HIV in rural areas. 3,4 Several urban-rural differences complicate efforts to improve life quality in rural PLWH. Compared to their urban counterparts, rural PLWH confront a shortage of mental health care professionals experienced in providing HIV care, fewer social supports, reduced access to public and private transportation, and more HIV-related stigma from community members. 5,6 Perhaps unsurprisingly, a greater mortality rate was reported over a 10-year period in rural (10.4%) than urban (6.0%) PLWH. 7 Rural PLWH evince a higher rate of depression than urban PLWH. Sheth et al. 8 compared depression prevalence rates between urban and rural PLWH presenting at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock HIV Program. Using a retrospective cohort design and Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) Scores, 9 they categorized patients as living in small towns/rural (n=185), micropolitan (n=145), or metropolitan (n=316) areas. Depression rates were highest in rural areas (60%) followed by micropolitan (52%) and metropolitan areas (41%), with rural PLWH 1.3 times more likely to receive a depression diagnosis than their metropolitan counterparts. High depression rates in rural PLWH are troubling because depression in PLWH is associated with poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, impaired daily functioning, poor engagement and retention in care, more comorbid health conditions, and the continued practice of risky sexual behaviors. [10][11][12][13][14] That rural PLWH are less likely to have seen a mental health provider over the past year and make fewer visits to mental health professionals 15 than urban PLWH makes high depression rates in rural PLWH all the more worrisome. Despite the need for mental health treatments for rural PLWH, mental health treatment shortages and geographic barriers preclude many rural PLWH from accessing and receiving treatment. Ninety-six percent of all U.S. households have traditional landline and/or cellular telephones, 16 which can provide practical treatment administration routes for depressed rural PLWH. Teletherapy overcomes geographic distances separating patients and practitioners, maximizes confidentiality (e.g., teletherapy spares the patient from publicly, physically entering a mental health venue), and provides emotional and informational supports to geographically-remote individuals. 17 Teletherapy has considerable depression treatment efficacy. Mohr et al.'s 18 meta-analysis found significant reductions in depressive symptoms across all assessment periods for patients enrolled in telephone-administered psychotherapy compared to standard care (SC) controls (d = .26); even greater reductions emerged when analyses were limited to changes from pre-to post-intervention (d = .82). A few studies have examined the efficacy of teletherapy to treat rural PLWH, but their results are inconclusive. Heckman et al. 19 treated 299 rural PLWH recruited in 13 states and found that neither 8 sessions of telephone-administered coping effectiveness group training nor 8 sessions of information-support group training reduced depressive symptoms. Ransom et al. 20 pilot-tested whether brief tele-IPT reduced psychiatric distress in 79 rural PLWH. Patients received either SC (n=38) or six sessions of tele-IPT plus SC (n=41). Tele-IPT patients evinced significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and overall levels of psychiatric distress from pre-through post-intervention than SC controls; one-third of tele-IPT patients reported clinically-meaningful reductions in psychiatric distress. Based on Ransom et al.'s promising pilot RCT, 20 we conducted a more comprehensive RCT using a larger and more geographically-diverse sample to test tele-IPT's efficacy to relieve depressive symptoms in rural PLWH diagnosed with unipolar depression. IPT is a timelimited, diagnosis-targeted psychotherapy that focuses on one's feelings in an interpersonal context and enhancing interpersonal skills. 21 IPT helps patients resolve their depressive symptoms by linking a current interpersonal crisis to the patient's depressive episode. By helping patients to resolve that crisis, tele-IPT helps the patient gain a sense of mastery over an oppressive environment, relieve depressive symptoms, and improve his or her life. This RCT evaluated the efficacy of tele-IPT to reduce depressive symptoms in 132 HIVinfected persons living in rural U.S. areas. Patients completed surveys at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 4-and 8-month follow-up assessing depressive symptoms (primary outcome), interpersonal problems (secondary outcome), and social support (secondary outcome). Analyses in this report examined only acute changes (from pre-through postintervention) in depressive symptoms, interpersonal problems, and social support, as followup data collection is ongoing. We hypothesized that (i) tele-IPT patients would report greater reductions in depressive symptoms and interpersonal problems and increases in social support than SC controls, and (ii) a significantly greater proportion of tele-IPT patients would respond favorably to treatment (i.e., depressive symptom relief \u226550%) than SC controls."}, {"section_title": "METHOD Patients and Procedures", "text": "Between August 2010 and September 2014, AIDS service organizations (ASOs) in 28 states distributed recruitment brochures to their HIV-infected rural clients through face-to-face interactions, regular mail, and placement of study brochures in \"high-traffic\" areas of their facilities. The Rural Center for AIDS Prevention (RCAP) at Indiana University distributed study advertisements through its listserv and publicized the study on its website.

This study enrolled rural PLWH who received a unipolar mood disorder diagnosis (not self-reported elevated depressive symptoms) because: (1) IPT was developed specifically for individuals diagnosed with mood disorders; (2) HIV manifestation and medication side effects can mimic somatic symptoms of depression (interviews differentiated these symptoms); and (3) an actual depressive diagnosis had been an inclusion criterion in the pilot RCT. 20 The sole exclusion criterion was serious cognitive or neuropsychiatric impairment based on the telephone-administered version of the 3MS (scores < 70).

A priori power analyses, informed by data from our previous rural PLWH research, 20 showed that 70 patients per study arm would yield power >.85 for clinically significant reductions in BDI-II depression scores, the study's primary outcome. Standard Care (SC) Control.-SC controls received no active study treatment but had access to community-based support services available to PLWH (e.g., AIDS-related support groups, 12-step programs, individual therapy, prescribed antidepressant medications). No limitations were imposed on patients' use of psychosocial services outside of the RCT. Their use of these services was documented during the study. Tele-Interpersonal Psychotherapy (tele-IPT) + SC.-Tele-IPT + SC patients received nine weekly, one-hour telephone IPT treatments (adapted from the \"Manual for Interpersonal Therapy with Depressed HIV-Seropositive Patients\"). 30 Sessions 1 and 2 consisted of patient-therapist introductions and an overview of therapy protocol. Teletherapists and patients also explored patients' depressive symptoms, discussed the nature of depression, reviewed current interpersonal relationships, and identified a problem relationship or circumstance that served as the therapeutic focus for the remainder of treatment. Therapists framed each patient's primary interpersonal concern using one of four focal areas: interpersonal role dispute (e.g., conflict with partner); role transition (e.g., loss of employment, moving from an urban to a rural environment); grief (death of loved one); or interpersonal sensitivities (chronic difficulties forming or maintaining close relationships). Sessions 3 through 9 addressed the problematic relationship/issue identified in Sessions 1 and 2. Sessions 8 and 9 addressed issues of therapy termination and maintenance of treatment gains. Tele-IPT patients used the following protocol during therapy: (1) a private, television-and computer-free location was preferred for therapy; (2) weekly therapy sessions scheduled at times when no interruptions were anticipated; (3) avoidance of call waiting, except in possible emergency situations; (4) avoiding teletherapy via cellphone while driving; (5) when possible, using traditional land-line telephones to reduce likelihood of \"dropped\" calls; (6) avoiding use of the speakerphone feature; and (7) if using a cell phone, ensuring a fully charged battery."}, {"section_title": "Therapist Training and Supervision", "text": "Prior to initiating the RCT, John Markowitz, M.D., an IPT clinical trials expert 21 and architect of IPT for PLWH, conducted a two-day in-person training session with teletherapists, all of whom were PhD-level psychologists and many of whom had considerable teletherapy experience. This was the only formal training offered to teletherapists; no additional centralized or formal trainings were conducted after initiating the RCT, as would likely be the case when administered by clinical or community health professionals. Following the initial training, each teletherapist was e-mailed a tele-IPT intervention manual for review prior to conducting teletherapy. Similar to patients, teletherapists were located in various regions of the United States. This study purposely employed this minimal instruction approach because, in all likelihood, this is how many manualized teletherapies are (and will be) disseminated through practitioners in community settings. This approach also enhanced the external validity of the tele-IPT treatment and arguably made this study a hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial. Teletherapists participated in monthly telephone-based supervision conference calls. Monthly tele-supervision provided therapists with opportunities to discuss their administration of tele-IPT, any clinical concerns they had, and helped to verify and increase treatment fidelity. At the completion of each tele-IPT session, therapists completed a \"Therapy Content Checklist\" to enhance treatment fidelity. All teletherapy sessions were digitally audio recorded and reviewed by study team members to ensure fidelity to intervention protocol."}, {"section_title": "Patient Flow", "text": "Patients were recruited in waves of 2, 4, or 6 and randomly assigned to condition using an algorithm that ensured equal cell sizes.

Of the 305 individuals who completed eligibility screenings, 138 did not satisfy the depression-related inclusion criteria. Ultimately, 167 individuals satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria and were assigned to a study arm. While all patients were diagnosed with a PRIME-MD-based depressive disorder in eligibility screenings, 35 patients (14 tele-IPT and 21 SC controls) had pre-intervention BDI values <14, the threshold for mild depressive disorder. 24 To minimize the possibility of a \"floor effect\" in intervention outcome analyses, and because assessing the efficacy of tele-IPT with non-depressed individuals has questionable utility, these patients were excluded from outcome analyses, yielding 132 intent-to treat and 118 therapy completer patients (i.e., patients who completed all nine teletherapy sessions).

ANOVA compared depressive symptoms and perceptions of social support by Rural Urban Continuum Code to determine if depression and social support varied by rurality and if rurality should be considered in intervention-outcome analyses.

This is the first large-scale RCT to test tele-IPT's efficacy to provide acute depressive symptom relief in rural PLWHA diagnosed with depression. Tele-IPT was a highly acceptable form of treatment for depressed rural PLWHA, with 80% of patients completing all nine treatment sessions. Across a series of intervention-outcome approaches, tele-IPT patients reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms and interpersonal problems at post-intervention than controls, with 23% of tele-IPT patients reporting reductions in depressive symptoms of 50% or greater and intervention effect sizes that were \"medium\" in magnitude in completer-only analyses. This proportion (23%) is identical to findings from Ransom et al.'s 20 pilot RCT of tele-IPT for depressed rural PLWHA. Although a favorable response rate of 23% is relatively modest compared to those found in some previous IPT studies, 34 this rate is compelling given the brevity of treatment (9 sessions), the minimal formal training provided to IPT teletherapists, and the large proportion of patients included in the sample with histories of other mental health and substance use disorders. Many individuals with these conditions are typically excluded from AIDS psychotherapy outcomes research. More than half the patients linked their depression to a recent role transition. Common role transitions in rural PLWHA included sudden relationship changes (newly divorced), loss of job or change in employment status, new or unanticipated caregiving roles, moving from an urban to a rural area, or worsening health (e.g., diagnosed with a serious non-HIV-related health condition). In this study, tele-IPT focused on depressive symptom relief associated with role transitions by encouraging the patient to mourn the loss of the old role, acquire new skills to succeed in the new role, develop new attachments and supports made possible through the new role, and identifying positive aspects of the new role. 35 Mental health practitioners and agencies who work with rural PLWHA should anticipate that many depressive episodes in this group are triggered by difficult role transitions. Face-to-face IPT has demonstrated efficacy across many disorders, including nonpsychotic major depression, 36 recurrent depression, 37 bulimia nervosa, 38 binge eating disorder, 39 and PTSD, 40 and is an indicated treatment in numerous treatment guidelines for mood and eating disorders. Several formative studies suggest that IPT can be administered successfully via telephone. Donnelly et al. 41 used a single-arm pilot study to demonstrate tele-IPT's feasibility for women with breast cancer. Miller and Weissman 42 established feasibility and preliminary efficacy of tele-IPT for depressed women with a lifetime history of recurrent depression and low rates of previous treatment. Neugebauer et al. 43 found that one to six sessions of telephone-administered interpersonal counseling (a briefer form of IPT) provided symptom relief in depressed women who had miscarried compared to standard of care. The current clinical trial is arguably the largest, most definitive, and most rigorous test of tele-IPT's acute depression treatment efficacy and underscores IPT's feasibility to be administered via traditional land-line and cellular telephones. To date, no research has examined the relationship between rurality, depression, and social support in rural PLWHA. Conventional wisdom suggests that the highest levels of depression and isolation should occur in PLWHA in the most geographically-isolated communities. Interestingly, this research found that PLWHA in the most rural areas (continuum codes of 8 and 9) reported depressive symptoms and perceptions of social support comparable to PLWHA in more densely populated rural communities and rural communities adjacent to large metropolitan areas. Rurality was also unrelated to tele-IPT session attendance, suggesting IPT's acceptability among all rural PLWHA. While tele-IPT reduced patients' depressive symptoms and interpersonal problems, no treatment-related changes were observed in social support. One explanation for this null finding is that very few, if any, social supports existed in patients' immediate geographic vicinities that they could mobilize. It is also plausible that nine weeks of treatment was insufficient to improve social support networks for PLWHA in rural areas. Practitioners who offer tele-IPT for depressed rural PLWHA should consider how the lack of social supports in rural areas might affect the administration of an interpersonal treatment that relies heavily on developing, accessing, and benefiting from social support networks. This clinical trial has several limitations. A more rigorous study design would have included an attention-equivalent control group. Some patients' therapeutic gains may have resulted from enrollment in a clinical trial, interactions with supportive research staff, and weekly sessions with caring mental health professionals (i.e., common factors) independent of the psychotherapy. Thus this design precludes attributing gains specifically to IPT, as opposed to other psychotherapies. Approximately 20% of patients attended self-help groups in the past month and many had been working with practitioners from a variety of helping professions. Some gains reported by patients may be attributable to outside services unrelated to tele-IPT. All data were collected through self-report methodologies; no data were collected through chart reviews or electronic medical records (e.g., data to verify patients' HIV-seropositive status). No data were collected to assess patients' virologic responses to tele-IPT (e.g., reductions in HIV viral loads). Tele-IPT therapists received relatively little structured training in tele-IPT and relied almost exclusively on manuals for teletherapy administration. This may have yielded an underestimate of the true potency of tele-IPT. A more rigorous and quantifiable assessment of fidelity to intervention protocol would have also strengthened the study. Finally, several rural urban continuum codes contained relatively few patients. Comparisons of depressive symptoms, social support, and therapy session attendance across these codes were likely under-powered. Despite these limitations, this study had numerous strengths. These included considerable geographic diversity in the sample (patients enrolled from 28 states), a high rate of assessment follow-up at post-intervention (86%) in a group that is oftentimes difficult to track and retain, and the inclusion of many patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders and/or alcohol and substance use disorders, all of which increase the study's external validity. Additionally, this study used multiple intervention-outcome data analytic approaches, with all findings converging on tele-IPT's acute depression treatment efficacy for this group, reducing the likelihood that significant intervention effects were an artifact of a single data analytic approach."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Telephone-administered IPT provides clinically-meaningful acute reductions in depressive symptoms and interpersonal problems in rural PLWHA. Tele-IPT is also a highly acceptable form of treatment, with 4 out of 5 tele-IPT patients participating in all nine teletherapy sessions. Future analyses will assess the long-term efficacy of tele-IPT to reduce depressive symptoms in rural PLWHA and identify potential mediators and moderators of tele-IPT for depression treatment in this clinical population. Conclusions regarding the efficacy of tele-IPT for depressed HIV-infected rural persons should be reserved until findings from longterm intervention outcome analyses are available. If tele-IPT provides acute and long-term depressive symptom relief in rural PLWHA, this manualized treatment can be offered by community-based rural practitioners who treat large numbers of rural PLWHA.
