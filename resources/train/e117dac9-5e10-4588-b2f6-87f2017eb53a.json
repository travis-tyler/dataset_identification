Primary productivity in grasslands and nutrient and energy fluxes in tropical rainforests may depend more on the functional role of species than on species richness, and the composition of species in functional groups may be more important to the resilience of ecological processes and functions than the number of functional groups (Silver et al. 1996;Hooper & Vitousek 1997). Functional groups pertain to biological diversity at the species level, which is useful because species have been the focus of study for many decades. As a result, the causes, patterns, and consequences of changes in species composition are relatively well known compared with other organizational levels of diversity (Chapin et al. 2000). Ecological functions are performed by vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant species in an ecosystem, and the nonrandom pattern of their distribution within and across the scales of an ecosystem is thought to contribute to ecological resilience (Peterson et al. 1998;Wardwell et al. 2008). We define scale as the geographic extent over which a process operates and the frequency with which a process occurs. Ecological resilience is a measure of a system's ability to remain organized around a particular set of mutually reinforcing processes and structures (Holling 1973), known as a regime. For example, reefs are maintained in a hard-coral regime by the grazing of a few functional groups of herbivorous fishes (Bellwood et al. 2004). The intensive harvest of herbivorous fishes in Caribbean reefs led to increases in the abundance of sea urchins, which became the primary grazers. When extensive hurricane damage in 1980 was followed by a disease outbreak that greatly reduced the number of sea urchins, the reefs shifted to a macroalgae-dominated regime, which largely persists today (Hughes 1994;Mumby et al. 2007). Alternative stable states, also known as regimes, have been documented in a wide variety of ecosystems (Folke et al. 2004), and a given regime may be less desirable if it provides fewer goods and services to humans. Coral reefs dominated by fleshy brown macroalgae have lower species richness and support lower levels of fishing and tourism than systems dominated by hard coral (Moberg & Folke 1999). Intensive livestock grazing in Patagonia led to a transition from grasslands to shrublands, which increased evaporation and loss of water through deep drainage and decreased transpiration (Aguiar et al. 1996). Hysteresis can make it difficult for a system to shift back to its more desirable state (Scheffer et al. 1993). Hysteresis occurs when the restoration of the environmental conditions present before the regime shift is insufficient to restore the system to its previous state. The variability of responses to environmental changes by species within a functional group (i.e., functionalresponse diversity) is thought necessary for resilience (Elmqvist et al. 2003;Chillo et al. 2011) because in ecosystems changing as a result of natural and human disturbance, ecological functions can be maintained despite the loss or decline of dominant species by functionally equivalent species that are less abundant (Walker et al. 1999;Chillo et al. 2011). However, as species within an ecosystem are extirpated or their abundances are greatly reduced, the diversity of ecological functions and of functional responses to disturbance is likely to decrease. In addition to the diversity of functional responses, the distribution of functions within and across the scales of an ecosystem is thought to be a critical component of resilience (Peterson et al. 1998;Allen et al. 2005). If this is the case, then an assessment of resilience via the crossscale distribution of function may affect prioritization of species for conservation. Species that are charismatic, rare, or at greatest risk of extirpation or extinction may not contribute the most to ecological resilience. Allen et al. (2005) proposed measures of resilience at multiple scales that are an extension of the cross-scale resilience model (Peterson et al. 1998). To use these measures in an assessment of resilience, one must identify the aggregations and discontinuities in the distribution of body masses and quantify the functions provided by those species. Ecological systems are structured by a few key processes that occur at distinct spatial extents and temporal frequencies, and these processes generate discontinuities in the spatial and temporal structure of landscapes and in the distribution of morphological features of species (Holling 1992). Ecological structure and resources are not distributed along continuous gradients; rather, they are characterized by domains of scale over which their distributions either do not change or change monotonically (Wiens 1989). Scale domains are separated by relatively nonlinear transitions from one set of dominant processes to another. Species interact with the environment as a function of their size (Woodward et al. 2005), so the pattern of scale domains and discontinuities in the physical environment ought to be reflected in animal body-mass distributions. Animal body-mass distributions consist of aggregations of similarly sized species that reflect a scale domain and gaps, or discontinuities, that reflect a transition to a new set of structuring processes (Holling 1992;Allen 2006;Fischer et al. 2008) (Table 1). It is possible that mechanisms of community assembly result in the partitioning of functions across scale domains to reduce competition among species and allow the coexistence of species that use similar resources (Peterson et al. 1998;Leyequien et al. 2007). If this is the case, a diversity of functions within an aggregation and a redundancy of functions across aggregations would increase ecological resilience because the loss of function in one aggregation would be compensated by one or more species from the same functional group that occurs within a different aggregation (Wardwell et al. 2008). We analyzed the cross-scale resilience of a grassland avian community. We used 3 measures of cross-scale resilience, overall number of functional groups, number of functional groups within a body-size aggregation, and the redundancy of functional groups across aggregations, and tested the hypothesis that the local extinction of species is nonrandom with respect to the retention of functions. Birds are clearly not the only taxonomic group that contributes to the resilience of grassland ecosystems, but they are useful subjects of analyses because data sets on birds are large and the information available regarding their presence and absence, diet, and foraging habits is of high quality."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The dry mixed grassland of southeastern Alberta (Canada) is one of the largest and most intact native grasslands remaining in the United States and Canada, where grasslands are one of the most threatened ecosystems (Samson & Knopf 1994). Declines in grassland bird populations have been steeper and more widespread than those of any other avian guild in any other ecosystem in the United States and Canada (Vickery et al. 1999;Blancher 2003;Sauer et al. 2007). Eight-five percent of the species of birds designated as threatened by the government of Alberta occur in The Grassland Natural Region, of which the dry mixed grassland is 1 of 4 ecologically distinct subregions (Alberta Environment 2010) of Alberta. Of the roughly 5 million ha of dry mixed grassland, 54% is native grassland (defined as quarter sections [approximately 65 ha] with \u226575% native vegetation) (Prairie Conservation Forum 2008). Over 90% of the dry mixed grassland in Alberta is managed for livestock grazing and extensive agriculture. Grazing occurs on about 55% of the area, dry-land crops on about 35%, and irrigated crops on about 10% (Downing & Pettapiece 2006). Hay is the primary dry-land crop, and it provides habitat for some grassland bird species. Grazing maintains the dry mixed grassland, and its positive and negative effects are more a function of grazing location, timing, and intensity than herbivory itself. Oil and gas exploration and extraction are manifest in extensive roads, well heads, and pipelines throughout the region. The number of natural gas wells drilled annually in Alberta increased 8-fold between 1990 and 2005, and the linear distance of natural gas pipeline increased roughly 4-fold (Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers 2008). The bulk of this development has occurred within the dry mixed grassland. In the future, the area of intensive agriculture may increase on lands currently used for extensive agriculture and oil, gas, and urban development may increase. Historic drivers that shaped the dry mixed grassland were drought, grazing, and fire. Drought, rather than fire, is the primary driver maintaining the dry mixed grassland because it occurs more frequently than fire, inhibits expansion of woody shrubs, and prevents an accumulation of fuel that would maintain a frequent fire regime (Sala et al. 1996;Madden et al. 1999). Historical records suggest fire frequency in dry mixed grassland was 5-30 years,  1966(Sauer et al. 2007 whereas it was 5-10 years in mixed-grass land (Madden et al. 1999;Truett 2003). In the past, bison (Bison bison) and other ungulates, such as pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), grazed the region, and to a certain extent bison grazing has been replaced by cattle grazing. Because there are substantial differences in the ecological roles of bison and cattle, the ability of cattle to functionally replace bison remains uncertain. We compiled a list of breeding birds that occur in the dry mixed-grass land from Alberta government data (Banasch & Samuel 1998;Dale et al. 1999;Knapton et al. 2005;Gutsell et al. 2005aGutsell et al. , 2005b, the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) (Sauer et al. 2007), the Audubon Christmas Bird Count (National Audubon Society 1983-2005, the Royal Alberta Museum, and the Federation of Alberta Naturalists (Penner, personal communication). We assigned each species to a functional group (Table 1) on the basis of its dietary strategy and foraging strategy (Poole 2006). We defined dietary strategies--carnivore, herbivore, invertivore, and omnivore-on the basis of the type of food items eaten during the breeding season. A species was considered an omnivore if its diet included a minimum of 30% of both plants and animals. Foraging strategies were aerial; arboreal or foliage; aquatic; bark; and terrestrial. Our categories are coarse, but match the generality of the ecological questions we addressed. We identified the scale domains at which species are distributed by rank ordering species by their log body mass and analyzing whether body-mass distributions were discontinuous. We calculated body mass by averaging adult male and female body-mass data from the Royal Alberta Museum specimen database. If the sample size from the museum was <30, we used data from published studies conducted in similar ecosystems in the United States and Canada. It is recommended that several statistical methods be used to identify discontinuities in body-mass distributions and then that one assess whether the results converge (Stow et al. 2007). We used the analytical methods of Bayesian classification and regression tree (BCART) (Breiman et al. 1984) and the gap rarity index (Restrepo et al. 1997). We used 3 measures of cross-scale resilience: number of functional groups; number of functional groups within each body-mass aggregation; and number of body-mass aggregations in which each functional group is present (Allen et al. 2005). We calculated values for all 3 measures for the complete data set (101 species). Then we removed all threatened species (25) from the data set to simulate their extirpation from the system and recalculated values for the 3 measures. We categorized species as secure or threatened. Species were categorized as threatened if either the provincial or federal government listed a species as endangered or threatened or if BBS data for Alberta showed a significant (p < 0.05) (Sauer et al. 2007), decline in abundance from ) (15 species). A threatened categorization reflected probability of regional extirpation, not global extinction. We also used BBS trend data to categorize species as threatened because governmental endangered species listings can be controversial and affected by political considerations. The BBS data alone were not considered adequate for categorization because surveys are conducted along roadsides and likely underdetect wary and wetland birds, birds with small populations, or birds with habitats that occur primarily away from roads (Sauer et al. 2007). We compared the observed loss of threatened species with simulated random loss to determine whether species extinctions were nonrandom with respect to the retention of function. Random loss of species was simulated in a Monte Carlo process in Matlab (5000 iterations). We fixed the number of aggregations and the number of species in each aggregation to be equivalent to the number of aggregations and species in the observed data, but the selection of which 25 species were removed was randomized. We calculated values of the 3 measures for each iteration and then created a distribution of values for each measure. We ranked our observed results within the random distributions generated by the Monte Carlo simulations. The ranking of the observed data within the distributions generated by the simulation provided a probability that the observed results were the result of a random process. We further used this probability to determine whether each observed result was in the lower or upper half of the random distribution. We applied a binomial test to determine whether the preponderance of our within-and across-aggregation functional-group observations were randomly or nonrandomly distributed within the Monte Carlo simulations."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The breeding bird community of the dry mixed grassland consisted of 101 species from 15 functional groups and included wetland songbirds and waders. We did not include 33 deepwater species in our analyses because they have different body-mass distributions than terrestrial species and the mechanisms driving aquatic body masses are not well understood (Holling 1992). There were 8 body-mass aggregations ( Table 1). The number of functional groups represented within each aggregation ranged from 3 to 9. The aggregations of smaller-bodied birds included more species and functional groups. The aggregations of larger-bodied species had substantially fewer species and fewer functional groups. The redundancy of function across aggregations was phylogenetically constrained. For example, there were no small aerial carnivores or aquatic carnivores, and there were no large aerial invertivores or arboreal invertivores. Of the 15 functional groups, 3 occurred in 6 aggregations, 5 functional groups had one representative and occurred in only one aggregation, and the remaining 7 functional groups occurred in 3-4 aggregations. The distribution of functions after removing the 25 threatened species from the data set suggested that the distribution of function within and across aggregations was highly conserved despite the high number of potential extinctions because the 3 measures of resilience were relatively unchanged. Overall number of functional groups was reduced from 15 to 14 due to the extinction of the Sora (Porzana carolina), the sole aquatic herbivore.  phus]), but despite the loss of 7 species, 5 of the 8 functional groups in the aggregation remained. The redundancy of functional groups across aggregations was also strongly retained, despite the extinction of 25% of species. Only 1 functional group (aquatic herbivore) was extirpated entirely, although 5 functional groups had only 1 representative initially. The functional group terrestrial herbivores had the greatest reduction in representation across aggregations, from 6 to 3. Values of the 3 measures of function did not change substantially in response to extinctions of 25% of the species. For example, 7 of 8 functional groups remained in aggregation 1, aggregation 2 retained 6 of 6 functional groups, and 8 of 9 functional groups remained in aggregation 3. Although the overall distribution of function within and across the aggregations did not change substantially, despite the extinctions, resilience was reduced because the number of species that represented a functional group within an aggregation was greatly reduced. For example, when we counted the number of species per functional group per aggregation, 58% of the time a functional group within an aggregation was represented by one species. Aggregation 5 had 6 functional groups before and after the threatened species were removed. However, 5 of those functional groups were represented by only one species following extinctions. Further losses in that aggregation would result in reduced functional diversity at that aggregation and in a reduced redundancy of function across aggregations. Given the uncertainty associated with response diversity within functional groups, we suggest a particular body-mass aggregation may not be resilient to disturbances when there are \u22642 species per functional group. Disturbances are often scale specific, and although functionally similar species in different aggregations can theoretically compensate for the loss of function in another aggregation, morphologically imposed foraging constraints can prevent true replacement. Therefore, we once again counted the number of species per functional group per aggregation, but this time calculated the number of times 1 or 2 species remained as the sole representatives of a functional group within that aggregation. Seventy-four percent of the time a functional group within an aggregation was represented by only 1 or 2 species following extinctions, and 80% of the time the redundancy of function across aggregations was reduced to 1 or 2 species. The fact that any additional bird extinctions have a high probability of eliminating a functional group within a particular scale domain indicates the resilience of the grassland, as represented by the distribution pattern of the breeding birds, may have been reduced. Of the 3 measures, number of functional groups was the least affected by future extinctions. Ten of the 15 functional groups had 3 or more species remaining, so future extinctions would initially have a smaller effect on number of functional groups than they would on the other 2 measures of resilience. We also compared the observed distribution of function remaining after the extinction of the threatened species with the 5000 simulations of the null model of random species removals. The comparison of observed and expected results for the within-aggregation functional diversity showed that 5 of 8 aggregations retained a greater number of functional groups than expected (binomial p = 0.22). Ten of the 15 functional groups were represented in more aggregations than expected (binomial p = 0.09) ( Table 2). The probability of the observed results for all 3 measures of functionality was 0.08. The distribution of function within and across scales was retained at higher than expected values and was consistent with the hypothesis that species extinctions are nonrandom."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that functions are distributed in a manner expected to contribute to resilience and that this distribution pattern is maintained even with the extinction of species. This distribution pattern is explained in part by phylogeny. Macroevolutionary processes affect which species are available to colonize a particular ecosystem, but mesoscale processes of niche exploitation and competition drive the observed pattern of functional distribution within and across the scales in an ecosystem (Allen et al. 2006). The observed pattern of extinction of 25 species compared with the random removal of 25 species also suggests that species' extinctions are nonrandom because the cross-scale distribution of function remained intact, especially compared with the distribution of function following random extinction. Although the results of a variety of studies show species extinctions are nonrandom with respect to Table 2. Ranking (i.e., upper or lower half of the distribution resulting from the output of 5000 iterations of a Monte Carlo simulation) of observed number of functional groups, number of functional groups within each body-mass aggregation, and number of body-mass aggregations in which a functional group is present for birds associated with the dry mixed grassland in Alberta (Canada)."}, {"section_title": "Resilience metric", "text": "Ranking phylogeny (von Euler 2001;Rezende et al. 2007), communities with and without compensatory mechanisms (Kremen 2005), and the order of extinctions (Larsen et al. 2005), we are the first to demonstrate that the distribution of functions within and across scales may contribute to a nonrandom extinction process. We hypothesized that the extinction of one species within a functional group may reduce competition among other species with similar diets and foraging strategies and increase their ability to survive future disturbances. Results of studies of food-web networks suggest that nonrandom extinctions can allow communities to retain resilience to disturbances because surviving species will have greater average resilience as the number of their competitors decreases (Ives & Cardinale 2004). In our study, threatened species accounted for 25% of the number of bird species, yet even with their hypothetical loss the ecosystem retained almost complete functionality on the basis of the 3 cross-scale resilience measures. However, the loss of species decreases diversity of responses to disturbance, cross-scale redundancy of function, and within-scale diversity of function and may compromise resilience. Should the threatened species become extinct, the grassland would be at a threshold at which the loss of virtually any additional species would result in a reduction in functional diversity within scales and in functional redundancy across scales. Peterson et al. (1998) suggest that functions will be more diverse within a body-size aggregation and more evenly distributed across aggregations as a result of community assembly mechanisms that partition species that forage on similar resources (analogous here to providing similar functions). The consequence of this distribution is a more stable provision of functions in the face of disturbances and losses of species within particular aggregations. Relatively intact systems, such as our study area, can support high levels of losses without a substantial reduction in function. However, the loss of entire functional groups can decrease grassland resilience to colonization by non-native species (Zavaleta & Hulvey 2004). The dry mixed-grass land is considered relatively intact in part because there has been little outright loss due to urbanization. Although the spatial and temporal pattern of disturbance processes has changed over the last century, ranchers are encouraged to graze their cattle in a heterogeneous pattern to mimic bison grazing patterns, and fires, although infrequent, are not always easily suppressed despite fire suppression being standard practice (T. Kupchenko, personal communication). Insofar as extinctions and successful colonization by nonnative species reflect the degree of habitat change in a landscape, among avian species only the Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) and Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) have become extinct since precolonial times, and only 5 species have established breeding populations: House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Rock Pigeon (Columbia livia), Gray Partridge (Perdix perdix), and Ring-necked Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). Most agriculture is extensive, so gross grassland characteristics remain, despite the loss of some native species to non-native grasses. In the dry mixed grassland, the extinction of avian species would directly reduce the distribution of function within and across aggregations, and insofar as birds play a functional role in maintaining the dominance of grasses, the loss of further species could increase the probability of a regime shift. This is analogous to foodweb studies in which stability decreases as the number of links (species) decreases (Dunne et al. 2002). Food webs have thresholds of node loss beyond which the network can collapse (Dunne et al. 2002). Although bison and other species may have historically been stronger drivers of plant structure and composition in the dry mixed grassland than birds, the fact that the grassland has persisted despite the extinction or decreased abundance of some species suggests that other species have compensated functionally. There are some weaknesses to our methods. Current strategies for categorizing species into functional groups are unsatisfactory because it would be difficult to explicitly link a functional group to ecosystem processes. It is challenging to develop functional categories appropriate to the scale and goals of a study. We included within our study assemblage all native breeding birds in the grassland, including grassland obligates and species that breed in riparian shrubs and trees, cliffs, sand dunes, and other features common to the ecosystem. Thus, although species may belong to the same functional group and be in different body-mass aggregations, the degree to which one species can functionally compensate for another may be restricted by the ecological niche it occupies within the grassland. Also, the grassland breeding birds are only part of the plant and animal assemblage that contributes to the processes and functions of the grassland, and the extinction of a bird species will affect and be affected by the other biotic and abiotic elements with which it interacts. Maintaining within-scale functional diversity and crossscale functional redundancy is a hedge against the uncertainty and unpredictability inherent in nonlinear complex systems with multiple alternative regimes (Scheffer & Carpenter 2003;Kinzig et al. 2006). Resilience, as quantified by the distribution of functions, could be a tool for objectively assessing species' ecological importance if the focus is system behavior and persistence. We believe stronger empirical links need to be made between functional classifications and ecosystem processes. However, until the complex dynamics governing nonlinear shifts in ecosystem structure and processes are better understood, maintaining functional diversity within and across scales may prevent transitions to alternative regimes."}]
