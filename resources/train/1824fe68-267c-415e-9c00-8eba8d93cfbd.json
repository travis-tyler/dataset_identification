Globally, the thermal expansion of water, melting of the Earth's cryosphere, and long term variations in the spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges are the primary controls on rates of sea level rise. Regional and finer scale processes such as ocean circulation, interannual climate variations, and vertical land movement (VLM) further impact the relative elevation of the sea surface to the coastline (Milne et al., 2009;Mote et al., 2008;NRC, 2012;Stammer et al., 2013 1900-2008(NRC, 2012. These noted differences in the rate of SLR are primarily attributed to differences in VLM across Washington"}, {"section_title": "State.", "text": "Both the isostatic rebound (dynamic response in Earth's crust to the loss of ice mass from the most recent glaciation) and the crustal deformation from the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American Plate, produce local variations in VLM. As tide gauges measure the sea-surface height referenced to a position on land, VLM amplifies or reduces the recorded SLR signal, generating the differing trends observed in Washington State (Mote et al., 2008). In the Salish Sea (Figure 1) 0.3 m to 1.82 m of SLR is anticipated by the end of the 21 st century (Mote et al., 2008;NRC, 2012;Miller et al., 2018), the timing of which will be primarily controlled by anthropogenic inputs of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. Assessing the total risk to SLR across the Salish Sea requires knowledge of the spatial variability in processes that affect total water level and highlights the need for improved predictions of the wave climate and its influence on total water level (Mote et al., 2008;Church et al., 2013;Kopp et al., 2014;IPCC, 2014;NRC, 2012). Sea level rise in the Salish Sea poses a serious threat to coastal lands, sensitive ecosystems for salmon and shellfish, industry, and infrastructure important to human well-being (NRC, 2012;Mote et al., 2014). SLR in Washington State is expected to increase the frequency of extreme total water level (TWL) events exceeding contemporary flood elevations (Church et al., 2013;Tebaldi et al., 2012). Already, extreme weather events are damaging coastal lands and infrastructure such as the December 10 th through December 24 th storms of 2018, prompting federal aid and a disaster declaration by FEMA for Jefferson, Island, Snohomish, and Whatcom counties (FEMA, 2019). By the year 2040, Washington State is projected to spend 24 billion dollars in mitigation costs from moderate amounts of SLR (LeRoy and Wiles, 2019) and this number is projected to increase through the end of the century. Additionally, ~ 4,020 kilometers of shoreline in Puget Sound are expected to have a geomorphic response to future higher water levels that in turn will impact the hydrodynamics (waves and currents) and compound the complexity of forecasting future coastal adjustment (NRC, 2012). Ultimately, the Salish Sea will experience a landward migration of coastlines, where they are unconstrained, generating costly problems such as an increase in coastal erosion, wetland loss, flooding, and saltwater intrusion to coastal aquifers (Mote et al., 2014;NRC 2012;Ranasinghe et al., 2012). To fully assess future risk along the coast, the dynamic component of waves must be included and quantitative estimates of the extent and frequency of future disturbance events along the coast are needed. Wave observations provide historic context and real time information that help define the local or regional wave climate. While offshore wave observations for the continental United States are plentiful, inside the Salish Sea, long term and reliable wave data are sparse. United States controlled waters host a single wave buoy (NDBC Hein Bank Buoy #46088 while Environment Canada maintains two in the Strait of Georgia (buoys are shown in Figure 2). With only three wave buoys in the Salish Sea, all residing in the largest basins (Strait of Juan de Fuca & Strait of Georgia; Figure 1), there is a limited understanding of the wave climate in the narrower fjordal basins that make up Puget Sound. Without observational data, models provide first-order estimates of wave conditions needed to predict impacts in the coastal zone (Herdman et al., 2018;Hope et al., 2013). Engineering groups, academic researchers, and government agencies in Puget Sound use numerical models to provide initial estimates on extreme water levels (e.g., Finlayson, 2006;FEMA, 2016). Model results aid in improving and planning for the safety and sustainability of coastal communities, and provide important guidance to local projects in ecosystem protection and restoration strategies (e.g., Puget Sound Partnership, Action Agenda). Few studies have attempted to model waves and wave run-up in Puget Sound (NHC, 2005;FEMA, 2016;Finlayson, 2006) and their scope was limited to the scale of individual counties or site specific projects. Often, these assessments varied in approach, making comparisons of vulnerability to storms and waves across the state difficult. Employing large, high-resolution models requires significant computing resources needed to simulate waves on spatial scales relevant to coastal planners (FEMA, 2016). While previous studies provided the context necessary for designating coastal flood zones and assessing impacts on a site-specific basis, they lacked future context; Puget Sound has yet to have a systematic evaluation of the temporal and spatial variability in the historic wave climate with projected changes into the future. I performed this level of assessment as part of the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Regional Resiliency Grant titled Washington Coastal Resilience Project (WCRP) and to support implementation of the USGS regional Puget Sound Coastal Storm Modeling System (PS-CoSMoS). The WCRP aims to increase the knowledge surrounding coastal vulnerability throughout Puget Sound and evaluate opportunities to enhance policy needed to achieve regional resilience under projected changes in the coastal climate. My work addressed two main goals of the WCRP grant: 1) improve the understanding of coastal hazards stemming from storm surge and waves, 2) enhance resiliency in coastal communities through pilot studies. The modeling developed for this effort also helped advance the regional wave model and demonstrated the high resolution dynamic wave runup modeling of the USGS PS-CoSMoS program. Using phase-averaged region-scale numerical wave models and local hydrodynamic numerical models, I simulated wind-wave generation, wave run-up, and subsequent flooding in the Salish Sea. To reduce computational costs, I built a look-up-table (LUT) of wave parameters across the Salish Sea to relate wind speed, wind direction, and water level, to wave parameters (e.g., significant wave height, peak period, wave direction). The LUT was sampled with a "}, {"section_title": "Setting", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Puget Sound Coastal Landscape", "text": "The dynamic advance and retreat of glacial ice during the last glacial maximum of the Pleistocene (~15,000 year ago) carved the deep troughs which make up modern day Puget Sound and the northern straits (Booth, 1994;Finlayson, 2006;Johannessen and MacLennan, 2007). Glacial erosion and deposition provided much of the source material for modern beaches in Puget Sound. Within the steep walls of the U-shaped troughs, wave-cut platforms provided the narrow space for modern beaches to form, backed by steep coastal bluffs, rich in glacial outwash, glacial till, and glaciomarine sediment. These dynamic bluffs, often termed 'feeder bluffs' provide necessary sediment to the local beaches, perpetuating the livelihood of mixed sediment beaches, a common shore type in Puget Sound, consisting of coarse sands and gravels (Finalyson, 2006;Johannessen and MacLennan, 2007). Elsewhere, rocky shorelines, large river deltas, and spit and lagoons systems, make up the complex shorelines of Puget Sound (Johannessen and MacLennan, 2007). For the purpose of this study, the term Puget Sound refers to all of the inland waters of Washington State restricted by the international boundary with Canada and extending to the western end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca (Figure 2)."}, {"section_title": "Drivers of Coastal Flooding", "text": "In the Salish Sea, flooding on the coast is a direct result of high water levels and waves. As the Salish Sea is separated from the Pacific Ocean, outside of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, all wave energy in the region is directly linked to local winds. The macrotidal nature (tidal range of 3-4 meters) of the Salish Sea is the main influence on static water levels with winds and waves influencing the dynamic side of coastal flooding (Figure 3). Weather systems carrying low pressure centers are commonly the catalyst for extreme wind and waves. The most severe being Extra Tropical Cyclones that make landfall on coastal Washington State and Southwest British Columbia (Mass and Dotson, 2010; Read, 2015). These strong mid-latitude cyclones produce low-pressure centers in the range of 955 to 980 millibars and generate extreme wind conditions in the Salish Sea. As the front of the storm moves from the ocean to land, wind speeds increase due to a change in orientation of the isobars surrounding the low-pressure center. The highest wind speeds are observed south of the low-pressure center in a region called the bent-back trough, where wind directions shift with the isobars to be more southerly (Mass and Dotson, 2010). As the atmospheric pressure fluctuates with these storms, there is a direct response by the water in the Salish Sea depending on the nature of the change. Lower ambient pressure allows for expansion of the water body resulting in increased sea surface heights-often called storm surge, and is a major component of the non-tidal residual in a tidal record. For this region, storm surge of 30-50 centimeters is common with the major storms, raising the static sea level and facilitating a greater likelihood of flooding. Coincident with changes in pressure are high wind events where the dominant wind directions generally follow the orientation of the major basins (South to North; Phillips, 1968;Overland and Walter, 1963;Finlayson, 2006). During strong wind storms (such as Extra Tropical Cyclones), shorelines facing south are more exposed to the combination of high water (dependent on tide and storm surge) and large waves as they are facing the dominant direction of energy. Infrequently, high magnitude winds from the north are accompanied by higher atmospheric pressure. Throughout such an event, shorelines oriented towards the north are susceptible to wave impacts accompanied by low to negative storm surge. A graphical representation of the various dynamic and static components that influence the total water level elevation on the coast can be found in Figure 3 Table) of wave parameters at each location using wave model output. 6. Using the spatial masks from step 3, I extracted the correct WRF weather point and NOAA tide gauge to provide concurrent time series of wind speeds, directions, and water levels to interpolate through each LUT and generate hindcasts of wave parameters. 7. Developed hindcasts of wave parameters for SLR scenarios of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.91 m by adding these values to each water level time series prior to sampling the LUT.

Here however, currents are not considered as this detail was outside the scope of this project. The spectral action balance equation describes wave generation, propagation, and dissipation (SWAN Team, 2019a;Booij et al., 1999), where the first term represents local changes, the second and third term propagation, and the fourth and fifth terms changes in frequency and direction by current interaction and changes in depth.

A major assumption when invoking stationary SWAN is that waves are able to grow and propagate instantaneously across the domain, and responses in the wave field to changes in the forcings (e.g., wind speed and direction) are also instantaneous. When dealing with smaller domains, such as the fjordal basins of southern Puget Sound, these assumptions can be valid where fetchlimited wave growth dominates and wave propagation across the domain is faster than changes in the wind or tidal forcing. However, for modeling large areas exceeding 100 square kilometers such as the Strait of Georgia, (SWAN Team, 2019b) non-stationary SWAN is recommended (see Rogers et al., 2006 for more information). SWAN employs third generation dissipation physics following Cavaleri and Malanotte-Rizzoli (1981) and the equations of Komen et al. (1984) for modeling wind-wave generation. Dissipation due to whitecapping was modeled according to Komen et al. (1984) and nonlinear quadruplet wave interactions were approximated using the discrete interaction approximation developed by Hasselman et al. (1985). Depth-induced breaking was included by using the bore model of Battjes and Janssen (1978) because spectral modeling in shallow water when waves begin to shoal and break is difficult and not well constrained. Influences of bottom friction on energy dissipation were also included, using a coefficient of friction (0.038) derived from the Joint North Sea Wave Project experiments of Hasselmann et al. (1973). Triad wave-wave interactions, important in shallow settings for transferring energy from lower frequencies to higher frequencies, were invoked using the default SWAN settings and the lumped triad approximation.

Wave hindcasts built using the observational bias corrected winds to sample the LUT increased the maximum significant wave heights and peak period (Table 1) compared to uncorrected WRF data. Without wave observations it is unclear if bias correcting improved the wave models skill, however, it is assumed that improved boundary forcing, i.e., wind, will yield more accurate wave predictions. Where observations are available, a quantile bias correction of WRF model grid points is ideal, however, few research quality weather stations exist in the Puget Sound. A majority of the observations have data coverage less than 30 years (generally needed to establish a climatology) with numerous data gaps and coarse resolution (e.g., 15-deg direction and 1 m/s binning). Lacking long term and quality historical meteorological data proximal to water, applying an observation derived quantile bias correction was not realistic region-wide.

Spatial masks were created with Google Earth to segment the Salish Sea and guided which forcing point was to be used when sampling the LUT at each 50 m point along the -10 m NAVD88 contour. Figure 9 shows the WRF model points used and the segments of coastline and fetch they represent. Special care was taken when building each spatial mask to limit WRF coverage of shorelines to those which would most realistically experience winds characterized by a WRF point. For example, Figure 10 shows a comparison of the wind speeds and directions for the two closest WRF points to the north shore of Orcas Island (orange area in Figure 10). The two points are separated by the island itself and the southern point, isolated in a bay and separated from the north shore, has lower magnitude wind speeds and a lower occurrence of northerly wind. Along the north shore, the wind and resulting wave conditions would be better represented by the WRF water points to the north as they are more characteristic of the winds coming down the Strait of Georgia. Invoking a mask system which followed the orographic confines of an area, ensured the appropriate meteorological and water level time series were chosen for all locations in the Salish Sea. At each 50-meter point along the -10 meter NAVD88 depth contour, the appropriate WRF point and NOAA tide gauge interpolated through the LUT and populated a time series of hourly wave parameters. The final product being concurrent time series of winds, water levels, and waves across the entire region. Limited by wave observations, the skill of the LUT was compared to the three wave buoys Hein Bank, Sentry Shoal, and Halibut Bank (Figure 2). At each wave buoy location, wave hindcasts were built using the closest and most representative WRF model point and NOAA tide gauge from the nearest SWAN model grid point. The LUT only provided bulk parameters such as wave height rather than spectral data so comparisons were carried out on bulk parameters only. Changes to wave parameters were assessed by resampling the LUT with water level time series that had been incremented by 0.3, 0.6, and 0.91 m. Due to the high uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and timing of SLR in Washington State (Mote et al., 2008;NRC, 2012;Miller et al., 2018), uniform values were chosen instead of specific projections from the many reports.

Stockdon has been tested and calibrated on open coast sandy beaches exposed to long period ocean waves, a different environment than the Salish Sea (Allan et al., 2015;Stockdon et al., 2006). TAW is recommended for situations of wave runup on coastal structures (barriers or steep coastal dunes) due to reduction factors from wave angle of attack, offshore berms, various bed roughness parameters and the ability to handle a wide range of wave conditions (Allan et al., 2015;NHC, 2005). Ruston Way's shoreline is heavily armored with riprap and other revetments ( Figure 12) and only exposed to wind-waves which indicated a better classification with the TAW runup model in place of Stockdon. The TAW equation, equations 2a and 2b in Appendix A, from Meer (2002) were used to estimate the 2% wave runup elevation from time series of wave heights, periods, and water levels. The spectral period (T m\u22121.0 ) is recommended over the peak period in Equations 2a and 2b and was estimated using Equation 6 in Appendix A. The wave height at the toe of the engineered structure (riprap along Ruston Way), referred to as the spectral wave height (H mo ), is required to calculate wave runup. In order to estimate the spectral wave height, Meer (2002) suggests a wave model such as SWAN provide all of the necessary spectral data. Lacking this type of model output with the LUT, Allan (2015) provided an approach to estimate the spectral wave height (Equation 5 in Appendix A). As a check on the spectral wave height estimate (Equation 5), the regional wave model output was shoaled following Equation 7 which calculated the shallow water wave height at the toe of the structure independent of refraction and assuming all wave energy was conserved. Here, the deep water and shallow water wave group velocities were first calculated and defined the shoaling factor K s (Equation 8 in Appendix A) which combined with the deep water wave height to estimate the shallow water wave height. The smaller of the two wave heights (shoaled wave height and spectral wave height) was then used with the spectral period to estimate wave runup with TAW (Equations 2a and 2b). Regionally, the TAW runup model (Equations 2a and 2b) was applied on an idealized shoreline with a uniform slope (0.  A wave direction time series from the LUT allowed for reductions in wave heights from oblique wave angles of attack on the order of 10% (see Van der Meer, 2002 for more information on wave reduction factors). Using extreme value theory (Zervas, 2005;An & Pandey, 2006;Guedes Soares & Scotto, 2004) and the r th largest methodology (Vitousek et al., 2017) generalized extreme value probability distribution functions (PDF) were generated for the n-max TWLs each year (n = 5, years = 60) at each transect. An extreme value curve was fit to the PDFs of extreme TWLs which provided estimates on the recurrence of extreme TWL elevations and defined storm types. Extreme water levels corresponding to a 10-yr TWL (10% probability of occurrence in any given year) were examined along Ruston Way. Analysis of entire 60-yr hindcasts of TAW model output revealed a bimodal flood regime for Ruston Way (Figure 27). Here, flooding occurred from two different regimes: (1) high storm surge and low waves and (2) low to negative storm surge and moderate to high waves. From the time series of TWL (SWL + wave runup) at each transect, I identified instances of high water and waves sourced from northerly winds representative of a 10-yr storm event. Given the orientation of Ruston Way, these events (regime 2) will produce larger wave-driven impacts (erosion and high water hazards) for Ruston Way as its shoreline will be protected from strong southerly winds. Having identified impactful storms representative of a 10-yr event, the wave and water level boundary conditions from TAW were extracted and used in hydrodynamic modeling of wave shoaling, breaking, and runup at each transect to estimate flood extent from a dynamic model."}, {"section_title": "Hydrodynamic Wave Runup Modeling", "text": "The Comparisons with the BFE showed exceedance spatially for the two SLR scenarios which highlighted exposed areas and hinted at an increased frequency of flooding in the future."}, {"section_title": "Results & Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Wave height sensitivities", "text": "Wave height is a function of the wind speed, wind duration, water depth, and fetch.

Any predicted temporal variability could be within the uncertainty of the GCM requiring comparisons with other future climate projections to determine if this trend is also predicted as changes in extreme wind speeds would prove important for wave impacts. Average wind directions showed the most change with directional shifts of six degrees or less by 2100 and wind directions associated with higher magnitude wind speeds were predicted to shift a maximum of two degrees into the future across Washington State. Wind rose diagrams ( Figure 13) at eight locations similar to Figure 11 characterized identical wind climatologies for both time periods where average differences in wind direction for speeds greater than 10 m/s were less than 1 degree (0.88 degrees). It remains uncertain to what extent subtle change in wind direction will affect extreme water levels, but shifts of just a few degrees is likely to be important to wave energy, coastal erosion and analyses of sediment mobility as observed elsewhere (Norcross et al., 2002). Depending on how variability in wind directions transpire in the future, modeling can help assess potential corresponding wave impacts. In Puget Sound, the prevailing wind directions (the direction that winds are coming from) are south/southwest during the winter and west/northwest during the summer months with periodic north gales occurring in winter months (Phillips, 1968;Overland and Walter, 1963;Finlayson, 2006). These directions are parallel to the regional orientation of the major fjordal basins which reduce variability in wind direction through topographic funneling during high magnitude events (Overland and Walter, 2918;Schoenberg, 1983 model; spatial coverage of GFDL-ESM2M can be seen in Figure 15). As climate models improve and future products come online that cover more of Washington State spatially and temporally, the assumption of homogeneity into the future can be explored in more detail along with the spatial and temporal variability this MACA downscaled model predicted."}, {"section_title": "Impact of an Observation Derived Quantile Bias Correction", "text": "Modeled wind speeds from the WRF weather model point closest to the Seattle WPOW1 weather station (Blake Island in Figure 6) are underpredicted over the entire wind range with higher magnitude speeds (> 10 m/s) being 8 m/s slower (Figure 7). Distributions of wind speed showed the WRF data has a higher occurrence of lower magnitude wind speeds (4 -7 m/s), a lower occurrence of winds greater than 8 m/s, and a higher percentage of winds from the south/southwest than the observational dataset ( Figure 7). An observation-derived quantile bias correction of model data was used to adjust the WRF predictions at this location and improved the modeled representation of the climatology. Average wave heights calculated with the biascorrected winds at a deep water location west of Seattle WPOW1 increased less than 5 cm, while the maximum wave height increased by 50 cm. The average peak period showed no appreciable change while the maximum peak period at this location increased \u00be of a second (Table 1) "}, {"section_title": "Empirical correction to adjust for higher friction over land", "text": "I adjusted the wind speeds of WRF land points in Hood Canal and southern Puget Sound to more accurately model extreme wave heights associated with flooding and coastal hazards from waves. Owing to spatial coarseness (12-km), many WRF model grid points located over water were in fact classified as \"land.\" Wind speeds of these grid points were examined and found on average to be 1.3 times less than nearby over-water points (Figure 8). This difference scaled with higher magnitudes such that at winds speeds of 20 m/s, land points were on average 7 m/s slower than over water points. When applied, the empirical correction to wind speeds increased the maximum wave height from the LUT 25 cm and 0.6 seconds for the peak period at open water settings north of Ruston Way in Tacoma (Figure 2; Figure 8). In Puget Sound, average wind conditions are lower in energy (< 5 m/s; Finlayson, 2006) and were more frequent in the WRF model ( Figure 7). The higher frictional coefficient of WRF land points had little effect on modeled wave heights for the average conditions (lower wind speeds) while the need to adjust over-water land points was apparent when modeling higher magnitude wind conditions. Providing an empirical bias correction adjusted the wind speeds of over-water land points to better represent over-water conditions, which should provide a more accurate prediction of wave heights from the LUT."}, {"section_title": "LUT Validation at Hein Bank, Sentry Shoal & Halibut Bank", "text": "The skill of the LUT was evaluated at the Hein Bank, Halibut Bank, and Sentry Shoal wave buoys (Figure 2).

In southern Puget Sound the dominant directions of wave energy were north/south with locations closer to and in the SJDF having a third component of wave energy from the west. The average annual maximum wave height across Puget Sound (Figure 19) quantified the potential exposure to waves each year but failed to identify specific locations where waves could be impactful. On a sub-basin scale, the average amount of hours each year where waves were predicted to exceed 0.5 m highlighted stretches of coast with a greater exposure to wave driven hazards and processes (e.g., erosion, longshore currents; Figures 20-24). Wave runup on a simplified shoreline further identified areas where waves should play a role in influencing TWL and driving flooding and erosion ( Figure 28). In south central Puget Sound (Figure 22), south facing shorelines were predicted to see ~400 more hours each year of wind-waves exceeding 0.5 meters with distinct changes in exposure apparent at inflection points in shoreline orientation. Elsewhere in Puget Sound, this spatial trend was prevalent with shorelines in the SJDF predicted to have a third component of exposure to waves from the west. Directional changes of 10 degrees or less in the average wind conditions predicted by the MACA downscaled GFDL-ESM2M GCM are likely to influence wave exposure at the coast. Shorelines facing south are projected to see a higher frequency of impacts from waves into the future as dominant wind directions remain from the south. However, slight variations in decadal average wind directions may affect shear stress on the bed and wave-induced currents, prompting a geomorphic response and influencing wave transformations in the nearshore. Additional research to assess the potential for morphologic change and the impact of temporal variability in wind direction on waves is advised. For Puget Sound, this assessment ( Figures 19-24) provides one of the first regional characterizations of shoreline exposure to waves, serving as a first order approximation highlighting where waves will be impactful in TWL elevations. However, local features like bed roughness and slope must be included to provide a thorough assessment of TWL, requiring tools like CoSMoS and my case study for Ruston Way."}, {"section_title": "Impacts of SLR on Offshore Wave Climate", "text": "Locations like Skagit Bay (Figure 2) and the remaining ~19 large river delta systems of Puget Sound are likely to experience an increase in wave energy with SLR as higher seas reduce fetch and depth limitations to support wave growth. Model results indicated that SLR will primarily affect fetch in terms of frequency rather than extent. Even so, I examined SLR effects on wave generation and propagation and found no systematic change to deep water waves under SLR scenarios of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.91 m. The average significant deep water wave height changed by 5 cm or less and the average peak period increased 0.1 seconds or less with .91 m of SLR. The mean annual maximum wave height displayed the largest increase ranging 30 cm ( Figure   25). The general lack of change to the deep water wave climate across the deeper fjordal settings In Puget Sound, most of the area impacted by SLR will be constrained by the already steep slopes and prevalent bluff backed beaches. In these locations, much of the focus in hazard mitigation is on the influence that storms and waves will have on wave runup and TWL with SLR. Model results in the embayments and waterways of southern Puget Sound and the area surrounding Port Angeles and Discovery Bay in the SJDF (Figure 2) showed the most change in deep water waves with SLR. Elsewhere, changes of 10 cm or less were estimated for all three SLR scenarios. Lacking a principal component of the wave climate (long period swell) in the LUT which will impact these predictions for locations in the SJDF, only the model results for southern Puget Sound will be discussed in further detail. In southern Puget Sound, maximum deep water wave heights increased on average by 15 -25 cm for the maximum SLR scenario of 0.91 m (Figure 26). Extreme fluctuations in fetch are common in these macrotidal areas where the tidal range is 3 -4 m, potentially explaining the change predicted by the LUT. Higher sea levels effectively shift tidal ranges up the shoreline assuming that flow geometries and tidal propagation is unaffected. Shorelines accustomed to intermittent wetting and drying will see an increase in exposure to water and therefore waves. Relatively flat areas like the many large river deltas in Puget Sound should experience the largest change in wave heights with SLR as there will be an increase in both fetch and depth. The extent that depth limitation is modified by SLR remains uncertain and will depend on the efficiency that waves and currents control accommodation space for sedimentation fed by fluvial and/or littoral sources.

To accurately model wave runup across the region, sitespecific characterizations of bed roughness and beach slope are required to capture the local features influencing runup as sensitivity tests showed wide ranges dependent on slope and roughness (roughness increased runup by as much as 81% and slope as high as 97%). I performed a site specific risk assessment of coastal hazards for Ruston Way and explored how wave runup and TWL will be affected by SLR, storms and waves, to inform adaptation planning for the City of Tacoma. Historical and potential future wave runup, TWL, and flood risk were modeled and two flood regimes governed by wind direction and atmospheric pressure change were found to be important. Large NTR co-occurring with small waves (10-20 cm) was identified in the TAW runup model as an impactful storm type for Ruston Way while the other regime was characterized by large waves (50 cm or larger) occurring with little or even a negative NTR (high atmospheric pressure that periodically depress the sea surface height; Figure   27). Under the second storm type, flooding was predicted due to the contributions of large waves and effects of northerly winds (wind stress and setup) despite lower still water level associated with higher pressure. Ruston Way is oriented north/northeast ( Figure 30) and will be relatively protected from events representative of the first flood regime. Anecdotal evidence from collaborative partners in Tacoma suggested SWL flooding (regime 1) has occurred historically but is less impactful for coastal erosion. Concerns for this scenario encompass high water hazards restricting access to Ruston Way and salt water fouling of infrastructure. The TAW runup model predicted high TWL less frequently during events with waves exceeding 50 cm and storm surge ranging from -20 cm to 5 cm (regime 2; Figure 27). Yet these storms are a primary concern for groups in Tacoma working to protect investments and infrastructure along Ruston Way as these events are already eroding and impacting Ruston's shoreline ( "}, {"section_title": "XBeach Wave Runup Modeling", "text": "To address flood and wave hazards at a high detail and demonstrate the entire CoSMoS modeling train, wave transformation, wave breaking, and wave runup were modeled for a 10-yr storm (regime 2) in XBeach and runup and total water level extent were mapped along Ruston Way, Tacoma is lacking, the observed erosion suggests that higher sea levels will allow greater wave energy to impact the upper foreshore more frequently and add to wave scour and erosion, similar to impacts shown in Figure 32.

Ongoing efforts by the USGS to deploy wave gauges in locations across a gradient in exposure to winds (fetch) and waves such as Bellingham Bay, Skagit Bay and Whidbey Island will provide important datasets to validate models including the LUT approach described here. However, these datasets do not overlap with the timeframe of the LUT . With advances in GCMs, climate reanalysis products, and computational resources, the availability of higher resolution wind products for use with the LUT will increase, leveraging the prospect of finer scale wind fields for more recent periods in history. Until then, evaluating the skill of the LUT in Puget Sound relies on error statistics from Hein Bank, Halibut Bank, and Sentry Shoal (Figure 2)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Change in the Earth's climate system over the past century and into the next is predicted to increasingly affect coastal processes and accelerate into the future. Climate induced variability in ocean circulation patterns, polar ice sheet coverage, and changes in the frequency of extreme weather events will create costly problems and impact resources necessary for ecological and anthropogenic functions. In Washington State, the effect of sea level rise is projected to increase flood hazards on the coast and lead to high mitigation costs, impacts to ecosystems, etc., and this study examined the potential behavior of storms and waves to better evaluate the total threat from interactions of SLR with winds and waves. These complex and dynamic interactions are difficult to forecast and regions like the Puget Sound will benefit from models like CoSMoS aimed at predicting hazards from coastal processes with climate change. A more thorough understanding of how changes to storms, waves, and water levels will impact infrastructure, sediment loads, and coastal hazards has been noted as important for resilience planning as the Puget Sound region continues to grow and expand. (e.g., large tidal flats) indicated the most change in wave height with SLR will occur where increases in fetch and depth will support wave growth. Accurately quantifying coastal bed morphology and how these settings will respond to changes in water level and wave energy will therefore be important. Regional wave model output provided the boundary conditions for high resolution wave runup modeling, which demonstrated that total water level can vary up to 2.5 m due to differences in slope and roughness. Higher resolution coverage of intertidal elevations and morphology will therefore benefit vulnerability assessments of Puget Sound beaches. Finer and regional scale runup modeling revealed the influence of shoreline orientation on coastal hazards where south facing shorelines experienced a higher threat and occurrence from large waves and storm surge while shorelines oriented north were more sensitive to extreme total water level events influenced by waves and wind stresses. Along Ruston Way, fine scale runup modeling projected an increase in extent and frequency of low to moderate storms, like the 10-yr flood, exceeding FEMAs 100-yr BFE with ~51% of the area exceeded with ~0.9 m of SLR. For Puget Sound to increase its ability in evaluating coastal hazards and impacts, validation datasets are needed (wave and wave runup) with a regional characterization and mapping of the intertidal zone to define bed roughness and fill in crucial data gaps limiting runup model skill.
