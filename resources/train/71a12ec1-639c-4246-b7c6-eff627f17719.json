Each center is administered by an industrial firm, a university, or another nonprofit institution\" (NSF/SRS 2006, p. 323). Many FFRDCs employ postdoctoral researchers (postdocs) as part of their efforts to assist government agencies with scientific research and analysis and to train the country's researchers and scientists. The 2009 FFRDC survey collected the total number of postdocs employed by FFRDCs in the United States-categorized by source of support, citizenship, sex, and field of research-as of October 1, 2009. The FFRDC survey is collected as part of the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS), which is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Funding for the FFRDC survey is provided in part by the U.S. Department of Energy."}, {"section_title": "TECHNICAL NOTES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Survey Universe", "text": "The universe for the 2009 GSS-FFRDC survey was the Master Government List of Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (available at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/start.cfm). This list of FFRDCs has been kept by NSF since 1967. The master list of FFRDCs, as of April 2009, appears in appendix A. The survey universe, as of April 2009, consisted of 39 FFRDCs. Of these 39 FFRDCs, any that either currently had or could have a postdoc program was eligible to participate in the survey. The 2009 survey also contacted the NIH's Intramural Research Program because it employs the largest number of postdocs in the federal government. NIH is also a cosponsor of the GSS. However, because, NIH Intramurals is not an FFRDC, its data are reported separately from the data of the 39 FFRDCs."}, {"section_title": "Survey Instruments", "text": "The 2009 FFRDC survey collected data on the total number of postdocs employed by each center. A postdoc is defined by the GSS as an appointee who holds a PhD or equivalent doctorate; whose doctorate was awarded recently, generally within the past 5 years; whose appointment is for a limited term, generally no more than 5 to 7 years; who works under the supervision of a senior researcher; and whose appointment is primarily for the purpose of training in research or scholarship. The GSS definition of postdocs was provided in the survey glossary. 1 The FFRDC survey collected data via a web instrument. Topics included the type of support the postdocs received (federal and nonfederal), their sex, citizenship, race/ethnicity, and field of research. A copy of the survey questionnaire is included in appendix B."}, {"section_title": "Survey Methodology", "text": "On January 19, 2010, before starting data collection, RTI International (a trade name of Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) contacted the directors of all 39 FFRDCs to confirm whether the individuals listed as respondents for previous data collections were still at their center and to determine whether these individuals would still be the most appropriate survey respondents or to obtain a respondent name when it was missing. Copies of these letters and all other communication with the FFRDCs are included in appendix C. Of the 39 directors who were asked to confirm a contact name, 33 had not replied after 1 week, when follow-up procedures began. RTI then e-mailed the respondent identified in 2007 to confirm whether the individual would be the respondent again. As necessary, RTI sent follow-up e-mail messages and made followup telephone calls to the directors or prior year respondents of the 33 FFRDCs that did not confirm the respondent. As a result of these efforts, a respondent was identified for the 39 contacted FFRDCs. The survey instrument was e-mailed to all 39 FFRDCs as soon as a respondent was identified for the center. During the data collection process, 16 centers indicated that they did not have postdocs. The list of centers that said they had no postdocs was compared with past data, and RTI confirmed that those 16 FFRDCs reported having no postdocs in past survey cycles or had been created since the most recent data collection year. Later in the data collection, these FFRDCs were sent an e-mail message asking them to consider whether they might have postdocs working at their center under the title of \"postdoctoral fellow,\" \"postdoctoral researcher,\" or \"research associate.\" Each of the 16 centers responded via e-mail or during a telephone follow-up and confirmed that they had no employees that met the definition of a postdoc working at their FFRDC. In all, 16 FFRDCs were ineligible.  For this data collection, the response rate calculation is as follows:  First nonresponder e-mail prompt (for cases at \"no activity\") February 23, 2010 First nonresponder e-mail prompt (for cases at \"logged in\") February [24][25]2010 Telephone calls to confirm e-mail receipt for \"no activity\" cases March 1, 2010 Second nonresponder e-mail prompt (for all incomplete cases) March 15,2010 Third nonresponder e-mail prompt (for all incomplete cases) March 15, 2010 E-mail to confirm \"0\" postdoc status for FFRDCs who reported no postdocs via e-mail or telephone  "}, {"section_title": "EDITING AND MISSING DATA PROCEDURES", "text": "As each FFRDC returned data, RTI staff reviewed the submission to confirm that all data fields were completed and that data were internally consistent. In cases where additional information or corrections were needed, respondents were contacted by telephone or e-mail and asked to correct and resubmit the survey. RTI conducted a comprehensive review of 12 FFRDCs that were flagged for edit verification. If an FFRDC had cell counts that were more than 20% above or 20% below their prior year data, that center was flagged for edit verification. In all cases, respondents confirmed their data as accurate, with changes usually explained by factors such as a hiring freeze or changes in the FFRDCs' internal tracking systems for administrative data. Four FFRDCs checked a box on the survey to indicate they could not provide postdoc data broken out by specific categories. Three could not report postdocs by field of research. Three could not break out postdoc data by citizenship, two could not by race/ethnicity, and one could not by sex or source of support. "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Postdoctoral Requirements", "text": "The 2009 survey added several items to the FFRDC survey. The first of these was an item asking FFRDCs whether they had a formal definition of postdocs and what requirements the FFRDC had for postdoc positions. Over three-quarters (18) of the FFRDCs reported having a formal definition of a postdoc (table 4). All FFRDCs required that the postdoc have a doctoral degree or equivalent and defined the position as one intended to advance professional skills and lasting for a defined period of time. The least common postdoc requirement was that postdocs publish research in scholarly journals, with only 13 FFRDCs, or 56%, indicating they had this requirement."}, {"section_title": "Race/Ethnicity", "text": "New to the survey in 2009 was an item requesting data on race/ethnicity for postdocs who were U.S. citizens or permanent residents (non-U.S. citizens with green cards).

Of the postdocs for whom race/ethnicity data were reported, only 3% were reported as unknown (table 5).

Citizenship data were reported for 84% of postdocs who were federally supported but for only 52% of postdocs who were not federally supported. The vast majority of postdocs (92%) were primarily supported by federal funds. Among federally funded postdocs for whom data were reported, slightly more than half (59%) of federal support was received by temporary visa holders, with much higher percentages found at three FFRDCs (table 7). Among nonfederally funded postdocs for whom data were reported, slightly more than half (55%) were U.S. citizens. Only one FFRDC reported having more postdocs who were nonfederally supported than were federally supported (table 7).

Engineering fields accounted for 20%, while about 7% of postdocs were in multidisciplinary fields or unknown fields of research. Physics/astronomy postdocs accounted for 45% of those in science fields, followed by 23% in chemistry. Materials/metallurgical engineering was the most commonly reported engineering field (36%), followed by 17% each in mechanical engineering and chemical engineering. Citizenship by field of research information was provided for 84% of postdocs. Of those, 72% of postdocs who were U.S. citizens and 74% of postdocs who held temporary visas were in the sciences.

Reporting by item was low or nonexistent for some of the items asked. Data by sex were provided for only about half (53%) of the postdocs. Race/ethnicity and field of research were not reported for any of the postdocs. The findings specific to NIH Intramurals are found in tables 11 and 12: \uf0a7 Postdoctoral requirements. NIH Intramurals reported having a formal definition of postdocs; as with most FFRDCs, they had all the requirements listed in table 4. \uf0a7 Source of support. This information was provided for all NIH Intramurals postdocs. Close to 98% of postdocs were federally supported, with a slightly higher percent (99%) among U.S. citizens and a slightly lower percent (96%) among temporary visa holders (table 11). \uf0a7 Citizenship. Citizenship information was reported for all NIH Intramurals postdocs. Approximately 41% of postdocs were U.S. citizens (table 11). Nearly all postdocs who were U.S. citizens were federally supported (99%), and 96% of postdocs who held temporary visas were federally supported (table 12). \uf0a7 Sex. Sex was reported for only about half, or 1,921 of the 3,635, of postdocs in the NIH Intramurals (table 11). It should be noted, however, that those 1,921 postdocs represented data from 17 of the 23 NIH Intramurals programs. For those NIH Intramurals postdocs for whom sex data were available, there were more males than females (1,107 males; 814 females). The percentage of postdocs who were female (42%) was higher than it was at FFRDCs (23% female postdocs).  Overall, FFRDCs found the web instrument to be an improvement over the worksheet approach used in prior years. The FFRDCs found the items easy to navigate, with clear instructions and well-defined purpose. The main findings from the debriefing are summarized as follows: \uf0a7 Background information. Debriefing participants had been at their respective institutions for between 9 and 22 years, and each had responded to the FFRDC survey in the past. All three FFRDCs reported they were able to include all postdocs. Two of the FFRDCs relied on job titles assigned at hiring by human resources to identify their postdocs; the third FFRDC relied on administrative staff in the various directorates to identify the postdocs, but he was confident they used a common definition and that all had been included. \uf0a7 Survey information/instructions. All participants reported they had read the instructions page, found it clear and helpful, but did not need to refer to it again during the survey. All were familiar with the term \"FFRDC.\" \uf0a7 Postdoc definition. None of the participants reported any difficulty responding to this item, and none were able to think of a component of their definition of postdoc that was not included in the list of elements provided. All three FFRDCs indicated it would be helpful if NSF provided its definition of postdoc just so they could be certain there was a common understanding of who should be included. \uf0a7 Demographics. All three FFRDCs reported tracking race/ethnicity information in their systems and that they used the same categories internally as were used on the survey. All three FFRDCs indicated they were able to report this information for all of their postdocs. \uf0a7 Financial support by citizenship. All three FFRDCs reported having this information readily available for all their postdocs. These FFRDCs each used internal charge codes to determine how each postdoc was being supported. One participant had wondered whether \"nonfederal\" meant \"non-NSF\" or meant she should include only postdocs who received no type of federal support. Each indicated they could report the specific federal agencies providing support. \uf0a7 Field of research by citizenship. Field of research information was determined slightly differently among the three FFRDCs debriefed. One reported using the field in which postdocs had obtained their degree. Another reported basing field of research on the area in which the postdoc was currently working. The third reported needing to rely on staff in the individual directorates to report back field of research for their postdocs, so it is not certain how each of those directorates made the determination. The level of detail in field category was acceptable to all three FFRDCs. \uf0a7 Glossary. One participant was unaware of the glossary, one indicated she found it helpful to confirm that she was understanding key terms correctly, and the third indicated he was aware of it but did not need to refer to it. No one suggested additional definitions that could be included. \uf0a7 General. All three FFRDC participants felt they were the best person at their FFRDC to respond to the survey. Two were human resources staff and did not need other staff to help answer the items. The third needed to obtain information from the various directorates housing the postdocs. All three liked reporting based on fiscal year, so that October 1 was a useful reference date for them. We invite you to join with other Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) in the National Science Foundation's (NSF) survey of postdoctoral appointees (postdocs) at FFRDCs. Your postdoctoral program serves as an important national resource in developing our country's most talented researchers. The NSF collects information on the number and characteristics of postdocs in science, engineering and health-related fields at the nation's colleges, universities, and FFRDCs. This study is being conducted in connection with the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering and with support from the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health."}, {"section_title": "DIRECTOR'S LETTER", "text": "For the first time, the FFRDC survey will be administered via the Web.
