Robert Oppenheimer"}, {"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "The mechanism by which knowledge flows from universities to firms is varied, involving formal means, such as publications, as well as less formal mechanisms, such as discussions between faculty and industrial scientists at professional meetings. Face-to-face transmission is most appropriate when tacit knowledge is involved, since, by definition, tacit knowledge cannot be codified. The placement of new PhDs in industry provides one mechanism for transmitting tacit knowledge. Much of a graduate student's training is of a tacit nature, acquired while working in her mentor's lab. These techniques, wrapped up in new PhDs, can be transmitted to industrial R&D labs when the PhD takes a position there upon graduating.2\nDespite the role that PhD placements can play in the transmission of knowledge, we know very little about these knowledge flows. For example, we know little about the providence of new PhDs going to industry: What universities do they come from? Where do they go? Do they stay in the area where they were trained? By way of contrast, we know considerably more about the transmission of codified knowledge, due in large part to the citation trail left by both patents and articles which allow one to make inferences concerning patterns of transmission.\nThe reason for this knowledge gap relates to the availability of data. Firm hires of new PhDs are not part of the public record. Nor, and more to the point, do the data collected by the National Science Foundation on new PhDs at the time of graduation capture the industrial destinations of new PhDs. The data has been collected but not coded. During the past four years, we have coded this data which, beginning in 1997, became available in verbatim records. We now have six years of data, ending with PhDs granted in 2002. The data are far from perfect, having several \"holes.\" But they give a picture, partial as it may be, about which heretofore little has been known. They show a remarkable fluidity of knowledge flows; they also show that knowledge centers, as defined in terms of PhD production, exist in parts of the country that are no longer known for their industrial strength and that new PhDs working in industry are heavily clustered in certain cities.\nHere we summarize findings from the six years of data that have just become available. In addition, we explore insights that human resource data can bring to the study of innovation, following up on a presentation that Stephan (2002) made at the National Research Council where she argued that human resource data could provide a lens for tracking innovation.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows: In section II we describe the data.\nIn section III we explore issues related to geography. Where do the new PhDs come from? Where do they go? What do the patterns say in terms of the role of proximity in the transmission of knowledge spillovers? Section IV examines insights gained by using human resource data to illuminate patterns of innovation. We examine, for example, the industrial mix of hires, how hiring patterns changed between the two periods, and the diversity of fields hired within a given industry Data issues are discussed in section V. Conclusions are drawn in section VI. The data on definite plans also undercounts placements of recent PhDs who work in industry but initially take a postdoctoral position upon graduating. This is particularly the case in the life sciences, where the percent of new PhDs taking a postdoctoral training position upon graduation exceeds 50 percent; yet approximately one-in-three of these postdocs eventually ends up working in industry.7\nSome indication of the undercount is given by comparing the percentage of PhDs who reported working in industry four years after completing their PhD to the percentage with definite plans to work in industry at the time they received their PhD. Such a comparison shows that, although there is variation by field, about three times as many doctorates end up working in industry as do those who specify a firm at the time of graduation.8 Despite these limitations, much can be learned from analyzing the SED firm placement data. Table 3 .1 presents a summary of the data, showing (a) the number and percentage of all new PhDs in a field who had definite plans to work at a firm and (b) the number and percentage, who identified a top-200 R&D firm or its subsidiary Given that the underlying strength of the economy, especially in the high tech area, varied during the sixyear period, the data are presented separately for the two periods. The slightly lower number of PhDs produced during Period Two compared to Period One in science and engineering undoubtedly reflects in part the strong market for non-PhD employment in science and engineering during the 1990s, especially in engineering, math, and computer science. Only in the field of biology and medicine did the number of degree recipients increase, and then only marginally We see from table 3.1 that the industrial placement rate of new PhDs is highest among engineers followed by computer scientists and chemists. This reflects underlying patterns among seasoned PhDs, where over 50 percent of both engineers and chemists work in industry The field with the lowest percentage going to industry directly out of graduate school is biology This is not surprising, given the extraordinarily high prevalence of academic postdoctoral positions in the life sciences and the relatively small percentage of seasoned biologists, compared to seasoned PhDs in other fields, working in industry9\nApproximately 38 percent of the newly hired PhDs go to work at a top-200 R&D firm (or subsidiary) but there is considerable variation Period Two comprises those who entered the labor market after the dot.com bust and during a period of recession. This depressed environment is no doubt responsible for the lower number of firm placements of new PhDs in engineering, computer science, and math. In two fields, however, the actual number placed (as well as the placement rate) rose considerably: In biology the number increased from 609 to 843 and in chemistry the number rose from 1,216 to 1,310. The underlying increase in biology (where the number of PhDs produced during the two periods remained almost constant) meant that the placement rate in industry increased from 3.8 percent to 5.2 percent. While this is still a miniscule rate, it undoubtedly reflects the growing realization among doctoral students in the life sciences that industry, especially pharmaceuticals represents a relatively favorable employment environment and reflects also the expansion of pharmaceutical firms during this period.10 The underlying decline in PhD production in chemistry, coupled with an increase in the number of industrial placements, meant that the placement rate in chemistry increased substantially, going from 18.7 percent to 22.2 percent.\nThe rate of those taking jobs at top-200 R&D firms is approximately the same in the two periods. But there are some noticeable differences, especially in the small fields of agriculture and astronomy. We also see that the number and percent of computer scientists going to work at large R&D firms decreased, undoubtedly a reflection of market conditions in the field after the dot.com bust."}, {"section_title": "III. Knowledge Sources and the Question of Proximity", "text": "Knowledge sources, by region of country where trained, are presented in table 3.2.11 Many of the PhDs going to work in firms are educated in geographic centers associated with innovation. For example, one in four is educated in New England and the Middle Atlantic states; about one in six is educated in the Pacific states. But the headline here is the extraor- Public knowledge sources are often measured in terms of university R&D expenditure data. Column 3 of table 3.2 shows the distribution of these expenditures by region. A comparison of column 3 with column 2 indicates that public knowledge sources, as measured by human resource flows to industry, are concentrated in somewhat different geographic regions from those that university R&D expenditure data would suggest, and the differences are substantial. For example, the South Atlantic region produces about 15 percent of those going to industry but accounts for 19 percent of university R&D expenditures; the East North Central produces 19.6 percent of new PhDs going to industry but accounts for only 14.4 percent of university R&D. We conclude that the spatial distribution of knowledge sources embodied in newly minted talent is somewhat different from the distribution of knowledge sources stemming from university research, as measured by university R&D expenditure data. Part of this difference may be an artifact of our inability to count new PhDs who go to industry after taking a postdoctoral position, but this is unlikely to account for the striking differences in the Midwest.\nThe top 20 universities training PhDs hired by firms are given in table 3.3. We see that the knowledge sources are quite concentrated; the top 20 educate 40 percent of those going to industry; the top ten educate 25 percent. Again we see the important role that the Midwest plays. Five"}, {"section_title": "Region trained", "text": "Percent trained University R&D (percent)* Table 3 .3\nTop-20 producing universities of PhDs headed to industry [2000] [2001] [2002] of the top ten institutions are in the Midwest; seven of the top 20 institutions are in the Midwest. All, with the exception of Northwestern, are public institutions. The dominant role played by California is also evident. Four of the top 20 universities are in California. Considerable research has focused on the role that geographic proximity plays in transmitting knowledge. Early work by Jaffe (1989) , for example, used university research and development expenditures as a proxy for the availability of local knowledge spillovers, as did work by Feldman (1996a, 1996b) . More recent work by Feldman and Audretsch (1999) , Acs (1997, 2000) and University Number trained These and countless other studies go a long way toward establishing that geographic proximity promotes the transmission of knowledge. They do not, however, address the extent to which knowledge spillovers are local. One of the few papers to examine this question was written by Audretsch and Stephan (1996) and examines academic scientists affiliated with biotech companies. Because the authors knew the location of both the scientist and the firm, they were able to establish the geographic origins of spillovers embodied in this knowledge-transfer process. Their research shows that although proximity matters in establishing formal ties between university-based scientists and companies, its influence is not overwhelming. Approximately 70 percent of the links between biotech companies and university-based scientists in their study were non-local.\nKnowledge sources and knowledge destinations, as proxied by PhD flows, are given in table 3.4 by region. The table can be used to examine the question of the degree to which spillovers, as proxied by the employment location of newly trained PhDs, are local. Entries that lie on the diagonal represent \"local\" links, showing those who take employment within their region of training. Here we find that 48 percent of the entries lie on the diagonal. There is considerable variation by region, however. The Pacific Region retains slightly over 70 percent; and the Mid-Atlantic is second, retaining 51 percent; New England is a close third with a 46 percent retention rate. By way of contrast, the East South Central region retains only 32 percent. The East North Centralwith its heavy production of new PhDsretains 38 percent; and its sister region, the West North Central, retains 34 percent. Appendix A.1 drills down to the state level, showing training, employment, and retention patterns (where confidentially permits) by state. Compared to the mean state retention rate of 37.1 percent, the Midwest states are low: Iowa retains 13.6 percent of those it trains; Indiana retains only 11.8 percent of the 771 PhDs it trains that go to work in industry and Wisconsin retains only 17.7 percent of the 492 it trains. By way of contrast, the retention rate is extremely high in California, with almost seven out of ten PhDs staying to take a job in California. Overall, the state stay rates are low compared to those for bachelor and master degree recipients in science and engineering. Among those taking jobs in industry. for example, the stay rate is 64.4 percent in science and 62.3 percent in engineering.12 The, PhD state stay rate is also low compared to recent law school graduates for whom 57 percent with New PhDs who leave their state of training tend to go a reasonable distance. This is clearly seen from table 3.4, which shows migration flows between regions. As noted above, the Pacific region attracts a considerable number of new PhDs from the mid-west and mid-and-southAtlantic states. In earlier work, and for the period 1997-1999, we found that, among those who left their PMSA of training, the average distance between location of training and location of employment was 835 miles.\nElsewhere (Sumell et al. 2006) we have examined factors affecting the propensity for PhDs hired by industry during Period One to leave the state of training and transfer their knowledge to another state. We find that mobility relates to field and quality of the PhD program. For example, compared to the benchmark of biology, individuals trained in agriculture, engineering, chemistry, computer science and earth science are more likely to leave their state of training. Among those trained in engineering, biology, chemistry, math and medicine, those trained in top programs are more likely to leave. We also find that those who were supported on a fellowship or a dissertation grant are more likely to leave their state of training.13 Those who worked part-time during their last year in graduate school or are returning to a previous employer are more likely to stay. Those on temporary visas are more likely to leave their state of training, as are Asians, regardless of visa status, and underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. On the other hand, individuals who went to both college and high school in their PhD state of training are considerably (17 percent) more likely to remain in state than those who did not receive both degrees from the same state.14 Our finding that only 37.1 percent stay in the state of training raises the question of whether the role of proximity to the university is overemphasized in the transmission of public knowledge from universities to industry. The top source of public knowledge, according to the Carnegie Mellon survey of firms (Cohen, Nelson, and Wash 2002) , is publications and reports. Neither requires proximity to the scientist/ engineer. The second source, informal information exchange, public meetings, or conferences and consulting, is facilitated by proximity but proximity is not essential. The next tier includes recently-hired graduate students. Our research clearly shows that in this respect proximity does not play a major role.15\nThe finding that nearly two out of three PhDs who go to work in industry leave their state of training and that more than one out of two leave their region of training highlights the degree to which the market for PhDs working in industry is national. It also underscores the degree to which the quality and scale of doctoral S&E training programs requires, at least in part, a tolerance on the part of certain states, especially those located in the Midwest, to the fact that a good portion of their most prized \"talent\" emigrate to the Coasts. Many of these doctoral programs were initially developed and designed to meet state needs. Students in these programs still meet state needs in terms of their labors in the classroom and the laboratory. But, as the labor market expands, and as the traditional industrial base of the United States shifts, one can make the case that a highly trained S&E workforce will only be maintained if the Federal government increasingly steps in to provide financial support for graduate education, since state legislatures are unlikely to continue to fund these migration flows over the long run.16"}, {"section_title": "IV. Using Human Resource Data to Illuminate Patterns of Innovation", "text": "Firms hire new PhDs not only for the new knowledge that they possess but also for their ability more generally to contribute to the innovative activities of the firm. Tracking the placement of PhDs can also inform our understanding of patterns of innovation. This can be useful given that changes are occurring in patterns of innovation which traditional measures, such as patent counts and research and development expenditure data, are increasingly unable to illuminate. To quote Mowery (1999, p. 46) , \"Without substantial change in the content and coverage of data collection, our portrait of innovative activity in the U.S. economy is likely to become less and less accurate.\"\nHere we explore how data concerning the placement of new PhDs with firms can illuminate our understanding of patterns of innovation. Of particular interest is how such data inform our understanding of the location of innovation, the source of innovative inputs, and the degree to which human resource data relate to other measures of innovation. Before doing so, we place the discussion in context by summarizing major changes occurring in patterns of innovation."}, {"section_title": "Changing Patterns of Innovation", "text": "Four trends characterize the change that has occurred in patterns of innovation in recent years: (1) the increased reliance on external R&D, such as that performed by universities, consortia and government laboratories (Mowery 1999, p. 44) ; (2) increased collaboration in the development of new products and processes with domestic and foreign competitors and customers (Mowery 1999, p. 44) ; (3) a decentralization of in-house R&D activities (Merrill and Cooper 1999) ; and (4) the movement of innovative activities to functions in the firm typically not thought of as being drivers of innovation. The latter is fueled in part by the development of technologies that impact the operation and marketing of the firm's production. Although all four changes contribute to the growing inadequacy of traditional measures to describe innovative activity, it is the latter two that we explore here because they can best be illuminated by examining HR data.\nIncreasingly firms have chosen to locate research activities at the plant level, instead of at a central R&D lab. This decentralization creates fuzziness in the current R&D data since the location of where the actual innovation is developed corresponds less and less to corporate headquarters, yet the data are collected at the corporate level. Knowing the location of PhDs working in industry can help solve the \"location\" problem since the placement data reflects actual location, not the location of the company's headquarters.\nAnother organizational change with regard to patterns of innovation is the movement of innovative activities to functions within the firm not typically regarded as drivers of innovation. One example is the assignment of scientific personnel to evaluate and seek R&D opportunities through mergers and acquisitions. Another is the involvement of technically teamed personnel in marketing and distribution. A third example is the evolution of what is sometimes referred to as \"service science,\" which looks for ways to improve the performance of the service sector through the use of engineering, mathematics, and management (Lohr 2006) . The important innovations that firms make in these areas are generally missed in standard measures of R&D. Measuring flows of new PhDs to industry regardless of their organizational assignment provides the opportunity of learning something about these sources of innovation that are not typically counted in R&D expenditure data.\nLocation Table 3 .5 shows the regional distribution of new PhDs going to work in industry The region where the largest number of new PhDs plan to work is the Pacific (25.9 percent). The strong presence of IT firms in the Pacific region, as well as the heavy proportion of engineers in the database, no doubt contribute to this finding. The Mid-Atlantic region is the second largest employer of new PhDs. The East North Central is a distant third. Column 3 gives the distribution of industrial R&D expenditures by region. A comparison of the spatial distribution of new hires with the spatial distribution of R&D industrial expenditures is consistent with the argument above, showing that the distributions are spatially different. For example, we see that expenditure data undercounts innovative activity in the South Atlantic and the West South Central, and overcounts innovative activity in the Pacific region and the East North Central. While some of these differences are undoubtedly due to our inability to fully measure PhD flows to industry, the differences are suggestive that R&D expenditure data alone fail to capture regional differences. The work location of new PhDs going to industry can also inform our understanding of the location of innovative activity at the city level something that is not possible to obtain from industrial R&D expenditure data. Other manufacturing; broadcasting and 813 telecommunications; conglomerate *Each cell reports data on three or more firms and no firm in any cell hires 50 percent or more of the new PhDs reported in that cell.\nThe top 33 firms recruited approximately the same number of new PhDs in Period One (2,908) and Period Two (2,916). However, there were large differences across NAIC classifications, reflecting changes in the underlying economy Growth was greatest in chemicals and pharmaceuticals (37.5 percent). This mirrors our earlier finding that hiring increased among biologists and chemists between the two periods. Employment of new PhDs fell 42 percent between the two periods in aerospace products and parts. Employment remained relatively constant among the other NAIC groupings.\nThe SED data also provides insight into the mix of expertise that firms hire. Pharmaceuticals provide an illustrative case. During the six-year period, top-200 R&D pharmaceutical companies hired 1,047 new PhDs. The dominant field of training was chemistry (402), but 100 or more were hired from four other fields: 193 from biology; 147 from engineering, 140 from medicine, and 132 from math. The hires in math undoubtedly reflect the importance of modeling in drug discovery."}, {"section_title": "Foreign", "text": "Approximately five percent (1,096) of the new PhDs with definite plans to go to industry indicate that they are taking a position with a firm Total 5824 located outside the United States. The number (and percent) going abroad is slightly lower in Period Two than in Period One. The most common foreign destination is Korea, where 22.5 percent of those with plans to work in industry abroad indicate that they will go; the next most likely destination is Germany (8.8 percent), followed by Japan at 8.5 percent. Canada attracts about six percent and Taiwan close to five percent. In light of recent discussions concerning increased innovative activity in developing Asian countries, it is interesting to note that approximately six percent are headed to the countries of China (1.8 percent), India (2.1 percent), or Thailand (2.0 percent)."}, {"section_title": "V. Data Issues", "text": "As noted earlier, the data used for this paper have certain limitations. First, the period they are drawn from includes the years when the dot. com boom was at its zenith. It remains to be seen whether the results hold when the period of analysis is extended past 2002. Second, the data undercount new PhDs going to work in industry in two respects. First, they undercount in the sense that not all PhDs have definite work plans at the time they graduate. Second, they undercount in the sense that in certain fields, especially the life sciences, it is common practice for individuals to first take a position as a post doc before eventually taking a job in industry. While we can learn something about both groups by examining patterns in the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), this is far from a perfect substitute, since the SDR only samples about eight percent of PhDs for follow-up study. We would learn far more if resources were available for follow-up with those who do not have definite plans. We could also learn considerably more if a survey were done of postdocs, especially postdocs at the time they leave the postdoctoral position. Science Resources Statistics at NSF is currently in the process of reviewing and studying the possibility of fielding a postdoc survey. SRS's goal is to provide an integrated approach to surveying postdocs in order to ifil in current gaps. SRS has made some changes in data collection and its policy towards data use which have the potential to increase our knowledge about industrial placements and, by inference, the innovation process in the United States. First, SRS is in the process of adding a \"salary offer\" question to the SED for those with definite plans.2\u00b0 When implemented, it will be the first time that information has been collected at the national level on starting salaries for PhDs in science and engineering. Second, Data on firm placements provide insights that other data do not provide. One such insight relates to where these newly minted and hired PhDs trained. This is of interest since newly trained PhDs provide one means by which knowledge, especially tacit knowledge, is transferred from the public sector to the private sector. We find these knowledge sources to be heavily concentrated in certain regions and states. Moreover, the geographic distribution of knowledge sources, as measured by where PhDs going to work in industry trained, is different than other measures of knowledge sources would suggest, such as university R&D-expenditure data. We conclude that the spatial distribution of knowledge sources embodied in newly minted talent is different from the distribution of knowledge sources stemming from university research, as measured by university R&D expenditures.\nA major headline here is the strong role played by Midwestern universities, which educate over 26 percent of all PhDs going to industry. Indeed, seven of the top 20 institutions educating PhDs to work in industry are located in the Midwest. We also find that PhDS working in industry are not particularly likely to remain in the state where they received their PhD training. Compared to master-degree recipients going to work in industry, PhDs are almost 45 percent less likely to remain in the state of training. To wit, the state stay rate for PhDs working in industry is 37 percent; that for masters is 65 percent. The finding suggests that it is important to rethink the role that proximity to the university plays in the transmission of knowledge.\nStay patterns are particularly low among certain Midwestern states and universities located in these states. Some of these states have seen a considerable decline in their industrial prowess in recent years. As Nathan Rosenberg has pointed out, it is not accidental that athletes at Purdue University bear the nickname of \"boilermakers,\" reflecting Purdue's early commitment to engineering education supporting industry in the state of Indiana. While the name persists, Purdue's PhDs now overwhelmingly leave the state to take employment elsewheremany as far away as the west coast. One can make the case that as the traditional industrial base of the United States shifts, a highly trained S&E workforce will only be maintained if the Federal government increasingly steps in to provide financial support for graduate education, since state legislatures are unlikely to continue to fund these migration flows over the long run. It is risky as a nation to continue to rely on the \"kindness\" of Midwestern states to publicly educate the high-quality S&E workforce that heads out-of-state upon graduation. Of course, kindness is not the intent of these states. Universities benefit from doctoral students, especially to the extent that they provide cheap labor in the classroom and the laboratory. But the fact remains that while all public institutions, and indirectly the states that support these institutions, garner these benefits, some states garner the added spillover benefits which occur when new PhDs remain in state. Others do not.\nHiring data also inform our understanding of patterns of innovation. This is particularly useful given that R&D data are often collected at the corporate level and thus do not reflect the decentralization that is occurring in research and development, as companies move away from large central labs. Hiring patterns also provide information on scientists and engineers working in industry, regardless of their organizational assignment. This provides the opportunity for learning something about resources employed in innovative activity that are not typically counted in R&D expenditure data.\nFirms most likely to hire new PhDs are found in computer and electrical products, followed by firms working in publishing and professional, scientific, and technical services. Five firms in pharmaceuticals and medicine are among the top hiring firms. Apropos to the above argument, while we find some overlap between top hiring firms and top R&D firms, there are also considerable differences. Only ten of the top 20 R&D firms appear on the top-20 hiring list. Clearly the PhD hiring variable is related to R&D expenditures but also captures a somewhat different dimension of innovation.\nNew PhDs working for industry are most likely to head to San Jose. Indeed, almost one out of ten new PhDs going to work for industry heads to San Jose. It is no wonder that the San Jose newspaper has a fulltime science reporter! While our finding may not persist when the time period is extended considerably past the dot.com boom, the rate going to San Jose was slightly higher in the second period (which includes post-dot.com years) than in the earlier period, suggesting that it is not entirely driven by the dot.com boom. Other top-destination cities include Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Portland-Seattle, and Chicago. While industrial employment of newly trained scientists and engineers is heavily concentrated in a handful of cities, it is not nearly as concentrated as are counts of patents or SBIR Phase II awards.\nThe location data highlights the role that PhDs play in local economic development, not only through their contribution to innovation, but also through the economic impact that their relatively high wages exert on the local economy. Sumell (2005) , for example, estimates that a newly trained PhD in computer science working in industry earns $86,700 a year; a newly trained PhD in electrical engineering earns $78,500. More than 300 new PhDs a year go to work in industry in San Jose alone. Many of these are electrical engineers and computer scientists. Hired to work on products that will have a global market, they spend much of their income locally. Through the multiplier effect, their spending contributes to regional economic growth. Finally, our data suggest that small firms play a larger role in irinovation than R&D data would suggest. For example, while the top 200 R&D firms expend more than 70 percent of all R&D in the U.S., they hire only 39 percent of all new PhDs. Part of the disparity is undoubtedly due to undercounting, since some large firms, especially in pharmaceuticals, hire new PhDs only after they complete their postdoctoral training, not directly out of graduate school.n The disparity however, is too great to be driven entirely by this. The difference reflects in part the degree to which small firms are \"knowledge-intensive\" and the degree to which R&D statistics are dominated by development costs associated with large firms, as opposed to research costs. It is difficult to know the extent to which this small-firm effect reflects Federal policies such as the SBIR program that are aimed specifically at small innovative firms. But the knowledge that small firms contribute substantially to innovation23 and are hiring newly-minted PhDs suggests that the Federal government might consider further leveraging the benefits coming from small knowledge-intensive firms by investing additional resources in programs aimed at small innovative firms. Such a policy not only has the potential of contributing to innovation and subsequent economic growth, it could also augment the number of research positions available for scientists and engineers and send a positive signal to those contemplating careers in science and engineering. This undercounting does not affect our conclusion unless at the time of the survey those with definite plans differ significantly from those without definite plans.\nThe estimate for the percent of postdocs in biology who eventually take a position in industry comes from the 1995 Survey of Earned Doctorates, which contained retrospective questions concerning postdoctoral experience.\nThe comparison made was between the percentage of 1995 PhDs who reported working in industry in 1999 (using the Survey of Earned Doctorates) and the percentage of Period One PhD placements in industry.\nIn 1999 approximately 25 percent of all PhDs in the life sciences were working in industry compared to slightly over 50 percent in chemistry and in engineering, 30 percent in math and computer science, and 35 percent in physics and astronomy (Stephan et al. 2004 ). Top fields are based on the 1993 National Research Council (NRC) rankings for all fields except medicine and agriculture. The rankings for the majority of fields are based on the \"scholarly quality\" scores in the NRC rankings for each relevant program at the institution. For field definitions that were broader than the program definitions in the NRC rankings (such as biology), we calculated the means for each rated program applicable to our broader field for each institution. For the fields of medicine and agriculture, we used the 1998 NSF CASPAR data to rank institutions, due to the absence of data for these fields in the NRC rankings. Institutions in these fields were ranked by total federal R&D expenditures at each institution. In the case of biology and medicine, which have a very large number of PhD programs, 75 institutions were included among the top programs. For smaller fields, such as astronomy, the top category includes the top 25 programs. In most other fields, the top category includes the top 50 programs.\nThe logit analysis also includes controls measuring the innovative character of the state, such as patent counts, academic R&D expenditures, industrial R&D expenditure, and a measure of job opportunities for PhDs in the state. In addition, we control for per capita income, population, and the educational level of the state.\nThis discussion also raises the question of the degree to which spillovers from public institutions result from nonappropriability. We have argued that tacit knowledge comprises an important component of the knowledge that new PhDs transmit to firms. Yet tacit knowledge, as Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1998) point out, facilitates excludabiity Thus knowledge transmission, to paraphrase the aforementioned authors, can result from the maximizing behavior of scientists who have the ability to appropriate the returns to their knowledge rather than from nonappropriabffity."}]
