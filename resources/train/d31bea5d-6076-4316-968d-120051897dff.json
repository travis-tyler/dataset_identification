Fewer than 1% of AD are caused by autosomal dominant mutations [1] [2] [3] ; hence, the majority of AD cases are sporadic regardless of age at disease onset [4, 5] . Although an age of 65 years for delineating YOAD versus late-onset AD (LOAD) was selected based on social factors such as the traditional retirement age [6] , key imaging, neuropathological, and neurochemical differences based on an age cutoff of 65 years have been reported in the literature. YOAD patients present with more severe gray matter atrophy [7] , more abundant senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and synaptic loss [8] , as well as greater deficits in acetylcholine [9] than LOAD patients. YOAD patients appear more likely to present with impaired language, attention, and visuospatial function, compared with LOAD patients who experience more memory deficits [10] .\nIn terms of rate of progression, some reports have shown a faster rate of cognitive decline in younger patients [8, [10] [11] [12] ; others found no association between the age of onset and rate Paul M.

In the second study [41] , LOAD was compared with healthy controls in whole CSF using Exiqon's human miRNome panels (752 human miRNAs) followed by examination of candidates in CSF-derived exosomes. Several candidate miRNAs were altered in LOAD compared with controls. In CSF-derived exosomes, the detectability of miRNAs increased, especially when testing the same candidates that were already identified in the whole CSF screen. However, the specific, high-throughput miRNA profile changes occurring in the CSF-derived exosomes of YOAD remain to be elucidated.\nThe current study explores the miRNA expression profile in exosomes derived from the CSF of biomarker-confirmed sporadic YOAD patients compared with that in healthy controls (HC). Here, we uncovered a decrease in miR-16-5p, miR-451a, and miR-605-5p and an increase in miR-125b-5p in YOAD patients versus HC. Combining the relative expression of these four miRNAs by regression analysis effectively distinguished YOAD relative to HC. Interestingly, the four miRNAs altered in YOAD share common targets and pathways altered in the post-mortem YOAD brain [49] . In a cohort of LOAD patients, we showed that miR-451a and miR-605-5p were similarly decreased and miR-125b-5p increased in LOAD but there was no significant difference in miR-16-5p expression compared with HC. Hence, these results revealed three miRNAs with altered expression in the CSF-derived exosomes of both YOAD and LOAD.

After quality control and applying a Ct cutoff of < 39, a total of 164 miRNAs were detected across all 29 samples with a 14% detection floor (Supplementary Table 3 ). For normalization, the Ct values for spike-ins UniSp6 (Supplementary Fig.  1a ) and cel-miR-39-3p ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ) along with the endogenous miR-204-5p ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ) were combined to generate the geometric mean ( Supplementary   Fig. 1d ) using established protocols [55, 56] . In total, 48 miRNAs were detected at two thirds of all samples. From this list, an ANOVA followed by pairwise comparisons uncovered an increase in six and decrease in five candidate miRNAs in YOAD versus HC using uncorrected comparisons ( Fig. 2a; all p < 0.05). Increased miRNAs included let-7b-5p, miR-27a-5p, miR-99a-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-30b-5p, and miR-145-5p, whereas decreased miRNAs included miR-605-5p, miR-877-3p, miR-29c-3p, and miR-16-5p.

We then examined whether validated miRNAs in YOAD were also altered in LOAD. For quality control of individual assays, the qrt-PCR efficiency and melt curves for each validated miRNA are provided (summarized in Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Similar to the discovery phase, the geometric mean of the cycle threshold for spike-in UniSp6 ( Supplementary Fig. 3a ) and endogenous miR-204-5p ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ) was used to normalize qrt-PCR data across groups (Supplementary Fig. 3c ). An ANOVA followed by corrected pairwise comparisons showed a decrease of miR-16-5p in YOAD but not LOAD (Fig. 3a , p < 0.05), an increase of miR-125b-5p in both YOAD and LOAD (Fig. 3b , p < 0.05), a robust decrease of miR-451a in both YOAD and LOAD (Fig. 3c , p < 0.0001), and a decrease of miR-605-5p in YOAD and LOAD versus HC (Fig. 3d , p < 0.05). A pairwise comparison between YOAD and LOAD for miR-16-5p was significantly different (Fig. 3a , p < 0.05) suggesting a YOAD-specific decrease in CSF levels of exosomal miR-16-5p relative to LOAD. Additionally, the differential expression of miR-125b-5p, miR-451a, and miR-605-5p was found to be in common between YOAD and LOAD. Next, we asked whether the expression of the validated miRNAs differed based on the age at which the LP was performed. Pearson correlation analysis was performed for the relative expression of all four validated miRNAs versus age at LP. We found that there was a significant negative correlation for miR-125b-5p expression in HC with age (Supplementary Fig. 4a ; R 2 = 0.624, p = 0.0022), but this effect was insignificant in YOAD (Supplementary Fig. 4b ; R 2 = 0.0055, p = 0.777) and LOAD (Supplementary Fig. 4c ; R 2 = 0.624, p = 0.0022). Hence, this suggests that expression of miR-125b-5p decreases with age in HC but may remain at high expression levels in AD regardless of age.

Results for miR-125b-5p showed modest improvement at distinguishing LOAD from HC (AUC = 0.785; CI = 0.537\u22120.950) than with YOAD. The miR-451a showed high discriminatory potential to distinguish LOAD from HC (AUC = 0.847; CI = 0.679\u22120.956), but was not as robust as in YOAD. In the case of miR-605-5p, performance at distinguishing LOAD from HC (AUC = 0.765; CI = 0.491\u22120.913) was similar as in YOAD.

From this, mRNA targets were depleted in peripheral blood cells and the choroid plexus, as expected. Importantly, markers of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, or simply brain were enriched. Although no targets were significantly enriched in cerebrospinal fluid, the percentage of predicted targets overlapping with cerebrospinal fluid was higher for all predicted targets overlapping with the blood, peripheral blood cells, blood vessels, and choroid plexus ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). These results suggest predominantly CNS localization of transcripts targeted by the validated miRNAs.

In a cohort of LOAD patients, differential expression of miR-125b-5p, miR-451a, and miR-605-5p was also observed. The fact that miR-16-5p was unchanged in LOAD suggests that altered exosomal expression of miR-16-5p may differentiate YOAD from LOAD. Moreover, all four miRNAs altered in YOAD share putative targets and pathways relevant to the postmortem YOAD brain transcriptome. Intriguingly, these mRNAs were overrepresented in previously implicated pathways in AD, including long-term potentiation [83, 84, 85] , MAPK signaling [86] [87] [88] , Wnt signaling [89, 90] , axon guidance [91, 92] , and calcium signaling pathway [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . Further, the upregulation of GO terms related to apoptosis and immune response also recapitulates known alterations in AD [98] [99] [100] [101] . An overrepresentation of AD-relevant pathways suggests that these miRNAs are potentially combinatorial candidates for understanding disease mechanisms underlying AD. Considering that three of the four validated miRNAs are downregulated, this implicates the absence of target repression [102] by these miRNAs in the enriched pathways. In contrast, the opposite miRNA/mRNA regulatory relationship may be true for upregulated miR-125b-5p.\nThe significant increase in miR-125b-5p we observed in both YOAD and LOAD patients is in agreement with previous findings in LOAD showing an increase in several CNS structures [103] [104] [105] [106] and in CSF [40, 43] . Other reports have shown a decrease of miR-125b-5p in LOAD serum [47, 107] and in CSF [47, 108] . To our knowledge, we are the first to report increased expression levels of miR-125b-5p in CSFderived exosomes from YOAD and LOAD patients. There is some evidence that miR-125b-5p has a microglial localization and may play a pro-inflammatory role [109] . Moreover, miR125b-5p overexpression results in hyperphosphorylation of tau and neurotoxicity in primary neuron cultures [103] . However, future studies are required to further examine these mechanisms in the context of AD. Encircled node clusters were selected using the Cytoscape (v3.4.0) plug-in AutoAnnotate (v1.1.0). Overrepresented GO terms shown in bold were selected using the WordCloud (v3.1.0) plug-in based on the proportion of redundancy between node clusters. Lists of transcripts shown under enriched GO BP terms are ranked and \u2265 2 fold change (top upregulated transcripts shown next to red nodes and downregulated transcripts next to blue nodes). False discovery rate (FDR) = q < 0.001. Gene sets were pre-ranked using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)\nA striking depletion of miR-451a in both YOAD and LOAD was noted in the current study. Previous reports have shown miR-451a to be decreased in the hippocampus [40] , temporal cortex [110] , and CSF [40] in AD. MiR-451a has a potential role in AD pathogenesis through attenuation of ADAM10 expression [111] . It appears that miR-451a is unchanged in LOAD serum [112] and is enriched in neuron expression profiles [113] , suggesting that miR-451a loss in AD is a CNSspecific molecular signature. Since miR-451a is also decreased in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [114] and major depressive disorder [115] and plays a role in peripheral inflammation [116] , future experiments will confirm whether miR-451a is a general marker of neurodegeneration and/or neuroinflammation.\nA previous microarray study reported a modest increase of miR-605-5p in blood mononuclear cells in LOAD [117] , but the authors state that miR-605-5p has low expression in the blood. In the whole CSF fraction, Riancho and colleagues (2017) demonstrated expression in 9/10 HC and 9/10 LOAD samples [41] , suggesting that miR-605-5p could be specifically altered in CSF-derived exosomes. The organ-specific function of miR-605-5p is not well established in the literature. One group has carefully shown that miR-605-5p promotes the P53 stress response and inhibits apoptosis in colorectal carcinoma cells [118] . Another report recently showed evidence that miR-605-5p acts as a tumor suppressor in melanoma by inhibiting INPP4B [119] . Future studies will explore whether there a CNS-specific role for miR-605-5p exists.\nA drawback to our experimental pipeline is the exclusion of a discovery panel on the whole CSF fraction to act as a direct comparison to the CSF-derived exosomes. Hence, future studies will be required to show whether the miRNAs we identified are specifically altered in exosomes alone or are also in other compartments. One previous study suggested that both the extracellular Argonaute2-bound miRNA profile and the exosomal fraction are important, but they found the AUC was higher when the exosomal microRNA was used versus the Argonaute2 microRNA and so concluded that exosomal microRNA may in some way more accurately reflect the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilepsy and status epilepticus [120] . Despite this limitation, our results partially compare to a recent study exploring the miRNA expression profile in the CSF-derived exosomes from LOAD patients [41] . For example, the study of Riancho and colleagues showed that miR-598 was not detected in the whole CSF fraction of AD patients but was detectable in the majority of CSF-derived exosome preparations. We detected miR-598 in all HC and YOAD patients in the current study, with no difference in relative expression between HC and YOAD. Riancho and colleagues also found that miR-9-5p was more likely to be detected in LOAD; however, we only detected this miRNA in 1/12 HC and 4/17 YOAD samples. Although, we used the same Exiqon exosome extraction kits and these differences could be attributable to CSF input volume (300 \u03bcl in Riancho et al. versus 1 ml in our study). Indeed, recent stoichiometric comparison of three commercial precipitation exosome extraction techniques versus ultracentrifugation [121] and subsequent miRNA cleanup [30] demonstrated the relationship between CSF volume input and the exosome particle quantity in the yield. The polymer-based exosome isolation kits demonstrate high yield and overlapping particle size distribution regardless of input [121] . However, the coprecipitation of contaminants in the form of membrane fragments, aggregated proteins, lipoprotein complexes, and/or ribonucleoprotein particles represents caveats to the use of synthetic polymer buffers [122, 123] .\nWe observed a decrease in miR-16-5p in the exosomes from CSF in YOAD. It is known that miR-16 is also a member of the miR-15/107 gene family, targets AD-specific mRNAs, and has been explored as a potential therapeutic target in early AD [124] . Functional studies have uncovered miR-16-5p-mediated inhibition of APP, BACE1, MAPT, and NICASTRIN transcripts [124, 125] indicating that ADrelevant transcripts are directly regulated by miR-16-5p. Our findings here agree with previous observations showing a decrease of miR-16-5p in younger LOAD patient CSF compared to controls [108] and in older LOAD patient serum [44] and miR-16-2 in the CSF-derived exosomes from younger LOAD patients [46] . Previous findings also showed that miR-16-5p is decreased in LOAD hippocampus but not in CSF [42] and its decrease correlated with early Braak staging [44] .\nInterestingly, we did not observe a decrease in miR-16-5p in the exosomes of CSF from our LOAD cohort. This finding may be attributable to differences in the profile of CSFderived exosomes versus whole CSF, serum, and/or brain tissue. Another possibility is that there may be age-dependent factors contributing to miRNA expression in CSF-derived exosomes. The average age of the LOAD cohort at the time of LP in the current study (75.5 \u00b1 4.6 years) versus the previous CSF study (69.5 \u00b1 7.3 years) differs [108] . In addition, differences exist between the average age of our LOAD and HC cohort (66.5 \u00b1 7.7 years). Future studies will consider the longitudinal change of miR-16-5p expression and other miRNAs in AD CSF, serum, and brain tissue. Also, replication of these results in independent and other neurodegenerative disease cohorts will confirm whether a decrease in CSF exosome levels of these miRNAs is specific for younger AD patients.\nOverall, this study uncovered a differential expression profile for both previously identified and novel miRNAs altered in AD and extended these findings to the exosomal compartment in CSF from YOAD and LOAD patients. The expression level of all four miRNAs effectively discriminates YOAD from HC, suggesting the potential for combinatorial value for detection of YOAD versus HC. Since these miRNAs target transcripts and pathways relevant to molecular processes underlying AD and provide some further understanding into the pathophysiological differences between YOAD and LOAD, further functional characterization of these miRNAs may offer new therapeutic avenues for patients with AD."}]
