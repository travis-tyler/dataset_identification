[{"section_title": "", "text": "In 1989, Senator Claiborne Pell, Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Subcommittee on Education, Arts and the Humanities and the person for whom the Pell Grant program is named, voiced his concern that students who successfully completed college were overburdened by large debts. Senator Pell felt that college students were at risk of becoming a \"new class of indentured servants\" whose career choices and personal lives were being distorted by the significant loan debt they had acquired to get an education (Kosterlitz, 1989, p. 921). Senator Pell's sentiment reflects the prevailing national policy of attempting to ensure that the financial aid college students receive does not become such a burden that it constrains their options when they graduate. Despite the sentiment of national policymakers, a growing number of students are accumulating larger debts in pursuit of their bachelor's degrees, and the rate of increase in loan amounts is more than three times the rate of inflation. Table 1 shows that 31.4% more 4th and 5th year seniors attending public colleges and universities relied upon loans to cover their college expenses in 1995 -96 than in 1989 -90, increasing  -90, 1992-93, and 1995-96 (NCES Report 2000 stated that they expected to earn a doctoral degree. 1 But, there appears to be a large gap between the number who expected to attain a doctoral degree and the number who actually pursued either a graduate (master's or doctoral) or first professional degree within a year of receiving their bachelor's degree. During the year immediately after receiving their baccalaureate degrees, only 5% of those who aspired to pursue a doctoral degree enrolled in a doctoral degree program, while 21% enrolled in a master's degree program, 4% enrolled in a first professional degree program, and 70% did not enroll in a graduate or first professional degree program. The rather large gap between the high degree expectations of recent bachelor's degree recipients and their low rate of enrolling in graduate school raises questions about how accessible graduate education is to recent U.S. college graduates. It also raises questions about the role that undergraduate debt and other factors play as potential impediments to immediate entry to graduate or first professional school. Given the increasing reliance upon debt, is graduate school really an immediate option for all who aspire to earn a doctoral degree? Aside from knowing the size of the eligible pool of students for graduate admissions and the number of people who enter graduate programs, very little is known about the access that students have to graduate and first professional school. Little is known for example, about the characteristics or the circumstances that distinguish aspirants for the doctoral degree who enroll immediately in graduate or first professional degree programs from those who do not. One circumstance that may deter some students from applying or enrolling in graduate or professional school is having undergraduate debt. The amount of debt may also be a deterrent for some recent college graduates."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review on the Effect of Undergraduate Debt on the Transition to Graduate School", "text": "Several prominent researchers (Ethington & Smart, 1986;Hearn, 1987;Isaac, Malaney, & Karras, 1992;Malaney & Isaac, 1988) in the 1980s and 1990s excluded the influence of undergraduate debt in their examination of student transitions from college to graduate school. Other scholars (Consortium on Financing Higher Education, 1983Ekstrom, Goertz, Pollack & Rock, 1991;Fox, 1992;Murphy, 1994;Nettles, 1989;Sanford, 1980, Schapiro, O'Malley & Litten, 1991Tsapogas & Cahalan, 1996;Weiler, 1991Weiler, , 1994Wilder & Baydar, 1991) have examined the role of debt in the transition to graduate school, and taken together, they are equivocal about the role that debt plays in students' decisions to enroll in graduate school. One group (Baum & Saunders, 1998;Baum & Schwartz, 1988;Consortium on Financing Higher Education, 1983Ekstrom, Goertz, Pollack, & Rock, 1991;Nettles, 1989;Schapiro, O'Malley, & Litten, 1991;Weiler, 1991Weiler, , 1994 concluded that debt was not a significant factor in students' decisions to enter graduate school. In his study of graduate students at Florida State University, Rutgers University, Ohio State University, and the University of Maryland at College Park, Nettles (1989) examined the variation in entry-level debt burdens among Whites, Hispanics, and African Americans who enrolled in doctoral programs. He reported that 46% of African Americans and 43% of Hispanics compared to 36% of Whites had taken out loans to finance their undergraduate education. Nettles reported that students who took more time off had relatively lower undergraduate debt, but debt did not appear to have a significant relationship to their decision to enter graduate school immediately after graduating from college. In a review of the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 and High School and Beyond (HS&B), Ekstrom, Goertz, Pollack, and Rock (1991) found that undergraduate debt did not significantly affect the propensity of students to apply to or enroll in graduate school. Defining debt of $10,000 or higher in 1982 and 1984, and $12,500 or higher in 1989 as \"high debt, \" Schapiro, O'Malley, & Litten (1991) reported that undergraduate debt influenced neither positively nor negatively student intentions to enroll in graduate school in the arts and sciences for graduates of colleges and universities that were members of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE). 2 Using HS&B, Weiler (1991) found that debt (measured as the sum of the amount borrowed for each year) did not deter students from attending postbaccalaureate degree programs. In another study that examined HS&B, Weiler (1994) found that while the expectation to attend graduate school decreases as the expected amount borrowed increases, the amount borrowed did not have a statistically significant affect on postbaccalaureate attendance. The 1983 COFHE study of 1982 seniors by level of loan debt failed to detect a clear pattern of difference in the consideration of attending graduate school or graduate school attendance. Approximately 15% of students with no loan debt and 15% of students with $10,000 or more of debt entered graduate school in the fall. For those 1982 graduating seniors who planned to delay entry into graduate school, the two primary reasons they reported for their decision to delay were the need for non-academic experiences for personal development (65%), and the need to improve their personal finances (46%). Having very high current educational debts was reported by only 17% of the cases as a reason for delaying their graduate school attendance. The 1987 COFHE follow-up study found that undergraduate debt did not prevent the attainment of further education for 1982 seniors who delayed entry into graduate school, did not lead COFHE seniors to abandon their educational aspirations, or their arts and science degree goals in favor of professional fields. In 1996 COFHE also found that student decisions to attend graduate or first professional school were not deterred by the amount of their debt. In a study of 2,000 borrowers under the Massachusetts Guaranteed Student Loan Program, Baum and Schwartz (1988) found that 35% of the people who decided not to go to graduate school said that concern over borrowing was \"very or extremely important\" in their decision. In a later follow-up study, the 1997 National Student Loan Survey (NASLS), Baum and Saunders (1998) reported that 43% of cases who did not go to graduate school cited the level of their undergraduate debt as extremely or very important in preventing them from going to graduate school, while 28% reported undergraduate debt being unimportant. Baum and Saunders did not find significant differences by race on the influence of student loans. A second group of researchers (Fox, 1992;Tsapogas & Cahalan, 1996;Wilder & Baydar, 1991) found debt to have a significant negative influence on student transition to graduate school. Analyzing a sample of cases who took the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) in 1986 -87, Wilder and Baydar (1991) found that undergraduate debt was a modest deterrent to people applying to graduate school, but not for being accepted or enrolling. Using the Survey of 1985 -86 College Graduates, Fox (1992) reported that undergraduate debt had a modest negative effect upon enrollment in graduate school for his overall sample and for a subsample of women, but was not significant for the subsample of men. In an analysis of the 1993 National Science Foundation's National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG), Tsapogas and Cahalan (1996) found that having undergraduate loan debt had a significant negative effect on the likelihood of attaining a degree or enrolling full-time in graduate school, while the amount of debt had an extremely small negative effect. Their separate analyses of men and women uncovered a negative relationship that having undergraduate debt had upon males only. A third group of researchers (Murphy, 1994;Sanford, 1980) found debt to have a positive affect upon the transition to graduate school. In an analysis of NLS-72, Sanford (1980) learned that when only the effects of loans on graduate school attendance is considered, college graduates with debt, regardless of the amount, were more likely to attend graduate or first professional school than college graduates who did not have loans. Using HS&B, Murphy (1994) found that undergraduate debt had a minimally positive influence upon students' plans to pursue doctoral level graduate work. While researchers over the past 16 years have contributed to our knowledge of the influence of financial indebtedness on the transition, they have not reached a consensus on its relationship to graduate school attendance. It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this collection of work. The literature projects an ambiguous image of the role of indebtedness. For some (Fox, 1992;Tsapogas & Cahalan, 1996;Wilder & Baydar, 1991) debt was found to be an impediment; for others (Murphy, 1994;Sanford, 1980) it was not found to be an impediment; still others (Ekstrom et al., 1991;Nettles, 1989;Schapiro et al., 1991;Weiler, 1991Weiler, , 1994 found it had no effect. How can researchers be so inconsistent in their findings? The answer is found in the data they are analyzing and their research methods. The limitations of the extant research are based on the analysis of samples that do not represent the larger population of students who are making the transition to graduate school (Consortium on Financing Higher Education, 1983Education, , 1988Education, , 1996Isaac et al, 1992;Malaney & Isaac, 1988;Nettles, 1989;Schapiro et al. 1991) and the use of secondary data analysis where neither debt nor access to graduate school were the primary purposes for collecting the data (Ethington & Smart, 1986;Murphy, 1994;Weiler, 1991Weiler, , 1994. This study examines the postbaccalaureate decisions of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who indicated during their senior year of college that they expected to pursue a doctoral degree. The focus is upon the influence of accumulated undergraduate debt upon students' decisions to apply and if accepted, to enroll in graduate or first professional school within a year of graduating from college. Several assumptions were made for these analyses. First, examining the experiences of students in the year immediately after graduating from college is important. One has the choice of examining the long-term decisions or the shortterm decisions. The short term is the focus of this research and it is important because it may provide an explanation of the influence of debt on doctoral degree aspirants' decision-making processes. Implicit in the analyses is the assumption that the students who do not apply or enroll in graduate or first professional school immediately may or may not apply or enroll in the future. Second, the decision to study application to graduate or first professional school is based upon the structure of education in the United States presented in the Digest of Education Statis-tics 1999, which shows that students may progress to the doctoral degree after completing either master's degree study or professional school study (U.S. Department of Education. National Center for Education Statistics, 2000b). By focusing upon how undergraduate debt and other factors relate to graduate or first professional school application and attendance for students who say that they expect to achieve a doctoral degree, this study may help us to explain how debt affects students who are the most likely prospects for entering graduate and professional school. The study addresses the following question: What is the relationship of undergraduate educational indebtedness to the decisions of recent bachelor's degree recipients who expect to earn doctoral degrees, to apply to and if accepted, to enroll in a graduate or first professional degree program immediately after completing their bachelor's degree?"}, {"section_title": "Methodology and Data Analyses", "text": "The Sample The sample for this research is taken from the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) Longitudinal Study of 1992-93 college graduates. It includes recent bachelor's degree recipients who expect to earn a doctoral degree and examines their application to a graduate or first professional school, and if admitted, their enrollment in either a graduate or first professional degree program within the year immediately following their graduation from college with a bachelor's degree. The B&B is a subsample of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), a nationally representative sample of all postsecondary students. NPSAS:93 provided the baseline data for B&B. B&B was designed to be representative of postsecondary students in the United States who completed their bachelor's degrees in the academic year 1992-93. 3 Four criteria were used for selecting students for the sample for this study: (a) students were U.S. citizens, (b) students received their baccalaureate degree between July 1, 1992 and August 31, 1993, (c) students were not American Indians or Alaskan Natives, 4 and (d) students stated in the NPSAS interview that they expected to earn a doctoral degree. From the original B&B sample of 10,080, selecting U.S. citizens reduced the sample to 9,862, receiving a bachelor's degree reduced the sample to 9,734, selecting non-American Indians or Alaskan Natives reduced the sample to 9,613 cases, and expecting to earn a doctoral degree further reduced the sample to the 1,982 cases that constitute the focus of this study."}, {"section_title": "Modeling the Graduate School Attendance/Choice Process", "text": "The conceptual model for this study depicts the relationship of students' academic and personal backgrounds to their transition to graduate and first professional school immediately after completing college. The premise of the model is that undergraduate debt along with students' personal background characteristics, the characteristics of their baccalaureate institution, their college experiences, and their immediate opportunity costs to attend graduate school, individually and collectively influence students' decisions to apply to graduate school and, if accepted, their decision to enroll in graduate school. The model incorporates the critical components of research by Hanson and Litten (1982), Hossler, Braxton and Coopersmith (1989), and Paulsen (1990), on college choice; the research of Ekstrom, et al. (1991), Ethington and Smart (1986), Hearn (1987), Nettles (1989), and Wilder and Baydar (1991) on persistence to graduate school; and the research of Fox (1992), Murphy (1994), Nettles (1989), Sanford (1980), Schapiro et al. (1991), Tsapogas and Cahalan (1996), and Weiler (1991Weiler ( , 1994 on the influence of financial indebtedness. The model is based upon the work of Ekstrom et al. (1991) and Wilder and Baydar (1991). One predictor of enrollment in graduate or first professional school that may offset the influence of undergraduate debt is the offer of financial aid. With the exception of the mixed results of Ekstrom et al. (1991), earlier research (Baird, 1976(Baird, , 1982Butler-Nalin, Sanderson, & Redman, 1983;Ethington & Smart, 1986;McClain, Vance, & Wood, 1984;Remus & Isa, 1983;Wilder & Bayder, 1991) found that receiving financial aid has a strong positive influence on graduate school enrollment. The B&B asked students if they applied for financial aid at any of the graduate schools to which they applied for admission, but the B&B did not collect data to show whether and how much students received. Therefore it is not possible to measure the influence that receiving graduate school financial aid had on the odds of students enrolling in a graduate or first professional degree program unless the analyses are restricted to students' first choice school. The B&B collected information on whether students received offers of financial aid at the first two graduate schools to which they applied. In order to learn about the influence of the offer of financial aid on enrollment decisions two analyses will be presented. The first will be the analysis of students general application and enrollment if accepted in graduate or first professional school without considering the influence of an offer of financial aid. The second will be the analysis of students' application to their first choice graduate or first professional school and their enrollment, if accepted into their first choice graduate or first professional school with the offer of financial aid being included in the analysis. Figure 1 presents the model of student flow into graduate school. The model contains five categories of independent variables that were derived from the literature review and two categories of dependent variables reflecting how students make the transition from undergraduate to graduate school and the factors that contribute to the two steps in the transition. The five categories of independent variables are: (a) personal background, (b) characteristics of the baccalaureate institution, (c) college experiences, (d) immediate opportunity costs to attend graduate or first professional school, and (e) offer of financial aid from the first choice graduate or first professional program if accepted (limited to the second set of analyses). The conceptual model shows the expected relationship of these categories of variables to students' decisions to apply to graduate or first professional school at the end of college, and their enrollment in a graduate or first professional degree program immediately upon receiving a bachelor's degree. The outcome (dependent) variables in the model are: (a) students' application to graduate or first professional school, with a second analysis for application to their first choice institution, and (b) if admitted, student enrollment in either a graduate or first professional degree program, with a second analysis for their first choice institution. The model displays the independent variables in categories simply as a means of illustrating the overall conceptual relational framework. Each independent variable, however, may exert independent influence throughout the model and will be analyzed in that way rather than as part of categories. Variables B&B variables were selected for inclusion in the analyses on the basis of their fit into the seven major categories: (a) personal background, (b) characteristics of the baccalaureate institution, (c) college experiences, (d) immediate opportunity costs to attend graduate or first professional school, (e) offer of financial aid from first choice graduate or first professional program if accepted (this will only be entered for the first choice enrollment regression), (f ) application to a graduate or first professional school, (g) enrollment in a graduate or first professional degree program if applied and admitted (see Table 2).

The dichotomous variables less competitive, noncompetitive, or special and competitive were created with very, highly, or most competitive institutions serving as the reference category. Control is a dichotomous variable with private having a value of 1. College experiences include whether students majored in a pure or applied field, their undergraduate GPA, their satisfaction with the ability of instructors, their satisfaction with the intellectual life of their undergraduate school, their satisfaction with their undergraduate curriculum, their satisfaction with their own intellectual growth, and their undergraduate educational debt. Undergraduate major is classified using Biglan's (1973) pure/applied paradigm (see Appendix for a complete listing). Pure/applied focuses on whether a department emphasizes pure research or the practical application of subject matter. Chemistry is an example of a pure field, while engineering is an example of an applied field. The rationale for this choice is that the Biglan's pure/applied paradigm allows for the classification of fields in a manner that is compatible with Davis' (1964) level of necessity of graduate school. In addition, analysis of the April 1994 activities of B&B students by the Department of Education reported that college graduates who had majored in the arts and sciences (18%) were more likely to enroll in further education full time than those who majored in professional fields (9%) 5 (U.S. Department of Education. National Center for Education Statistics, 1996). Students' undergraduate GPA is measured on a 4.0 scale. Dichotomous variables were created for undergraduate GPA: 2.74 or less, 2.75 to 3.24, 3.25 to 3.74, and 3.75 or higher, which is the reference category. The four student satisfaction measures are each dichotomous variables with one being a yes: satisfaction with the ability of instructors, satisfaction with the intellectual life of the school, satisfaction with course curriculum, and satisfaction with intellectual growth. Students' undergraduate debt is a series of dichotomous variables: $100 to $4,999, $5,000 to $9,999, $10,000 to $14,999, $15,000 or higher and no debt, which is the reference category. The immediate opportunity cost to attend graduate school is measured by students' projected average annual salary in the year following their graduation from college. The earnings projections are based upon the average September 1993 salary offers by major field of study for 1992-93 bachelor's recipients as reported by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (see Appendix). The offer of financial aid variable was created on the basis of three other values: (a) applying to a master's, doctoral, or first professional degree program at their first choice institution, (b) being accepted to their first choice institution, 6 and (c) being offered financial aid by their first choice post-baccalaureate institution. 7 "}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variables", "text": "The transition from undergraduate school to graduate school is comprised of two steps. These two steps are measured as two separate dichotomous variables. The first step is application to a graduate or first professional school. The second step is enrollment in a graduate or first professional program, having been accepted. Two versions of each of the dependent variables are presented for analysis in order to learn about the influence of the offer of financial aid on the graduate and first professional enrollment decision. The general application variable is based on students' general application to graduate or first professional school. The second version of the application variable is restricted to their application to their first choice graduate or first professional school. The first choice application variable was created on the basis of students reporting that (a) they applied to graduate or first professional school and (b) that they applied to a master's, doctoral, or first professional degree program at their first choice school. If cases answered yes to both of these questions, they were coded as applying to a first choice graduate school. The second step is enrolling in a graduate or first professional degree program, having applied and been accepted. The general enrollment variable was created based on students enrolling in a graduate or first professional program, having been accepted. The first choice enrollment variable was created on the basis of students reporting that (a) they were accepted to their first choice graduate or first professional school, (b) they reported being enrolled at their first choice post-baccalaureate institution in 1993 -94, and (c) they enrolled in a master's, doctoral, or first professional program in 1993 -94. In order to determine if students enrolled in their first choice institution, IPEDS identification numbers for their first choice graduate or first professional school (B&B variable GS01CODE) were compared to the IPEDS identification numbers for the three possible institutions that students could have reported being enrolled in 1993 -94 (B&B variables PB01IPED, PB02IPED, PB03IPED)."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Variables", "text": "An important issue in secondary data analysis is to acknowledge missing constructs. One important indicator missing from the analysis is the composition of the financial aid offer (fellowships, research or teaching assistantships, or loans). Therefore, it is not possible to determine the influence that particular types of graduate school aid such as fellowships, research or teaching assistantships, or loans had on the odds of students enrolling in a graduate or first professional degree program. B&B also does not contain information about students' attitude toward educational debt or their behavior with managing their debt (both educational and noneducational). We can only make inferences about their attitudes on educational debt on the basis of their actions. Because B&B is the NCES college senior cohort study, it does not collect a great deal of retrospective data on students' college experiences that could be used to estimate senior year educational expectations. Given the research of Hearn (1987) and Pascarella (1984), who both found that freshman year educational aspirations had a positive influence on educational aspirations in later years, using B&B to estimate a model to predict educational aspirations in the senior year of college would be inappropriate since it would not include important predictor variables. The NCES Beginning Postsecondary Study (BPS) would be a more suitable data base to use for predicting senior year educational expectations. Since the primary focus of our study was to examine the application and enrollment behaviors of students who expressed an interest in earning a doctorate, students were selected for the sample if they stated in their senior year of college that they expect to earn a doctoral degree. This created a nonrandom sample of college graduates who applied to and enrolled in graduate or first professional school. Acceptance to graduate school is the intermediate step between application and enrollment. In B&B, the factors that contribute to the graduate and first professional institutions admission decision are not collected. B&B only collects case reports about whether they were accepted to graduate or first professional school. Consequently, the factors that affect acceptance cannot be adequately determined. A second issue that had to be addressed in constructing variables was how to handle missing data. While GRE scores were included in B&B, only 21.6% of the cases that expect to earn a doctoral degree reported total GRE scores. Hence, GRE scores were not included in the analyses. Because college grade point average and GRE scores are substantially correlated, this omission is not considered problematic. A third issue in creating the variables for analysis was the constraint on creating the dependent variables for application and enrollment. These binary variables compared students who attend graduate or professional school immediately after college with a group that combines two dissimilar groups-those who delay their attendance and those who do not attend as well as those who delay their enrollment and those who do not enroll. Given the inability to distinguish between these two different groups because adequate time has not elapsed, it is not possible to know what the constraining effect of debt may be on these doctoral degree aspirants. For some members of the group the constraining effect of debt will be to postpone their application or enrollment decision, while for others debt may lead them to abandon their doctoral degree aspirations."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "Weights are used to ensure that the sample is representative of the population of recent bachelor's degree recipients who are U.S. citizens, non-American Indians, or Alaskan Natives who expect to earn a doctoral degree. A sample weight was calculated using the design effect from the B&B 93/94 for all students who applied to graduate school (2.21), the B&B nonresponse adjusted weight (bnbwt1) and the mean of the weighting variable for the entire sample. The unweighted sample has 1,982 cases, the weighted sample has 94,909 cases, and the adjusted weighted sample has 1,982 cases. Students will be selected for continuation in the analysis if they (a) apply to graduate or first professional school, and (b) apply to graduate or first professional school and are accepted to graduate or first professional school. The data analyses performed to address the research question are both descriptive and relational. Since the two outcome variables in the model of student post-baccalaureate transitions are dichotomous, logistic regressions are used. Logistic regression is used for predicting the likelihood that an event such as application to graduate or first professional school will occur. The enter method for model selection will be employed. The initial model will contain all the variables presented in Table 2 plus several interaction terms. The variables that have been entered will then be examined to see if they meet removal criteria. The removal criteria will be a p-value greater than 0.05. The interaction terms will first be examined to see if they meet the criteria for removal and then the other variables will be examined. The variable with the highest p-value greater than 0.05 will be removed, and the model will be rerun until no variables meet the criteria for removal. Separate logistic regressions will be presented for application to graduate or first professional school and for enrollment in a graduate or first professional degree program. Each table of results includes the individ-ual parameter estimates, asymptotic standard errors, and the significance level, odds ratios (change in the odds of applying or enrolling) and delta-P statistics (change in the probability of applying) of the estimates (see Petersen, 1985, andCabrera, 1994, for details about the delta-P statistic). The results of the logistic regressions are presented as odds ratios for the likelihood of an event occurring. Odds ratios greater than one mean that the odds of an event occurring are increased, while odds ratios less than one mean that the odds of an event occurring are decreased. When the odds ratio is one, the odds are unchanged (Menard, 1995)."}, {"section_title": "Findings General Process of Applying and Enrolling in Graduate or First Professional School", "text": "Descriptive analyses. A total of 1,982 of the cases were U.S. citizens who received a bachelor's degree, were not American Indians or Alaskan Natives, and who expected to earn a doctorate. Approximately 52% of the sample applied to graduate or first professional school (see Figure  2). Of the 1,036 students who applied to graduate or first professional school, the overwhelming majority (86.1%) were accepted (n = 890). Of the 890 students who applied and were accepted, 67.9% enrolled in either a graduate or first professional degree program as their highest degree program after receiving their bachelor's degrees (n = 603). Of the 603 students who enrolled in graduate or first professional degree programs, 70% enrolled in a master's degree program, 18% enrolled in a doctoral degree program, and 12% enrolled in a first professional degree program. Among the 285 (32.1%) who did not enroll in a graduate or first professional degree program, 57 (20%) enrolled in other educational programs, such as a nondegree program or an associate's degree program, and 228 (80%) reported that they were not enrolled in an educational program. Table 3 presents the analyses that show that undergraduate debt has an effect on students' decisions to apply to graduate or first professional school. Students with $100 to $4,999, $5,000 to $9,999, or $10,000 to $14,999 were equally likely to not apply or apply to graduate or first professional school ([49.4% vs. 50.6%], [52.4% vs. 47.6%], [53.4% vs. 46.6%]). Students with $15,000 or higher in debt were less likely to apply to graduate or first professional school (53.9% vs. 46.1%). In contrast, nearly 59% of the students without undergraduate debt applied to graduate or first professional school compared to 41% who did not.

The difference in enrolling in graduate or first professional programs between students with educational debt and students without was not statistically significant. Regression analyses. Before the logistic regressions were executed, a linear regression was run for both the application and enrollment models using the variables listed in Table 2 to conduct collinearity diagnostics (Menard, 1995). In both the application model and the enrollment model, all of the tolerances exceeded 0.70, indicating no serious problem of collinearity.

The chi-square statistic for overall fit although presented (X 2 = 176.646) and significant (p < 0.001) is not a valid measure of goodness of fit for the model because of the sparseness of the data. This particular statistic is not an acceptable procedure when assessing goodness of fit when the number of covariate classes is approximately equal to the number of observations, which occurs in this dataset (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 1989, pp. 138-139). While the \u22122 LL statistic is presented (2255.502), Menard (1995) contends that the \"Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit index may have some advantage over D M (\u22122 LL) when the number of possible combinations of values of the independent variables is equal (or approximately equal) to the number of cases in the analyses but other-wise tends to produce results consistent with D M \" (Menard, 1995, pp. 20 -21).

Students with debt of $5,000 or higher are significantly less likely to apply to graduate or first professional school than their peers who did not have educational debt (see Table 4). Forty-six percent of the 1992-93 college graduates who expected to earn a doctoral degree did not have educational debt; the other 54% accumulated an average debt of $10,691. Among the 1992-93 college graduates, students with accumulated educational debt greater than $5,000 represented 41% of the students who expected to earn a doctoral degree. Of the students who have debt and expect to earn a doctoral degree 75% had educational debt greater than $5,000 (see Table 3). It is important to know who the students are who have educational debt. If we know who these students are, then we may be able to address the obstacles that hinder students with educational debt from applying to graduate or first professional school. Table 8 shows that compared to students without educational debt, students who have educational debt are more likely to have parents who have not earned a bachelor's degree. Nearly a third of the students who have less than $5,000 in debt, 31.7% of student with $5,000 to $9,999 in debt, 42% of students with $10,000 to $14,999, and 28.1% of students with debt of $15,000 or more have parents whose highest education level is high school or less. By contrast, 19.5% of the students who have no educational debt had parents whose highest education level is high school or less. In comparison, 40.2% of students without educational debt have parents whose educational attainment is an advanced degree, whereas approximately 25% of students who reported having educational debt have parents with an advanced degree. Important differences are also found when family income is considered (see Table 9). Approximately 41% of the students who have less than $5,000 in educational debt, 44.6% of students with $5,000 to $9,999 in educational debt, 46.8% of students with educational debt of $10,000 to $14,999 and 50.4% of students with $15,000 or higher in educational debt reported 1991 family incomes of less than $24,999 compared to 18.6% of students without educational debt. At the other end of the income continuum, 2% of students with educational debt had family incomes of $100,000 or higher compared to 17% of students without educational debt. This shows that educational debt is related to family income. The lower the family income, the more likely recent college graduates are to have educational debt. This study has found that 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who expected to earn a doctoral degree appeared not to be adversely affected by financial indebtedness in enrolling in graduate or first professional degree programs if they apply and are accepted. The offer of financial aid by the student's first choice graduate or first professional program was a significant predictor of enrolling. This finding suggests that offers of financial aid may mitigate the effect of having educational debt on students' decisions to continue their educational careers. Because the B&B does not have financial aid packages or amounts awarded to students who do not enroll, it is not possible to examine the precise effects of financial aid. One surprising finding in this study was that students with lower opportunity costs defined as foregone earnings are less likely to apply to or enroll in graduate or first professional school than their peers with higher foregone earnings. This finding contradicts undergraduate college-choice research (Bishop, 1977, Fuller, Manski, & Wise, 1982Kohn, Manski, & Mundel, 1976;Manski & Wise, 1983)  students choosing between enrollment in a college or university or selecting other alternatives, such as work or military service. The collegechoice research posits that an individual student will select college or university attendance if the perceived benefits of attendance outweigh the perceived benefits of the noncollege alternative. Two studies (Tsapogas &Cahalan, 1996, andWeiler, 1991) examined the influence of foregone income on enrollment in graduate or professional school. Using HS&B, Weiler (1991) constructed a foregone income variable to measure the income that cases forego when they enroll in graduate or professional school. Foregone income had a negative effect upon the decision to enroll in a master's program but was not a significant effect upon enrolling in graduate or professional programs. Tsapogas and Cahalan (1996) estimated foregone income using the average salary for those employed full-time by major by sex. They found that students who majored in fields where they were able to command relatively high salaries without graduate degrees were less likely to go to graduate school. Separate analyses for males and females yielded similar findings. Tsapogas and Cahalan also found that bachelor's degree holders in the life sciences, social sciences, and the physical sciences were more likely to enroll in graduate studies to acquire further education before they began a career compared to their peers with degrees in engineering or the computer sciences. On the basis of this research, students with relatively high foregone income can be less likely to apply or less likely to enroll in graduate or professional school than students with comparatively low foregone incomes. Perhaps Hauptman's (1986) observation that the pool of applicants and their perception of labor market conditions, as well as the availability of financial aid, affect who goes to graduate school begins to shed light on the multiple facets of the decision-making process of selecting graduate school."}, {"section_title": "Applications for Educational Policymakers", "text": "The effect of educational indebtedness on the transition to graduate school for U.S. citizens is an important consideration for educational policy makers. In 1976 -77, nonresident aliens represented 11% of the doctoral degree recipients at U.S. graduate schools, by 1993 -94 their representation had more than doubled (26%). This raises questions about whether American graduate and professional education are becoming less accessible to American students than for their counterparts from abroad. U.S. educational policymakers are in a position to make doctoral education an appealing choice and a plausible option for recent college graduates. On the basis of the finding from this study that undergraduate indebtedness is a deterrent to application to graduate or first professional school for 41% of the doctoral degree aspirants in 1992-93, policymakers could argue that the federal student loan program, as it was constructed in the early 1990s, does not meet the requirements established by Senator Pell that debt not be an impediment to students. The federal government appears to have provided student loans that enabled students to gain access to college, but in this study, having educational loans greater than $5,000 prohibited 1992-93 college graduates who expect to earn a doctoral degree from pursuing further their educational goals in the year immediately after they graduated from college. This is particularly important in light of the shift in balance of federal financial aid policy from grants to loans. Table 1 shows that the increase in the percentage of students who borrowed from 1992-93 to 1995 -96 was 32% for seniors at public 4-year institutions and 18% for seniors at private institutions, while the percentage change in amount borrowed over the same time period was a 57% increase at public institutions and a 45% increase at private institutions. Policymakers may want to heed the finding that lower socioeconomic students who aspire to doctoral degree programs are choosing not to make the transition to graduate or first professional school. In addition, on the basis of the findings from this study policymakers could examine sex and race as other factors that contribute to doctoral degree aspirants not making the transition to graduate or first professional school. Men were more likely to apply than women. African Americans were more likely to apply than Whites, but they were less likely to enroll in their first choice graduate or first professional school than Whites. While it may be inappropriate to include such demographic characteristics as race and sex criteria for type and amount of loan and debt burden, the evidence from this research suggests that policymakers should take a closer look at strategies for encouraging women and African Americans to apply to graduate or first professional school immediately after receiving their bachelor's degrees given the different influence that debt appears to have upon their decisions to apply for graduate and first professional school. Since African Americans are so severely underrepresented in graduate and first professional degree programs, this research lends support for the need to at the very least continue programs that have been successful in encouraging underrepresented minorities and women like the Patricia Roberts Harris fellowships 11 and also justifies establishing additional programs to reduce racial effects of debt burden. Policymakers should be disturbed by the findings of the negative influence of loans for 41% of the college graduates of 1992-93. It is important to conduct routine analyses of the effect of loans upon students' post-baccalaureate educational opportunities in order to assess whether student loan debt is becoming more of a burden than it is intended to be.
