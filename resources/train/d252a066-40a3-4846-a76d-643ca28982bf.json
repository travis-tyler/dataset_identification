[{"section_title": "", "text": ". In the laboratory, these age differences in episodic memory are manifested by a reduced ability to learn and retrieve both non-verbal and verbal material, such as a list of words 2 . Substantial age-related differences are also seen in tasks involving working memory 3, 4 , attention [5] [6] [7] and task switching [8] [9] [10] , all of which can be considered as types of high level 'executive' functions. Older adults are also more susceptible to the effects of distracting interference during cognitive tasks 11, 12 and have a generally slower processing speed 13 . Nevertheless, some aspects of cognition are maintained with age, such as semantic memory (the accumulation of knowledge about the world 14, 15 ) and emotional regulation 16, 17 . In addition, age differences in cognition are not immutable: for example, the experimental conditions under which memory is studied in older adults can be modified so that age differences are reduced or eliminated 18 . A challenge in this field has been to understand the brain mechanisms that might underlie better or worse performance in old adults.\nIt is on this challenge that functional and structural neuroimaging studies of ageing have focused, and in the past decade, functional MRI (fMRI) studies have provided ample evidence of age differences in task-related brain activity 19, 20 . However, the interpretation of these differences is difficult, as sometimes brain activity is reduced in older adults relative to younger adults and sometimes it is increased. Decreased brain activity has typically been interpreted as a reflection of cognitive deficits in older adults 21 , and increased activity has often been interpreted as compensatory 22 . However, other mechanisms may also explain age-related increases of brain activity, including a lack of efficiency in the use of neural resources or a reduction in the selectivity of responses, which is known as dedifferentiation 23 .\nAnother issue is how brain activity is related to other aspects of brain ageing, such as changes in structure (volumes or white matter myelination, for example) or changes in neurotransmitters. There is also the question of how age differences in brain function might be affected by undetected neuropathological changes due to dementing illnesses. That is, some otherwise healthy older adults might eventually be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and the 'silent' pathological processes in their brains might account for some of the age differences reported in the literature. The purpose of this Review is to cover some recent developments in the field that address these long-standing issues and to discuss some interesting new trends in this area of research.\nBefore reviewing this work on cognitive ageing and the brain, it is important to note that there is general consensus that the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal obtained from fMRI is a reasonable, although indirect, index of neural activity, especially the synaptic activity reflected in local field potentials 24, 25 . In regard to the use of fMRI to study ageing, peak stimulus-related BOLD responses are similar in young and older adults [26] [27] [28] , although some work has shown that the magnitude of the BOLD response can be reduced in older adults, at least in some brain regions 29 . In addition, it is important to keep in mind that there are alterations in the cerebral vasculature with age, and these have the potential to influence the BOLD signal in as yet unknown ways 30, 31 . Although more research is required to understand the impact of ageing on the physiology underlying the BOLD signal, the relatively small age differences noted in the properties of these signals and recent work suggesting a small"}, {"section_title": "Working memory", "text": "The short-term retention and utilization of information.

In this Review, current trends and unresolved issues in the cognitive neuroscience of ageing are discussed.\nvascular contribution to BOLD signals in older adults during cognitive tasks 32 encourage the continued use of this technique to study cognitive ageing."}, {"section_title": "Compensation in the older brain", "text": "An early idea in the literature was that older adults (that is, those above the age of 65) might be able to engage some brain areas, particularly the frontal lobes, above the level seen in younger adults (in their twenties) to compensate for impaired function elsewhere in the brain 22 . In these early studies, it was noted that older adults had more activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during memory tasks relative to younger adults [33] [34] [35] , which was thought to compensate for reduced activity in visual processing regions 22, 36 (a phenomenon recently termed the 'posterior-anterior shift with ageing' (PASA) 36 ). This PFC activity was often bilateral in the older adults on tasks for which younger adults typically showed unilateral PFC activity, leading to the idea that the increased bilaterality of PFC activation in older adults reflects a compensatory mechanism that can aid cognitive performance 37 . A compensatory interpretation is often invoked when older adults show more activity in a brain region than younger adults when they perform a task at the same level as younger adults 38 , or when increased activity is positively correlated with performance in older adults but not in younger adults 35, 36, [39] [40] [41] . Several researchers have suggested that compensatory mechanisms might still be involved, even if performance in older adults is impaired 42 . For example, increased activity in an older adult might not be associated with preserved performance on a given task to the level seen in a young adult, but this performance might be even worse without the over-recruitment. Thus, despite the continued attention that this idea has received, it is still not clear exactly which regions might act in a compensatory manner or under which conditions this might occur 43, 44 . Several recent papers have provided further evidence in favour of the compensatory hypothesis. One paper examined age differences in inhibition using a series of tasks that assessed the ability to inhibit prepotent responses 45 . Older adults displayed more activity in a set of dorsal PFC and parietal regions, sometimes called the dorsal attention network 46, 47 , compared with younger adults. Importantly, activity in these attention-related regions correlated with better inhibition only in older adults. This result is consistent with the idea of a compensatory mechanism whereby additional activity in task-relevant regions increases the ability of older adults to carry out the task. Similarly, another experiment examined face perception 48 and found a set of regions in the right PFC and occipital cortex where increased activity was associated with better face recognition in older adults but not in a younger group. Furthermore, in a task requiring attention to right and left visual fields 49 , only old adults showed increased activity in the bilateral PFC that was positively correlated with better performance. Interestingly, studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have also provided some support for the idea that increased bilateral PFC activation is beneficial for performance in older adults. Two studies have shown that using TMS to reduce activity in either the left PFC during encoding or the right PFC during retrieval reduces memory performance in younger adults but has less effect in older adults, presumably because the unstimulated hemisphere can support the function when the other is inactivated 50, 51 . Therefore, these studies all suggest that older adults can recruit higher levels of brain activity than young adults (often in the PFC) and that this additional activity can aid the performance of the old adults who are best able to engage it.\nBy contrast, other work has provided evidence that over-recruitment of brain activity does not necessarily lead to better task performance. For example, some researchers 42, 52, 53 have suggested that when performance is matched between age groups, over-recruitment reflects less efficient use of neural resources in the older group, not compensation. In addition, more activation in old adults can sometimes be associated with poorer, not better, performance 54 . Recent studies have reported greater activity in the PFC during memory encoding 55 or retrieval 56 in older adults, both of which were correlated with poorer memory. Similarly, higher activity in a distributed set of regions, including the PFC and parietal cortex, was found to be correlated with slower and more variable reaction times on a set of visual tasks in old adults compared to young adults 57, 58 . To complicate matters further, some of these regions associated with slower responses in older adults are very similar to the frontoparietal regions reported to support better inhibitory function in older adults 45 (see above), suggesting that the association between activity in a given brain region and performance in older adults is task-specific, response-specific (for example, accuracy versus response time) or both (FIG. 1) .\nTogether, these results suggest that increased activity in older relative to younger adults can be associated with better performance on some tasks, but that this additional activity is not always compensatory (in the sense that it is directly related to better task performance). In some cases, over-recruitment of brain areas may reflect a greater demand on neural resources or less efficient use of them, and may or may not be related specifically to individual differences in behaviour. One explanation for this is the 'partial compensation' hypothesis 55 , whereby over-recruitment of the right PFC during memory encoding may aid old adults in carrying out the encoding task because of less effective use of the left PFC, which would normally carry out this task 21, 59, 60 . However, this additional right PFC activity during encoding cannot compensate for a reduction in encoding effectiveness of the left PFC, and so it does not provide a benefit for subsequent memory of the encoded items. This is similar to the idea that over-recruitment might help cognition in a general way but may not be related to performance on a specific task 42 . Regardless, the papers cited in this section indicate that one should be careful about interpreting age-related increases in brain activity as being compensatory without sufficient evidence from behaviour to support such an interpretation. Nature Reviews | Neuroscience Potential explanations for compensatory activity. One idea is that older adults shift from proactive strategies early in a decision process to reactive strategies that occur later. Support for this idea was reported in an experiment 61 that found PFC activity in young adults occurred during the early phase of memory retrieval trials and PFC activity in older adults occurred during the later phase. Another experiment examining task switching found that younger adults showed sustained PFC activity throughout the period in which they had to switch between tasks, whereas older adults showed transient increases to cues, indicating that a switch was required 62 . This pattern suggests that cognitive control is engaged differently with ageing, and also supports the notion of a shift from proactive control to a more reactive strategy that occurs in response to task demands. A similar proactive-reactive age difference was reported for the medial temporal lobes (MTLs) in older adults during a memory task 63 . Younger adults had more activity in these regions during preparation for memory retrieval, whereas older adults showed more activity during retrieval. These studies suggest that a shift in the timing of resource engagement is required to deal with the influence of age on proactive strategies that make these less effective or accessible, and that compensation in ageing may have a temporal component to it.\nAnother idea to explain compensatory activity is the 'compensation-related utilization of neural circuits hypothesis' (CRUNCH) 64 . The idea of CRUNCH is that more neural resources are recruited by older adults at low levels of cognitive load -that is, when tasks are easier -than by younger adults, who do not need them 53 . At higher levels of load, this compensatory mechanism is no longer effective, leading to equivalent or less activation in older adults relative to young adults. Data consistent with this idea have been reported in the PFC alone 65 and in both the PFC and parietal cortex 66, 67 during working memory tasks that varied in the number of items that had to be kept in mind. In these studies, older adults had more activation at low levels of working memory load, where performance was equivalent to that of younger adults, but less activity and lower accuracy at higher loads. This kind of result also has been found during episodic memory tasks 68 : younger adults showed recruitment of bilateral PFC during a difficult version of the memory task, whereas older adults showed activation of these areas for both easy and difficult versions of the task. All of these studies are consistent with CRUNCH (FIG. 2) , which suggests that the relationship between brain activity and cognitive load is 'S' shaped and plateaus at higher levels of load regardless of age. The older adult curve would be shifted to the left relative to younger adults, such that older adults would have greater brain activity at lower levels of load and reach their plateau at levels where younger adults are still able to increase their brain activity. According to this hypothesis, old adults engage neural resources, such as the PFC, at lower task loads to compensate for less effective use of these resources, or perhaps because of degraded input to the PFC 64 , thus shifting the curve leftward. Although this idea has considerable appeal, and may be able to account for both the age-related increases and decreases of brain activity described in the literature, it is not clear whether one would need to see recruitment of a unique region in older adults in order to interpret this activity as compensatory. That is, in older adults, the engagement at lower load of the same region that is active in younger adults at higher loads might reflect an increase in the 'normal' inter-individual variability in the brain-load function that must exist even in young adults, rather than compensation per se."}, {"section_title": "Dedifferentiation", "text": "The concept of dedifferentiation was originally proposed to explain the increased correlations among behavioural measures in older adults 69 , but was adopted by neuroimagers because it also seemed to characterize brain activity in older adults. Early examples included bilateral prefrontal activity associated with abilities that typically yield lateralized activity in younger adults 37, 70 , more diffuse activation patterns 71 , and less selective activity in task-relevant regions across a variety of tasks 22, 72, 73 . Like the idea of compensation, dedifferentiation continues to be a viable explanation for some age differences in brain activity.\nOne way to investigate dedifferentiation is to compare the patterns of activity across tasks to see whether Figure 1 | Increased brain activity in older adults may be associated with better or worse task performance. This figure summarizes the results of two studies that differ in how increased brain activity in older adults was associated with task performance. In one of these studies (study 1), the regions shown in green showed a correlation between more activity and slower reaction times on perceptual and working memory tasks in older adults 57 . In another experiment (study 2), several brain regions (indicated in purple) showed a correlation between more activity and more accurate performance in a go/ no-go task requiring inhibition of responses 45 . Note that some regions (coloured purple and green) showed an association with better performance in study 2 and the opposite effect in study 1. This discrepancy highlights the complexity of trying to relate brain activity in older adults to their behaviour, and indicates that the specific relationships between regional brain activity and task performance in older adults depend on the task demands or on the behavioural measure that is assessed (or both).

This kind of result was found in an experiment contrasting implicit memory for a sequence of repeated visual stimuli to explicit memory for a list of words 74 . Young adults showed more activity in the hippocampus for explicit learning and more activity in the striatum for implicit learning. Older adults showed equivalent activation in these regions during the two tasks. Another experiment 75 also found that implicit memory in younger adults was accompanied by increased activity in the striatum and decreased activity in the hippocampus, whereas older adults showed increases in both. Similarly, older adults are reported to have less distinctive activity in the visual cortex during perception and working memory tasks 76, 77 . In both kinds of task, old adults had less distinctive patterns of activity in the occipital cortex than young adults, which is consistent with dedifferentiation. Interestingly, distinctiveness in PFC and parietal regions was higher in old adults compared to young adults, which was interpreted as compensation. In another study 78 , young adults were found to have unique patterns of activity during the retrieval of three different kinds of memory content: autobiographical memory (personally relevant), episodic memory (not personally relevant but related to stimuli seen during the experiment) and semantic memory (world knowledge). These included activity in the MTLs during autobiographical retrieval, in the dorsolateral PFC and parietal regions during episodic retrieval, and in the left temporal cortex during retrieval of semantic memories. These patterns of activity were also seen in old adults but were less distinct for the autobiographical and episodic conditions, which is consistent with reported age differences in autobiographical and episodic memory but maintained, or even increased, semantic memory with age. Finally, less selective responses to specific categories of visual stimuli have also been reported 79 , and are associated with measures of task switching and working memory in old adults 80 . Thus, all of these studies indicate that young adults have activation patterns that are typically quite selective for the particular stimulus features or task demands involved, whereas in older adults activation can be much less distinct, which is consistent with the idea of dedifferentiation across cognitive processes. These studies further suggest that the loss of selective brain responses may be a marker of a more general cognitive disruption.\nAnother way to assess dedifferentiation is to use adaptation, which is a reduction in the response of a given brain region (or regions) when a stimulus is presented repeatedly relative to the first presentation 81 . Several recent studies have used this method to look at selectivity of brain responses in ageing. One assessed activity in the region of the brain that is most responsive to faces, the fusiform face area (FFA) 82 , in response to faces that were the same, that had been morphed by varying amounts (that is, faces that were similar) or that were different 83 . Young adults showed more FFA activity during the presentation of morphed faces than for the same face shown repeatedly, indicating that the FFA treated morphed faces as 'different' even though they were relatively similar to each other. By contrast, the older adults showed equivalent activity for same and morphed faces. Moreover, discrimination thresholds for distinguishing same from different faces were correlated with the degree of adaptation in the FFA across younger and older adults, indicating that this adaptation was important for behaviour. A similar study 48 assessed adaptation in the FFA during the presentation of faces that also varied in viewpoint (right or left orientation). Young adults showed the least activity when the same face was seen in the same viewpoint, more activity when the face or the viewpoint changed, and the most activity when both the face and viewpoint changed. Older adults showed no differences in activity in FFA across the conditions and performed worse than young adults on a face-matching task involving changes in viewpoint. Adaptation in the auditory domain also has been examined 84 and, like visual adaptation, is seen more prominently in younger than in older adults. These experiments show that when adaptation is used to examine differentiation of responses in regions of cortex that respond to specific features of stimuli, regardless of The function relating the change in brain activity (measured by functional MRI during a task of interest) to levels of cognitive load is shown for young adults, old adults with a low risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and old adults with a high risk of developing dementia. The function in low-risk older adults would be shifted to the left relative to that seen in younger adults. At relatively low levels of cognitive load this shift would result in higher activity in older relative to younger adults (green shaded area). However, activity in older adults would reach its peak and level off while younger adults' activity is still increasing, so that at higher load levels there would be no age difference in activity or younger adults would have higher activity (red shaded area). A similar effect would be seen when high-risk older adults are compared to low-risk older adults -higher activity in high-risk groups relative to low-risk groups at low levels of cognitive load (purple shaded area), with the reverse seen at higher levels of load. This hypothesized set of load-dependent functions could explain why studies have reported both under-and over-recruitment in older adults compared to young adults and in highrisk older adults compared to low-risk older adults."}, {"section_title": "Functional connectivity", "text": "A measure of how activity within a network of brain regions is correlated, or how activity in a particular brain area is correlated with the rest of the brain."}, {"section_title": "Delayed match-to-sample task", "text": "Presentation of a stimulus (the sample) followed by a delay of several seconds, and then presentation of one or more stimuli that have to be judged as the same or different from the sample.\nDefault network (DN) .

One way of doing this is to measure the functional connectivity of a given brain region or set of regions 85, 86 . Several recent studies have looked at specific functional connections during a task and how these are affected by age. One study examined changes in brain activity during a working memory task with varying degrees of difficulty 87 and found that young adults had load-dependent increases of activity in the PFC. Older adults showed relatively high levels of PFC activity across all load levels (consistent with CRUNCH, see above), and weaker functional connectivity between the premotor cortex and a left dorsolateral PFC region. Another study addressed age differences in the resolution of interference during working memory for scenes using a delayed match-to-sample task 88 . Interference was introduced by presenting a face during the delay period and asking participants to make a gender and age judgement about it. Connectivity was measured between a brain region that responds preferentially to scenes (the parahippocampal place area (PPA) 89 ) and a region of the PFC thought to be important for resolving interference. In young adults, the correlation between activity in the PPA and PFC was disrupted when the face was presented but returned to pre-interruption levels after the face was removed, suggesting that the resumption of PPA-PFC functional connectivity resolved the interference effect. Older adults showed a similar disruption of PPA-PFC functional connectivity, but the effect persisted after the face was removed, suggesting a deficient ability to dynamically modulate network connectivity, which is consistent with the poorer performance of the older adults on the task in the presence of the interfering face. Both of these studies highlight the importance of functional connectivity between task-relevant regions and the influence of age on these connections, which in turn might affect behaviour.\nAge differences in functional connectivity during episodic memory tasks have been studied using a verbal recognition task 90 . Old adults had reduced functional connectivity within a hippocampal-parietotemporal network relative to young adults, but increased connectivity within a parahippocampal-frontal network. This result was interpreted as evidence that older adults compensate for hippocampal deficits by relying more on the parahippocampal cortex. Similar results have been reported in studies that measured brain activity during successful encoding of words 91 , scenes 92 or objects 93 by comparing encoding activity for subsequently remembered versus forgotten stimuli. In these studies, functional connectivity during successful encoding between MTL regions and posterior regions, such as the occipital cortex, was weaker in old adults, but connections between the MTL and the PFC were stronger in the older adults compared to a younger group. The results of these studies are reminiscent of the PASA effect involving more PFC activity in conjunction with less occipital activity 36 , and suggest that successful memory encoding in older adults might be mediated by similar posteriorto-anterior shifts in the functional connectivity of memory-related regions in the MTLs.\nFunctional connectivity has also been studied using attentional tasks. One recent study 94 showed that attention to specific task-related cues was associated with activation of the dorsal PFC and parietal attentionrelated regions in both younger and older adults, but functional connectivity of these regions was higher in young adults than for older adults. Interestingly, increasing cue-related functional connectivity was associated with more efficient performance on the task. In another study 95 attention and expectancy were manipulated by predictively cueing which type of stimulus would be presented in a working memory task. When the cue indicated that a picture of a face would be presented, young adults showed greater functional connectivity between the FFA and dorsal attention regions compared to older adults, which was consistent with their greater memory for predictively cued faces. Both of these studies suggest that weakened functional connectivity between PFC and parietal regions may explain the reduced ability of older adults to attend to and make use of stimuli in the environment. In general, the studies in this section suggest that task-relevant functional connections between specific brain regions can be disrupted with age and that these disruptions have a negative impact on task performance.\nAnother recent trend in the neuroimaging literature is to examine functional connectivity within particular large-scale brain networks, such as the default network (DN), which is active when people are resting and engaged in spontaneous thought [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] . In young adults, DN regions maintain strong functional interconnections during tasks requiring self-reference or theory of mind 101, 102 and also during the resting state 103, 104 . Several studies have found that the reduction of DN activity during externally driven cognitive tasks is less pronounced in old adults, relative to young adults 58, [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] . Functional connectivity of the DN also is reduced with age during working memory tasks 113 and during periods of rest 105, [114] [115] [116] . These reductions in task-related deactivation and functional connectivity are seen in the two regions that are thought to be the major nodes of the DN, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ventromedial PFC 117 , as well as in other DN regions, such as the MTLs and inferior parietal lobes (FIG. 3) . Interestingly, intrinsic connectivity during the resting state among nodes of the DN is related to the performance of older individuals on a variety of cognitive tasks 105, 106, 111, 118 . Given that DN modulation is associated with the degree of task difficulty and performance 119, 120 , a deficit in the ability to modulate DN activity and functional connectivity with advancing age may be a mechanism for deficient resource allocation to the task at hand, accounting for some age differences in cognitive performance 108 . Factors influencing brain activity An important issue in understanding age differences in brain activity is how these are related to other factors that are affected by ageing and that influence brain function, such as brain structure. It has been known for some time that grey matter structures in the brain undergo changes with ageing, such as reduced volume and thinning of the cortex, particularly in the frontal lobes 121, 122 ."}, {"section_title": "Box 1 | Measuring activity in brain networks", "text": "There is currently much interest in using neuroimaging to assess brain networks, and a number of methods have emerged in recent years for identifying such networks and measuring individual or group differences in network integration and activity. Most of these methods are based on correlations or covariance between regional measures of activity obtained with functional MRI (fMRI) (or some other neuroimaging technique), and they range from relatively simple assessments of correlations between the time courses of two or more brain regions 105 to more complex multivariate approaches that assess brain-wide patterns of connectivity, such as independent component analysis 116 or partial least squares 198, 199 . Another approach is that of graph theory 200 , which uses the number of correlations that characterize various regions to identify areas with large numbers of connections (hubs) and to cluster together subgroups of regions with strong connectivity inside larger collections of areas. Some have attempted to design methods that can assign temporal or functional causality, such as dynamic causal modelling 201 and Granger causality analysis 202 , but these have been somewhat controversial 203 . An example of the pair-wise correlation approach is shown in the figure (panel a) 105 . In this study, the time course of resting activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, a main node of the default network (DN), was correlated with the time course of activity in the other primary network node, the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) (these regions are shown as yellow circles on the brain image in panel a). The correlation values are shown (panel a) for a group of older adults (green dots) and younger adults (red dots). Not only are the correlations lower in older adults relative to younger adults, they are also reduced with age even in the older group (note regression line shown in green). Studies assessing whole-brain functional connectivity have shown age differences in global DN functional connectivity 58 (FIG. 3) , suggesting weaker network integration overall in older adults. Functional connectivity in the DN (and other networks) is weakened further in older adults with dementia 180, 204 . However, recent work has shown that some imaging artefacts that are more common in older adults, such as the influence of motion in the scanner 205 , can weaken functional connectivity, so issues such as this need to be examined further.\nStructural connections appear to be important for at least some of the functional connectivity seen in brain networks 206 . For example, the posterior cingulate cortex is a hub for structural connections 207 as well as functional connections in the DN 117 , and DN regions are strongly connected structurally 208 . In terms of ageing, older adults with better-maintained white matter show stronger functional connectivity 49 . In addition, life experience can influence this relationship between structure and function in older adults. Recently, it was shown that bilingualism was associated with better white matter integrity as well as more distributed patterns of functional connectivity in older adults 209 . Bilingual older adults had better white matter integrity in a number of tracts, including the corpus callosum, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging (see panel b in the figure, which shows white matter tracts in green on two representative structural images, and the areas with greater integrity in bilinguals (Bi) than in monolinguals (Mono) in red). The bilingual older adults also had stronger resting functional connectivity between a region of the inferior PFC (circled in panel b) and posterior brain regions (red areas in panel c, where brain images correspond to the slices seen in panel b) compared to age-and education-matched monolinguals, whereas monolinguals had stronger functional connectivity within PFC areas (blue and green regions, panel c). As older bilinguals typically show better cognitive control than monolinguals 210 , this finding suggests that better-maintained white matter structure and more distributed functional connectivity support maintained cognitive Integrity of white matter, which is typically assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 123 , is also reduced in old adults compared to young adults [124] [125] [126] . In addition to structural changes, age reductions in neurotransmitter binding potential and receptor density have been found for both dopamine [127] [128] [129] and serotonin 130, 131 . Finally, the incidence of dementing illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease increases with age 132 , making the impact of risk factors for Alzheimer's disease in healthy older adults an area of interest.\nBrain structure. There is a fairly extensive literature on age differences and decline in grey and white matter structures in the brain, especially in the frontal lobes 133, 134 . A longitudinal study 135 showed that both the hippocampal volume and integrity of white matter in the corpus callosum were reduced in older adults and correlated with declining memory performance. Some studies 49, 55 have found that age differences in activation within the PFC were mediated by white matter integrity, such that more intact white matter was related to more activation, but others have failed to find this effect 94, 136 . Despite this inconsistency in results, the use of DTI to assess white matter integrity holds considerable promise for the study of cognitive ageing, particularly as the integrity of specific tracts has been shown to be related to speed of performance in older adults 137 or to accuracy of performance [138] [139] [140] . Of particular interest will be studies examining the relations among white matter integrity underlying specific functional networks, functional connectivity in those networks and how these measures are related to behaviour in older adults. For example, it has been shown that stronger functional connectivity in a network involving the inferior PFC was associated both with better integrity of the corpus callosum and faster response times in older adults 141 \nReduced functional activation also has been associated with age differences in grey matter volumes 142 . One recent study 143 assessed the relationship between age reductions in grey matter volume of a region in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and brain activity. In young adults, larger right MFG volume was positively correlated with greater activity in the bilateral dorsolateral PFC and inferior parietal cortex, both of which have been implicated in memory retrieval 144, 145 . In older adults, right MFG volume was not positively correlated with activity in any regions that showed correlations in young adults, but was negatively correlated with activity in several regions, including the parahippocampal cortex. Less activity in these regions predicted better memory in older adults, suggesting that older adults with larger right MFG volume may be better able to compensate for the effects of age on this region by modifying activity in other brain regions to help memory retrieval. Interestingly, in this case, the compensation, if that is what it is, appears to take the form of decreased activity in some regions, which may indicate suppression of processes that would conflict with memory retrieval.\nAnother study 146 assessed the relation between brain activity and grey matter volume in younger and older adults across the whole brain. There was underrecruitment of the occipital cortex during encoding of face-name pairs in old adults compared to young adults, which was mostly accounted for by atrophy in these regions. At retrieval, older adults over-recruited a number of regions, including the dorsolateral PFC and parietal cortex. This over-recruitment was eliminated after accounting for volume loss in the PFC, but age differences remained in the parietal cortex after accounting for the effect of age differences in volume. These results suggest that structural age changes may account for some, but not all, of the differences in brain activity between older and younger adults. Perhaps more important is the evidence that age differences in brain structure can influence the relationship between activity in task-related brain regions and behaviour, indicating a complex interplay between structure and function. Dopamine. One of the most studied aspects of dopamine is its role in reward. Current conceptions of how reward is processed in the brain propose that a circuit of regions, including the ventral striatum and dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area, is necessary for learning about and using rewards to guide behaviour 147 . Several studies have shown that there are age reductions in striatal responses to learned reward 148 and reward anticipation 149 . Only one study has directly examined the relation between functional activation during reward tasks and dopamine binding levels 150 . It showed that old adults not only have less activity in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation but also show a weaker relationship between this activity and dopamine levels in Figure 3 | The default network in young and older adults. The regions making up the default network (DN) are shown in red. The DN was defined in younger adults and older adults using a multivariate, whole-brain approach 198 that identified regions where activity at rest was correlated with activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, a major node of the DN). The DN included the inferior parietal lobes (IPLs), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and the left medial temporal lobe (MTL). The green regions represent a subset of DN areas, both medial and lateral, with weaker resting functional connectivity in older compared to young adults\n.\nthe midbrain relative to younger adults, suggesting that age-related dysfunction in this neurotransmitter system could affect multiple everyday decisions that rely on reward processing.\nThe role of dopamine in non-reward tasks also has been examined. One study 151 assessed brain activity during a low-level working memory task and the influence of a common polymorphism in the gene for catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) in young and old adults. COMT is an enzyme that is thought to regulate dopamine levels in the PFC 152 , and the Val(158)Met polymorphism results in differing levels of available dopamine in the brain. The Met variant is associated with lower dopamine-degrading activity relative to the Val variant, leading to greater dopamine levels. Individuals who were Met carriers showed no age difference in brain activity, whereas those with the Val allele showed a robust age difference in left PFC activity. Older adults with the Val allele, presumably those with lower dopamine levels, had higher activity than their younger counterparts. These findings suggest that the Val(158)Met polymorphism influences the activity of brain regions within working memory networks and that over-recruitment of PFC activity in older adults can be linked to specific gene effects.\nAnother recent study 153 measured the binding potential of dopamine as an index of receptor density and related it to brain activity during working memory. Young adults had increased activity in frontal and parietal regions in a high-load memory condition relative to low-load conditions, and these load-dependent increases were greater in younger adults than in older adults. Older adults showed reductions of dopamine binding potential in the caudate nucleus and dorsolateral PFC, and when the contribution of these differences in dopamine binding was accounted for, the age effects on frontal and parietal activity were eliminated or greatly reduced. These findings suggest that some of the agerelated differences seen in brain activity during varying cognitive loads (FIG. 2) may be due to alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission.\nUnlike binding potential, dopamine synthesis capacity can be increased in old adults relative to younger adults 154 , which could reflect an attempt to compensate for the reduced receptor density. Greater synthesis capacity in the caudate nucleus correlated with better verbal working memory performance and more PFC activity during the task in old adults 155 . However, the relationship between dopamine synthesis capacity and task-related modulation of activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (a DN region), is disrupted in old adults 156 . These studies suggest that age differences in dopamine synthesis capacity, as with binding potential, influence functional activity in multiple brain circuits that are relevant for working memory performance, but whether these differences have a causal role in the reduced working memory performance in older adults is still unknown.\nTwo studies have manipulated dopamine levels directly to assess the relationship between dopamine, ageing and cognition. Dopamine depletion in young adults (by blocking dopamine D1 receptors) resulted in reduced activation in frontal and parietal regions during a high-load working memory task to levels similar to those seen in older adults 157 . Performance was also lower in young adults after D1 blockade, although still better than that seen in older adults. However, when a dopamine agonist was administered to old adults to test the idea that boosting dopamine function would induce similar brain activity to that observed in young adults when carrying out episodic memory tasks, an enhancement, rather than a reduction, in age differences was seen 158 . Much more research is required before any strong statements about the interactions among dopamine alterations and brain activity in ageing can be made."}, {"section_title": "Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease: apolipoprotein E.", "text": "There is evidence that memory reductions can be seen at least 6 years before a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 159 , suggesting that pathology in memory-related regions is well advanced before diagnosis 160 . Therefore, it is important to assess the potential influence of Alzheimer's disease risk on studies of 'normal' ageing. The impact of the different alleles of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene has been examined in this context, as the presence of one or two \u03b54 alleles is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 161 . Some studies have reported greater activation in memory-related areas, notably the hippocampus, in healthy old adults who were \u03b54 carriers compared with non-carriers of the \u03b54 allele [162] [163] [164] , and even in young \u03b54 carriers relative to non-carriers 165 , suggesting an increase in demand on these regions before the appearance of any symptoms of memory loss. However, a couple of studies 166, 167 have found evidence of lower brain activity in the hippocampus of aged \u03b54 allele carriers during memory tasks. These inconsistent findings regarding brain activity in high-risk individuals compared to their low-risk counterparts could be due to differences in specific task demands, the influence of any number of lifestyle or health factors, or where in the trajectory of longitudinal change one happens to measure brain activity and cognition. For example, if a participant is on a trajectory towards eventual dementia, measuring brain activity early in this trajectory might reveal an over-recruitment of activity in a given region, whereas a later measurement might show under-recruitment. It is also possible that differential responses to cognitive load could account for over-or under-recruitment in older individuals with either high or low risk for Alzheimer's disease (FIG. 2) . It nevertheless seems clear that the APOE genotype influences age-related changes in brain function, and that the altered task-related brain activity in \u03b54 carriers may reflect the increased vulnerability of these individuals to Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive decline.\nFinally, it was recently shown that over-recruitment of brain activity in older \u03b54 carriers is enhanced in those with greater physical activity 168 . Older adults with the \u03b54 allele who engaged in more physical activity had greater memory-related activation in posterior temporal and parietal regions than non-\u03b54-carriers or those with lower physical activity. This result is particularly interesting as these areas are some of the first regions of the cortex to show metabolic deficits in early Alzheimer's disease [169] [170] [171] . This work shows interesting influences of both the APOE genotype and physical activity on memoryrelated brain activation in cognitively intact but genetically at-risk older adults, but it is not clear whether this increase is compensatory or protective against future cognitive decline.\nRisk factors for Alzheimer's disease: mild cognitive impairment. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in older adults is another risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, as a relatively high proportion of older adults with MCI, particularly those with amnestic symptoms, will progress to clinical dementia 172 . There is an extensive literature on functional and structural brain changes in MCI, much of which has shown that individuals with MCI have greater activation in the MTLs during memory tasks relative to healthy older controls 173, 174 . Recent research has focused on understanding what might underlie this over-activity. For example, one recent study 175 examined subregions of the hippocampus using high-resolution fMRI to explore the CA3 region, which is thought to be involved in pattern separation during memory. Participants with MCI showed over-recruitment of the CA3 region, but not other regions, relative to controls, as well as impaired pattern separation ability, which is consistent with the idea of a dysfunctional encoding mechanism resulting from early neuropathological changes in this hippocampal region. Interestingly, healthy older adults also show memory-related deficits in CA3 function relative to younger adults 176 . Another study 177 found that over-recruitment of the hippocampus in MCI was related to cognitive load, such that it was only seen at lower levels of memory load during a paired-associates task. At higher loads, activity in the hippocampus was lower in the MCI group relative to controls, consistent with CRUNCH (similar results have also been reported in MCI for other brain regions 178 ). These studies point towards specific processing deficits as well as an impairment in the ability to respond to increases in cognitive demand as potential explanations for MTL over-recruitment in MCI. This work also highlights the similarities between age differences in healthy older versus younger adults and differences between MCI and healthy older individuals (for example, both can be characterized by CRUNCH and involve over-recruitment of brain activity). This similarity suggests a continuum of effects due to age and neuropathological brain changes, perhaps because both ageing and risk of dementia can affect cognition in a general way that impairs the ability to respond to increasing cognitive demand.\nOther recent work has emphasized how MCI affects larger scale brain networks. One such study showed that healthy older adults use a network of regions, including the MTLs, for successful encoding 179 . Although participants with MCI showed engagement of this network, activity in it was not associated with memory performance; instead activity in a network involving anterior temporal regions thought to be involved in semantic retrieval was correlated with memory in MCI. This shift was interpreted as a compensatory response to dysfunction in the MTLs. The DN has also been studied in older adults with MCI, who show weaker functional connectivity in this network compared to healthy elderly controls, consistent with studies showing that patients with Alzheimer's disease have less deactivation of and weaker functional connectivity in the DN 109, 180 . These effects of MCI have been found in the PCC 181 and in its connections to other regions 182 . In addition, DN functional connectivity is more affected in those individuals with MCI who later progress to dementia than in those who remain stable over time 183 . Indeed, the weaker functional connectivity of the DN in MCI and Alzheimer's disease, in conjunction with the finding of amyloid deposition and other neuropathological changes in DN regions, including the MTL 160 , has led to the suggestion that the DN is intimately involved in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease 184 . Again, there is a similarity between the vulnerability of the DN in older adults with risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (such as APOE and MCI) and the vulnerability seen in healthy older adults relative to young adults, suggesting that DN activity and functional connectivity in older samples might be a useful marker for predicting cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Influence of training on the ageing brain", "text": "The influence of expertise on the adult brain has been demonstrated 185, 186 (see BOX 1 for an example of how a lifelong experience can influence brain structure and function), but less is known about how short-term behavioural training can affect brain activity in older adults. This question is important because it has implications for rehabilitating cognitive decline in older people. A few neuroimaging studies have looked at this issue and their results are intriguing. One study provided training to older adults on a divided attention task in five 1-hour sessions over a 2-week interval and found improved performance and reduced age differences in brain activity that were apparent before training 187 . PFC activity that was greater in older adults before training was reduced to the level seen in younger adults after training, presumably because the practice on the two tasks had reduced the effort required to carry them out simultaneously, reducing the need for PFC-mediated cognitive control. Similarly, a reduction in the amplitude of an electrophysiological-evoked response during a working memory task was reported in older adults after 10 hours of perceptual discrimination training, and this reduction predicted the increase in accuracy on the working memory task that was achieved after training 188 . Increased activity in older adults after episodic memory training has been reported in a study 189 that scanned young and old adults during encoding of words to assess baseline age differences. The older adults then underwent two training sessions (for a total of 2.5 hours), in which they were trained on the use of three different learning strategies and then allowed to use the strategy of their choice to learn lists of words. A post-training fMRI session was then carried out in the older group. The use of the strategies by the older adults during the encoding condition at the second fMRI session coincided with an elimination of the pre-training age differences in word memory. Training also increased older adults' brain activity in the left frontal and temporal regions that have been previously associated with verbal processing and successful encoding 70, 190, 191 . These increases of brain activity were correlated with the degree of improvement in memory after training, suggesting a direct role for training in influencing both brain function and behaviour. These training studies suggest that increased brain activity after even limited training could be a result of the adoption of a different strategy, whereas decreased brain activity after training is more likely to be due to a practice-related increase of efficiency on a task 187 ."}, {"section_title": "Box 2 | Assessing behavioural and brain trajectories over the lifespan", "text": "An example of how lifespan studies could add to our knowledge of brain-behaviour interactions can be found in the study of variability. It is well known that measures of behavioural performance, such as response times, are variable both between and within individuals 120, 211, 212 and that behavioural variability is higher in children and older adults relative to younger adults [213] [214] [215] [216] . In ageing, behavioural variability also can serve as a marker for cognitive decline 217, 218 and increases before death 219 . However, the relation between behavioural variability and variability in brain activity has not been extensively examined, although evidence indicates that variability in ongoing activity is important for the expression of evoked patterns of activity 220 . The use of functional MRI to study brain function has relied primarily on assessing average brain activation patterns. Nevertheless, brain activity is inherently variable, and several lines of research have shown that our ability to understand important aspects of brain function is enhanced by considering the variability of brain signals [221] [222] [223] . In particular, networks that are more variable may be more robust to disruption and may explore more neural states, thus enhancing learning and promoting optimal performance 221, 222, 224, 225 . Recent studies have shown that there are developmental increases in variability and complexity of brain activity, from childhood to the young adult ages, along with increased accuracy and stability of task performance 226 . In addition, a recent study assessed variability of the blood-oxygenlevel-dependent (BOLD) signal with age, using the standard deviation of activity in all brain voxels, and found that the majority of regions with age differences had less variability in the older group 227 (see the figure, blue regions in panel a). In addition, lower BOLD variability in these regions was associated with slower and more variable response times on cognitive tasks 57 . Thus, this accumulating evidence suggests that behavioural variability has a U-shaped function over the lifespan 216 , with larger variability in children and older adults compared to young adults (see the figure, panel b) , whereas variability of brain activity shows the opposite trend (inverted U shape). Lifespan studies examining this kind of question using the same behavioural and imaging paradigms from children up to older adults would shed much light on how developmental "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "There are a number of issues in the ageing literature that have yet to be resolved satisfactorily, including that of compensatory brain activity. For example, overrecruitment of brain activity in older adults has been interpreted as compensation both when there was a positive correlation between activity and behaviour 39 , and when this correlation was negative 146 . Although it seems unlikely that both positive and negative correlations could be compensatory, perhaps a more careful and consistent definition of what is 'compensatory' is needed. One model 192 defines three different types of compensation. When there is a mismatch between available cognitive resources and current task demands, this leads to the recruitment of additional neural resources, reflected in increased brain activity. At this point, without a link to behaviour, the over-recruitment is called 'attempted compensation' . The increase in brain activity may be associated with better task performance, in which case it is defined as 'successful compensation' , or worse task performance, in which case it is defined as 'unsuccessful compensation' . In this model, determining the relationship between the engagement of additional neural resources and task performance is critical for determining whether the compensation has been successful or not. Adopting terms such as unsuccessful or partial compensation, to make a clear distinction between these phenomena and successful compensation in which over-recruitment is clearly linked to better performance, may help to remove discrepancies in the literature and clarify the compensatory role of various regions. In addition, others have suggested 23 that the term 'compensation' should be used only for those instances in which old adults recruit brain activity that is not seen in younger adults, and the engagement of this area or areas is directly correlated with better performance only in the older adults and not in young adults (that is, there is a unique pattern of neural activity that supports task performance in an age-specific manner).\nAnother initiative that would be welcome in this field is the use of lifespan studies to identify the changes that occur, both in cognitive processes and the brain mechanisms underlying them, from childhood to old age. Such developmental changes could take a variety of forms, including both linear and nonlinear changes. There is recent evidence suggesting that some behavioural and brain trends in development might take different forms\n, indicating that much could be learned about the links between brain and behaviour using a comprehensive lifespan approach. In addition, longitudinal studies will be important for understanding brain ageing. Although cross-sectional studies are easier to carry out, and have contributed most of what we know to date about ageing of the brain, they are vulnerable to cohort effects, and longitudinal studies are necessary for identifying the effects of ageing within individuals. There have been a few longitudinal studies of brain function in older adults that have shown decreased task-related activity over time 193 , both decreases and increases depending on the specific brain region and cognitive demands 194, 195 , and a greater decline of activity in older individuals with risk factors for Alzheimer's disease 196 . With so few data points it is difficult to come to any strong conclusions about change over time, highlighting the need for these kinds of studies.\nFinally, it is clear that ageing is influenced by a large number of factors that vary from individual to individual, including genetics and life experiences (FIG. 4) . Although it is probably impossible to account for all of these factors in a single study, the current trend is to include an assessment of multiple influencing factors and multiple measures of brain structure and function, as the experiments reviewed here can attest. Publicly accessible databases, such as the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 197 , that contain information on a large number of individuals collected across multiple laboratories will aid greatly in this effort. Sharing of data and meta-analyses will allow for larger scale examinations of ageing effects than is possible with data from a single laboratory and will ultimately add to our knowledge in a substantial way. The model is intended to show the interplay among a wide array of physical and behavioural aspects (some of which are discussed in this Review) and the ageing process. The arrows are bidirectional to indicate that the influence can potentially arise from these factors on the ageing process, or vice versa. For example, genetic factors could influence how an individual ages, and ageing can enhance the effects of genes on specific behaviours. There are other factors that could be included here, such as risk factors for vascular disease or dementia, but this incomplete list gives a sense of how complex the study of ageing is and how difficult it would be to comprehensively assess these variables in a single experiment."}]
