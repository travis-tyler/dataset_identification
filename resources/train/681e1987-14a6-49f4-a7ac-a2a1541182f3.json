Indeed, as long as global emissions are above the natural capacity of the earth to absorb greenhouse gases atmospheric concentrations will continue to increase (Sarmiento and Gruber, 2002). The impact of different timings of emissions reductions on atmospheric concentrations is reflected in various efforts to model interactions between human activity and the climate system (e.g. Chesnay and Weyant, 2006;Clarke et al., 2009;IPCCC, 2007a, Ch.3). Clarke et al. (2009) present results from ten different integrated assessment models developed by research groups in various countries. Each model aimed to explore the feasibility and implications of achieving three distinct atmospheric concentration targets by 2100 for some of the main anthropogenic greenhouse gases. 1 The targets were set at 450 ppmv CO 2 -e, 550 ppmv CO 2 -e, and 650 ppmv CO 2 -e. 2 In contrast, the atmospheric concentration level in 2000 was approximately 420 ppmv CO 2 -e. Each of the modeling teams also ran reference scenarios, where the world economy was assumed to continue along a business-as-usual trajectory, without efforts to curb emissions. Following these reference cases, atmospheric concentrations in 2100 ranged from 800 to 1500 ppmv CO 2 -e depending on model characteristics. In all reference cases, business-as-usual emissions resulted in concentrations exceeding 450 ppmv CO 2 -e prior to 2020. Most models were therefore unable to meet this target by 2100 without temporarily overshooting it. For CO 2, the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, 2050 emissions reductions ranged from 20% to 90% below 2000 levels. In all cases, CO 2 emissions needed to be close to zero or negative by 2100. In contrast, the 650 ppmv CO 2 -e target, the least stringent of the three considered in the study, was met by most models by first allowing CO 2 emissions to continue to rise until 2050 before subsequently being reduced towards zero to 2100. 3 Whether efforts to reduce emissions are introduced immediately or delayed, the energy sector is bound to be heavily involved. The burning of fossil fuels in the scope of energy production and use accounts for approximately 70% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (IEA, 2010a). Energy-related emissions can be reduced to some extent through changes to consumption habits and the deployment of existing climate friendly technologies, such as fuel switching from coal to gas, or the replacement of old equipment in household and industrial sectors by more energy efficient ones. Ultimately, however, new technologies which emit no or only limited amounts of greenhouse gases will need to be developed, brought to market, and deployed on a global scale. At present, such new climate friendly energy technologies consist primarily of various forms of renewable energy, such as wind, solar, or bio-energy, as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS). 4 The modeling results discussed above highlight that the greater the emissions reductions, the greater the need to increase the share of such new climate friendly technologies within the global fuel mix (Clarke et al., 2009). Much of the challenge of climate change mitigation therefore lies in the ability to develop and deploy these new technologies."}, {"section_title": "Climate change mitigation policies and the international institutional framework", "text": "From an economics perspective anthropogenic climate change results from failing to account for adverse socio-economic effects of climate change in transactions of goods and services linked to emissions of greenhouse gases (i.e. climate change is an externality). The fact that these effects are broadly diffused in society implies that governments need to introduce policies and other measures in order to reduce emissions and induce the deployment and development of new climate friendly energy technologies. 5 Such policies can take a broad variety of forms. At one end of the spectrum are economic instruments which aim to internalize the climate change externality. These include placing a tax on greenhouse gas emissions or allocating a limited number of tradable emissions permits. At the other end of the spectrum are policies, sometimes referred to as command and control, which aim to support or discourage the use or development of specific technologies or practices. These include a broad variety of measures such as technology standards, mandates, and regulations. Economic instruments raise the price of greenhouse gas emitting activities, thereby generating incentives for firms to develop technological substitutes that emit comparatively fewer emissions. In contrast, command and control measures aim to more directly guide the direction and pace of technology development towards climate friendly alternatives (Newell et al., 1999;Jaff et al. 2002). An important characteristic of climate change is that once emitted, greenhouse gases mix well in the atmosphere and, as a result, emissions in one location eventually affect the climate globally. 6 Unilateral efforts to reduce emissions by a government may therefore have little effects if at the same time other nations allow their emissions to continue to rise. This is particularly true if efforts to reduce emissions lead to the relocation of greenhouse gas intensive are particularly well suited to remote power generation, in which case government policies may not be necessary. 6 However, climate models do predict important regional variations in climate change (see IPCC, 2007b, Ch. 11). activities in countries without emissions reduction policies. 7 In sum, not only is climate change a governance issue, it is one that requires global and coordinated actions. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its 1997 Kyoto Protocol, and other agreements negotiated under the auspices of the UNFCCC constitute the main international institution created to address climate change. The UNFCCC calls for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stabilize atmospheric concentrations at a level \"which prevents dangerous interference with the climate system\". 8 However the international institutional framework has failed to define a clear mechanism to distribute longterm emission reduction responsibilities among nations (Schmalensee, 1998;Aldy and Stavins, 2007b). While many reasons have been put forth for this failure, two characteristics of the international climate institution stand out. The first is that no consensus has emerged concerning what constitutes dangerous interference with the climate system. Scientists are confident that rising concentrations of greenhouse gases will lead to a variety of potentially significant adverse impacts on society and the natural environment yet uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of these impacts remains high (IPCC, 2007c). The scientific literature also refers to potential greenhouse gas concentration thresholds above which climate change effects would increase rapidly yet these are difficult to identify with any precision (.e.g. O'Neill and Oppenheimer, UNFCCCC have kept to the main tenets of previously agreed texts while developed country parties have called for a more inclusive approach where developing countries would progressively adopt emission reduction responsibilities (Aldy and Stavins, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "The prospects of new industries", "text": "There is little doubt that introducing a price on greenhouse gas emissions would increase the cost of the vast majority of industrial activities, which over time would affect economic output (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000). Rising costs would only be dampened as climate friendly technologies become available at costs below those of incumbent technologies when a price on emissions is included. Furthermore, the trend may eventually be reversed if the costs of climate friendly technologies break even with those of incumbent technologies without inclusion of a price on emissions. However, technology development is a long-term endeavor and there are no guarantees that it will result in cost competitive alternatives. The task of mitigating climate change is therefore most often characterized as a burden on the economy. 13 Nevertheless, the process of technological development associated with climate change mitigation will reward those who own successful new climate friendly technologies as they will benefit from the sale of the technologies (or of the emissions reductions resulting from their use) to those who face comparatively higher costs to meet their emissions reduction obligations. There are therefore potential industrial opportunities underlying the burden sharing process. This industrial perspective on climate change mitigation is often reflected in government planning documents. For example, the European Commission's European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (European Commission, 2007, p.4) warned: If we fall behind in the intensifying global race to win low carbon technology markets, we may need to rely on imported technologies to meet our targets, missing out on huge commercial opportunities for EU businesses. Similarly, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry's Innovative Energy Technology Program (METI, 2008, p. 3) noted: Since Japan has the world's top level technology in the field of energy, we need to strongly promote international cooperation and actively contribute to substantial global emissions reductions while reinforcing and maintaining our competitiveness. This can be done both by focusing our research and development resources on the technology fields where we can lead the world and by accelerating and promoting technology development with the recognition that technology is an important resource for Japan. Another example is the United States White House Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future (White House, 2011, p.4) which highlighted that \"leading the world in clean energy is critical to strengthening the American economy and winning the future\". Such statements provide some indication of the perceived magnitude of the economic and industrial stakes involved in the development of new climate friendly technologies. The fact that such statements are made by governments of advanced economies is not surprising. They are among the group of countries which, in the scope of the UNFCCC, have agreed to take the lead in reducing emissions. In addition, the most significant technological advances of the last century have taken place in these countries and as a result they have accumulated strong technology and industrial capabilities. This, however, is not the case of China. China is not bound to reduce emissions and is a designated recipient of climate friendly technology transfer and financial assistance under the UNFCCC. In addition, over the last century China does to not have a proven track record of contributing to the advancement of technological development. Nevertheless, the Chinese government has also clearly outlined its ambitions to develop climate friendly technologies, further underscoring the perceived potential economic value of a strong industrial presence in such sectors. For example, Premier Wen Jiaoboa noted at a World Economic Forum meeting in 2009 that China \"will accelerate the development of a low carbon economy and green economy so as to gain an advantageous position in the international industrial competition\". 14"}, {"section_title": "Research question and hypothesis", "text": "Given the above mentioned ambitions of the Chinese government, this research aims to assess whether Chinese firms can catch up with firms at the technology frontier in the scope of new climate friendly energy technologies. In particular, it aims to determine the extent to which, and ways in which, Chinese firms and research institutions involved in technology development efforts are likely to make non trivial contributions to the development of new climate friendly energy technologies. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that Chinese firms can catch up with the climate friendly energy technology frontier. The hypothesis rests on the combination of two complementary arguments. The first focuses on developments within China, while the second focuses on developments at the technology frontier. \u2022 First hypothesis argument: Chinese firms can make rapid progress in the development of new climate friendly energy technologies because 1) the government can create relatively large domestic markets for these technologies, and 2) they are part of a system of technology development with a powerful and proactive government at its heart. The first point of this argument rests on the fact that market opportunities are central to technology development. Thanks to its large size and rapidly rising energy demand, the Chinese government can create through policy a market for climate friendly energy technologies of significant size by international standards. This therefore provides an opportunity for Chinese firms and other entities to accumulate valuable experience, thereby accelerating technology development. The second point of the argument rests on the notion of systems of technology development -described in more details in the literature reviewed below -which consists of the interactions between firms, government, and research institutions underpinning the processes of technology development. China has competent industrial goods manufacturing firms as well as many technical research institutions. More importantly, however, the Chinese government can exert strong influence on both firms and research institutions to guide the direction and pace of technology development, and intervene in the market to foster technological development among Chinese firms. \u2022 Second hypothesis argument: The frontier of new climate friendly energy technologies has evolved relatively slowly because of limited government support for their development in advanced economies. Whether due to the failure of the international climate institution discussed above or other reasons, government support policies in advanced economies, such as European countries and the United States, for the development of new climate friendly energy technologies has been limited. As a result, the frontier of new climate friendly energy technologies has evolved slowly relative to other technologies. Bringing these parameters together, the hypothesis states that Chinese firms can catch up with the climate friendly energy technology frontier because on the one hand they can make rapid progress with technology development and on the other, progress at the frontier has been relatively slow. Answering the above research question and assessing the validity of the stated hypothesis are important for a number of reasons. One of these concerns the international climate change mitigation institution discussed above. It is worth stressing that much policy attention has focused on the notion, found in article 3 of the UNFCCC, of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" among countries. In contrast, relatively little attention has been given to the notion of countries' \"respective capabilities\", found in the text of the same article. By investigating whether China can catch up with the development of new climate friendly energy technologies this research will therefore shed some light on the country's capabilities. The research may therefore contribute to shift the emphasis of the climate mitigation policy debate from determining how responsibilities among countries differ to questions of technology and industrial development. Another important aspect of this research is that it may contribute to the literature on developmental strategies. Over the past half century, a small number of developing countries who started out with little technological sophistication developed strong capabilities in a number of fields. This phenomenon has led to a large body of scholarly work that highlights the instrumental role of government in shaping competitive advantages in specific industrial sectors (e.g. Amsden, 2001; Kohli, 2004). The case of climate friendly energy technologies in China may therefore provide new insights to this important literature."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "This section aims to anchor the research question and hypothesis to the literature, and lay the grounds for the methodological discussion to follow. The starting point is a definition of the term 'technology' at the heart of the research question. Though in every day parlance the term technology refers to artifacts or devices, the literature typically adopts a broader definition. There are numerous variations yet these almost invariably encompass both physical elements and knowledge. For example, Westphal et al. (1985, p. 170) define technology as follows: Technology refers to a collection of physical processes which transform inputs into outputs, to the specifications of the inputs and outputs, and to the social arrangements that structure the activities involved in carrying out these transformations. Technology thus is the practical application of technological knowledge, which is what underlies and is given usable expression in technology. Such knowledge has technical and transactional elements, the former relating to product characteristics and physical processes, and the latter to social arrangements. These social arrangements include various kinds of market and contractual relationships among entities as well as organizational modes and procedural methods to regulate an entity's internal operations. Similarly, Dosi (1982, p.152) defines technology as: [\u2026] A set of pieces of knowledge, both directly 'practical' (related to concrete problems and devices) and 'theoretical' (but practically applicable though not necessarily applied), know-how, methods, procedures, experience of successes and failures and also, of course, physical devices and equipment. Existing physical devices embody -so to speak -the achievements in the development of a technology in a defined problem solving activity. At the same time, a 'disembodied' part of technology consists of particular expertise, experience of past attempts and past technological solutions, together with the knowledge and the achievements of the 'state of the art'. Other important terms which must be defined are the 'technological frontier' and 'technological catch-up'. Dosi (1982, p.152) defines the technological frontier \"as the highest level reached upon a technological path with respect to the relevant technological and economic dimensions\". Adopting similar terminology, technological catch-up can be defined as the processes by which an entity at lower levels along a technological path rises at a faster pace than the evolution of the technological frontier (i.e. the highest level along the path). Technological catch-up is therefore an intrinsically dynamic process which depends on the evolution of both the technological frontier and the entity catching up. The literature review in this section focuses on highlighting important scholarly work on the development of new technologies at the frontier, and on the processes of technological catch-up. The literature on these topics is vast so I adopt a few restrictions in light of the nature of the above research question and hypothesis. Firstly, I focus on the literature most relevant to an analysis at the level of an industry or of a technology. The literature at higher levels of aggregation, for example on macroeconomic assessments of growth, catch-up, and the role of technology, is therefore not discussed here. 15 Secondly, I place particular emphasis on literature with sufficient granularity to account for the roles of various agents, including the government, in the processes of technology development. Thirdly, I focus on literature which addresses technological catch-up at the international level and in particular in the scope of industrial development in emerging economies."}, {"section_title": "The development of new technologies", "text": "1.2.1.1 Conceptual frameworks A widely adopted breakdown of technology development stems from the work of Schumpeter (1934) and consists of three basic stages: invention -the formulation of the idea at the origin of a new technology; innovation -the process of creating useful products and processes based on the invention; and diffusion -the fulfillment of the economic potential of the products or processes developed through markets. More recent writings on technology development have moved away from a strict distinction between invention and innovation (Nelson and Winter, 1977). Still, the literature recognizes that certain innovations are more important than others and a distinction is commonly made between radical and incremental innovations. Radical innovations consist of the introduction of new products or processes which break from those prevailing at the time. In contrast, incremental innovations serve to improve existing products or processes. A successful radical innovation will therefore lead to a series of incremental innovations until the economic potential of the product or process developed is exhausted, or a new radical innovation introduces a new, superior product or process which eventually supplants it (Dosi, 1982;Perez, 2004). A technology's development is a cumulative process as incremental innovations build on the achievements of previous innovations. 16 16 In fact radical innovations are oftentimes cumulative as well as \"major innovations constitute new building blocks which provide a basis for subsequent technologies\" (Rosenberg, 1994, p 15)."}, {"section_title": "Time", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Incremental innovations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Initial optimization", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Radical innovation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Degree of maturity", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Maturity", "text": "This crude depiction gives a sense of technology determinism yet a central feature of technology development is that it is highly uncertain. Rosenberg (1996) notes that a technology's success is far from predictable at the time of its first introduction (i.e. the radical innovation in the above discussion) as it depends on a number of factors, each characterized by significant uncertainties. One such factor is the inability to foresee the multitude of incremental innovations which may follow. This is linked to the fact that radical innovations introduce technologies which are typically very crude. The variety of future uses is therefore impossible to predict. Furthermore, future uses may also depend on unforeseeable innovations occurring in other sectors."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1.1: Evolution of a technology (A technological trajectory)", "text": "Source: Perez (2004) Perez (2004) schematizes the links between radical and incremental innovations from the introduction of a new product or process to its maturity, as shown in figure 1.1. Following a radical innovation, the new product or process introduced undergoes some preliminary optimization. As it secures market shares, incremental innovations are introduced to improve the product or process in terms of quality, efficiency, or other relevant technical criteria. Gradually, firms and other agents involved in the technology face diminishing returns to further innovation and a maturity plateau is reached. In their contribution to technology life cycle theory, Abernathy and Utterback (1978) place particular emphasis on the relation between product and process innovations. 17 They identify three phases in a technology's development, as depicted in figure 1.2. In the first phase, different product designs compete with one another. These are the result of independent radical innovations and often have distinct physical properties. This formative period of a technology is referred to as the 'fluid phase', as various competing products imply that production processes are not firmly established. Products at this early stage will typically be crude, expensive, and unreliable (Kim, 1999;Rosenberg 1996). The fluid phase ends with the emergence of a dominant design, after which demands for various product attributes become increasingly well articulated in the marketplace. This progressively narrows the scope of new product innovations towards increasingly incremental innovations. Cost competition rather than product competition starts driving innovation and radical innovations are increasingly found in manufacturing processes. Abernathy and Utterback call this as the 'transition' phase. Utterback (1996)  that product manufacturing progressively shifts from relying on skilled labor and general purpose equipment to the introduction of specialized equipment operated by a less skilled workforce. Subsequently, as in the case with product innovation, process innovations become incremental in scope in what Abernathy and Utterback (1978) call the 'specific' phase. Utterback (1996) uses this conceptual framework to explain the historical development of a broad range of industrial technologies. He introduces some variations on this framework to distinguish between assembled (e.g. the automobile or the typewriter) and non-assembled products (e.g. electricity or chemicals), or to explain how the emergence of a new competing technology affects the various steps outlined above."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1.2: The dynamics of product and process innovation", "text": "Source: Abernathy and Utterback (1978) The framework developed by Abernathy and Utterback (1978) highlights the role that demand for technology, articulated through markets, plays in guiding the technology development process. However, as noted by several scholars (e.g. Mowery and Rosenberg, 1979), 'demand-pull' for technology cannot alone explain the entire technology development process. Nelson and Winter (1977) and Dosi (1982) help to conceptually answer this puzzle by linking the realms of science, technology, and production. They highlight the role of 'selection devices', or 'selection environments', through which scientific or technology objectives are formulated, priorities are established, and resources allocated in the pursuit of selected projects. In particular, they distinguish between market and non-market selection environments. Market selection environments, where the 'demand-pull' for technology is the strongest, play a predominant role towards the end of the science-technology-production continuum. There, firms decide whether it is worthwhile to adopt an innovation based on whether they think they can generate profits. Profits, however, only materialize as a consequence of how consumers react once the innovation is introduced in the market place. The way in which consumer preferences are expressed in the market place and how well firms serve these preferences through technology innovation are therefore the central mechanisms of market selection environments. The economic criterion of profitability becomes less useful as a guide to technology choices as one moves upstream along the science-technology-production continuum. Nelson and Winter (1977) note that away from the marketplace, established heuristics guide technology development efforts. Firms typically have their own technology development strategies based on their experience and capabilities. They may also follow established strategies, such as seeking the exploitation of scale economies or increasing mechanization as cost saving strategies. The more one moves upstream from the marketplace, the more significant non-market selection environments characterized by institutional and social factors become. In non-market selection environments, firms, universities, other research organizations, as well as government agencies, are the main agents shaping technological development. In these environments long standing scientific and technological research agenda typically play an important role. Many scholars have underscored that there are numerous feedbacks among the various selection environments help adapt to changing conditions, whether resulting from economic changes or new scientific/technological breakthroughs. Rosenberg (1982, ch.7;1994, ch.8) notably stresses that the science-technology-production continuum is far from unidirectional, and there are often important feedbacks from technology to science as well as from production to science. Dosi (1982) and Nelson and Winter (1978) also stress the role of government policy in both market and non-market selection environments. For example, the monitoring role of regulatory agencies in various sectors prior to the introduction of technologies or processes in the market place (.e.g. in pharmaceuticals, or aerospace), or more targeted policies aiming at achieving specific goals (e.g. national security, health care, or environmental protection), can strongly influence the nature and direction of technology development."}, {"section_title": "Research and development (R&D), learning from experience, and imitation", "text": "The above discussion outlines some of the main elements and drivers involved in the development of new technologies. However, it provides no information on technology development activities per se. Here the principal means available to firms and other agents to generate new technological knowledge are briefly discussed. I focus on technology innovation activities, which consist primarily of research and development (R&D) and various processes of learning from experience. I also discuss the role of technology imitation activities, which aim to copy technologies and therefore to acquire knowledge developed by others. While imitation in itself does not generate new technological knowledge, the literature highlights that it is often an important contributor to innovation activities and also allows firms or other agents to keep up with technologies developed elsewhere. R&D is often broken down between basic research and applied R&D. Basic research is typically associated with scientific inquiry and has no applied objectives. Applied R&D in contrast ultimately targets specific commercial uses. In general, most basic research efforts take place in universities and other research institutions and are funded by governments. In contrast, applied R&D is for the most part funded by firms. 18 Technology development also tends to be the dominant type of activity (Rosenberg, 1994, ch.1). Development activities include the iterative steps of testing and making improvements to new product or process designsoftentimes relying on prototypes -prior to their eventual market introduction. However, most development activities aim to improve and modify existing products (Rosenberg, 1994;. As noted by Patel and Pavitt (1995) since the 1950s and 1960s governments and a number of other institutions have engaged in systematic efforts to collect quantitative data on R&D activities, such as levels and sources of funding as well as staff numbers and qualifications by sector. 19 This has contributed to the establishment of a large literature on R&D and its role in the 18 These broad trends are well documented in statistics compiled by the Joint OECD-Eurostat international data collection on resources devoted to R&D and available online at: www.oecd.org/sti/rds 19 For example in the case of the USA, the Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS) is conducted jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Science Foundation (NSF) and economy. For example, a large body of econometric studies emphasizes the contribution of R&D to productivity and economic growth (Griliches, 1998). R&D data has also been extensively used to assess how the structure and organization of firms and markets affect technology development (for an overview see Cohen, 1995). Learning from experience refers to the processes through which technological skills and knowledge are acquired by individuals and organizations by accumulating experience in undertaking certain tasks. The process which has received the most attention in the literature is learning-by-doing. Arrow (1962a) played an important role in formally introducing learning-bydoing in neo-classical economics thinking. The original formulation of the term focuses on the observed labor productivity gains resulting from the accumulation of experience in production within manufacturing plants. 20 A closely related process is learning-by-using, which consists of the gains resulting from experience accumulated with the utilization of a technology (Rosenberg, 1982, ch.6). As noted by Rosenberg, these gains can materialize as technology improvements resulting from feedback loops between users and the technology development process. Alternatively, learning-by-using can lead to enhanced productivity from either lengthening the life of the technology or reducing operation and maintenance costs. Other scholars have further broken down processes of learning from experience. For example, Bell (1984) draws from case studies of infant enterprises to distinguish between learning-by-operating, learning-by-changing, and learning-from-system performance feedback, among other sources of learning. replaces the Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD), which was in place since the 1950s. For international guidelines on R&D data collection see OECD (2002). 20 See Wright (1936) for one of the first references to learning-by-doing in the production of airplanes. A rich literature, often referred to as the learning curve, or experience curve literature, attempts to quantitatively capture the effects of learning from experience. This literature typically uses cumulative production as an indicator of experience and correlates this with changes in the performance of production activities, such as through changes in man-hours per unit produced or, more generally, costs of production. Learning curves are often characterized by a learning rate which is a constant percentage improvement in performance for each doubling of accumulated experience (Conley, 1970). Learning curves have been extensively used at the level of the manufacturing plant (Argote and Epple, 1990). However, some studies have broadened the approach to the level of a technology. In such cases the analysis typically has some predefined geographic scope. For example, the learning curves literature applied to energy technologies reviewed by McDonald and Schrattenholzer (2000) highlights that some studies are limited to production in certain countries or regions while others consider production globally. 21 The learning curve offers a powerful tool yet suffers from important limitations. In particular, it is difficult to link observed learning rates to actual learning processes. The literature highlights a high variability in observed learning rates across industries, and often for the same technology at different locations, yet provides limited explanations. Similarly, changes in learning rates over time have been observed for many technologies yet the literature again fails to provide satisfactory explanations (McDonald and Schrattenholzer, 2000;Argote and Epple, 1990). One important issue is that changes in performance observed may be due to a variety of factors other than learning (Bell, 1984). This is all the more true as learning curves are applied in broader contexts, away from labor productivity metrics at the plant level to more aggregated metrics (such as production costs) at the industry or technology level. Such factors may include changes in prices of raw materials, economies of scale in the production process, changes in the size of the products being manufactured, 22 or the effects of the other means of technology development -i.e. R&D and imitation. Nemet (2006) attempts to distinguish some of these factors in the scope of the global learning curve for solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. He concludes that most of the reductions in PV module costs observed between 1980 and 2000 can be attributed to processes other than learning-by-doing. In particular, he identifies economies of scale in production, a drop in the price of the raw material (purified silicon) resulting from manufacturing improvements in the microprocessor industry, and module efficiency gains resulting from R&D. He notes that learning-by-doing may have only affected 10% of the observed reduction in costs. An important characteristic of technology innovation is that once new technological knowledge has been created, it is hard to exclude others from using it, whether this knowledge is embodied in artifacts or not. Technological knowledge can therefore be used relatively easily by others as input to their own innovation efforts. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as knowledge spillover. Such spillovers have long been recognized in the literature (Arrow, 1962b) and have been formally included in economic growth models with endogenous technological change (e.g. Grossman and Helpman, 1991). However, there have been few empirical assessments of spillovers, in large part because such knowledge flows are elusive and not accounted for by market transactions. In practice, knowledge spillovers are actively sought through imitation activities, such as reverse engineering of existing products or processes, the hiring of staff working for competing firms, drawing on new patent applications, the review of technical publications, or other means of information exchanges (e.g. via conferences and informal channels). The limited availability of data on imitation activities has led several scholars to survey firms to identify some of the salient features of their imitation efforts. Mansfield et al. (1981), for example, survey firms in chemicals, drugs, electronics, and machinery industries regarding the imitation of 48 product innovations. The study compares innovation and imitation timing and cost requirements. It also assesses the effect of holding patents for innovations on imitation costs, and the extent to which patenting encourages innovation in light of risks of being imitated. Based on a survey of firms, Mansfield (1985) compiles data on the time needed for information on product or process development decisions, or on technical details of new products and processes, to leak to competing firms. 23 Levine et al. (1987) and Cohen et al. (2000) survey hundreds of R&D staff in United States firms to draw information on the most important means adopted to protect innovations as well as how firms benefit from the innovations of others. Similarly, Cohen et al. (2002) survey R&D staff in both United States and Japanese firms in a comparative study of R&D spillovers and the role of patents. 24 Another branch of the literature uses patent citations contained in patent applications as an indicator of knowledge spillovers. In particular, several scholars have combined this with information on the location of inventors contained in patent applications to assess the geographic scope of spillovers (e.g. Jaffe et al. 1993;Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 1998;Maurseth and Verspagen, 2002). The discussion above highlights some of the impediments in undertaking assessments of specific means of technology development. Data availability is a notable hurdle, particularly concerning learning from experience and imitation activities. In addition, the important overlaps and feedbacks among R&D, learning from experience processes, and imitation activities make separate assessments difficult. R&D and learning processes are most often undertaken concomitantly. Similarly, both R&D and learning efforts may result from imitation activities. An important literature on technology development has thus focused on documenting case studies of technology development in specific industries or technologies by combining both qualitative information and quantitative data. For example, the semiconductor industry has been the object of many studies (e.g. Irwin and Klenow, 1994;Langlois and Steinmueller, 1999), much like the computer industry (e.g. Bresnahan and Greenstein, 1999;Bresnahan and Malerba, 1999;Mowery, 1999), the aircraft industry (e.g. Mowery and Rosenberg, 1982), the chemicals industry 24 Such surveys have provided a wealth of empirical data allowing others to continue work on this topic (e.g. Arora and Ceccagnoli, 2006). (Arora et al., 1999), telecommunications equipment (e.g. Rosenberg, 1994, chap. 11), among others. These case studies provide a rich body of work on technology development dynamics. They highlight that though the basic technology development concepts and core mechanisms outlined above are always present, there is in fact a large variety in the underlying features of each technological trajectory (Mowery and Nelson, 1999b)."}, {"section_title": "Systems of technology innovation", "text": "The case studies mentioned above also highlight a number of import systemic dimensions to technology development, such as government funded R&D, the role of domestic niche markets for new technologies (e.g. through the military), or research collaborations between industries and universities (Mowery and Nelson, 1999a). The 'systems of innovation' literature focuses on the study of such systemic dimensions, placing particular emphasis on the role of interactions between different types of agents in the technology development process. Three strands of the innovation systems are discussed here: 'national innovation systems', 'sectoral systems of innovation', and 'technological systems of innovation'. 25 Each is used to answer distinct questions yet they share the same basic approach. National innovation systems assess how firms, research organizations, government agencies and other agents of technology development within a given nation can together shape innovation processes. One objective of this literature is to understand the role of national institutions in the scope of different technologies with naturally distinct development characteristics. Another is to assess the role of national institutions in light of technology development processes more or less international in scope (Nelson and Rosenberg, 1993). Many national innovation system studies have been undertaken. For example, Freeman (1987Freeman ( , 1988 and Odagiri and Goto (1993) describe some of the characteristics of the Japanese system of innovation, Nelson (1988) and Mowery and Rosenberg (1993) focus on the United States innovation system. 26 In contrast, the sectoral innovation systems approach focuses on understanding the role and interactions of different agents in the scope of a set of technologies used in specific industrial sectors (Malerba, 2002). This more focused approach is often international in scope and not restricted to a single technology. This notably allows capturing technological substitutions and the co-evolution of different technologies within specific industries. Malerba (2004) compiles sectoral innovation systems studies on pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, chemicals, telecommunications, software, and machine tools, with a particular geographic emphasis on Europe. Finally, the technological innovation systems literature focuses on the development of specific technologies (Carlsson and Stankiewicz, 1991). As for the sectoral approach, there are no geographic boundaries to the analysis of technological innovation systems. The geographic scope of the analysis therefore depends on the specificity of the technology and often combines international and national considerations. Unlike the sectoral approach, however, the emphasis of the technological innovation systems literature is on technology development pertaining to one type of technology. This implies that such assessments may cut across several industrial sectors. Carlsson (1995;) compiles a series of detailed studies of technological systems focusing on factory automation, electronics and computers (primarily radio and telecommunications, military electronics, and power electronics), the development of specific drugs in the pharmaceuticals industry (beta blockers and a gastrointestinal drug), powder technology, and biomaterials. The three strands of the innovation systems literature mentioned above typically identify technologies, actors, institutions, and the information networks linking them, and combine qualitative and quantitative information to characterize the key system features. This literature underscores the high level of diversity in the key features of different cases, whether at the national, sectoral, or technology level. Generally, the innovation systems literature does not provide much additional methodological structure. One exception, however, comes from the technological innovation systems literature. Hekkert et al. (2007) and Bergek et al. (2008) propose to complement the analysis of innovation system structural components -i.e. the actors, institutions, and networks -by an assessment of system functions. They underscore that a functional view of innovation systems allows moving beyond previously static assessments. The term 'function' refers to of the various ways in which system components contribute to the goal of the innovation system (Johnson, 2001), which is to develop, diffuse, and use innovations (Edquist, 2005). Johnson (2001) surveys the innovation literature and finds that, though terminologies differ widely, a high level of cohesion exists on what the underlying functions of innovations systems are. Hekkert et al. (2007) and Bergek et al. (2008) both build on the work of Johnson (2001) and others to identify the main system functions. Table 1.1 compiles the functions identified by both studies, highlighting the high level of agreement between them.  2007Brief definition"}, {"section_title": "Knowledge development and diffusion", "text": "\nTechnological knowledge is developed through R&D, learning from experience, and imitation activities.

Information about the technological path is particularly valuable to entities behind the frontier as it is often times cheaper and faster to acquire technological knowledge than to attempt to develop it independently (Mascus, 2004). The international transfer of technology therefore plays an important role in providing firms and other agents in emerging economies with valuable technological information. As highlighted by Bozeman (2000) and Zhao and Reisman (1992), there are many definitions of technology transfer in the literature and much depends on the disciplinary perspective adopted. Here I adopt a definition commonly used in the economics and policy literature, where technology transfer refers to \"any process by which one party gains access to a second party's information and successfully learns and absorbs it into his production function\" (Maskus, 2004, p.9). Various modes of international technology transfer exist and are well documented in the literature. As noted by Radosevic (1999), these can be classified in numerous different ways. Here, similarly to Maskus (2004), I distinguish between formal and informal modes of international technology transfer. Formal modes of international technology transfer occur through market transactions, while informal modes are outside the scope of market transactions. As noted below, there are many complementarities between formal and informal modes of transfers. Formal modes of international technology transfers consist of trade in capital goods and professional services, foreign direct investment, joint ventures, and licensing. International trade in capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, or turn-key plants, or trade in professional services, such as engineering consulting services, or technical assistance, exposes the importer to the underlying technological knowledge. For example, the process of integrating imported machinery into production processes implies learning about its operation, adapting the supply chain upstream and downstream of it, etc (Radosevic, 1999). Such transfers of knowledge may be formally included in the purchase contracts e.g. via training or technical assistance. Foreign direct investment, joint ventures and licensing, are among the channels available to firms in advanced economies seeking to diffuse their technology to foreign markets (Blomstr\u00f6m and Kokko, 2003). 27 Foreign direct investment consists of establishing a subsidiary in a foreign market. A joint venture is a contract under which two or more firms agree to some level of collaboration, oftentimes by establishing a new company under co-ownership. Typically, the owner of the technology will make the technology available to foreign firms, which will use their knowledge of their local markets to enhance technology diffusion. Finally, the purchase of a license by a foreign firm gives production or distribution rights to some technology protected by intellectual property, as well as the information and knowhow to make effective use of it (Maskus, 2004). 28 Technology transfers via foreign direct investment, joint venture, or licensing therefore occur from the owner of the technology to the foreign firms involved, whether these are subsidiaries in the scope of foreign direct investment, partnering firms in the scope of joint ventures, or the firm licensing the technology. These foreign firms are provided with technical information and knowhow needed for producing and/or operating the imported technology. Often times this involves training of local staff and sharing of design documents. These formal modes of technology transfer are complemented by informal modes, which notably allow technological knowledge to be further transferred to other firms and agents in the recipient countries. These informal modes are not market transacted and therefore fall under the umbrella of knowledge spillovers discussed previously. Assessing the role of such knowledge spillovers associated with trade and the operations of multinational corporations in foreign countries has been the focus of a large body of literature, reviewed by Saggi (2002) and Blomstr\u00f6m and Kokko (1998). This literature focuses in particular on the role of reverse engineering and other ways of learning trade secrets; 29 labor turnover, where workers trained or 28 Licensing is often used in both joint ventures and foreign direct investments as the legal tool to transfer the technologies among the firms involved (whether partners or subsidiaries). 29 Reverse engineering efforts are sometimes referred to as demonstration effects, as local firms imitate the foreign technology once demonstrated to work in the local market. previously employed by a multinational firm transfer important information to local firms; and vertical linkages, where technology is transferred to local suppliers or distributors. 30 Informal modes of technology transfer can also play an important role without being linked to formal modes. Reverse engineering can target imported consumer goods; firms in emerging economies can study patent applications filed by foreign firms; temporary migration of students attending universities, scientists taking part in international collaborations, or engineers temporarily employed in firms in advanced economies may also contribute to technology transfer (Maskus, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Firm technological capabilities from technology transfer to innovation", "text": "Drawing on empirical studies of international technology transfer, a large body of literature highlights that once transferred technologies are oftentimes modified by the receiving firms (Pack and Wesphal, 1986;Bell and Pavitt, 1993;Fagerberg, 1994;Nelson, 2004;Bell, 2007). The need for such technology modifications and continued improvements stems from the fact that technology markets will typically be very different from region to region. For example, the characteristics of the demands from technologies will differ markedly from region to region and evolve at different paces. Similarly, different regions have different resource endowments and access to raw materials, which may affect the performance of the transferred technologies and call for modifications. The literature refers to 'firm technological capabilities' to characterize the ability of firms in developing countries to seek out the most appropriate technologies through transfer and to improve and adapt them to the characteristics of their environment and in response to changing conditions (e.g. Bell and Pavitt, 1993;Bell, 2007;Lall, 1992;Kim, 1997;. However, the taxonomies of firm technological capabilities also encompass capabilities linked to the development of new technologies (Radosevic, 1999). 31 As noted by Bell and Pavitt (1993, p.162), as firms accumulate technological capabilities they are progressively able to introduce more significant changes to the technologies being transferred and eventually \"firms produce the kinds of technological change which are usually thought of as innovations\". Drawing on research on the evolution of several industries in Korea, Kim (1997; links the accumulation of technological capabilities in firms below the frontier in emerging economies to the dynamics of innovation in advanced economies outlined by Abernathy and Utterback (1978;Utterback, 1996) and reviewed in Section 1.2.1.1. Kim's model is schematized in figure 1.3 and has at its core a three step model of technology acquisition, assimilation, and improvement.When a technology in advanced economies has reached maturity (upper chart in figure 1.3), production processes typically become highly standardized and less reliant on skilled labor. The technology can be relocated to developing countries, where production costs are lower. Firms in emerging economies with limited technological capabilities can acquire the technology from advanced economies via technology transfer. Kim (1997;  country. Increased competition leads to efforts to assimilate the technology and introduce differentiated products. Firms with higher technological capabilities can introduce gradual improvements, often times driven by export opportunities."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1.3: Innovation processes and catching up", "text": "Source: Kim (1999) Note: in the lower chart time flows in the opposite direction as in the upper chart. Kim's model underscores that firms which have successfully acquired, assimilated, and possibly improved upon transferred technologies in the specific phase, may build on this experience and aim to repeat the process with technologies at an earlier stage of development. For technologies in the transition phase (upper chart in figure 1.3), however, firms in emerging economies must be able to engage in some basic forms of R&D activities to assimilate and improve on the transferred technology. Kim refers to the challenges as shifting from 'duplicative imitation' to 'creative imitation'. Some firms may accumulate sufficient technological capabilities to generate technologies in the fluid phase (upper chart in figure 1.3) and eventually compete with firms in industrially advanced countries. Various authors have offered detailed breakdowns and descriptions of capabilities of firms in emerging economies. 32 Arguably the most complete classification was put forth by Lall (1992) and improved by . This classification, summarized in table 1.2, distinguishes between a firm's production capabilities and its technological capabilities. 33 As defined in Bell and Pavitt (1993, p.163): The former incorporates the resources used to produce industrial goods at given levels of efficiency and given input combinations: equipment (capital-embodied technology), labor skills (operating and managerial know-how and experience), product and input specifications, and the organizational methods and systems used. Technological capabilities consist of the resources needed to generate and manage technical change, including skills, knowledge and experience, and institutional links and linkages. 32 See Bell (2007) for a review of some of the most prominent classifications of firm level capabilities in the literature. 33 Different authors have put forth different firm capabilities classifications with varying analytical scope. For example, Kim's (1999) 'technological capabilities' encompasses Bell and Pavitt's (1993; 'technological capabilities' as well as their 'production capabilities'. The classification also identifies three types of activities: investment, production and supporting activities; and distinguishes among three different depths of technological capabilities, highlighting the different levels of sophistication reached as capabilities accumulate. The 'advanced' level corresponds to frontier-like capabilities, while 'basic' and 'intermediate' correspond to sub-frontier levels of capabilities."}, {"section_title": "The role of government and the systemic nature of technological catch-up", "text": "Most scholars who have contributed to the literature on firm technological capabilities recognize that firms are only one element in a broader system of technological development. Kim (1999, p.119) notes that \"firms develop their technological capability through in-house efforts, augmented by interactions with domestic and foreign institutions, constrained by regulations, and stimulated by government incentives in the dynamically changing global technology environment\". In most cases, firm technological capabilities have been used to frame assessments of industrialization processes in developing countries at the industry level, and to underscore the central role of governments in inducing firms to acquire and upgrade their capabilities. Lall (1992) combines his classification of firm level capabilities with an assessment of national technological capabilities, focusing on the interplay of capabilities linked to physical investments, human capital, and technological efforts; incentives for production and investment; and market and non-market institutions. He uses this national technological capabilities framework to discuss and compare a set of core indicators of industrial development in several East Asian countries (Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), India, Thailand, and two Latin American countries (Brazil and Mexico). In an earlier study, Lall (1987) develops a classification of firm capabilities to assess the performance of Indian firms from the early 1960s to the early 1980s in the cement, iron and steel, and textile industries, as well as in a number of case studies of firms in consumer goods, heavy electrical equipment, machine tools, and petroleum refining. The study provides a high level of detail at the firm level. However, it also carefully considers the role of policy-induced constraints on firms. In particular, Lall assesses the role of the government policy of protecting domestic firms from import competition and new foreign investments. The policy was notably complemented by mandatory use of domestic capital goods and local consultants. The study also highlights the role of government bias in favor of public sector ownership in iron and steel, as well as the effect of government support of small-scale enterprises through various subsidies. It also details how price controls, industrial licensing procedures, and the regulation of technology transfers were used in conjunction with government directed industrial planning and investments. Lall (1987, p.228) concludes that though the Indian firms studied have clearly expanded their technological capabilities, \"the generally sluggish industrial growth created by the government's policies held back both the pace of learning and its deployment; and the anti-export bias and infrastructural constraints held back the exploitation of [technological capabilities] for foreign markets\". Amsden (2001) also develops a comprehensive classification of firm technological capabilities to compare and contrast how the governments of a group of developing countries during the second half of the 20 th century induced the accumulation and enhancement of such capabilities within firms. 34 Amsden (2001, p.8) argues that successful state driven late-industrialization was based on a principle of reciprocity whereby subsidies were allocated to domestic firms subject to meeting \"monitorable performance standards that were redistributive in nature and results oriented\". She explains how some governments succeeded in creating 'national leaders' in a variety of industries -i.e. successful domestic firms with their own knowledge based skillswhile others failed. She also details the various government policies introduced and national institutions created in these countries as firms entered industries characterized by higher levels of technological complexity. Some of the most prominent types of government interventions included export promotion, the allocation of industrial licensing, performance standards, technology transfer controls, R&D subsidies, and the establishment of government research institutes. The reciprocity principle outlined by Amdsen (2001) was arguably most effectively used in Korea. In her earlier account of that country's industrial development since the early 1960s, Amsden (1989) also uses firm technological capabilities as an analytical support and considers developments in a number of industries (e.g. cement, steel, automobiles, shipbuilding). However, she places far greater emphasis on a number of concurrent factors. In particular, she underscores the importance of a strong interventionist state, its interactions with large diversified business groups, as well as the existence of a cohort of competent engineers and an educated work force. Amsden (1989) details the cumulative nature of policies and measures introduced by the Korean government in support of industrialization. At their core were tariffs to protect infant industries, as well as a variety of incentives and subsidies for private investors. Price controls were also extensively used to tailor support to specific sectors and the government also closely monitored technology transfer. Amsden (1989; details the strong discipline exercised by the Korean government over private firms through a variety of performance-based incentives, and the role this played in spurring technological catch-up. She notes that the concentration of firm technological capabilities in a few large-scale diversified domestic companies notably made the enforcement of this discipline easier for the government. Of particular prominence to monitor firm performance was the use of export objectives, though various technology indicators, notably pertaining to technological transfer and R&D investments, were also used. Firms which performed poorly faced rationalization, seizure of assets, and, in the worst cases of failing firms, a refusal to bail them out. In contrast, well performing firms were provided with further subsidies as well as industrial licenses to operate in new markets. Kim (1997; also uses his technological capabilities framework as a tool embedded in a broader narrative of industrial development in Korea. He builds on case studies of Korean industries since the 1960s (e.g. automobile, electronics, semiconductors) to identify the mechanisms which have allowed Korean firms to accumulate technological capabilities, first in mature technologies, followed by intermediate technologies, and ultimately emerging technologies (see figure 1.3). Kim (1997; underscores in particular the role of the strict regulatory framework geared towards pushing domestic firms towards higher value industries, and the assimilation of foreign technology. For example, the government's export promotion policies forced domestic firms to rapidly engage in the transfer and assimilation of foreign technology. Similarly, the government's strategic push towards heavy and chemical industries forced domestic firms to invest in another wave of technological learning based on foreign technology in industries where they had little prior experience. Kim (1997Kim ( , 1999 also highlights how the government adapted the regulatory framework over time. For example, in the early stage of industrialization during the 1960s and 1970s, the government restricted foreign direct investment as a means of technology transfer, accelerating technology assimilation and forcing firms to develop independent managerial capabilities. However, starting from the 1980s, as Korean firms engaged in more sophisticated industries and foreign technologies became more difficult to transfer, foreign direct investment and licensing were allowed to increase. Domestic R&D funding also started playing an important role within firms. Newly formed government research institutes and various reforms in the education system contributed to helping Korean firms move towards more research based technology development."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "General approach: case studies combining system and firm perspectives", "text": "The above literature review highlights the complex and dynamic nature of technology development and catch-up processes and how this has affected scholarly work on the topic. As technologies move from the realms of science to production and become commercially viable, the market becomes an important driver of technology development. Market opportunities allow firms to accumulate experience, which in turn feeds into technology learning processes. Furthermore, market opportunities create incentives for firms to invest in other means of technology development, namely R&D and imitation. It is apparent from the literature, however, that these three principal means of technology development -R&D, learning from experience, and imitation -are heavily intertwined with important overlaps and feedbacks among them. The literature emphasizes that the ability of firms below the frontier to engage in technological development goes hand in hand with their ability to accumulate technological capabilities. To capture these diverse characteristics, assessments of technology development and catch-up in the literature have relied heavily on case studies at the industry or technology level, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. Two approaches in the literature stand out in terms of the methodological structure they provide to case studies analysis. The first, 'technology innovation systems', has been used to assess innovation processes at the frontier. By combining assessments of a system's structural elements -i.e. actors, networks, and institutions -and of its functions, it offers a powerful tool to capture the systemic characteristics of technological development. In contrast, the second approach, 'firm technological capabilities', has been mainly used to assess technology development below the frontier in developing countries. It categorizes firm technological capabilities along different types of activities and with various levels of depth, allowing for a detailed accounting of technology development. Technology case studies therefore seem best suited to answer the research question outlined in Section 1.1.4 and I propose to combine the 'firm technological capabilities' and the 'technology innovation systems' approaches to form the methodology used to test the research hypothesis. The first approach provides the depth for a detailed assessment of technology development activities of firms below the frontier, which is necessary to assess the extent of technological catch-up and answer the research question. The second approach offers the breadth to systematically capture the role of various agents in technology development, including that of the government, which is central to the research hypothesis. As noted above, the literature on technological catch-up in developing countries already combines firm technological capabilities with assessments of the systemic environment surrounding firms, notably the role of governments. However, these systemic assessments have remained relatively unstructured. By adopting the technology innovation systems approach I therefore hope to provide more structure to this part of the analysis. The firm technological capabilities approach is designed to address questions of catch-up and is therefore well suited for this research. The main issue is whether the technological innovation system approach can be applied to assess technology development below the frontier. A similar issue has been raised in the scope of 'national systems of innovation', discussed in Section 1.2.1.3. Viotti (2002) argues that studies of national systems of innovation tend to focus on a country's scientific and technical institutions and that this is inappropriate for industrializing economies (i.e. below the frontier) where such institutions play a secondary role and possibly no role at all in the process of technological development. Nelson (2004) agrees that some reorientation is needed for assessments of technological catch-up. However, he also notes that national innovation systems still provide a useful framework. He underscores that the ability to independently make incremental modifications to technologies, central to the process of catchup, is conceptually close to innovation. In addition, Nelson (2004) argues that the focus on science and technology institutions is mandated in the scope of many modern industrial sectors as technological catch-up rapidly requires these. The technological innovation systems approach provides a framework, articulated around structural elements and core system functions, that is sufficiently flexible to capture the role of a diverse set of agents. These may include science and technology institutions as well as many other types of agents depending on the nature of the case considered. Furthermore, with only minor modifications to the scope of the system functions identified in the literature and outlined in table 1.1, the approach can capture technology development dynamics more broadly, whether at the frontier or below it. As suggested by Nelson (2004) in the scope of national innovation systems, 'technological innovation systems' can therefore easily be recast into broader 'technology development systems', suited for the needs of this research. These functional considerations at and below the frontier are detailed in table 1.3."}, {"section_title": "Table 1.3: functions of technology development systems", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Name of function Key function characteristics Main distinction at and below the frontier", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Market formation", "text": "Markets allow firms to accumulate experience, which is an essential input to knowledge development. Market competition and the prospects of securing profits also constitute one of the main incentives for firms to invest in knowledge development. The ability of firms at the frontier to secure market shares for their product depends in large part on their technological capabilities. Firms below the frontier have lower technological capabilities yet may still gain access to markets if either: 1) Lower prices of factors of production combined with technology transfer make their products competitive with those of frontier firms, or; 2) Government creates a market through regulations only accessible to them."}, {"section_title": "Entrepreneurial activity", "text": "Entrepreneurial activity consists of the ability of firms to take risks and probe new technologies, modify existing ones, or test new uses and applications.

Much entrepreneurial activity is therefore also needed to successfully adapt transferred technologies to the specificities of local market conditions.\nAs mentioned above, an important sign of entrepreneurial activity in the Chinese wind turbine Finally, though as mentioned earlier much R&D efforts have focused on relatively short-term technology development some firms and research institutes had engaged in more substantial long-term R&D where the risks of failures were higher."}, {"section_title": "Guidance of search", "text": "Several factors influence the direction of technological development.

Similarly, no concerns were raised about the availability of qualified engineers to work in the growing wind power industry. Aside from the traditional engineering training offered by most universities in the country several universities also offered specialized academic curriculums. For example, NCEPU's School of Renewable Energy offered an undergraduate program dedicated to wind power engineering, which by 2011 was accepting 90 new students a year. Probably the most significant issue with respect to the availability of resources concerned qualified research staff within universities. The issue was not a lack of highly educated and qualified engineers. Rather, as noted by an ERI interviewee, the challenge was to attract people to work on long-term R&D. A CREIA interviewee explained that people had limited incentives to do continued, high-level academic research.

The definition of technological catch-up outlined above as 'entities at lower levels along a technological path rising at a faster pace than the evolution at the technological frontier' is conceptually appealing and I draw on Perez (2004, see figure 1.1) to depict the process over time schematically in figure 1.4. At the frontier, technological knowledge accumulates over time as a technology is developed. An entity below the frontier (the cross in figure 1.4) can catch up if it is able to accumulate technological knowledge at a faster pace than the evolution of the frontier, otherwise it will fall behind. 35,36 Catching up therefore consists of a convergence of technological knowledge over time. The assessment is broken down into two sub-components. The first sub-component aims to assess whether technology development at the frontier of new climate friendly energy technologies has been driven primarily by the support extended by governments through policies. I use patent applications as an indicator of knowledge development at the frontier, which I correlate with policy changes in countries which have historically provided strong support to climate friendly energy technology development. The second sub-component aims to assess whether the frontier of new climate friendly energy technologies has progressed slowly relative to other technologies and industries. I use patent applications in combination with technology penetration rates as indicators of knowledge development at the frontier and compare trends of new climate friendly energy technologies to those related to other technologies and industries."}, {"section_title": "The case of wind power", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Case selection", "text": "The research question and hypothesis consist of one dependent variable: technological catch-up, and three explanatory variables: first, the size of the domestic market relative to that of foreign markets; second, the level of activity of the Chinese government in supporting technology development among Chinese firms; and third, the pace of knowledge development at the technological frontier relative to other technologies. In theory, drawing conclusions on the generalized validity of the research hypothesis would require that the research method outlined above examine at least as many case studies as there are explanatory variables. Therefore at least two new case studies of new climate friendly energy technologies could be used to test the validity of the hypothesis, with emphasis on ensuring variation in the dependent variable. However, this thesis has focused solely on the case of wind power technology. While this single-case research design allows for only limited inference, it has explanatory value and furthermore puts forth a novel research method combining distinct approaches from the literature. In future work, the findings presented in the following chapters need to be complemented by additional technology case studies. I discuss the selection of other potential technology case studies in chapter 5. The focus on one technology case study reflects the level of detail required for each assessment and the difficult processes involved in securing access to industrial information in China. In particular, the three assessments outlined above require diverse data collection efforts, both quantitative and qualitative. Extensive interviews were notably conducted with officials from a sample of actors of the Chinese wind power technology development system, including wind turbine manufacturing firms, universities, research institutes, industry organizations, and government. The choice of wind power was driven by a central feature of the research hypothesis: that China can create relatively large markets for climate friendly technologies. In this respect, wind power is an excellent case study. Indeed, as detailed in Chapter 2, by 2010 China had the largest national wind power market in the world in terms of installed capacity."}, {"section_title": "Introduction to wind power technology and cost drivers 38", "text": "I introduce here some of the basic principles and key technological characteristics of wind power which have guided much of the technology development efforts described in subsequent sections. Though several types of wind turbines have been developed and tested over the years, this thesis focuses on horizontal axis up-wind turbines as this technology is by far the most widespread across the world. The axis of the rotor on such turbines is parallel to the direction of the wind with the rotor turning perpendicular to it and in front of the tower on which it stands. 39 Wind turbines convert kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical energy and ultimately electrical energy. The power contained in a steady airstream can be characterized by the equation P = 0.5 3 , where is the density of the air, A is the cross-sectional area of the airstream, and U is the wind speed. This cubic relation implies that power increases disproportionately as wind speed increases. Wind turbines are therefore presented with much greater amounts of wind power during a period of high wind speed than during a comparable period of slow wind speed. 40 One consequence is that turbines will likely produce most power at speeds above the mean wind speed, even though these occur less frequently. In addition to varying wind speeds, at any given site the direction of the wind will also vary over time. In order to capture the highest fraction of power in the wind, the rotor should be perpendicular to the wind direction as this increases the area A in the above equation. Wind speeds tend to increase with height, particularly in the case of rough surfaces, such as forested areas or built environments. Installing turbines high above the ground or sea level allows capturing higher wind speeds, thereby increasing the power available in the wind. Conversely installing turbines in locations of low roughness, such as plains or the open sea, will increase the available power in the wind compared to an equivalent location with higher roughness. In addition, lower elevations are also linked to greater turbulence which can contribute to damage turbines. Wind turbine rotors convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical energy. According to Betz Limit, regardless of the turbine, the theoretical maximum power which can be extracted from the wind's energy is 59%. Assuming a given conversion efficiency, the equation above highlights that the rated power of a turbine increases with the swept area of the turbine. 41 These basic principles have guided much of the technology development efforts discussed in this and subsequent chapters. These efforts have focused on bringing down the costs of electricity produced from wind power, whether by reducing the initial investment cost, reducing the annual operating and maintenance (O&M) costs, or by increasing the annual electricity production. 42 Though there are innumerable ways to improve wind power technology and reduce the cost of electricity, I highlight below some of the key areas of technology development. One important area is blade design as this plays a central role in determining the conversion efficiency from kinetic energy in the wind to mechanical energy in the rotor shaft, and therefore affects total electrical output. Each location has a unique wind power distribution and the selected rotor should capture as much power as is economically feasible over a broad spectrum of available wind speeds. One challenge is to balance the benefits of increasing production by capturing the power available at higher wind speeds, with the risks of damaging the turbines and thereby increasing O&M costs. All turbines have ways to avoid capturing wind power above certain wind speeds. The two most common approaches have been either to design airfoils which naturally stall above certain wind speeds, or to allow blades to be mechanically pitched away from the wind. In addition, the rotor may also be brought to a stop through various types of brakes. Larger swept areas allow capturing more wind power and therefore generating more electricity. A related area of technology development has therefore focused on blade materials and manufacturing methods to allow building increasingly long blades while maintaining essential properties. However, a limiting factor in the trend towards larger turbines has been turbine weight. Heavier turbines are more expensive due to higher material costs and installation costs. Large turbines notably need specific cranes with heavy lifting capabilities which are costly to mobilize. Weight reduction has therefore been another important area of technology development which has concerned all aspects of the turbine, from the development of new lighter building materials to new drive train configurations and technologies. A broad area of technology development concerns the conversion of mechanical power in the rotor shaft into electrical power through a generator, often in conjunction with a gearbox. The drive train (i.e. the combination of gearbox, shafts, and generator) can be coupled with a converter to ensure the power generated is compatible with the electricity grid specifications. Many different drive train and converter designs and technologies have been developed and tested to enhance conversion efficiency and therefore increase power production. In this process, a number of other important criteria must also be taken into considerations, such as grid friendliness, or turbine weight. Another central issue is turbine reliability. This is particularly important in remote locations where maintenance costs can be high and access can be difficult. The development of effective control and monitoring strategies for wind turbines therefore play a central role in maximizing power production and reducing O&M costs. In addition, simplifying turbine configurations to limit O&M requirements has been another important area of technology development. Accurately mapping wind power resources to identify the best available locations for wind power is another essential task to ensure wind power projects maximize electricity production. Offshore locations have notably been highlighted as holding some of the best wind resources. This, however, raises important new technology challenges as technologies specific to offshore wind power conditions need to be developed. Turbine foundations and grid extensions notably account for a much larger share of total investment costs in the case of offshore projects and have therefore been the object of increased technology development efforts. Finally, beyond the turbine itself, wind power is interconnected to regional power grids, governed by strict electricity quality standards. Compared to conventional power generation, the high level of intermittency of wind power production linked to the natural variability of the wind creates added costs to the overall system due to the need to provide more ancillary services, such as short-term load balancing. There are therefore important areas of technology development at the system level which contribute to reducing wind power generation costs.     However, when looking at the evolution of annual incremental capacity installed, by 2010 four Chinese firms were ranked among the top 10 firms globally, with Sinovel and Goldwind ranked among the top five. In addition, apart from Vestas, which was ranked first, the rate of increase in incremental installed capacity towards the end of the decade appeared higher for Chinese firms than for frontier firms. In sum, in the space of five years, China went from representing a small fraction of global installed wind power capacity to becoming the country with the largest cumulative installed capacity in the world. By 2010, over three times as much wind power capacity was installed in China than in the United States, the second largest market in the world, and over nine times more than in Germany or Spain. When looking at cumulative installed capacity at the firm level, Chinese firms lagged behind some of the leading firms. This is not surprising given the relative short history of the Chinese wind power market. However, incremental installations highlight the rapid growth of Chinese firms, which by 2010 were ranked among leading firms globally. "}, {"section_title": "INDICATORS OF WIND POWER TECHNOLOGY PROGRESS", "text": "This section focuses on the first part of the chapter's analysis of technological catch-up and uses indicators of wind power technology progress to assess whether a convergence of trends over time can be identified between firms at the technological frontier and in China. In particular, I use indicators of some of the key characteristics of wind turbine technology as well as indicators of wind power plant performance."}, {"section_title": "Wind turbine characteristics", "text": "A central feature of the evolution of wind turbine technology has been turbine size. Turbines have become increasingly large as firms have endeavored to continuously reduce electricity generation costs and optimize the use of limited geographic resources, first onshore and subsequently offshore. 46 One simple metric of turbine size is the rated capacity of turbines. Figure 2.4 shows the evolution of average turbine rated capacity of the cumulative and incremental installed capacity in China and in the three main markets for wind power -the United States, Germany, and Spain. China experienced the fastest rise in average turbine size of its cumulative installed capacity and had the highest value in 2010. Yet when looking at the average turbine size of its annual incremental capacity, China remains behind other countries. Furthermore, the difference in average size with leading countries has only shrunk marginally between 2005 and 2010.  shows turbines over 1MW in capacity, though several frontier companies started with much smaller models. Vestas' first commercial model introduced in 1979, for example, was a 30KW turbine. Among the leading Chinese firms, only Goldwind produced less than megawatt scale turbines, starting with a 600KW model in the late 1990s. Frontier firms started producing megawatt scale turbines from the early 1990s and turbine size has since increased progressively, ranging from 4MW to 7.5MW by 2012. In contrast, most leading Chinese firms only entered the market between 2005 and 2008 with turbines ranging from 1.2MW to 2MW. After an initial phase of relatively slow increase in the capacity of new turbine series, the trend in turbine size rose rapidly with four of the six leading Chinese firms having prototypes ranging from 5MW to 6MW by 2012. 47 Wind turbine manufacturers typically introduce new products within series of a given rated capacity, for example the '1.5MW' series. Within series are various turbine models. Each model has specific characteristics, usually according to the conditions in which it is designed to operate in, such as wind speeds, temperatures, etc.  The data include prototypes of commercial turbine series. I do not include here experimental or demonstration projects. Typically, commercial production of the series starts between one and two years after the installation of a prototype. If a series had more than one prototype installed the year of first installation was used. A related feature of the evolution of wind turbine technology is blade length, as longer blades allow turbines to capture more of the wind's kinetic energy.     "}, {"section_title": "Wind turbine performance", "text": "The performance of wind turbines can be assessed using data on operation and maintenance (O&M) as well as electricity generation. Useful O&M data includes data on service and repair costs, types of failures, mean time between failures, or turbine availability rates. However, such data are difficult to compile in a systematic fashion as plant operators or turbine manufacturers in both China and other markets are reluctant to share this information. This section therefore draws exclusively on electricity generation data as a means to assess and compare turbine performance. The indicator used to assess the performance of wind turbines is the capacity factor, which is the ratio of the actual electrical output over the maximum electrical output if turbines were running at their rated capacity all the time. Wind resource availability as well as turbine power generation performance are therefore central to determining the capacity factor of wind turbines. In theory, turbine design is another important determinant of the capacity factor. A hypothetically large rotor combined with a small generator would achieve an artificially high capacity factor, though at the price of limited electricity output and a high cost of electricity. In practice, however, project developers aim to select the best turbine designs for the location of the wind farm so as to optimize output and minimize cost of electricity. The capacity factor is therefore not a design criterion but rather an outcome of this decision-making process and can serve as a useful indicator of performance. Capacity factors can be calculated at various levels of aggregation, from a single turbine, to a wind farm, and country. However, electrical output is typically monitored at the level of the wind farm and this is therefore the main unit of analysis adopted here.  51 Only projects for which data had been monitored and reported to the CDM for all of 2010 were included. 52 Finally, only projects using turbines over 1MW were considered (all projects in the sample use 1.5MW turbines except for nine projects, three of which use 1.25MW turbines and six of which use 2MW turbines). Of the 47 wind farms in the sample 13 used turbines manufactured exclusively by leading foreign companies (primarily Vestas and GE) while the remaining wind farms used turbines manufactured exclusively by leading Chinese manufacturers (primarily Sinovel, Goldwind, and Dongfang). The capacity weighted average 2010 capacity factor for projects using turbines manufactured by foreign firms was 26% while that of projects using turbines manufactured by Chinese manufacturers was 24%. To while that of projects using foreign manufacturers was 25%. The second cluster consists of three projects on the north western coast of Shangdong province. Two of these use turbines manufactured by Chinese manufacturers while the third uses turbines from a leading foreign manufacturer. The shortest and longest distances between projects in this cluster are 50 and 150 miles. The capacity weighted average 2010 capacity factor of the projects using Chinese turbine manufacturers was 23% while that of the project using a foreign manufacturer was 24%. The third cluster consists of four projects located in Jiangsu province. Two use foreign turbine manufacturers while the other two use leading Chinese turbine manufacturers. Three projects in this cluster are within a 20 mile radius while the fourth is 70 miles away. The capacity weighted average 2010 capacity factor of projects using foreign manufacturers was 26% while that of projects using Chinese manufacturers was 22%. The fourth cluster of projects consists of six projects in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Three of these use foreign turbine manufacturers and three use leading Chinese turbine manufacturers. Four projects are within a 21 mile radius, while two others (only four mile apart from each other) are approximately 70 miles away. The capacity weighted 2010 capacity factor of the projects using foreign manufacturers was 21% while that of projects using Chinese manufacturers was 23%. Though based on a small sample of Chinese wind farms, the above results do not show conclusively any significant difference between the performances of wind farms using Chinese turbine manufacturers and those using foreign manufacturers."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Technology indicators of turbine rated capacity and blade length show a convergence of trends, with Chinese firms progressively introducing new models in the same range of sizes as firms at the frontier. Turbine top head mass manufactured by Chinese firms also appears to be in the same range as turbines manufactured by frontier firms. In addition, the diversity of drive-train configurations found among frontier firms is also apparent among Chinese firms. Comparisons of turbine performance are difficult due to limited data available and as a result, I was only able to compare capacity factors. Another limitation was that sufficient production data was not yet available at the time of writing to capture much of the recent rise in turbine size mentioned above. Nevertheless, data compiled on capacity factors for a sample of wind farms in China shows that the trend is rapidly increasing. In contrast, capacity factors of a sample of United States wind farms have evolved more gradually. By 2010 capacity factors in China were in the same range as those found in leading markets. Furthermore, data from a small sample of Chinese wind farms using either turbines manufactured by Chinese firms or frontier firms also suggests no significant differences in capacity factors. In sum, wind power technology indicators show that Chinese firms are indeed catching up with the wind power frontier.\nFor each of the three countries, the above discussion underscores a high level of correlation between changes in government support policies and the level of wind power deployment. This suggests that markets for wind power have relied on government policies as they would have not been economically feasible otherwise. The policy timelines in each case highlight the frequency with which the level of government support for wind power deployment has been altered. This has had a clear effect on the rate of deployment. As discussed in the literature review in Section 1.2, this is relevant as market opportunities drive firm investments in long-term technological development efforts. Such frequent changes to government support policies may be linked to a number of factors. One of these, though beyond the scope of the above discussion, is politics. Extending government funding on a large scale and over several decades to a specific technology such as wind power is likely to be a politically taxing process. As governments change, so do political priorities, which in turn affect the willingness of governments to support deployment. In addition, as discussed in The political decision to not pursue nuclear power as an alternative power generation technology in both Denmark and Germany likely had a number of positive effects on wind power deployment. Nuclear power is a low greenhouse gas emitting technology and given the climate mitigation ambitions of both countries, the decision likely led to more pronounced government support for wind power in addition to providing firms with more certainty with respect to the long-term prospects of wind power. Another important factor which may explain the numerous changes in deployment support policies is the pervasive uncertainty faced by policy makers concerning the effectiveness of the policies introduced. This is clearly apparent in the case of California during the 1980s, where the policies to support wind power deployment led to a rush of installations far beyond what the government expected. Such uncertainties are further fueled by changes in external factors, such as in the price of steel used in wind turbine manufacturing, the prices of fossil fuels, as well as the progress made in wind power technology and turbine manufacturing. Changes in such external factors alter the power generation cost differences between wind power and incumbent technologies thereby changing the effects of government policies. These factors continually evolve and though governments may try to tailor their support to technology deployment accordingly, this is likely to be an imperfect process as an information lag will necessarily persist. A common feature in all three countries is the apparent ability of project developers to preemptively increase deployment to secure certain support levels prior to the time governments introduce changes. This is highlighted by the spikes in deployment prior to policy changes witnessed in each country. This phenomenon is not surprising given the bureaucratic process involved in policy change and the frequent interactions between government and firms. However, it further contributes to accentuating market fluctuations. The case of offshore wind power development is also instructive as it highlights the difficulties faced by policy makers in creating new market opportunities for wind power. Of the three countries considered, only Denmark has succeeded in launching offshore wind power projects during the time frame considered. However, this involved large projects requiring lengthy approval processes. Offshore development is notably complicated as it requires costly and technically sophisticated grid connections. This was one of the reasons behind the numerous delays faced by offshore projects in Germany, despite several increases in feed-in tariffs.\nThe discussion above highlights the diversity of approaches pursued by governments to support wind power technology R&D. In the early 1980s in both Germany and the United States the government launched programs aiming to develop large utility-scale turbines through collaborations with the aerospace industry. In both countries the programs were eventually abandoned, having failed to lead to any significant technological follow-ups, whether commercially or through further government R&D projects. One issue in both cases appears to be that the government was unrealistic about the time needed for technology development. This is notably reflected by the overlapping timing of government funded turbine prototypes in the United States, that left no time for engineers and developers to monitor prototypes and draw on this experience to improve new models. Another important issue is that these projects were entirely funded by the government. The firms involved therefore had no financial stakes in ensuring the projects led to useful commercial technological knowledge. The projects appear to have been primarily driven by government policy objectives rather than based on real firm-level capabilities. In both Germany and the United States, the projects notably involved aerospace companies with no visible long-term interest in wind power. The Danish government followed a more cautious and incremental approach. The dataset was treated in two ways prior to being used in the analysis presented here: first to select only patent applications linked to new knowledge generation; and second to select only the most important type of intellectual protection. Regarding the first treatment, patent applications either seek intellectual protection of new knowledge or the geographic or time extension of existing intellectual protection. The latter leads to the creation of patent families, which consist of the set of related patent applications associated with the same invention (OECD, 2009). The emphasis here is on the generation of new knowledge and I therefore only consider the first type of patent applications. To do so I only select patent family heads (i.e. the first patent application of a patent family) and unique patent applications (i.e. patent applications not part of a patent family). The second treatment focuses on the types of patent being sought. Though terminology and scope vary from one patent jurisdiction to the other, three broad types of patents exist. Invention patents are typically used to protect the most significant new technologies; design patents focus on protecting new design features; while utility models, only available in some countries, typically involve less stringent requirements compared to invention patents, and may be used to protect less significant technology developments. Invention patents can be considered at the heart of the technology development process as they are used to protect the most significant new technological features. I therefore only consider this type of patent in data presented here. To identify patents associated with wind power technology I use the EPO patent classification for clean energy technologies. 156 For each country I look at two types of patent data. The first consists of wind power patent applications filed by the patenting authority of the country, thereby seeking intellectual protection within the country's borders. The second consists of wind power patent applications where one of the inventors or applicants is located in the country. For this second type the patents may therefore have been filed anywhere. The two types of patent data are closely linked and offer nuances to the assessment of patenting trends. The first is more relevant in the scope of deployment as the deployment policies considered in this chapter are national yet typically do not discriminate on the nationality of firms involved or the place of filing of their intellectual property. In contrast, the second type of patent data is more relevant in the scope of government R&D funding as this has typically targeted national firms and research institutions (see Section 4.2.2 for details). The emphasis in this section is in correlating changes in the rate of wind power patenting, deployment, and R&D funding. I do not attempt to compare the patenting rates (i.e. the number of patent applications in a given year) across countries as different countries have different intellectual protection regimes. Similarly, I also do not attempt to compare patenting rates across the two types of patent data as these are based on very different sample sizes. While information on country of filing is available for all patents in the Patstat database, only about half of all patents contain information on the location of inventors or applicants.  In the case of Germany (figure 4.11) the timing of the overall rise in the number of yearly patents filed in the country from the late 1990s also corresponds to the increase in cumulative deployment. In addition, the modest increase in patenting activity during the second half of the 1970s can be linked to the surge in government R&D funding over the same period. Similarly, the rise in government R&D funding during the 1990s also corresponds to a rise in patenting activity. From the late 1990s, it is difficult to identify a correlation between patenting and government R&D funding as possible effects of government R&D funding are compounded with  As in the case of Denmark and Germany, the rate of patents filed in the United States (figure 4.12) has increased sharply from the late 1990s, which corresponds to a sharp rise in cumulative wind power deployment in the country. Similarly to the case of Germany, the rise in patenting in the late 1970s and early 1980s is correlated to the sharp rise in government R&D funding. Unlike the case of Denmark and Germany, however, the strong growth in patenting activity from the late 1990s is not accompanied by a rise in government R&D, indicating that deployment may be the main cause of the surge in patenting. The strong correlation between changes in wind power patenting rates and changes in policy induced wind power deployment and government R&D funding in the three countries considered strongly suggests that the hypothesis that government has been the main driver of wind power technology knowledge development is correct. \nSolar hot water heaters, solar PV, and CCS technologies appear to be suitable potential case study technologies to further assess the validity of the hypothesis outlined in Chapter 1. Such case studies would also likely offer some interesting contrasts compared to the case of wind power discussed in previous chapters. Markets for solar thermal technology and gasification have notably developed prior to the formulation of the Chinese government policy goals pertaining to the development of climate friendly technologies. The extent to which the evolution of this policy context has influenced the role of government in the respective systems of technology development is notably interesting. In the case of solar PV, the fact that China has been an important supplier to world markets implies that large Chinese PV manufacturers already exist and have experience with the technology. The role of government in this system of technology development is therefore likely be more focused on enhancing technological attributes than on ensuring the engagement of Chinese firms in the domestic market. In addition, the case of PV will shed light on the role of a large domestic market, which is central to the research hypothesis."}, {"section_title": "TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES OF CHINESE WIND TURBINE MANUFACTURERS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Assessing firm technological capabilities associated with product technology", "text": "As indicated previously, technological catch-up implies that converging trends of technological indicators are combined with rising firm technological capabilities.

Below I first discuss in some details interview findings concerning turbine designs and blueprints, turbine components, and R&D activities. I then draw from this to assess using table 2.2 the evolution of technological capabilities of Chinese wind turbine manufacturers. First, however, it is useful to put into perspective the evolution of the role of Chinese turbine manufacturers firms in the Chinese market, and to briefly describe the industrial roots of the six firms which took part in this study.

In 2010, SEwind was the sixth largest Chinese turbine manufacturer and the 14 th in the world. It was created in 2006 by Shanghai Electric, a state-controlled enterprise and another major power equipment manufacturer in China, also involved in a variety of manufacturing industries such as trains and other railway equipment, electrical machinery, and machine tools.

XEMC is a subsidiary of Xiangtan Electric Manufacturing Corporation, a state-owned enterprise which specializes in the manufacturing of electric equipment ranging from industrial motors and generators to elevators, as well as heavy trucks, rail equipment, ship propulsion systems, among others."}, {"section_title": "Turbine designs and blueprints", "text": "Designs and blueprints constitute the technological anatomy of the wind turbine. They codify the technological choices which make up its unique layout, and embody a broad spectrum of engineering calculations pertaining to a variety of fields ranging from fluid mechanics, material sciences, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and acoustics, among others. Designs and blueprints are therefore at the heart of wind power technology. In this section, I discuss how Chinese wind turbine manufacturers obtained and developed the designs and blueprints for the various turbine series and models produced since entering the market. Interviewees from all firms underscored that following initial installation in China, many turbines did not perform as expected and required significant maintenance. Interviewees noted that in retrospect, these initial models were not very well suited for Chinese conditions, for example with respect to temperature variations or dust levels in the air. Soon after their initial deployment Chinese manufacturers started making small modifications to the turbine designs in order to better adapt them to the specificity of the Chinese environment. At the same time demand for wind power in China was growing rapidly and manufacturers responded by making further changes, offering models specifically suited to the diverse conditions found across the various wind rich regions of China. Aside from progressively introducing models that were able to accommodate different wind conditions through different blade lengths and tower heights, manufacturers offered models specifically tailored to the cold climates of the northern regions, where much of the initial growth in demand for wind turbines was concentrated, to high altitudes, to the desert condition of north-western regions, to different grid requirements, among others. These modifications were made by the Chinese manufacturers, sometimes in collaboration with specialized firms, but for the most part independently from the original European licensors. For most firms, the turbine series which stemmed from these initial licensing agreements became core product lines and by 2011, Chinese manufacturers offered a broad variety of models to suit all possible market conditions. Sinovel installed in China over 6,600 turbines in its 58 Training and technical assistance was also provided in the scope of licensing agreements. Furhlander, for example, provided technical assistance, quality control, and training to Sinovel as it installed the first licensed turbines in China. However in general it appears to have been more limited than in the scope of joint-development agreements. One firm that made extensive use of joint- Goldwind and Vensys collaborated on the design of a 1.2MW direct-drive permanent magnet turbine and produced a prototype in 2006. Vensys did most of the design work, particularly concerning the drive train, generator, and rotor, while Goldwind took more responsibility for the control system. Following the erection of the prototype, Goldwind and Vensys increased the machine's capacity from 1.2MW to a 1.5MW and Goldwind started mass production in 2007. 59 The name of the firm was not provided at the time of the interview. 60 Due to much larger generator size and the absence of gearbox the layout and load distribution in a direct-drive turbine are very different from DFIG turbines. Goldwind offered a variety of models, with different rotor diameters, various tower heights, and the technical variety to accommodate the specific conditions of the different regions (cold climate, desert, high altitude, etc). By 2010 the 1.5MW direct-drive series had become Goldwind's main product line, with over 3,900 units installed. 61 In 2008 Sinovel entered a joint-development agreement with Windtech, an Austrian firm which had recently been acquired by American Superconductor (AMSC), for the development of a 3MW DFIG model for both onshore and offshore projects. Sinovel had been accumulating experience with its 1.5MW DFIG series but had no exposure to off-shore designs. Windtech Small steps towards independent designs were followed by more ambitious efforts. United Power independently developed a 6MW DFIG model, twice the rated capacity of its largest existing model, and produced a prototype in 2011. Goldwind, in an effort to mitigate financial risks related to spikes in the price of rare earth elements used in PMSG generators, drew on its experience with both gearboxes and DDPM technology to independently design a 3MW hybrid turbine, combining a gearbox and medium speed permanent magnet generator. This new design reduced the size of the generator, thereby reducing the overall weight and quantity of rare earth elements needed. A prototype was completed in 2009. Though originally intended as demonstration project, Goldwind indicated that it had started producing the hybrid turbine in small batches. Similarly SEwind is currently independently developing a 5MW DDPM offshore turbine, moving away from the DFIG technology it used in its previous models. While much of the design work on these turbines is done independently, most manufacturers indicated that they still turn to foreign consultants for assistance with specific issues, for example with blade design, finite element analysis, drive train analysis, prototype testing, among others."}, {"section_title": "Acquisitions of foreign firm", "text": "Two Chinese manufacturers deepened bonds with European firms through acquisitions. Goldwind acquired a majority stake in Vensys in 2008. The two companies subsequently cooperated to develop a 2.5MW DDPM model for which a prototype was erected in 2009 followed by production in 2010. The general features of this turbine are similar to the 1.5MW model, but Goldwind and Vensys introduced a number of improvements to the design in order to optimize the structure and reduce turbine weight per unit capacity. They also completed the design of a scaled-up 3MW model which became commercially available in 2012. In addition, they designed a 6MW machine the first prototype of which is to be installed in 2013. One feature of the acquisition of Vensys by Goldwind is that Vensys continues to license its own turbine designs to firms outside of China under its own brand name. In 2009 XEMC acquired Darwind, a Dutch wind turbine design firm. Darwind was another recipient of direct-drive turbine designs from Zephyros following the firm's bankruptcy, and had since been working on a 5MW direct-drive version (de Vries, 2011). Soon after the acquisition of Darwind, the new entity -XEMC-Darwind -completed the new 5MW turbine design and a first prototype was installed in Holland in 2011, while a second was being erected in China at the time of interview."}, {"section_title": "Wind turbine components", "text": "In this section I turn to some of the main components of wind turbines -the gearbox, the generator, the bearings, the control system, the converters, and the blades. In each case, I focus on the evolution of the Chinese supply chain and how Chinese turbine manufacturers have secured supplies and addressed product quality concerns given the rapid evolution of the market and the new turbine series being introduced. 62 It is important to keep in mind, however, that these components are composed of many subcomponents, which are themselves composed of further sub-components. While the main components may be designed and manufactured in China, the manufacturers of these components may still source some of the sub-components from abroad. For example, several turbine manufacturers indicated that certain important sub-components, such as hydraulic pumps or sensors, were imported because they were both cheaper and of higher quality than what could be found in China. Similarly, United Power purchased the epoxy resin used in the manufacture of its own turbine blades, discussed below, from Europe or the United States, as Chinese suppliers had little quality control and lacked adequate certification. 63"}, {"section_title": "Gearboxes", "text": "While wind turbines are a relatively new technology in China, Chinese firms have in fact extensive experience in manufacturing certain turbine components.

Often these are large state-owned heavy industry enterprises such as Nanjing High-speed and Accurate Gear Group, or Chongqing Gearbox Company, both of which have long been among the main manufacturers of wind turbine gearboxes in China (ERI, 2008). Many Chinese turbine manufacturers purchased their turbine gearboxes exclusively from Chinese suppliers. In some cases gearbox manufacturers were associated with turbine manufacturers. For example, Dalian Heavy Industry, which founded Sinovel and was still one of its main shareholders, manufactured turbine gearboxes and was one of Sinovel's main suppliers. Though Chinese gearbox manufacturers dominated the Chinese market, several firms indicated that they still worked with foreign gearbox suppliers, particularly for some of their newer models. Dongfang for example, purchased gearboxes for its existing 1.5MW models from Chinese firms, but also turned to foreign suppliers for its newer and larger models. Similarly, United Power turned to a German manufacturer for the gearboxes of its 6MW turbine. Among the turbine manufacturers interviewed, United Power is also the only one which had also started manufacturing some of its own gearboxes, though production was still small at the time of the interviews."}, {"section_title": "Generators", "text": "The Chinese wind turbine generator market was also dominated by Chinese, often state-owned, enterprises.

China. One reason is product reliability, as bearings are particularly costly to replace. This is particularly true of the main shaft bearings, located between the rotor and the gearbox and/or generator, which require dismantling of the drive-train to replace. Turbine manufacturers explained that while there are several Chinese suppliers of main shaft bearings for the most established turbine models on the market, they still turned for a large part of their supplies to foreign suppliers, such as the SKF Group, Schaeffler Technologies, or Timken, despite being significantly more expensive than bearings sold by Chinese firms. However, several manufacturers indicated that Chinese bearings manufacturers, to which they were increasingly prepared to turn to, were progressively gaining market shares. When XEMC for example, started producing its 2MW turbines, it only used foreign suppliers of bearings. However, it progressively started working with Chinese bearing manufacturers, which at the time of interview supplied part of their bearings needs for these models. The official interviewed explained that a similar approach was likely to take place with their 5MW series. Similarly, Dongfang indicated that it used almost exclusively Chinese bearing manufacturers for its 1.5MW model though it purchased bearings from foreign suppliers of its larger models. Some Chinese bearings manufacturers were also associated with wind turbine manufacturers. This is notably the case of Shanghai Electric, which produced both main shaft bearings and pitch bearings, and is one of the suppliers of SEwind."}, {"section_title": "Power converters", "text": "The power converter is the interface between the wind turbine generator and the electricity grid. It notably enables a variable speed operation of the turbine -and therefore greater extraction of energy from the wind -by maintaining voltage, frequency, and other variables of electricity production at standards compatible with electricity grid requirements. Compared to other components, control systems and blades, discussed below, are more unique to the wind turbine industry. However, given the central role of control systems in managing the performance of turbines, many turbine manufacturers indicated that they aimed to develop and produce their own control systems. The Sinovel official interviewed explained that the firm had started developing its own control systems in collaboration with Mita-Teknik. At the time of the interview, however, these only represented a small fraction of the firm's needs. Similarly SEwind had started deploying control systems it had recently developed. The pitch-control was still being supplied by a specialized German firm but the interviewee explained that they were also working with Chinese firms on the development of this sub-component. United Power is another firm which started developing its own control systems. Similarly, Goldwind explained that it used its own control system in its turbines. XEMC obtained designs and software for the entire control system used in its 2MW direct-drive turbine through its joint venture agreement with Harakosan. This has allowed the firm to improve and up-scale the control system to suit its 2.5MW and 5MW models."}, {"section_title": "Blades", "text": "The sound design and manufacturing of blades is vital to capturing as much kinetic energy in the wind as possible. Though collaboration between component and turbine manufacturers was central to all the components discussed above, turbine manufacturers indicated that blades were an area where such collaborations were particularly important. There are now many Chinese blade manufacturers but the majority collaborate with foreign firms through joint ventures or other contractual arrangements. Avic Huiteng, for example, was among China's three largest blade manufacturers in terms of capacity since the early 2000s, and was one of the largest independent blade manufacturers in the world. Sinovel and SEwind indicated that they purchased all their blades from such Chinese suppliers. For its 2MW series XEMC's blade suppliers were also mostly Chinese. However, for larger models they also turned to LM Wind Power, from Denmark, which is the largest independent blade producer in the world and has a large manufacturing base in China. Goldwind also collaborated with both Chinese manufacturers and LM Wind Power. In addition it purchased two Chinese blade manufacturers in 2010. At the time of the interview, however, these accounted for a small percentage of the firm's supply of blades and integration of the acquired firms in the company's supply chain was still at an early stage. Dongfang manufactured blades for its 1.5MW and 2MW models. The blade designs were obtained through collaboration with Aerodyn, which Dongfang contracted for the task. However, Dongfang indicated that it would turn to foreign suppliers for its 3 and 5MW models. United Power independently designed and manufactured some of its blades and produced sufficient numbers for all its 1.5MW models. It hoped to expand production to other models, and gradually sell blades to other manufacturers. The firm was also planning to manufacture the blades of its 6MW turbine."}, {"section_title": "Dynamics of components supply", "text": "The approach adopted by turbine manufacturers to secure supplies of the main turbine As turbine manufacturers started developing new, larger models, they most turned again to foreign component suppliers for initial production. Once more it is only after an initial growth in the market for the new products that Chinese suppliers appear to have started entering the market to supply components for these larger models. One possible reason which emerged from the discussions with turbine manufacturers was that the rate of development of new turbine models had been higher than that of the Chinese supply chain. The United Power interviewee, for example, said that even though the gearbox market in China had many large and experienced 65 Using foreign suppliers did not necessarily ensure product reliability. SEwind for example used a German supplier of blades for its first batch of 1.25MW turbines. Problems emerged rapidly with the blades and the company quickly turned to a Chinese supplier for further production. Chinese suppliers, the firm still relied on a German gearbox manufacturer for the initial components of its latest 6MW model because the Chinese supply chain was not ready to deal with such larger models There are signs, however, that the discrepancy between the pace of development One implication is that this has created an impetus for turbine manufacturers to consider producing their own components as a means to accelerate turbine development efforts. This has notably been one of the main drivers of Sinovel's recent efforts to develop its own control system and converters. Similarly, United Power explained that an important driver in the decision to develop their own component manufacturing capabilities, notably with respect to blades, gearboxes, and generators, was to avoid relying on an inadequate component supply chain, unable to engage in technology development efforts."}, {"section_title": "Research and development", "text": "The above discussions described how Chinese turbine manufacturers tackled obtaining turbine designs and blueprints and securing supplies of some of the main turbine components. Here, I adopt a different perspective and discuss a particular type of activity undertaken within the firm: research and development (R&D). R&D is often considered in the literature on technological development as an activity which characterizes firms at the technological frontier. Yet, as discussed in Chapter 1, the pursuit of R&D activities is also important below the frontier, and as illustrated in table 2.2, is central to activities of firms with advanced technological capabilities. Often the distinction between R&D at the frontier and below it comes from the relative importance of the research and the development components of R&D. At or close to the frontier, R&D will typically be characterized by a higher proportion of applied research while farther below the frontier development will play a more central role. One difficulty in assessing R&D is that while many attempts have been made to clearly define what constitute R&D activities (e.g. OECD, 2002), in practice, it remains a loosely defined concept. Firms at or below the frontier may consider certain activities to fall under the category of R&D while others may not. For this reason this section is based on a part of the interviews with officials from Chinese turbine manufacturing firms in which they were asked about the organization, current activities, and recent achievements of their firm's R&D activities. R&D was purposely not strictly defined so as to allow interviewees to discuss whatever activities their firm considers as R&D. In addition in order to alleviate any concerns about proprietary information, it was made clear to each interviewee at the onset that we expected them to only share information to a level of detail they felt comfortable with, and that we were more interested in broader trends than individual cases. For this reason the level of detail in what follows varies significantly and should only serve to assess trends in R&D activities. Before turning to the organization of R&D activities within firms and their interactions with research institutions, I first briefly provide some background information about R&D funding, location of R&D activities, and R&D staff and management."}, {"section_title": "2.2.5.1", "text": "Funding, location, staff and management Turbine manufacturers were reluctant to share detailed figures on relating to their annual R&D funding. In some cases, such as Dongfang, the interviewee explained that this was due to the fact that the wind turbine manufacturing business was not a clearly distinct accounting unit within the rest of the company. Nevertheless, all pointed that R&D investments were between 3.5% and 5% of revenues, which was the legal minimum requirement for their industry. 66 At Sinovel, most R&D activities had been undertaken in two office buildings in central Beijing company anywhere in the world had yet adopted in a commercial wind turbine. SEwind's R&D activities are organized around blade research, electronics, load calculations, systems design (e.g. lubrication system or cooling system), and mechanics (e.g. finite element analysis). Some of the R&D priorities highlighted were typhoon resilience, further development of SEwind's main control system, the development of a pitch control system, and the design of the permanent magnet generator which SEwind planned to use in its 5MW direct-drive machine. This came in addition to the monitoring of the 3.6MW model prototype, which had been operating for several month at the time of the interview. Some of the main recent achievements of SEwind's R&D group were the design and manufacture of increasingly long diameter blades, which they achieved in collaboration with their Chinese blade suppliers. Another important achievement was the development and implementation of their control systems. When asked about work on future models or alternative drive trains, the interviewees explained that they were focusing on their 5MW product, and that for the time being they had no R&D projects on larger capacity models. One interviewee explained that beyond 5MW, turbine weight with existing drive-train configuration became a significant issue. He added that though alternative drive trains to the dominant DFIG or PPDM configurations existed, these were still too far from being commercially viable. XEMC highlighted that the first priority of their R&D group was to keep improving the design and control strategy for their 2MW series based on operating data from wind farms in China. The second priority was the introduction of the 5MW model, for which a second prototype was being erected in China at the time of the interview. SEwind highlighted a range of research collaborations with universities as well as research institutions, such as the Shanghai Glass Fiber institute, with which it collaborated on blade materials and designs. Collaborations with universities have included work on grid integration and control systems. However interviewees noted that results were often not so useful, as they could not readily be integrated in the firm's products. The XEMC official highlighted that most of their university collaborations were with local universities in Shandong Province. The interviewee noted that their R&D collaborations were typically aimed at assisting the firm with specific calculations in which the university research groups had particular strength, or which were needed at a time when the firm was understaffed. One example put forth by the interviewee was a project with a research group at Tsinghua University to assist them with design calculations for their 2MW turbine generator."}, {"section_title": "Evaluating firm technological capabilities", "text": "The Finally, collaborating with universities and other research organizations on turbine development corresponds to 'advanced' capabilities."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The analysis presented in this chapter indicates that Chinese wind turbine manufacturers are indeed catching up with foreign frontier firms. Indicators of wind turbine technology progress showed converging trends in terms of both wind turbine characteristics and performance. There are, however, some important areas for which data could not be assembled. It was notably impossible to gather data on operation and maintenance trends either in China or other leading countries. Similarly, data used for the calculation of capacity factors in China do not consider much of the recent rise in turbine size. Future work should therefore aim to complement the data compiled in the scope of this research. The evaluation of firm technological capabilities associated with product technology in six of China's leading wind turbine manufacturers showed that these had grown rapidly, being at the time of interviews at advanced or intermediate levels for the three types of activities identified by   More striking however was the evolution of firm capabilities related to production activities. These rapidly evolved from basic to intermediate levels, and in some cases appeared to be reaching advanced levels. The evolution of the means of technology transfer adopted -from licensing, to joint development, acquisition, and targeted technical assistance contracts -played a critical role in the rapid growth of capabilities associated with production activities. Not only did these means of technology transfer provide the Chinese manufacturers with access to wind turbine technological knowledge, they also facilitated its assimilation through extensive and close collaboration with foreign firms. By 2011 all firms had acquired sufficient knowhow to independently develop new turbine models. However the primary emphasis of their technology development efforts, both in house or in collaboration with research institutions was on introducing incremental, short-term technology improvements. Still, some firms engaged in more ambitious R&D projects with more long-term outlooks, akin to innovation efforts at the frontier. Interviews were based on the technology development system approach detailed in Section 1.3. In particular, two types of interviews were conducted, each focusing on a set of technology development system functions. 69 Interviews with people from the policy making group covered each of the six system functions, namely 'market formation', 'knowledge development and diffusion', 'entrepreneurial activity', 'guidance of search', 'legitimation', and 'resource mobilization'. Interviews with the turbine manufacturers and research organizations focused on two system functions: 'knowledge development and diffusion' and 'guidance of search'. For both types of interviews the approach was semi-structured: a core set of interview questions were identified for each system function, yet ample room was left for follow-up questions to allow for thorough discussions of recurring and salient themes. provide some context for the Chinese government's interest in wind power. 71\nThis chapter described some of the most salient features of the Chinese wind turbine The government exerted its influence on firms, both state-owned and otherwise, through regulatory means and various networks. In particular, the government extensively used industry associations to keep track of industry developments, coordinate new regulatory steps, and facilitate the exchange of information with firms. The chapter suggests that the hypothesis that technological progress made by wind turbine manufacturers was driven by the combination of exposure to large market opportunities and the active involvement of the government within a wind power technology development system is correct. Nevertheless, undoubtedly the biggest challenge facing the Chinese wind turbine technology development system was whether it would be able to transition from a model of technology development based on technology transfer to one based on technology innovation. At the time of this research, the R&D agendas of both firms and research institutions were still dominated by short-term, incremental, problem-solving oriented technology development. In addition, the government R&D apparatus was primarily structured to support such R&D efforts within firms rather than to complement them, for example, by focusing on common, industry wide technology issues or longer term technology development efforts. Still, some firms and leading research institutions were involved in frontier-like R&D projects, tackling technology challenges at the forefront of the industry. Though clearly a small part of the Chinese wind turbine technology development system, this indicates that innovation capabilities were present. Similarly, the government also appeared to be aware of the limitations of the current R&D support model and willing to consider possible reforms to its R&D support institutions. compare trends for wind power to those of other technologies.\nSection 4.2 highlighted the central role played by governments to both create markets for wind power and support wind power R&D efforts. The detailed policy timelines in the three countries discussed reflects the challenges of implementing policies which can provide fertile environments for firms to engage in technology development, whether through stable market opportunities or sound R&D support. These policy efforts were highly correlated with wind power patenting trends, suggesting that government policy has played a central role in wind power technology development. 1990s. However, by the early 2000s it had surpassed that of all conventional energy technologies and subsequently rose at a much faster rate. Still, comparing numbers of actual patent application filing shows that wind power is far behind patenting rates in a number of technologies, particularly fossil fuel power generation and oil and gas drilling. The above discussion highlights the unique nature of wind power as a policy driven technology. Though wind power was a relatively novel technology in the 1980s and 1990s, the rate of patenting during this period was slow relative to all other technology subfields, including the most mature of technologies. The relative slow pace in knowledge development can be attributed to limited government support. In particular, the largest rise in wind power patenting in the three countries considered were all associated with the rapid increase in cumulative wind power deployment starting from the late 1990s and early 2000s. The pace of policy induced wind power deployment can therefore be identified as the main limiting factor in the pace of wind power knowledge development."}, {"section_title": "The roots of the Chinese government's interest in wind power", "text": "To better understand the role of government in China's wind turbine technology development system, I outline here some important trends underlying government planning decisions related to wind power.

Nevertheless, in 2010 China accounted for over half of the world's coal consumption and virtually all projections indicate 72 One tonne of oil equivalent (toe) refers to the net heat content of 1 tonne of crude oil.

Reserves are defined as proven volumes of energy resources that are economically exploitable at today's prices and using today's technology. In contrast resources refer to volumes that cannot currently be exploited for technical and/or economic reasons, as well as volumes that are unproven but geologically possible (BGR, 2012 From an energy security perspective, the concern therefore appears to be less about long-term physical availability of domestic resources than about the potential inability of the domestic coal supply chain to meet the growing demand. In 2009, the country became for the first time a net importer of coal. Due to its sheer size, the country was already the second largest importer of coal in the world by 2010, following Japan. As a result, China is increasingly exposed to international coal price dynamics. The spot price of steam coal at Qinhuangdao, the country's largest port used for coal trade, has notably increased, doubling in value between September 2007 and September 2011. 77 Though understanding the causes of international coal price movements is a difficult task, it appears that part of the reason for the rise in Qinhuangdao spot prices is that international coal suppliers, such as Australia and Indonesia, were not able to keep up with China's rapid growth in import demand (IEA, 2011b). China's heavy reliance on coal to fuel its economic growth also has important implications in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. As shown in figure 3. emissions from coal combustion alone accounted for 56% of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions. The Chinese government's response to the rapid rise in coal consumption and its implications for energy security and greenhouse gas emissions can be traced through objectives formulated in its five-year plans. A long-term objective has notably been to reduce the energy intensity of the country's economic activity.

When looking at high-technology manufacturing industries alone, China's share of global value added has increased from under 3% in 1995 to close to 19% in 2010. However, when expressed as a percentage of China's GDP, the share of KTI has only increased from approximately 18% of GDP in 1995 to 20% in 2010. This increase was primarily driven by growth in high-technology manufacturing, which rose from representing approximately 2% of GDP in 1995 to 4% in 2010, while the share of knowledge-intensive commercial and government services have remained approximately the same. 78 KTI consists of knowledge-intensive services and high-technology manufacturing industries. Knowledge-intensive services are broken down into three types of commercial services (financial, business, and communications) and two types of government services (education and health). High-technology manufacturing consists of aircraft and aerospace, pharmaceuticals, computers and office machinery, semiconductors and communications equipment, and scientific instruments (NSB, 2012). 79 Value added is as the measure of industry production that is the amount contributed to the value of a good or service.

China has gone from a trade deficit in high-technology goods of USD 6 billion in 1995 to a trade surplus of USD 157 billion in 2010, primarily driven by exports of communications goods, computers, and office machinery. 81 However, Xing (2010) finds that foreign invested firms accounted for 85% of China's total high-tech exports by 2008.

The 12 th five-year plan, released in 2011, also emphasized the importance of indigenous innovation and placed scientific development at the core of the country's long-term economic development strategy. It set as an objective for the country to increase spending on R&D to 2.2% of GDP by 2015.

From 2003 to 2007, five rounds of annual tenders were conducted under the concessions program which led to the allocation of 18 projects, ranging in capacity from 100MW to 300MW, and totaling 3.4GW in capacity. 87 The main features of the program managed by NDRC were the use of a competitive bidding process and a requirement for grid companies to purchase all power generated by wind power and to sign long-term purchasing power agreements with the selected project developers at the agreed bid price. 88 85 Though provincial governments have also introduced regulation to support the wind power deployment, the discussion in this section only includes the regulatory framework introduced by the central government. 86 A number of more limited efforts in support of wind power had been introduced prior to the concessions program. See Liu et al. (2002) for a discussion of these earlier efforts. 87 See Ni (2008) and  for a complete list of concessions projects. Not all 18 projects allocated resulted from a tender. Depending on land availability, the winning bids of some projects were used to negotiate the construction of adjacent wind farms on similar terms. 88 Developers bid for the price of electricity they would receive during the first 30,000 full load hours of cumulative electricity generated by the plant. After that, and until the end of the 25 years concession period, developers receive the average electricity price at that location. See Li et al. (2006) for a detailed account of the four first rounds of the concession bidding process. China stated that power generation firms operating more than 5GW in total generation capacity had to have 3% of their total capacity by 2010 from non-hydro renewable energy sources, and 8% by 2020. By the end of 2008 over 160 wind farms had been built through these regulatory means. Based on this experience, in 2009 NDRC changed the wind power project pricing system from a tender based system to a fixed feed-in tariff. 89 The new system distinguished four tariffs ranging from RMB 0.51 to 0.61/kWh depending on wind resources, with higher tariffs in lower wind power resource regions, and divided the country accordingly. The wind power tariffs were higher than the tariffs set for thermal power generation, which were at the time of approximately RMB 0.40/kWh. 90 The above evolution of wind power market incentives concerned only on-shore wind farms. In 2010 NDRC and the NEA introduced a concessions program to start off-shore wind power development and a first round of four projects totaling 1GW in capacity was approved. The allocation of a second round of projects totaling 2GW was scheduled for 2012 but was subsequently delayed due to project siting issues. The government also introduced a variety of tax breaks for clean energy investments including wind power. Effective as of 2008, the new Enterprise Income Tax law included a reduction in income tax rates from 25% to 15% for high-technology firms, from which, depending on criteria discussed later in this chapter, wind turbine manufacturing firms could benefit. Wind power projects approved from 2008 onwards also benefited from a three-year exemption and three-year 50% reduction in corporate income taxes. 91 Finally the value added tax (VAT) rate for wind power generated electricity was reduced from 17% to 8.5%. 92 Several interviewees underscored the pivotal role of the capacity requirements placed on large power generation companies in spurring the development of the Chinese wind power market. An interviewee from CREIA noted that the 2010 target had been achieved in advance and believed that the 2020 target would also be met. He explained that there was a dimension of prestige for large power companies in achieving the targets and embracing a green growth model. Most of the firms were state-owned and successfully meeting targets was seen favorably by the government. He highlighted that there was also some competition among large power generators, where the success of some pushed others to try to perform better. However, the interviewee explained that there was also a financial rationale underlying the aggressive pursuit of wind power project development by power generation companies. While there have been many reports of poorly managed wind power projects in China, the most successful developers, such as Longyuan, were in fact achieving satisfactory rates of return from their wind farm operations, particularly in contrast to the rest of the power generation portfolios of their holding companies. Between 2004 and 2011, Chinese power generation companies experienced rapidly declining profit margins in large part due to financial losses on coal power generation operations, which in most cases constituted the bulk of their power generation portfolios (Recknagel, 2010;Azure, 2008). Coal prices in China have increased by approximately 200% between 2005 and 2010 while industrial power prices rose only by approximately 30% for the same period (DBS, 2011). Both coal prices and electricity prices were set by the government. However, as underscored by the CREIA interviewee, coal prices were harder to control as domestic prices were increasingly exposed to international market prices."}, {"section_title": "Support to domestic turbine manufacturers", "text": "In 2006, the state council identified large capacity wind power generation units as part of a group of key technologies that were \"greatly related to the development of the national economy\". 93 The NDRC's Medium-and Long-Term Plan for Renewable Energy Development in China established the following goals: By 2010 China will basically have achieved the ability to produce domestically the main renewable energy equipment it uses. By 2020, local manufacturing capability based mainly on home-grown Intellectual Property Right (IPR) will be achieved. The government implemented a number of measures which sought to establish a wind turbine manufacturing industry in China and support domestic firms. Local content requirements for government-supported wind power projects constituted the backbone of such efforts. 94 For the proposals submitted during the Concessions program the government set the local content requirement initially at 50% and increased it to 70% after the first round. 95 In addition, in response to concerns that these requirements were not being enforced, as of the fourth round of the concessions program, developers were asked to work with turbine manufacturers to submit details of their domestic manufacturing plans. 96 The 70% local content requirements were extended in 2005 to all wind farms built in China. 97 These were eventually removed by NDRC in 2009, at least partly in response to international complaints brought to the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, as detailed in Chapter 2, by that time a wind turbine component 93 \"Several Opinions on Expediting the Rejuvenation of the Equipment Manufacturing Industry\", State Council if the Chinese Republic of China, 13 February 2006. 94 The first local content requirements related to wind power were introduced in the 9 th Five Year Plan (1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000), which stated that turbine equipment purchased for projects approved by NDRC had to have a 40% local content. See Dewey & LeBoeuf (2010). 95 Specifically, 70% of turbine components by purchase value must be manufactured in China and the turbines must be assembled in China. 96 See Li et al. (2006) for a detailed account of the concessions program regulatory structure and details of the first four rounds of bidding and project allocations.  (Li et al., 2006;Baker & McKenzie et al., 2007). Similarly, all projects allocated in the first round of off-shore concessions used turbines from Chinese manufacturers (Zhang et al., 2011) though project allocation guidelines included no specific requirements to that effect. 98 However, one indication that NDRC may have favored project proposals based on turbines manufactured by domestic firms was China's procurement law, effective since 2002, which mandated that government procurement target domestic suppliers when these were available. 99 It 98 However, the off-shore project allocation guidelines state that the developer should be a \"China-funded enterprise or Chinese-foreign enterprises where the Chinese party has a controlling stock interest\". remained unclear however whether such procurement guidelines had applied to government investments in wind power. 100 Still, the rapid dominance of the domestic market by Chinese turbine manufacturers may simply be due to financial reasons. Wind power deployment objectives for large power companies were set in terms of capacity installed rather than electricity generated. As highlighted by an interviewee from the CWEA the incentives were therefore primarily to buy the cheapest turbines rather than those which produced the cheapest electricity. This created an investment cost hurdle for foreign companies as their turbines were generally more expensive than Chinese turbines. Li et al. (2006), for example, note that project feasibility studies submitted in 2006 in the scope of the concessions program showed turbines from foreign manufacturers priced approximately 45% higher than turbines from domestic manufacturers. One measure which favored domestic turbine manufacturers was a subsidy introduced in 2008 by the Ministry of Finance to encourage the development of increasingly large capacity turbines. 101 The subsidy was of a lump sum of RMB 600 per kW for the first 50 turbines produced of any new model with a capacity of 1.5MW or more. To qualify for the subsidy the wind turbine 100 The clearest sign that the procurement law did apply to government investments in wind power came following a 2009 complaint from European manufacturers of wind power equipment about their exclusion from wind farm projects funded under the government economic stimulus plan. NDRC announced on its website that purchases for government investment projects counted as government procurement. See Asia Times, 11 June 2009, \"Foreign Companies Blowing in the Wind\". Still, it is unclear whether this comment concerned only stimulus funds or wind power investments more broadly. 101 \"Interim Measures for the Administration of the Special Fund for Industrialization of Wind Power Equipment\", Ministry of Finance, Issued August 2008. manufacturers had to be state-owned or under Chinese control. 102 The firms also had to own the intellectual property for their turbines. Furthermore, the blades, gearboxes, and generators used had to be manufactured by Chinese controlled companies, and turbines with Chinese-made converters and bearings were encouraged. In addition turbines had to be manufactured and tested in China. Recknagel 2010 "}, {"section_title": "Addressing electricity grid integration issues", "text": "Grid integration had been one of the main stumbling blocks for the growth of the Chinese wind power market. Though the Renewable Energy Law discussed above stipulated that grid companies had to expand the grid to accommodate the growth in installed wind power capacity, in reality there was a growing lag in grid connections. By the end of 2010 the share of total installed wind power capacity in China not yet connected to the grid reached approximately 30% (Ni and Yang, 2012;Azure, 2011;National Energy Board, 2011;Schwartz, 2011). In addition, wind farms which were connected to the grid had experienced numerous large-scale disconnections, sometimes hundreds of turbines at a time, which had put significant strain on the electricity system (WPM, 2011e). There appeared to be multiple reasons for these grid integration issues. First, on-shore wind farms were concentrated in the northern and north-western provinces of China, far from the large electricity demand centers in the central and eastern parts of the country. The growth in wind power in these regions exceeded the ability of the local grids to cope with all the wind power generated (Jiang et al., 2011). Grid connection therefore effectively implied building long distance transmissions lines, which were costly and demanding in terms of planning. Second, the approval of wind farms by the government proved to be highly uncoordinated, making grid connection planning all the more difficult. NDRC had been responsible for the approval of projects over 50MW in capacity, while the approval of smaller wind farms had been left to provincial governments. This resulted in over 90% of Chinese wind farms being approved at the provincial level as developers sought to avoid the more stringent project review process of NDRC (WPM, 2011a). Third, as underscored by  the renewable energy law and subsequent regulations concerning the power grid had failed to clearly define responsibilities, objectives, and incentives for grid companies to build adequate grid capacity. 103 Among other concerns  note that the regulatory framework had not included strict punishments when grid companies failed to build grid connections to wind farms, nor provisions for compensating wind farm developers for revenues shortfalls due to the lack of timely grid connection. In addition, the renewable energy surcharge proved insufficient to cover costs incurred by grid companies (CGI, 2012). Finally, the rapid growth in installed wind power capacity had not been accompanied by the timely introduction of adequate standards concerning grid integration technology. There was notably no mandatory requirements concerning Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) technology, which allows turbines to stay connected to the grid in the event of a sudden drop in voltage at the point of connection. Most turbines in China were originally installed without LVRT or other grid integration functionalities and this had been highlighted as one of the main reasons behind the widespread disconnections. 104 The government reiterated the obligation of grid companies to connect wind farms on numerous occasions. 105 It notably introduced amendments to the Renewable Energy Law in 2009 which for the most part focused on addressing grid integration issues. The revised law raised the penalty to grid companies if they failed to comply with grid connection obligations, and called for setting quantitative targets linked to the obligations of grid companies. In 2010 the government started introducing detailed measures to address grid integration issues. The NEA introduced regulations mandating the inclusion of specific grid technologies, both at the plant level and for individual turbines, including LVRT and other functionalities. 106 The Standardization Administration of the People\u00b4s Republic of China (SAC) also approved new technology requirements related to the grid connection of wind farms, which came into effect in"}, {"section_title": "107", "text": "Wind farms and wind turbines already in operation were required to be retrofitted with grid friendly technologies. The revised renewable energy law also emphasized the obligation of grid companies to purchase all electricity generated from projects \"which conform to grid-connected technical standards\". 108 In addition, the NEA introduced in 2010 a regulation which makes testing of grid connection and compliance with technical requirements mandatory for wind turbines used in newly approved wind farms (Jiang et al., 2011). 109 With respect to project planning, a new regulation introduced in 2011 set stricter project approval rules. Under the new rules construction of new wind farms could not begin before the approval process was completed or the projects would not receive feed in tariffs or grid access. Furthermore the new approval process required provincial governments to apply to the NEA for approval of wind farms under 50MW. In addition, all wind farms were required to have a formal evaluation one year after the start of operations (GWEC, 2011;Nomura, 2011). In 2011, the government also raised the renewable energy surcharge on all electricity sales from RMB 0.004 per kWh to 0.008 per kWh to better support the mandatory purchase of power generated from renewable energy sources and the costs associated with grid extensions born by grid companies (CGI, 2012). 110 Furthermore, to continue market formation while easing pressure on grid companies the NEA also introduced measures to accelerate the approval and building of wind farms in low wind resource areas, closer to electricity demand centers and therefore easier to connect to the grid (GWEC, 2011, WPM, 2011b; WPM, 2012). The first commercial low-wind speed project was completed in May 2011 and many new low-wind speed projects have since been approved. Finally, in 2011, the State Grid Corporation, which by the end of 2010 accounted for over 96% of grid connected wind power capacity in China, released a white paper on the promotion of wind power (Schwartz, 2011; State Grid Corporation, 2011). The white paper was the first of its kind for the company and detailed plans for grid extensions associated with eight 10GW regional wind power bases planned by the NEA. The white paper identified the wind power bases which would predominantly serve local demand and those which would serve load centers in central and coastal regions through new long distance high and ultra-high voltage transmissions lines (Ni and Yang, 2012). The whitepaper also outlined plans for the construction of extensive pumped storage capacity in order to help balance intermittent wind power and ensure grid stability (Schwartz, 2011). Grid integration issues were highlighted by many interviewees as constituting a significant challenge to the progress of the Chinese wind power industry. With respect to the elaboration of the new grid standards, an ERI interviewee highlighted that these were primarily the result of lengthy negotiations between the large power generation companies and the state grid companies in response to the technical challenges created by growing wind power capacity. He explained that the government played primarily a facilitator role. An NEA interviewee noted that there were now grid integration standards on three levels -the enterprise level, the industry level, and the national level -and that these concerned manufacturers, utility companies, and grid companies at the state and local level. A CWEEA interviewee explained that the new standards notably contributed to slowing down the pace of market development, at least temporarily, as wind farms and turbines which did not meet the new technical requirements would have to make improvements before being able to get approval. Similarly he explained that retrofitting existing turbines would take time and impose new costs on manufacturers and developers. The ERI interviewee was confident that these recent developments would lead to efficient grid infrastructures capable of integrating the foreseen growth in wind power capacity. He stressed that in light of the size of the Chinese wind market and the pace at which it had grown, issues linked to such infrastructural adjustments were to be expected. In 2008, to encourage the manufacturing of increasingly large turbines in China, the government introduced a rebate on VAT and border tariffs on the import of key components of turbines greater than 1.2MW in capacity. At the same time it also removed an import tax exemption for turbines smaller than 2.5MW. 113 The rebates were updated in 2010 to include components of turbines greater than 1.5MW in capacity, and the threshold for the import tax exemption was raised to turbines above 3MW. 114  Measures aimed to address grid connection issues discussed in Section 3.4.3 were also deemed to have positive effects on turbine quality. The wind farm approval reforms introduced in 2011 notably gave greater oversight of project quality to the NEA. An NEA interviewee also explained that the new grid technology requirements implicitly required a certain level of technological capabilities and forced companies to invest more in R&D and other technological capabilities."}, {"section_title": "Addressing turbine technology issues", "text": "Several interviewees were cautious about the proposed manufacturer admittance standards. One interviewee from the CWEA acknowledged the turbine quality issues in the Chinese wind power market but believed that ultimately a shakeup of the industry should be driven by competition among firms. Another CWEA interviewee made a parallel to the beginning of the European wind power market, where the market consolidated naturally over time. The interviewee also downplayed concerns about the excessive number of manufacturers in China, noting that the majority had in fact produced very few turbines. He explained that at first, small firms that had secured orders could simply purchase components from suppliers and assemble them to produce turbines. However, he stressed this was unsustainable in the longer term as demands in terms of technology, logistics, and scale had increased significantly. He noted that at the time of the interview there were only 10 to 15 manufacturers in China capable of meeting these increasingly high demands. This view was echoed by a Chinese Wind Energy Equipment Association (CWEEA) interviewee, who thought competition was the only thing which would actually make existing firms leave the market. He stressed that the low turbine prices made it difficult for turbine manufacturers without large production bases to remain in the market. 118 The standards, in his view, were therefore not necessary."}, {"section_title": "Structural and institutional issues undermining the quality of wind power projects", "text": "Interviews with various actors of the Chinese wind turbine technology development system highlighted a number of characteristics of the Chinese wind power market and its institutions which undermined the quality of wind power projects. Three of these are discussed below."}, {"section_title": "Misplaced incentives", "text": "As highlighted by a CWEA interviewee, the fact that the government set wind power deployment targets for power generation companies in terms of installed capacity rather than power generated had a profound impact on the quality of turbines selected in wind power projects. The interviewee explained that the main wind farm developers were owned by large state-owned enterprises whose main priority was to show the government the fast pace at which they were installing wind power capacity. He stressed that for a long time questions of turbine quality and wind farm operation and maintenance (O&M) were not a high priority. As a result, the wind turbine market became crowded with manufacturers that focused on producing turbines at low cost rather than based on their long-term performance. However, an interviewee from North China Electric Power University (NCEPU) noted that the situation was changing. Part of the reason was because the warranties on turbines in a growing share of existing wind farms were expiring. Under most wind farm contracts in China, wind turbines were covered by warranties for two or three years, during which time turbine manufacturers were responsible for O&M. After this initial period, O&M responsibilities were passed on to the wind farm owners. 119 A CREIA interviewee noted that as a result of this, developers had started to compare more carefully the merits of different turbines. He explained that this contributed to progressively rising technological demands placed on turbine manufacturers. A CWEA interviewee also noted that bank lending in the scope of wind farm financing was not based on an evaluation of project quality but rather on what collaterals the firm taking the loan could provide. In contrast, he stressed that in Europe or the United States, banks paid close attention to the project itself, often asking independent auditors for due diligence work prior to agreeing to a loan, and thereby providing an additional quality based verification of projects."}, {"section_title": "Turbine certification issues", "text": "Interviews with wind turbine manufacturers highlighted that most wind turbine models they had produced had received design certification while only a few had received type certification. 120 The Chinese wind turbine manufacturing market began its rapid growth prior to 119 The interviewee explained that unlike in the US where O&M is often outsourced to specialized firms, in China the power companies have their own O&M teams. 120 A design certification implies that the criteria listed in the turbine design documents were sound and the turbine will operate safely and according to the stated power generation information. The standard practice is for the certification organization to check all the calculations and procedures identified in the design documents by running its own calculations using the same input data to verify the robustness of the turbine designs provided by the the establishment of Chinese wind turbine certification organizations and as a result much of the certification of Chinese turbines was undertaken by established foreign firms, which were quick to offer wind turbine certification services in China. These included Germanischer Lloyd (GL) and Technischer \u00dcberwachungs-Verein (TUV), both from Germany, as well as Det Norske Veritas (DNV) from Norway. Chinese certification organizations which were progressively increasing their involvement in the wind power sector included the China General Certification Center (CGC) and the China Classification Society. A CGC interviewee noted that turbine design certifications used in China followed the same basic process as in Europe or the United States, and implicitly assumed that turbine production processes followed the specifications outlined in the design documents. However he highlighted that this was often not the case in China, and that this may explain some of the technology issues experienced by certified turbines in recent years. He explained that in a European or the United States context turbine design certification may be sufficient as factories and manufacturing plants had their own quality standards, such as ISO 9000, which could be relied upon. In addition, firms typically had teams responsible for quality control, often including dedicated testing laboratories. He noted that in China however, the manufacturing conditions most often did not meet such quality standards. For example he explained that the Euro Code 3 standard for steel structures were not used for turbine towers in China as welding methods commonly used in China did not correspond to welding standards identified in the Euro Code 3 standard. manufacturer. Firm audits may also be undertaken to check control systems. Type certification includes design evaluation, as well as the testing of machines, and manufacturing evaluation (RED, 2011). The CGC interviewee therefore stressed the need for more extensive turbine certification procedures tailored to Chinese conditions. He explained that his organization had completed a new blade certification protocol specifically elaborated for China which he thought may help address these issues. The first steps were similar to that of international certification organization, and focused on the verification of design documents. Then a prototype of a blade manufactured using the design document should be tested according to all standard test procedures. A third step was a verification of the blade manufacturing process, for example to check that the plant was equipped with temperature and humidity control systems, as well as adequate blade material mixing machines. In addition, the procedure included personnel requirements with respect to training on how to use the machines. Finally the certification included unplanned audits of the manufacturing plants. The interviewee explained that CGC was planning on developing certification protocols for other main turbine components, such as gearboxes and the generator. However he was concerned that more extensive turbine and component certification procedures would not easily be adopted. A CREIA interviewee underscored that there were no government policies in place which specifically required certification and that the certification of turbines was primarily a result of market forces. 121 The CGC interviewee noted that some Chinese turbine manufacturers failed to understand the role of certification and sometimes put pressure on them to provide certificates in a very short time, threatening to go to a competing organization if this could not be done."}, {"section_title": "Wind resource monitoring and modeling issues", "text": "Another hurdle to the development of quality wind power projects in China concerns the monitoring and modeling of wind power resources. An ERI interviewee noted that in the United States or Europe, wind farm developers relied on specialized consulting firms to undertake detailed assessments of wind resources at potential wind farm sites. He explained that in contrast, in China the pace of development was such that site selection had not been given a high priority by developers. Rather than do a complete assessment of wind resource availability, a common approach had been to copy others. For example, in Inner Mongolia, where many existing wind farms were located, wind farm siting decisions had often been based on the performance of neighboring wind farms rather than on the assessment of a site's specific wind resources. A CWEA interviewee explained that an additional issue concerned the wind load models commonly used in the turbine manufacturing process. The models used were defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), based primarily on experience accumulated in the United States and EU markets. However, the interviewee explained that these models were not well suited for Chinese wind conditions. Measurements of wind loads from various areas in China, such as Xingjian, showed distinctive functional forms. He explained that in such conditions, using turbine designs based on the IEC wind load model would be inefficient at best, and may have implications in terms of O&M. He concluded that much worked still needed to be done in terms of wind load modeling to better capture the wind profiles of different regions of China."}, {"section_title": "SUPPORT TO WIND POWER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)", "text": "R&D was an important theme in several interviews.

Firms, however, needed to qualify as new and high technology enterprises, which required owning core intellectual property and investing between 3 and 6% of revenues in R&D, with at least 60% incurred inside China. 123 In addition, firms were required to have 30% of their science and technology personnel with college or university degrees, and at least 10% involved in the R&D of high or new-technology products or services. The regulations also provided detailed definitions of what activities and projects qualified as R&D. They also established a system where firms had to reapply every three years to continue benefitting from 122 As noted previously the law offered a reduction in income tax from 25% to 15% for hightechnology firms. 123 R&D investment rates ranged from 6% if revenues were below RMB 50 million to 3% if revenues were above RMB 200 million.

Furthermore, an interviewee from MOST added that because firms in the wind power sector were for the most part state-owned or state controlled, investing in R&D reduced the amount of the firm's profits which the government could claim, and this itself constituted an additional incentive for investing."}, {"section_title": "Government R&D funding", "text": "The two main actors involved in government funding of wind power R&D are the National Finally, the Support Program focused on key technical problems linked with mass production and commercialization. The MOST interviewee stressed that unlike projects supported by the NSFC, MOST programs funded applied research and therefore emphasized concrete solutions and tangible outputs. A key distinction among these distinct R&D project funding channels was the source of funding. Given its focus on basic science, the NSFC is entirely funded by the government. The An interviewee from United Power stressed that the main benefits of participation in MOST supported R&D efforts were not the financial support received, noting that large wind turbine manufacturers did not lack resources to invest in R&D. Rather, it was the honor the firm received and the recognition which came with it. He stressed that this honor from undertaking a MOST supported R&D project was the best advertisement a firm could receive for its products. The interviewee from XEMC echoed this view, noting that though they received limited funds from the government, taking part in government-supported projects was excellent promotion as it reflected the firm's technological capabilities to develop new products. This point was also underscored by the CWEA interviewee, noting that though the relative value of the financial contribution received from MOST Programs had decreased as the industry had grown, taking part in MOST projects remained a prized honor for Chinese firms and they were therefore keen to continue playing an active part in such projects. Nevertheless a CREIA interviewee questioned the organization of MOST Programs around specific projects, noting that these were typically narrow in scope and failed to provide continuity.

An interviewee from Tsinghua estimated that for every subject area, such as wind power, dozens of experts were involved, often times through industry associations such as CWEA. An interviewee from Goldwind explained that the process brought together turbine manufacturers, wind farm developers, experts from universities, as well as industry associations. Another interviewee from CWEA indicated that the process was also informed by international experience. An interviewee from CASTED indicated that his organization notably assisted MOST in this planning process, such as by conducting studies of best practices internationally. This expert consultation process resulted in detailed guidelines on a list of projects which MOST sought to fund. These included strict technical parameters, with some focusing specifically on the research procedure and key outputs. The guidelines were then made public, after which research groups and firms were able to submit proposals to receive funding and undertake a given project. A MOST committee then evaluated the projects submitted and selected the proposals it would fund. This was also informed by the research credentials of applicants and track record of past collaborations. Interviewees explained that following project completion, an audit by a team of experts from MOST checked whether the project objectives laid out in the proposals had been met and whether funds allocated by the government had been used according to the plan.

As explained by NEA, MOST, and CWEEA interviewees, only recipients of government sponsored R&D projects benefit from the resulting technology, knowledge, and knowhow developed. Similarly, CREIA and ERI interviewees stressed that the existing national or key laboratories belonged to the hosting firm or university. The government had little practical involvement and there were no obligations to share findings. The CREIA interviewee noted that in the case of firm laboratories in particular, output was not shared with others in the industry aside from eventual commercial technology transactions. The ERI interviewee stressed that as a result, R&D remained concentrated within firms which had their own research groups serving their own interests. He viewed that not having national laboratories or companies which provided R&D services to the all industry actors was an important institutional limitation to the establishment of high quality wind power R&D in China. He stressed however that this was not unique to the wind power industry and that solutions would therefore imply broad institutional reforms of the ways in which government funds and supports R&D in China. Still, the NEA and CWEA interviewees explained that the issue was increasingly recognized and the idea of creating a public platform for wind power R&D was gaining traction within the Another question concerns the advantages of working within a public R&D platform compared to R&D centers within firms. The CWEA interviewee noted that NREL and RISO were established prior to the emergence of large wind turbine manufacturers and played an instrumental role in developing key technological knowledge at very early stages of the industry. In contrast, in China large turbine manufacturers developed prior to the establishment of such a public research platform, making the process of setting up such an organization very different. He explained that Chinese manufacturers had increasingly better capabilities to develop technologies, were often associated with very large industrial groups, had the financial resources to invest, and were able to hire qualified engineers. The NEA had also instructed ERI to work on a proposal to create a new R&D organization with a truly public outlook in China, following the model of RISO and NREL. ERI interviewees explained that their objective was to start by creating a new center, independent from existing universities, research organizations, or firms, yet which would be supported by a number of existing institutions, including existing key laboratories and national laboratories."}, {"section_title": "The role of research institutions", "text": "Chapter "}, {"section_title": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University", "text": "The interviewee's research group consisted of five professors (three full professors, including the interviewee, and two associate professors), two postdoctoral students, ten doctoral students, and many Master students.

They developed software and a prototype of a turbine's main control system in collaboration with a manufacturer supported by one of the grid companies. The interviewee explained that they had since transferred their main control system technology to several others firms. In addition, the group worked on the development of pitch control systems, and eventually transferred the technology to Guodian. The interviewee explained that these projects were funded for the most part in the scope of the MOST Supporting Program. The group also collaborated with Sinovel, for which they received some support funding from The interviewee explained that the third project was a particularly novel technology development effort. Though Sinovel did not pursue the idea beyond the research stage, Guodian had decided to move this from research to application and had established a project to develop a prototype of the coupling system for a 1.5MW turbine. At the time of interview the manufacturing had been completed and they were in the process of assembly. The group planned to pursue research on the electromagnetic coupler during the 12 th five-year plan period.

The group had been working on wind power since 2005. The interviewee estimated that approximately three quarters of the group's funding came from firms while the rest came from government research support funding. The work of the group with respect to wind power could be divided into two types of activities. The first consisted of projects which focused on technological solutions beyond a ten year time horizon, while the second consisted of technology support projects undertaken with firms. Examples of projects which fell in the first category included research on torque vibration damping in very large direct-drive permanent magnet wind turbines, over 10MW in capacity. Another example was a project on how individual blade pitching strategies could contribute to stabilize very large floating offshore turbines. The interviewee explained that both these projects were funded by a National Natural Science Foundation research grant and the primary outputs were research papers published in specialized peer reviewed journals. With respect to the second type of projects the interviewee explained that the group worked with firms on the development of converters and pitch control systems. One example was a project, completed shortly prior the interview, with Dongfang Electric. The objective was to help the firm develop the control system of a new converter for 1.5MW direct-drive wind turbines. This involved building experimental set-ups and running a series of tests in the firm's R&D facilities."}, {"section_title": "Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University", "text": "The interviewee explained that he had only worked on wind power research for five years and had one PhD student working with him on the topic. His area of expertise was non-linear dynamics applied to structural engineering. He explained that his group first ventured in wind power R&D to provide technical assistance to firms. One early project consisted of assisting a Chinese turbine manufacturer with making modifications to turbine designs obtained through technology transfer and advising the firm on how to best collaborate with foreign firms. Another project involved technical advice to a manufacturer and a wind farm developer to try to understand why several turbines had collapsed. The group's more recent research focused on wind turbine design. The interviewee explained that design procedures used in the industry did not appropriately account for dynamic and nonlinear properties. He emphasized that in reality wind loads were constantly changing and therefore led to complex structural behaviors. Vibrations, for example, were addressed very differently from a dynamic system perspective than from that of a conventional linear perspective. The group therefore aimed to build a more complete, dynamic mechanical model of the turbine structure and to develop a new turbine design program. In a first instance the objective was to publish results in peer reviewed journals. However if results obtained were positive the group would seek further funding from the National Natural Science Foundation and would consider approaching firms to collaborate on further development. The interviewee explained that the size and scope of this project made it impossible to get funding from the three main MOST programs and had therefore used funding left from projects in coal combustion to support this research. PhDs, 50% master's degrees, and the rest bachelor's degrees. He stressed however that in practice it was often difficult to distinguish the institute from Corona as they collaborated very closely on R&D and product development. The first converters and control systems produced by Corona were for 600kW turbines, followed by converters and control systems for 750kW, 1MW, and eventually 1.5MW turbines. The growing use of pitched blades for turbines over 1MW also led the institute and Corona to develop pitch control technology and integrate this in the control systems produced. During the 11 th five-year plan the institute in collaboration with Corona received funding to develop 3MW turbine converters and control systems. The interviewee explained that the institute had focused on developing new control system functions (e.g. LVRT technology), running simulations and laboratory tests, while Corona had focused on detailed product development and full power testing. The interviewee noted that during the 11 th five-year plan, though the institute remained the largest recipient of MOST R&D funds on converter and control system, several other research groups also received funding (including the research group at Tsinghua University mentioned above). He explained that it was getting harder and harder for the institute to get financial support from the government as the emphasis was increasingly shifting to production, and therefore funding was increasingly targeting firms. The interviewee explained that during the 11 th five-year plan MOST funding represented approximately 20% of the combined R&D funding of the institute and Corona, with Corona financing the rest. The interviewee indicated that Corona had started work on 5MW products. He also highlighted an ongoing joint venture with Guodian Longyuan on the production of its 1.5MW converters. Corona was also involved in a new joint-venture with Datang, a large state-owned power generation company, which had acquired a small wind turbine manufacturer."}, {"section_title": "TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM FUNCTIONS", "text": "I return here to the six technology development system functions outlined in table 1.3 of Chapter 1. I summarize some of the key findings from the interviews to assess how each function has been fulfilled and what role the Chinese government has played."}, {"section_title": "Market formation function", "text": "The market formation function underpins the ability of firms to accumulate technological experience. In addition, competition in the market and the prospects of securing profits constitute an important incentive for firms to invest in technology development. The discussion in Section 3.3 detailed how the Chinese government created a domestic market for wind power through a variety of policies. At the heart of these were minimum wind power capacity targets placed on power generation companies and a preferential price for electricity generated by wind power. The government also introduced a number of measures to support the establishment of a domestic wind turbine industry and to ensure the active participation of Chinese firms. These included local content requirements and a turbine technology development subsidy only available to Chinese wind turbine manufacturers. There were also some indications that the government had given preferential treatment in the allocation of wind farms to projects using Chinese turbine manufacturers. Furthermore, the formulation of wind power deployment objectives in terms of installed capacity favored domestic turbine manufacturers as they priced their turbines lower than their foreign competitors. The market formation process was facilitated by the fact that the main state-owned power generation companies were under pressure from peers and the government to meet their capacity targets. In addition, the relatively negative financial conditions surrounding coal power generation investments also contributed to investments in wind power projects. The government, however, also faced a number of challenges in its efforts to create a domestic wind power market. One of these was that the expansion of the electricity grid to connect wind farms had lagged behind project approvals and construction. In response, the government actively sought to address the various issues at stake through specific regulations. These involved reforming the wind farm approval process, revising the grid code, working with the national grid companies to plan future grid extensions, and increasing the surcharge on power prices to better account for wind power integration costs. Though it was too early to tell whether these measures would be successful, several interviewees were confident that the main issues had been addressed. The interviews also highlighted a number of important underlying structural and institutional hurdles which undermined the quality of wind power projects. These notably concerned the nature of incentives for power generation firms, turbine certification, as well as wind resource and modeling issues. Several interviewees noted that these were institutionally complex to resolve, underscoring the challenges of the market formation processes. Gamesa, both considered as frontier firms, who for three years at the beginning of the rapid growth of the Chinese wind power market only offered turbines of a maximum of 850kW in capacity. These smaller models were eventually phased out of the Chinese market after Chinese firms entered the market offering bigger capacity models. Similarly, a CWEA interviewee stressed that a firm which only produces a 1.5MW turbine, the dominant model at the time of the interview, was sure to go out of business given that competitors were developing larger turbines. Though Chinese manufacturers were accumulating technological capabilities rapidly, the CWEA interviewee thought developing new turbine models required design capabilities which many manufacturers still lacked. Similarly, the CREIA interviewee noted that, at the time of the interview, Chinese manufacturers still relied on joint-development with foreign companies and had some progress to make before being able to independently develop their own technology. The discussion in Chapter 2 on the nature of R&D efforts undertaken by some of the leading Chinese wind turbine manufacturers confirmed that their emphasis had primarily been on making incremental improvements to existing technologies. Nevertheless some firms had started investing in more significant, long-term R&D efforts, similar in scope to innovation efforts at the frontier. Interviews with professors working in prominent Chinese research institutions reflected a similar mix of R&D priorities. Their work had for the most part been oriented towards collaborations with firms to address short-term problems or to assist them in the development of improved technologies. However, some research groups were also engaged in more significant R&D work, tackling longer-term problems at the forefront of the industry. There were therefore clear signs that the capabilities to engage in advanced R&D were present in the Chinese wind turbine technology development system, even though such activities played a relatively small role."}, {"section_title": "Knowledge development and diffusion function", "text": "Concerning the diffusion of technological knowledge two main issues emerged from interviews. The first was that wind power technology R&D funding provided by the government through MOST only served its participants and therefore failed to benefits others in the industry. Many interviewees notably highlighted the lack of a public platform which allowed pooling of R&D resources and findings. The second issue concerned the nature of interactions between firms and research institutions. Several interviewees noted that research institutions played a small role in the technology development process relative to that of firms' own efforts. In addition, many interviews underscored that the bulk of work undertaken by research institutions focused on assisting firms with their immediate technology needs. Taken together, these two issues highlighted that both government R&D funding and research institutions served to enhance existing R&D efforts by firms rather than be complementary to them. In particular, there was a clear lack of emphasis on efforts targeting common industry wide R&D themes adopting a longer-term technology outlook than that of firms, and which were less firm-centric by encouraging more collaboration among research institutions."}, {"section_title": "Guidance of search function", "text": "Arguably the most important factor guiding wind turbine technology development efforts in Similarly, the government's emphasis on grid integration and the quality of power generated by wind farms led to the development and adoption of grid friendly technologies. The second feature which provided guidance to the technology development process was the coherence and consistency of long-term government policy planning. While specific regulations, such as those mentioned above, had direct effects on firms, the combination of planning documents such as five-year plans, and overarching laws such as the Renewable Energy Law, provided strong signals to the industry about the long-term direction of government policy. All interviewees notably spoke with great confidence about the continued long-term growth of the industry noting that wind power was a sector the government wanted to develop. A CWEA interviewee highlighted that there was strong consensus in the industry about the commercial viability of designing larger machines given the strength of the regulatory environment. Finally, a third feature of the Chinese system which helped guide technology development efforts was the formulation of MOST R&D funding priorities before each five-year plan. The process brought together a large group of experts from industry, research institutions, and government, which was tasked to identify the most pressing issues faced by the industry and list the research priorities for the next five years. Several interviewees noted that the resulting R&D project guidelines played a particularly important role in the early stages of the industry, when R&D funding was scarce. However, with the rapid growth of the wind power market, government R&D funding became relatively small compared to R&D investments made by firms. Some interviewees therefore doubted whether the process sill provided much guidance."}, {"section_title": "Countering resistance to change function", "text": "As highlighted by an interviewee from CWEA, the nature of interactions between government and industry in China was such that, generally, firms did not express their potential opposition to a given policy course and tended to follow government guidance. Nevertheless, a CREIA interviewee underscored that large firms in China, such as the power generation firms or the state grid companies, had a strong influence on the decision making process. The State Council, the highest level of policy making, was therefore exposed to different opinions concerning wind power and other renewable energy sources, including strong objections. All interviewees agreed that there was in fact very little resistance to wind power from actors involved with coal power generation -the main incumbent power generation technology in China. Two main reasons were put forth. First, several interviewees underscored that the rate of growth of energy demand in China was such that the contribution of all energy sources was needed. As noted by CASTED and CWEEA interviewees, this had been clearly recognized by the government who's goal of non-fossil fuel energy meeting 15% of the country's energy demand by 2020 overshadowed possible resistance to wind power. In addition, the ERI and CREIA interviewees noted that energy demand was growing at such a rate that the growth of traditional power sources was still very large. Second, as explained by interviewees from CWEA, CWEEA, ERI, and NEA, the limited resistance to wind power was also due to the fact that coal plans and wind farms were owned by the same large power generation companies. The NEA interviewee notably underscored that wind power assets represented an increasingly important part of their profits. Several interviewees identified grid companies as having been the only significant source of resistance to wind power development in China. A CWEA interviewee explained that the emergence of wind power had challenged the way grid management had traditionally been conducted in China. NEA and ERI interviewees both stressed that Grid companies were concerned that wind variability may lead to excessive power supply fluctuations which they were ill equipped to manage. However, the NEA interviewee was confident that measures implemented to address the issue, discussed previously, would ease these concerns and allow the sound development of the industry to continue. ERI and CWEEA interviewees stressed that ultimately grid companies had to comply with the government's direction."}, {"section_title": "Other system functions", "text": "The two remaining functions, 'entrepreneurial activity' and 'resource mobilization', were not discussed at length by any interviewee. These are therefore only mentioned in brief below."}, {"section_title": "-Chapter 4 -", "text": "If the hypotheses of both parts of the analysis prove correct we can conclude that, in all likelihood, the relatively slow evolution of the wind power technology frontier is due to the limited government support. The importance of the three countries considered in the first part of the analysis is reflected in the composition of the wind turbine manufacturing industry: Denmark is home to Vestas and Siemens, 133 which in 2010 were respectively the first and ninth largest manufacturers globally and together accounted for 20.7% of global capacity installed that year; Germany is home to Enercon, which in 2010 was the fifth largest turbine manufacturer, accounting for 7.2% of the global market; and finally the United States is home to General Electric, which in 2010 was the third largest manufacturer of wind turbines and accounted for 9.6% of global installed capacity that year. The United States and Germany were also respectively the second and third largest markets in the world in terms of cumulative installed capacity (BTM, 2011). In addition, while a much smaller country, Denmark has the largest share of electricity consumption coming from wind power. The focus of this chapter is on wind power technology development since the 1970s. However, to give some context to this analysis, I first highlight some of the earlier efforts to use wind energy for electricity generation."}, {"section_title": "Precursors to the modern wind turbine", "text": "Until the industrial revolution, large tower wind mills, used for various mechanical tasks such as grinding grain and pumping water, were ubiquitous throughout Europe. Similarly, during the 19th century, small stand-alone windmills used for pumping water were a common feature on United States farmlands. From a purely technological perspective, aside from a shift to electricity generation, there is no clear discontinuity between these antiquated wind-based technologies and the recent efforts discussed in this research. Instead, what distinguishes the modern period is the role of government, which, following the global oil shocks of the 1970s, was instrumental in supporting a technology which in all likelihood would otherwise have been limited to niche applications. Before turning to a detailed discussion of such policies, it is therefore first useful to provide further technological context. I discuss here some of the early efforts to develop wind turbines for electricity generation, prior to the 1970s. One of the first efforts to use wind energy for electricity generation was a horizontal axis wind turbine built in 1888 on the property of a wealthy industrialist named Charles Brush in Cleveland, Ohio. The wind turbine was a wooden structure consisting of an 18 m high tower and a rotor 17 m in diameter made of 144 blades. The turbine had a 12kW capacity and was used to power the many incandescent lights in his house (Lynn, 2012;Shepherd, 1990). Though the turbine operated successfully for 20 years, the advent of electrification of cities across the United States and the expansion of centralized power generation led to its eventual abandonment (Righter, 2011). Around the same time in Denmark, Poul La Cour, with funding from the Danish government, developed several experimental wind turbines which drew on many of the features of the old tower wind mills and incorporated rudimentary airfoil structures. As a result of these efforts, by 1918 some 120 Danish rural power stations used wind turbines rated 20-35kW in capacity. However, the rapid spread of fossil fuel-based power generation following the end of World War I quickly made these wind turbines obsolete (Shepherd, 1990;Andersen, 2007). By the early 20 th century, rural areas that were not connected to the power grid presented one of the last settings where wind power generation had a potential economic advantage over fossil fuel alternatives. This period was characterized by several efforts to develop small scale wind turbines for electricity generation in remote locations. In the United States, an important contribution was that of Marcellus Jacobs and his brother. Following the First World War, they developed on their parent's ranch in Montana a turbine with a three-blade rotor aimed to generate enough electricity to charge small batteries used for lighting and powering radios. Originally based on a modified airplane propeller to drive generators, these machines were progressively refined to improve efficiency and in the early 1930s the Jacobs Wind Electric Company was created. Aside from their small size (turbines were typically around 2-3kW in capacity), the Jacobs turbine had some of the basic features of the turbines which would come to dominate the industry several decades later. 134 Though renowned for reliability, the Jacobs' enterprise became obsolete along with other small wind turbines manufacturers as rural electrification efforts in the United States intensified, and by the mid 1950s all had disappeared (Righter 2011;Manwell, McGowan, and Rogers, 2009). 135 The first effort to develop a large scale, grid-connected wind turbine was an experimental two blade turbine with a 30 m diameter rotor and rated capacity of 100kW, installed in 1931 on the coast of the Black Sea in the former USSR (Sectorov, 1934). The experiment ran successfully for several years but led to no subsequent development efforts. In the United States, the most notable effort was the construction in 1941 of a two blade turbine with a 53 m diameter rotor and rated capacity of 1.25MW. 136 This was the largest wind turbine ever built and remained so for almost 40 years. The turbine was installed in Vermont and connected to the local grid. It ran successfully for 16 months before several technical failures led the project to be abandoned in 1945 (Righter, 2011). Following the Second World War, several other prototypes of grid connected wind turbines ranging in capacity from 100kW to 1000kW were built in England, France, Germany, and Denmark (Nelson, 2009;NASA, 1981). In the case of Denmark, efforts to manufacture relatively small machines (ranging from 30 to 70kW in capacity) resumed prior to and during World War II. The most notable development led to the erection in 1957 of an experimental 200kW three blade turbine at Gedser, on the southern coast of Denmark. Though the machine did not immediately lead to commercial ventures, the turbine operated successfully for eight years (Lynn, 2012;Andersen, 2007, Neslon, 2009."}, {"section_title": "THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT POLICY IN WIND POWER TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT: THE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CASE OF DENMARK, GERMANY, AND THE UNITED STATES", "text": "This section aims to determine the role of government policy in technology development at the wind power technology frontier. I focus on two primary means of government support to wind The emphasis here is therefore solely on the role of government policies. In practice, however, many other factors may affect both wind power deployment and wind power patenting rates. For example, changes in fossil fuel prices affect the cost differential of power generation using wind power relative to incumbent fossil fuel based technologies and may therefore affect the rate of wind power deployment as well as the incentives to invest in technology development as reflected by patent data. A more complete assessment would therefore require accounting for a broader set of factors in each country. However, the objective here is to highlight the central of role of government support policies given the externality nature of climate change described in Chapter 1. The approach outlined above therefore allows for a sound preliminary assessment."}, {"section_title": "Wind power deployment policies", "text": "Governments wishing to encourage the deployment of wind power can implement a variety of policies. Usually a core set of quantity or price policies drive most of the technology deployment. A quantity policy sets quantity targets, typically in terms of installed capacity or power generated, which must be met by a specific group of actors (usually power companies). In contrast, price policies, whether in the form of taxes or subsidies, directly affect the revenues linked to specific technologies, thereby altering the investment incentive structure. In this section, I describe the evolution of the main quantity and price policies supporting wind power deployment in each of the three countries considered, and assess the effects of changes in these support policies on the evolution of wind power deployment. In case of weak correlation with market trends, I provide further information about secondary policies and other contextual information which may explain the trends observed. In each case I start by outlining some of the specific goals affecting wind power which have been issued by the government through national energy plans and other framework documents. 137"}, {"section_title": "Denmark", "text": "As of the mid-1970s, the Danish government began issuing long-term energy plans to guide the country's policy making. The emphasis at first was on reducing the country's dependence on oil imports, which in the mid-1970s, accounted for almost all of national consumption. The first plan, formulated in 1981, set a target equivalent to installing 1,000MW of wind power capacity by 1995. By the time of the next energy plan, issued in 1990, the emphasis had shifted towards addressing the environmental challenges associated with conventional energy production and use. The plan outlined a goal of reaching a total of 1,500MW of installed wind power capacity and meeting 10% of the country's electricity consumption by 2005 (Sawin, 2001). A 1996 plan placed strong emphasis on the need to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions and set a target of reaching 5,500MW of total installed wind power capacity by 2030, of which 4,000MW were to be installed offshore (IEA, 2001). In 2011, the Danish government released a new energy policy which aims for the country's energy and transport system to be entirely based on renewable energy by 2050. The plan sets a strategic milestone for wind power to account for 50% of electricity consumption by 2020 (IEA, 2012a). in 1981 of 1,000MW to be installed by 1995 was not met. In contrast, the next target, issued in 1990, was easily met. Installed capacity in 2005 was over 3,000MW, twice the target value, and wind power represented over 18% of total electricity demand compared to the 10% target. Though it is too early to tell, it seems that achieving the 1996 target of 5,500MW in total wind power capacity by 2030, including 4,000MW to be installed offshore, is well within reach. With close to 4,000MW in total installed capacity in 2011, of which 870MW was offshore, approximately 73% and 22% of the overall and offshore targets had already been met. One of the first government measures to support the deployment of wind power was a capital grant program introduced in 1979, equivalent to 30% of the investments costs incurred by individuals to install small wind turbines on their properties. This subsidy gradually decreased to 10% of investment costs by 1989 before being phased out by the end of that year (Sawin, 2001). At the time, cooperatives and individuals wishing to erect small wind turbines on their properties had to negotiate with power companies to connect their turbines to the electricity grid and be paid reasonable rates on the sale of the electricity generated. Utility companies also agreed to pay a third of grid connection costs. However these negotiated agreements were established on a case by case basis and in practice led to slow developments and often difficult implementation (Bolinger, 2001;Sawin, 2001).  Denmark, 1980Denmark, -2010 Note: Compiled from ENS (2011), IEA (2012b), and EIA 2012In 1992 the government passed a regulation introducing a feed-in tariff for wind power as well as a power purchase obligation for utility companies. The tariff for cooperatives and individual owners of single turbines less than 150kW in capacity was set at 85% of the average utility cost of production and distribution. 138 From the mid 1990s cooperatives and individual owners of turbines also benefited from two additional subsidies. The first was a reimbursement of the newly instituted 0.10 DKK/kWh CO 2 tax as well as a direct subsidy of 0.17 DKK/kWh from the proceeds of the electricity tax. The total feed-in tariff paid to cooperatives and private owners of wind turbines was therefore approximately 0.60 DKK/kWh of electricity generated (IEA, 2001;Krohn, 1998;and ENS, 1999). The turbine size limit was increased in the mid 1990s to 250kW before being abandoned (Sawin, 2001). In addition, restrictions on the eligibility for participation 138 The resulting tariff varied depending on location but was between 0.37 and 0.45 DKK/kWh in 1998 (IEA, 2001)  '80 '82 '84 '86 '88 '90 '92 '94 '96 '98 '00 '02 '04 '06 '08 '10 MW Total wind power capacity, MW wind power as share of total electricity consumption % in cooperatives, particularly concerning geographic proximity to the turbines owned and the extent of financial involvement, were progressively removed over the years (Bolinger, 2001). To further stimulate private wind power installation the government also offered favorable tax schemes on wind turbine investments. However, these were removed by the late 1990s, after which income from wind power generation was taxed as any other income (IEA, 2001). By 1998 close to 84% of the Danish wind power market was privately owned by cooperatives or individuals (ENS, 1999). This may in part be explained by the fact that Danish utility companies believed nuclear power would play a central role in meeting the country's new environmental objectives. However, in 1985 the Danish Parliament decided that nuclear power would no longer be considered as a power generation alternative for the country (Sewin, 2001). The same year the government negotiated an agreement with power utility companies to install 100MW of wind power capacity over the coming five years. A second agreement to install another 100MW of wind power capacity was signed in 1990 while a third was signed in 1996 to install an additional 200MW by 2000 (ENS, 1999). Pursuant to these agreements, utility companies received the same feed-in tariff for wind power generation as cooperatives and individuals (Krohn, 1998). 139 Utility companies also completed two 5MW offshore demonstration projects in 1991 and 1995. The success of these projects led to an agreement signed with the government in 1997 to develop 750MW of offshore wind power by 2008 (ENS, 1999;Sewin, 2001). In 1999, broad electricity sector reforms were launched and subsidies for wind power were adjusted in the process. For turbines installed prior to 2000, once an assigned number of full load hours were met, the feed-in-tariff was reduced from a total of 0.60 DKK/kWh to 0.43 DKK/kWh. 140 For turbines installed from 2000 onwards, the tariff was reduced to a fixed value of 0.43 DKK/kWh for the first 22,000 full load hours (approximately equivalent to 10 years of operation), after which turbines receive the electricity market price plus a 0.10 DKK/kWh premium until the end of their 20 year life (IEA, 2001). The government also introduced a subsidy of 0.17 DKK/kWh in addition to the 0.43 DKK/kWh tariff for turbines installed in conjunction to the decommissioning of old turbines less than 150 kW in capacity. For offshore wind farms, the government introduced a feed-in tariff of 0.453 DKK/kWh for the first 42,000 full load hours, after which the same 0.10 DKK/kWh premium on top of market rates was offered until the end of the turbine's 20 year life (IEA, 2004). 141 In 2002, following a compromise reached among various political factions, the government introduced further reforms that lowered the subsidies for onshore wind power. For turbines installed prior to 2000, from 2003 the 0.43 DKK/kWh tariff was only offered until the turbine reached 10 years of operation. Subsequently and until they reach 20 years of operation turbines received the market price for electricity plus 0.10 DKK/kWh . Similarly, for turbines installed between 2000 and 2002, the government introduced a cap of 0.36 DKK/kWh for the 140 Full load hours are the hours when a turbine generates electricity at its rated capacity. 141 Private investors were involved in two early offshore projects in 2000 (50MW) and 2003 (17MW), yet subsequent projects were larger and solely owned by the country's power companies. The offshore feed in-tariff mentioned above targeted utility owned projects . market price plus premium offered once turbines had reached their initial full-load hours allocation. For turbines installed from 2003 the only government subsidy offered was the market price plus 0.10 DKK/kWh with a total cap of 0.36 DKK/kWh . When turbines were installed in the scope of the decommissioning of old turbines less than 150 kW in capacity an additional 0.17 DKK/kWh was offered for the first 12,000 full load hours on top of the electricity price plus 0.10 DKK/kWh with a total cap of 0.60 DKK/kWh . In 2004, a broad political agreement was reached among political factions concerning the continued support for wind power. For turbines installed onshore from 2005, the feed-in tariff continued to consist of the electricity market price plus the 0.10 DKK/kWh subsidy received throughout the 20 year life of the turbines. For turbines installed in the scope of the replacement of old turbines under 450kW in capacity, a further 0.12 DKK/kWh for the first 12,000 full load hours was offered with a total cap of 0.48 DKK/kWh (IEA, 2004). 142 Concerning offshore developments, the 2004 agreement required construction of two large wind farms, each with a capacity of 200MW for which the subsidy was to be determined by a tender process . The first 200MW offshore project at Horns Rev II was awarded in 2005 at a feed-in price of 0.518 DKK/kWh for the first 50,000 hours . The second 200MW offshore project at Roedsand II was attributed in 2008 at a feed-in price of 0.629 DKK/kWh . A new 2008 policy raised the premium for new onshore wind turbines to 0.25 DKK/kWh above the market price for 22,000 full load hours. Turbines installed in the scope of the decommissioning of old turbines were given an extra 0.08 DKK/kWh subsidy for the first 12,000 full load hours. The 2008 policy also called for a tender for two additional 200MW offshore wind farms to come into operation by 2012 . The project located at Anholt was finally awarded in 2010 as one 400MW project at a feed in tariff of 1.05 DKK/kWh for the first 20 TWh (IEA, 2010). When looking at the evolution of incremental installed capacity in the country (figure 4.2), various periods of market growth and contraction can be identified. The first period of growth, though limited compared to later ones, took place in the second half of the 1980s. Sarwin 2001links this to the fact that the government investment credit was declining and would soon be phased out and people therefore took advantage of this while they still could. The period of contraction which followed can be linked to the relative policy vacuum in the first years of the 1990s. Sarwin (2001) also notes that complications related to the granting of turbine siting permits were not resolved by the government until 1994, which may also explain the low growth of the early 1990s.  This later point may also explain why the second growth period, which took place from 1994 to 1997 did not start earlier. Indeed, by far the main driver of this second and more significant growth period was the introduction starting in 1992 of a guaranteed minimum feed-in-tariff for wind power, also shown in figure 4.2, and the mandatory grid connection and purchase of power generated. The spike in wind turbine installation in 2000, which surpassed 600MW, or twice the previous highest level, suggests a rush to secure funding before electricity sector reforms launched in 1999 lowered the feed-in tariffs (Sawin, 2001). energy plan, for example, support to renewable energy was limited to R&D funding (Sawin, 2001). Since the reunification of the country, energy plans started placing more emphasis on environmental concerns. A 1990 energy policy document stated that renewable energy would play a significant role in the country's future energy supply (Sawin, 2001). While the federal government did not identify specific targets for wind power development, the state government of Lower Saxony, a region known to have particularly good wind resources due to its coastal location, set a goal of installing 1,000MW of capacity by 2000, later increased to 1,700MW by 2005. Schleswig-Holstein, another coastal state, followed suit by establishing a goal to install 1,200MW by 2010 (IEA, 2001;Sawin, 2001). In 1995, the government adopted a national target to reduce CO 2 emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by 2005. An energy plan released in 2001 strongly emphasized the need to ensure the sustainability of the country's energy system and give equal importance to supply security, economic efficiency, and environmental protection. It included a target of generating 12.5% of the country's electricity from renewable energy, including large hydro energy projects, by 2010 (IEA, 2002b). In 2002, the government introduced longer-term goals whereby renewable energy would account for 20% of electricity generation by 2020 and over 50% by 2050. The same year a parliamentary decision was reached to phase out nuclear power by 2025, at the latest (IEA, 2002b). Though the government's renewable energy goals had not provided specified targets for wind power, this decision clearly indicated that wind power would play a prominent role in the country's electricity mix. The federal government announced plans to erect 500MW of offshore wind power by 2006, 3,000MW by 2010, as well as a long-term target of 25,000MW by 2030 2002a). The target set in 2002 was increased in 2008 to 30% of electricity production by 2020 . In 2010 the government formulated long-term targets for the share of renewables in electricity production to represent 50% by 2030, 65% by 2040 and 80% by 2050 (IEA, 2010). Though the government has refrained from identifying specific goals for wind power other than for offshore wind, it is nevertheless instructive to look at the overall evolution of wind power cumulative capacity and the share of overall electricity consumption it represents (figure 4.3). In 2011, installed capacity surpassed 29GW and wind power accounted for 6.2% of total net power generation in the country. As early as 2007, Germany had exceeded its target of generating 12.5% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010, with wind accounting for 6.4% of total net power generation that year (BMU, 2008a). However, the government's offshore targets have fallen short with the first offshore-wind project only erected in 2009. In terms of state level targets, Sarwin (2001) notes that the Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein targets were exceeded.  Germany, 1980Germany, -2010 Note: Compiled based on IEA (2001;2002a;2002b;2006a;2006b; and EIA (2012). The first notable government policy in support of wind power deployment was the 100MW Demonstration Program, which started in 1989. The policy's primary objective, discussed in more details below, was to encourage technology development by providing support for the demonstration of new turbines. However it also played an important role in supporting technology deployment. For turbines selected under the program a choice was offered between receiving up to 60% of investment costs (with a cap on the total possible amount received), or a production subsidy for a 10 year period of 0.08 DM/kWh above the price wind turbines received from utility companies for power fed into the grid (Langniss, 2006).  '80 '82 '84 '86 '88 '90 '92 '94 '96 '98 '00 '02 '04 '06 '08 '10 MW Total wind power capacity, MW Wind power as share of total net power generation, % In 1991, the government passed the Electricity Feed-in Law (EFL), under which utility companies were required to purchase electricity generated by wind turbines at 90% of the average electricity retail price two years prior. The resulting feed-in tariff oscillated between 0.1661 and 0.1728 DM/kWh from 1991 and 1999 (Bolinger, 2001). Under the EFL, grid connection costs were paid for by project investors while grid reinforcement costs were shared with utility companies. 143 In 1991, the government expanded the 100MW program to 250MW, though in light of the EFL the additional subsidy offered to turbines installed in the scope of the program was lowered to 0.06 DM/kWh (Sawin, 2001). Smaller measures were also introduced during the 1990s to further encourage wind power deployment, including low interest loans for wind power investments as well as favorable tax treatment linked to the depreciation of wind power assets (Bolinger, 2001;Sawin, 2001;IEA, 2001). During the early 1990s, a number of states also offered generous investment subsidies to wind power developers (Sawin, 2001). The EFL and other incentives led to a rapid growth in wind power developments. However, most efforts were concentrated in the northern coastal regions of the country as these regions had the best wind resources. This placed a disproportionately large cost burden on the Northern utility companies and their consumer base, and contributed to generate opposition to the EFL. In response, an amendment to the EFL was introduced in 1998 which placed a cap of 5% of the total electricity which can be generated from wind turbines in any given region. In 2000, however, the government adopted the Renewable Energy Act (EEG), which aimed to expand and improve support policies for renewable energy sources as well as ensure that they complied with European Union directives concerning the liberalization of the electricity market. The EEG abolished the 5% electricity generation cap introduced in 1998 and addressed the costs issues by mandating that the additional costs incurred from wind power development would shared among all electricity users in the country (Bolinger, 2001). The main feature of the EEG was to no longer link the feed-in tariff to the electricity retail price and offer instead a fixed feed-in tariff based on the real costs of production, guaranteed for 20 years. To encourage technological progress, the EEG also planned to lower the feed-in tariff offered to new projects by 1.5% per year starting in 2002. The feed-in tariff was raised relative to the EFL to 0.178 DM/kWh for the first five years of the 20-year period. At the end of this period, plants generating at least 150% of a reference yield (based on a reference turbine size in specific wind conditions) received a basic feed-in tariff of 0.121 DM/kWh until the end of the 20-year period. For plants that did not achieve the 150% reference yield, the EEG introduced a formula to extend the higher rate period, after which they received the basic rate until the turbine operated for 20 years. 144 This approach was introduced to encourage the development of wind power projects in regions with less favorable wind conditions. In the case of offshore wind farms the EEG offered the same 0.178 DM/kWh tariff for the first nine years of a 20-year period for projects installed before the end of 2006 (Bolinger, 2001;IEA, 2001). 145 Under the EEG, the costs of grid extension or reinforcement were borne entirely by the grid operator who could pass these through to end costumers via a surcharge on electricity prices (Sawin, 2001). The Renewable Energy Act was revised in 2004. The amended EEG reinforced the requirement for grid operators to connect renewable energy projects to the grid and give priority to the electricity they generated. The amended EEG also accelerated the yearly feed-in tariff reduction for new plants from 1.5% to 2% a year, adopted a broader variety of reference yields based on different locations, and no longer provided support for projects where less than 60% of the reference yield was expected at the end of the five year period. To encourage decommissioning of old turbines, the amended EEG extended the initial high tariff period when a turbine with a over three times the capacity of the turbine it replaced was installed (BMU, 2007a). 146 From 2004, the initial high tariff for onshore plants was set at 0.087 euro/kWh, in conformity with the trends set by the 2000 EEG. The basic value was reduced slightly to 0.055 euro/kWh. For offshore wind power, the amended EEG raised the initial high tariff to 0.091 euro/kWh and extended the period during which projects received this to 12 years, after which the basic tariff was set to 0.062 euro/kWh for the remaining eight years. The 2% decline in tariffs was also scheduled to only start in 2008 for offshore projects (BMU, 2007a;. By 2006, no offshore wind power projects had been built due to various bottlenecks in the permit granting process and grid access concerns. The government therefore introduced the Infrastructure Acceleration Act which forced transmission system operators to pay for and build the grid connections from offshore project sites to the onshore grid (IEA, 2006a). In 2008 a new amendment to the Renewable Energy Act was adopted to compensate for the rise in steel and other raw material prices and to provide further support to the lagging offshore wind power market. For onshore projects, the higher tariff was increased starting in 2009 to 0.092 euro/kWh while the basic tariff was increased to 0.0502 euro/kWh. The yearly reduction in tariff was lowered from 2% to 1% starting from 2010. The amendment also offered an extra payment of 0.005 euro/kWh for projects linked to the decommissioning of old turbines and for turbines meeting specific technical standards for grid integration. For offshore turbines in operation before the end of 2015, the initial tariff was set at 0.15 euro/kWh for the first 12 years of operation. The subsequent basic tariff was set at 0.035 euro/kWh for the following eight years. For turbines installed after 2015, the initial tariff was set at 0.13 euro/kWh. A 5% annual reduction in the initial tariff was set for turbines installed as of 2015 . To facilitate the development of offshore wind projects, particularly in light of increasing difficulties to secure debt capital due to the financial crisis, the government launched in 2010 a EURO5 billion credit program through a government-owned bank to ensure readily available funds at market rates for the construction of 10 of the first wind farm projects in the planning pipeline (BMU and BMWI, 2010;IEA, 2011). In 2012, a new amendment to the EEG was enacted. While the basic tariff structure for onshore wind and the added subsidy for repowering plants and meeting technical standards for grid integration remained unchanged, the annual tariff reduction rate increased from 1% to 1.5% for new projects. For offshore projects, the initial 0.15 euro/kWh was extended for projects installed until 2018. However the annual reduction in tariffs increased from 5% to 7%. The amendment also offered the possibility for offshore projects to receive 0.19 euro/kWh for eight years rather than 0.15 euro/kWh for 12 years before dropping to 0.035 euro/kWh (IEA, 2011). The effect of changes in government subsidies on the evolution of the wind power market in Germany can be identified in figure 4.4. The first growth period, from 1992 to 1995, which saw annual installed capacity rise from about 70MW to a little below 500MW, is likely a consequence of the introduction of the first feed-in law in 1991. The removal of state level investment grants may have contributed to the relative stagnation observed in , however, Sawin (2001 notes that the more likely cause was a challenge in court in 1994 to the legality of wind turbine siting laws. This created significant uncertainty until a new law was passed in 1997, streamlining the planning and approval process. The sharp increase which took place between 1998 and 1999, surpassing 1,500MW installed per year, likely resulted from a combination of the enactment of the new siting law and a rush to install new plants in light of growing opposition to the feed-in-law, which eventually led to its amendment in 1998. Similarly, the stagnation of 2000 is likely a consequence of the capacity cap introduced in the amendment of 1998. The boom of 2001 and 2002, when installed capacity reached 3,250MW per year, the highest level in the thirty year time frame, can be attributed to the higher tariffs offered by the Renewable Energy Act of 2000.   Germany, 1980Germany, -2010 Note: Capacity data compiled from IEA (2001;2002a;2002b;2006a;2006b;. For purposes of clarity all onshore feed-in tariffs expressed in euros (conversion rate of 1.96 Deutschmarks to the euro). Tariffs shown are those which were given during the initial period for projects built in the year indicated. From 1991 to 1999 the average feed-in tariff value is used. Additional subsidies for turbine retrofitting are not included. The peak in annual installation of 2002 was followed by an overall decline in incremental wind power installations. The reduction in annual installations was most significant between 2002 and 2004, when annual installations totaled a little over 1900MW. As shown in figure 4.4, the overall trend between 2002 and 2008 matches the progressive drop in feed-in tariffs. However, as highlighted by Fischedick (2004), the slowdown was most likely due to a combination of factors, including the gradual exhaustion of available high wind resource locations, growing resistance to wind power expansion among various groups of stakeholders, and uncertainties with respect to grid connection and cost sharing obligations. The latter was notably at the heart of the 2004 amendment to the renewable energy law, which aimed to reinforce grid connection obligations and further detail balancing cost sharing rules (WPM, 2004) \nOne of the first R&D efforts by the Danish government was to refurbish between 1977 and 1979 the Gedser turbine, first installed in 1957, to use it as an experimental test site (Sawin, 2001). The government also worked with Danish utility companies to design, construct, and test two 630kW three-blade horizontal axis wind turbines, one based on blade pitching and the other using stall control. Over the years, other demonstration turbines were installed to help utility companies gain experience. Five 750kW turbines were installed in the early 1980s and two turbines of 1MW and 2MW in capacity were installed in the early 1990s (Sawin, 2001;Krohn, 1998). Since the late 1980s, government funded R&D projects have typically involved several participants among utility companies, turbine manufacturers, and research centers. The government also encouraged industry co-financing. During the 1990s, the government typically financed between 50% and 85% of total project costs. A network of experts from industry, academia, and government research centers in collaboration with the Danish Energy Agency oversaw R&D planning and project allocations (ENS, 1999;IEA, 2001).By the end of the 1990s, Danish wind turbine manufacturers increasingly funded their own technology R&D efforts. A government strategy for wind power R&D issued in 2000 therefore called for the government to place greater emphasis on long-term technology R&D (Sawin, 2001;IEA, 2001). The granting turbine certification to ensure that specific safety and reliability standards were met (Sawin, 2001;Krohn, 1998). By the early 2000s Ris\u00f8 managed the center, working with certification firms such as Det Norske Veritas (DNV) or Germanischer Lloyd (GL), and coordinated the elaboration of verification methodologies with international standardization bodies such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) . The Ris\u00f8 Laboratory has also been heavily involved in government funded research. In 2002, Ris\u00f8 formed a consortium with leading wind power research institutions in Denmark to increase collaboration and address some of the key challenges faced by the industry . Most prominent among these organizations were the Ris\u00f8 National Laboratory and the Danish Technical University (DTU), which merged in 2007 to become DTU-Ris\u00f8 (IEA, 2009 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 Million USD (2005 prices and exchange rates) Figure 4.7: Government wind power R&D funding, Denmark, 1976R&D funding, Denmark, -2010 Note: Compiled from Sawin (2001) and data sent to the author by the Danish Energy Agency.

However, it was not until 1979 and the second oil shock that the government announced targets of renewable energy production, including a goal to produce 500TWh of wind power per year by 2000. Furthermore, the Wind Energy Systems Act of 1980 set a target to install 800MW in capacity by the end of 1988. However, these goals were abandoned by the subsequent administration, which placed much of its energy policy emphasis on enhancing domestic fossil fuel production (Sawin, 2001). In 1997, the government formulated a target under the Federal Wind Energy Program that aimed to achieve a cumulative wind power capacity of 6,700MW by 2000 (Sawin, 2001). The Department of Energy's Wind Powering America initiative introduced in 1999 contained goals for at least 5% of national electricity generation coming from wind power by 2020, and for total installed capacity to reach 5,000MW by 2005, 10,000MW by 2010, and 80,000MW by 2020 (Sawin, 2001;IEA, 2001).    '80 '82 '84 '86 '88 '90 '92 '94 '96 '98 '00 '02 '04 '06 '08 '10 MW Total wind power capacity, MW Wind power as share of total net power generation, % 15% from 1980 and extended its availability to the end of 1985. These tax credits were however not extended beyond 1985 (Sawin, 2001). The National Energy Act of 1978 introduced the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) which aimed to created competition by requiring utility companies to purchase electricity from 'qualifying facilities', defined as either cogeneration facilities or small renewable energy plants no greater than 80MW in capacity. However, the legality of PURPA was challenged in court by utility companies and the Act did not come into force until 1981 (Gielecki, Mayes, and Pete, 2000). PURPA required utility companies to connect qualifying facilities to the grid, provide ancillary services, and purchase excess electricity generated based on the notion of 'avoided costs' (Sawin, 2001;Gielecki, Mayes, and Pete, 2000). 147,148 In 1990, PURPA was temporarily amended to remove the 80MW size limitations on power generation facilities registered before the end of 1994 and for which construction started prior to 2000 (Sawin, 2001;Gielecki et al., 2000). The government introduced several minor tax incentives in favor of wind power during the 1980s (Sawin, 2001;Gielecki, Mayes, and Pete, 2000). However, by far the most important wind power deployment support policy was an inflation adjusted production tax credit (PTC) introduced by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The PTC was initially set at 0.015 USD/kWh for qualified wind power projects installed between 1994 and 1999 and selling power generated to to 147 'Avoided costs' refer to the costs the utility companies would have to pay for the same amount of electricity (Sawin, 2001). 148 In 1980 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) made connection to the grid mandatory as well as the need for utilities to purchase all electricity produced by small renewable energy plants, irrespective of the utilities' needs. utility companies. The PTC could be claimed for power produced during the first ten years of a plant's operation. The government also introduced a Renewable Energy Production Incentive (REPI) at the same rate as the PTC for wind power plants in operation before the end of 2001 and owned by municipal utility companies or non-profit cooperatives that did not pay taxes to the government (Gielecki, Mayes, and Pete, 2000;Sawin, 2001;IEA, 2001). The PTC expired in June 1999 but was extended retroactively at the end of 1999 to include plants in operation by the end of 2001. From 1999 the tax credit was raised to 0.017 USD/kWh (Sawin, 2001). The PTC expired again at the end of 2001 but was once more extended retroactively in March 2002 through the end of 2003 at a rate of 0.018 USD/kWh. Similarly the REPI was extended for plants in operation by the end of 2003 at a rate of 0.018 USD/kWh . The PTC was again extended in October 2004 for wind power plants installed before the end of 2007 at a rate of 0.019 USD/kWh. The REPI was also extended over the same time frame (IEA, 2006b). In December 2006, the government extended the PTC through 2008 at a rate of 0.020 USD/kWh .The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 renewed the PTC for wind energy for one year, until the end of 2009, at a rate of 0.021 USD/kWh. However, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 further extended the PCT until the end of 2012. The latter also introduced an Investment Tax Credit (ITC) available until the end of 2012, which wind power plant developers could choose instead of the PTC. The ITC allows 30% of the investment in a wind power plant to be refunded in the form of reduced income taxes or an upfront grant . The Recovery Act also made loan guaranties available for wind projects and provided funding for the construction of new transmission lines (IEA, 2010;. In 2007, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) introduced a new regulation to give greater access to transmission lines for all power generation plants, including wind power. In addition, the new law exempted intermittent power generation plants, such as wind power, from incurring excessive 'imbalance' costs when the amount of electricity delivered differed from the amount scheduled to be delivered . California. 149 The state government introduced some of the earliest and at the time most ambitious policies in support of wind power deployment. At the heart of these were a series of standard power purchase agreements detailing the provisions under which state utility companies were required to purchase power generated by qualifying facilities under PURPA. The first three of these 'standard offers' were short-term contracts that became available in 1982. The fourth and last standard offer was introduced in 1983. This allowed qualifying facilities to sign longterm contracts with utility companies for up to 30 years and receive a guaranteed fixed price during the first 10 years. 150 However, in response to concerns over the oversupply of electricity and high prices to consumers, the state government eventually suspended the fourth standard offer in 1985. While plans to define a final standard offer contract were subsequently devised, the process collapsed in 1995 in light of the complex methodological and procedural issues 149 Between 1983 and 1997 California accounted on average for 97% of incremental wind power capacity installed in the country (based on data from Sawin, 2001). 150 Under the fourth standard offer contract, during the first 10 years qualifying facilities would receive a price for electricity based on the avoided long-term costs for utilities, as stipulated under PURPA. After the initial 10 years they would receive a price based on estimates of avoided short-run costs for utilities. raised. As a result long-term contracts were abandoned and utility companies were no longer required to purchase power from qualifying facilities (Sawin, 2001). The first period of growth in annual incremental wind power installation during the 1980s started almost immediately after the California state government introduced its standard offers. In fact, Sawin (2001) notes that almost all wind power projects in California between 1983 and the mid-1990s were in the scope of fourth standard offer contracts. She also attributes the decline in annual incremental installations between 1985 and 1987 to the expiration of both a federal tax credit at the end of 1985 and a California tax credit at the end of 1986. Finally, she associates the rise in annual installed capacity between 1989 and 1991 to a rush by developers to install projects before the expiration of the fourth standard offer contract (Sawin, 2001).  United States, 1980 Note: Capacity data based on Sawin (2001) and Wiser and Bolinger (2012). Following this early California experience, despite the introduction in 1994 of the PTC at the federal level, limited deployment took place nationally until 1999. The sharp increase in wind power installations in 1999 may be associated to a rush by project developers to secure contracts under PTC terms before its planned expiration in 1999. Similarly, the effects of subsequent short-term extensions and expirations of the PTC are apparent in years with high wind power capacity installed followed by years with much lower capacity installed. It is only following the 2004 extension of the PTC that more stable growth in the market was introduced. Part of the reason is that unlike in previous years, the PTC was not allowed to expire before being extended, thereby providing better financial stability to project developers. Installation peaked in 2009 to the historical level of 10 GW per year, which was likely due to a rush by developers to get projects approved before the planned expiration of the one year PTC extension introduced in 2008. The longer-term support offered by the government from 2009 has generated a more stable market in 2010 and 2011, represented by approximately 6,000 MW per year in new installations."}, {"section_title": "Research and development (R&D) support", "text": "Incentives for firms to invest in wind power technology R&D evolve as markets are created Government support of R&D therefore plays an important role in spurring wind power technology development, particularly in the early stages of the market.

When installed in 1982, it was the largest wind turbine ever built and the first large-scale turbine to adopt variable speed operation. The turbine ran several hundred hours before being abandoned due to blade failures. Government funding was given directly to the aerospace manufacturers involved in the project and covered all costs incurred. When government funding ended, these firms did not so pursue the wind turbine technology development efforts (Sawin, 2001;Krohn, 1998).  IEA, 2006b). As noted earlier in this chapter, a power generation subsidy constituted the main incentive for participation in the 100/250MW Demonstration Program (Sawin, 2001;IEA, 2001). By the end of the program in 1995, over 6,000 proposals had been submitted for a total of over 3,500MW in capacity. The program however only approved 1,223 proposals for 1,573 turbines installed and 384.5MW in capacity. 152 The last projects under the 250MW program were megawatt size turbines, installed in 1998 (IEA, 2001). During the 1990s government funded R&D included projects on turbine site selection, wind resource assessments, research on turbine components, materials, and grid integration (Sawin, 2001). Funding was allocated to universities and research centers as well as firms. The government notably encouraged R&D collaborations between firms and research institutions. When projects involved firms, the government only funded a fraction of total costs (IEA, 2002a). Towards the end of the 1990s government funded R&D also contributed to the development and demonstration of a number of large scale turbines by German firms (Sawin, 2001). For example, one project led by Enercon aimed to develop 3 to 4MW turbines and resulted in the installation in 2002 of a first 4.5MW turbine prototype at a test site (IEA, 2001;. Similarly, the government supported another project led by a company called Multibrid and which aimed to develop megawatt scale offshore turbines (IEA, 2001). This resulted in a 5MW Multibrid prototype turbine installed in 2004 at a test site . From 2005 onwards the bulk of government funded R&D projects started targeting offshore applications. Given the high share of offshore costs attributable to turbine foundations and construction, the government supported many projects in these areas. For example, the government provided funding for a project led by a company named Bard to develop a 5MW offshore turbine and its tri-pile foundation. A prototype was installed and testing began in 2008 . Other projects included the creation of an offshore foundation test facility as well as research on new dedicated offshore wind farm construction and logistic vessels (IEA, 2011;BMU, 2007b;. The government also encouraged the creation of research networks, one of which was a multiyear program launched in 2006 focusing on offshore foundations. It brought together steel companies, offshore construction companies, a turbine manufacturer and research institutes to investigate the development of various types of foundations (IEA, 2006a;BMU, 2007b). The government continued to support R&D in other areas, such as grid integration issues and component development. The latter notably included projects on new blade designs and improved blade manufacturing techniques (BMU, 2007b;2008b). From 2005, a strong emphasis was placed on turbine weight reduction and involved several projects on new gear and gearless drive-train concepts for multi-megawatt turbines (IEA, 2006b).The government supported a collaboration between an academic research group and Vensys to develop a compact 2.5MW permanent magnet gearless turbine (IEA, 2007;BMU, 2008b). In 2001, the government started planning for the construction of offshore condition measurement platforms to collect data for wind power development offshore and for the certification of offshore turbines (IEA, 2002). The first platform was erected in the North Sea in 2003 and started monitoring and collecting hydrological, meteorological, and physical data, which were made publicly available to research institutions and firms . A second platform was erected in 2007 while a third was erected in 2009, both with similar data monitoring capabilities as the first    4.8: Government wind power R&D funding, Germany, 1977 Note: Compiled from IEA (2012b). GDP deflator data from World Bank website (retrieved September 2012). Exchange rate data from European Central Bank website (retrieved September 2012). Values exclude production subsidies extended to wind turbines for the 100MW and 250MW programs. It does however include costs associated with data collection and monitoring of these programs. None of the prototypes erected have led to commercial developments (Sawin, 2001). Other government R&D during the 1980s and early 1990s primarily aimed to support technology development efforts by firms. Aside from the prototypes mentioned above, this notably involved turbine components such as blades, which until then had been based on aircraft wing designs. From the second half of the 1990s, the Department of Energy's Wind Energy Program, which has coordinated the bulk of government R&D funding since its establishment in 1973, started placing greater emphasis on applied R&D with the aim to develop more fundamental scientific and technical understanding of wind energy. By 2001, government funding was roughly evenly distributed among 'applied research', 'turbine development', and 'cooperative research and testing'. 154 For each firms' participation was given a prominent role. Typically, firms made technology and commercial decisions while national laboratories provided theoretical and technical support through research and performance testing (IEA, 2002a;2006b).  IEA, 2001;2002a;2006b;.  (IEA, 2001;2002a;2006a;DOE, 2012a Technology Center (NWTC), created in 1994. The center was the first wind turbine blade and system testing facility in the country. Towards the end of the 1990s, the center also started participating in the development of international turbine standards and began offering turbine certification services (Sawin, 2001;IEA, 2002a Cooperative research projects have focused on grid integration issues, removal of institutional barriers to wind power expansion, data collection and sharing from existing wind farms, the elaboration of design codes, or the development of high resolution wind resource mapping (IEA, 2001;2006b;.

Every technology has unique attributes, applications, costs, and relations to other technologies, which makes cross technology comparisons difficult. Nevertheless, certain broad metrics can help gauge the development of one technology relative to that of others. "}, {"section_title": "Technology penetration", "text": "Technology penetration is a measure of the time it has taken a given technology to reach a certain market share and therefore provides some indication of the technology's development success. This is often depicted graphically by plotting the fraction of a given product (e.g. steel) or service (e.g. lighting or mobility) supplied by different technologies in a given geographic region over time. The result is typically a logistic curve (or s-shaped curve). As a technology is first introduced, often in niche applications, the initial technology penetration rate is generally slow. As the technology becomes increasingly established and costs are reduced, this initial phase is followed by a period characterized by higher and more sustained penetration rates. Finally the rate of penetration progressively slows as the technology reaches a plateau, or saturation level. This s-shaped sequence may be followed by a phase of decline, as the technology is substituted by another, superior technology (Gr\u00fcbler, 1990;1991). Gr\u00fcbler, Naki\u0107enovi\u0107, and Victor (1999) highlight important distinctions which need to be taken into account when considering technology penetration. One such distinction is between technology diffusion and technology substitution. The first refers to the penetration of a technology into a new market, often to provide services which were previously not available. The second consists of substituting technologies in an existing market, offering better services or lower prices. Another distinction is between technologies and infrastructures (Gr\u00fcbler, Naki\u0107enovi\u0107, and Victor, 1999;Gr\u00fcbler, 1990 processes, such as literacy or reduction in infant mortality. The analysis focuses on the diffusion time constant (\u2206t), which is the time for a technology (or process) to grow from 10% to 90% market penetration. 157 The mean value of \u2206t for the sample is 41 years with a standard deviation of approximately equal size. Half of the sample has \u2206t of less than 30 years, and about three quarter has \u2206t less than 50 years. Gr\u00fcbler, Naki\u0107enovi\u0107, and Victor (1998) note that diffusion processes appear to progress more slowly than substitution, possibly because the introduction of new services adds to the time it takes for a market to form. Similarly, they underscore that the rate of penetration of new infrastructures is typically longer than most other technologies. Wind power technology reached the highest penetration rate in Denmark, accounting for close to 20% of the country's electricity production by 2010. It took approximately 10 years for the country to go from 10% of power generation to the 20% mark. Much lower levels of penetration have been reached in Germany and the United States, where wind power accounted for respectively approximately 6% and 2% of total electricity production in 2010. It is difficult to compare these values to the historical technology penetration rates documented by Gr\u00fcbler (1991) as he focuses on the time it takes a technology to go from 10% to 90% market penetration levels, which is far greater than what has so far been achieved in the case of wind power. Still, if one assumes that going from 10% to 90% penetration levels is a linear process (i.e. that it corresponds to the middle section of the s-shaped logistic curve and that this can be assumed to be a straight line), then the mean \u2206t value of 41 years documented by Gr\u00fcbler (1991) implies that every 10% increment in new market penetration takes on average approximately 5 years. Similarly, a \u2206t of 50 years, which was higher than for 75% of the sample of technologies assessed by Gr\u00fcbler, implies that each 10% increment in new market penetration takes a little over 6 years. These values imply significantly faster penetration rates than the 10 years it took wind power to go from 10% to 20% market penetration in Denmark. This indicates that even in the best case of market penetration wind power is progressing slowly relative to other technologies. Comparing observed wind power penetration rates to the data presented by Ray (1988) is also difficult as it is unclear what the date of first adoption should be in the case of wind power. As discussed in Section 4.1.3, there have been numerous precursors to the modern wind turbine, ranging back to late 19 th century United States or early 20 th century Denmark. In addition Ray (1988) focuses on the time needed to reach the 10% penetration level, which in the case of the three countries considered has only been achieved by Denmark. Nevertheless, if we assume that the first adoption of wind power in Denmark took place in 1980 when the first turbines were installed in the scope of the deployment support policies discussed earlier in this chapter, then 10% market penetration was achieved in Denmark in approximately 20 years. This is only slightly over the range of penetration rates documented by Ray (1989), indicating that wind power is progressing only marginally slower than the technologies considered. However the time between first adoption and 10% penetration would be significantly longer if an earlier date of first adoption was used. In addition, Denmark is the best case of wind power penetration. Considering wind power penetration in other countries would therefore lead to much slower rates of penetrations."}, {"section_title": "Technology patenting", "text": "As indicated earlier in this chapter, patent applications embody the development of novel  To compare patenting associated with wind power to other industries and technologies I draw on both comprehensive patent-to-industry and specific patent-to-technology concordance matrixes. As in the case of the patent data presented in Section 4.2.3, I use the EPO clean energy patent classification to identify patents associated with wind power. 160 I use the patent-to-industry classification matrix put forth by Schmoch (2008). Concerning patent-to-technology matrixes I focus on conventional energy technologies: fossil fuel power generation, oil and gas drilling, oil refining, nuclear energy, and hydro energy.    4.13: Global patenting in wind power, all technologies, fast and slow performing subfields, 19804.13: Global patenting in wind power, all technologies, fast and slow performing subfields, -2008 Note: 'Digital communication' and 'pharmaceuticals' were respectively the 2nd and 3rd subfields in 2008 in terms of highest patenting relative to 1980.

Nevertheless, the rate of wind power patenting was lower than that of all conventional energy technologies until the late 1990s, at which point it started to rise, eventually surpassing all conventional energy technologies around 2000. In absolute terms (lower chart), until the second half of the 1990s, the total number of yearly wind power patent applications had been comparable to that of hydro energy, which until then experienced the lowest levels of patenting among the conventional energy technologies considered. Once the rate of wind power patenting started to rise, however, by the late 1990s wind power patenting numbers had surpassed those associated with hydro energy and nuclear energy, and reached close to 900 by 2008. In contrast, the number of patents associated with oil refining has remained roughly stable increasing from 1,000 applications per year in 1980 to 1,200 in 2008. Fossil fuel power generation and oil and gas drilling experienced still higher yearly patenting rates. Though the rate of patenting associated with fossil fuel power generation has dropped since 1980 it still accounts for over 2,600 patent applications per year. After dropping from approximately 3,000 applications in 1980 to 2,000 patent applications in 1993, patenting in oil and gas drilling has notably risen to approximately 3,500 applications in 2008.

The hypothesis that indeed they could catch up was articulated along two complementary arguments: one focused on developments in China while the other focused on developments at the frontier. The first argument was that the Chinese government was able to create relatively large domestic markets for climate friendly energy technologies and that Chinese firms benefited from a strong technology development system with a powerful and proactive government at its heart. The assumption was that this would provide the necessary conditions for Chinese firms to make rapid technological progress. The second argument was that due to limited government support over the years in both Europe and the United States, the frontier of new climate friendly energy technologies had evolved relatively slowly, making it easier for Chinese firms to catch up. The analysis focused on testing these arguments in the case of one climate friendly energy technology: wind power. I discuss in Section 5.2 how the hypothesis could be further tested by extending the analysis to other technology case studies. Chapter 2 detailed the convergence of trends of leading Chinese firms with firms at the technological frontier using various wind turbine technology indicators. It highlighted that by the beginning of the 2010 decade, Chinese firms were developing wind turbines increasingly similar to those produced by frontier firms. The chapter also assessed the evolution of technological capabilities among some of the leading Chinese turbine manufacturers. This showed that the firms had rapidly improved their capabilities and were increasingly introducing new technologies based on their own technological development efforts. In sum, the chapter showed that catching up by Chinese wind turbine manufacturers was well underway. The chapter notably underscored the pivotal role of technology transfer from foreign firms in the process of accumulation of technological capabilities by Chinese firms. In particular the transition from licensing of turbine designs and blueprints to the joint-development of new turbine models with foreign firms appears to have played a key role in allowing Chinese firms to gain access to core technologies and accelerate the rate of technological learning. Chapter 3 focused on the first argument of the research hypothesis and described the main features of the Chinese wind turbine technology development system. It highlighted the policies introduced by the government to create a rapidly growing wind power market in China. More importantly, however, it described the steps taken by the government to ensure that Chinese firms would enter the domestic turbine manufacturing market and progressively come to dominate it. The competition which ensued among domestic turbine manufacturers to secure orders for their products was arguably the main driver of the technology development efforts of Chinese turbine manufacturers documented in Chapter 2. Nevertheless, the government was also actively engaged through a variety of regulations to spur rapid technological progress, both in terms of turbine size and ownership of intellectual property. This government activism was visible in other aspects of the Chinese wind power industry, notably to ease bottlenecks in grid expansion. The Chinese system was also characterized by the strong influence the government had on firms, many of which were state-owned. The exertion of this influence was facilitated by industry associations, which helped the government closely monitor industrial progress. The Chinese system faced a number of challenges to ensure the continued progress of the industry. Of these, the most significant was whether the system could transition from a model of technology development based on technology transfer to one based on its own innovation efforts. As noted above, by the beginning of the 2010s, the main turbine manufacturers had started to introduce turbine models based on independent technology development efforts. However these were still drawn to a large extent on earlier transfers of turbine designs and blueprints. The main emphasis of R&D efforts by Chinese firms was on short-term problem solving and incremental improvements to existing technologies. The government's R&D support system was also geared towards tackling the industry's most pressing needs. Research institutions notably played a relatively small part in the technology development system, primarily aimed at providing shortterm technological assistance to the industry. To some extent, overcoming technological challenges in the short term was suitable for purposes of catching up. However, as Chinese firms increasingly compete with frontier firms, such a shorter-term outlook to technology development is likely to be insufficient. More ambitious, independent technology development with a longer-term outlook will be needed. There were some signs that a transition was already occurring. A few firms and research institutions had started ambitious frontier-like technology development efforts. Other firms had acquired European engineering firms to assist them in their R&D needs. The government was also aware of the limits of the existing R&D support system and was exploring ways to better complement firm R&D efforts. While it is too early to tell whether these signs were outliers or precursors of further change to come, the fact remains that some of the basic ingredients for innovation-based technology development were present. Chapter 4 focused on the second hypothesis argument and assessed the role of government in the evolution of the wind power technology frontier. Using patenting rates as an indicator of knowledge development, the chapter first showed the high level of correlation since the 1970s between changes in government wind power support policies and patenting activity associated with wind power in three of the most active countries. The analysis then showed, using both technology penetration rates and patenting trends, that the evolution of the wind power frontier was slow relative to most other technology sectors globally. Only once policy-induced wind power deployment accelerated from the early 2000s did patenting activity started to grow at a more sustained pace than all technologies taken together. In sum, the chapter showed that the wind power frontier was evolving relatively slowly due to limited government support, thereby facilitating the process of technological catch-up by Chinese firms."}, {"section_title": "Extending the assessment of technological catch-up", "text": "The assessment of technological catch-up presented in Chapter 2 faced a number of limitations. For example, the comparative assessment of turbine performance based on capacity factors did not capture the bulk of the rise in turbine capacity observed in China because a track record of electricity production data for larger turbines was not yet available. Extending the analysis of capacity factors over time would therefore be an important step to complement the assessment of technological catch-up. It would also be useful to complement the capacity factor analysis with a comparative assessment of turbine operation and maintenance (O&M) using data, for example, on the frequency with which turbines have to stop operating and the time spent on repairs by problem area. 161 Such data were not available for Chinese wind farms in large part because there appeared to be no systematic data collection efforts for O&M. However, two industry associations indicated that they had received backing from the government to expand data collection efforts in this direction. If access to such data can be made available for both China and frontier markets, such assessments may therefore become possible. One technology dimension which was not discussed concerns the exports of Chinese wind turbines abroad. At the time of this research, Chinese manufacturers had just begun to export turbines and there was therefore little track record to work with. 162 However as Chinese turbine exports continue to rise it will be possible to compare the performance of Chinese turbines with frontier models in other markets, thereby complementing the analysis undertaken in Chapter 3."}, {"section_title": "Considering a more dynamic assessment of technological catch-up", "text": "The methodology adopted for this research considered developments in China and at the frontier independently. The only link between the two settings explicitly considered was the assessment of technology transfer from the frontier to China. This simple approach helped to identify and assess the most important drivers of technological catch-up. However, technological development efforts in both settings are likely to have interacted in dynamic ways -i.e. changes in one setting are likely to have affected development efforts in the other. In particular, the analysis presented in previous chapters raises questions concerning two types of dynamic interactions. The first relates to the technology transfers described in Chapter 2. The second relates to wind power deployment policies discussed in the case of China in Chapter 3, and in case of the Denmark, Germany, and the United States in Chapter 4. Each is briefly discussed below."}, {"section_title": "Technology transfers to China", "text": "The discussion in previous chapters underscored the critical role of the evolution of the means of technology transfer adopted by Chinese wind turbine manufacturers -from licensing, to joint development, firm acquisitions, and more targeted technical assistance contracts. In particular joint-development agreements were identified as having been particularly important. Not only did such agreements provide access to technological knowledge, but they also facilitated learning by Chinese firms through extensive and close collaboration with foreign firms. The analysis presented focused on the implications of such technology transfers for Chinese firms but it did not consider the perspective of the foreign firms involved. In would thus be useful to identify the reasons which led these firms to agree to transfer their technologies and help their Chinese counterpart assimilate the knowledge received. The foreign firms involved were either dedicated engineering services firms or second-tier turbine manufacturers (in terms of manufacturing output). In each case, they were based either in Europe or the United States. One possible reason may therefore be that access to the Chinese market offered business prospects far greater than what they would have experienced otherwise. It would follow that these foreign firms were ready to forgo some of their technological knowhow in exchange for access to the Chinese market. In contrast, leading frontier turbine manufacturers were unwilling to risk losing their technologies, even if this meant playing a smaller role in the Chinese market. Another possible reason for the technology transfers observed may be that entering the Chinese market gave foreign firms access to manufacturing capabilities on a scale which allowed them to eventually compete internationally. The rationale would be that as long as they offered high quality engineering services to their Chinese counterparts, they would remain indispensable. This may notably explain the acquisition of European engineering design companies by Chinese manufacturing firms (e.g. Vensys of Germany by Goldwind; Darwind of Holland by XEMC) or the willingness expressed by one leading Chinese turbine manufacturer to continue relying on such transfers for future models. In any event, the transfers of technology by European and United States firms described in this research appear to be linked to the magnitude of the market opportunities in China relative to those in other markets (at the frontier or elsewhere). It is likely, therefore, that if market creation efforts in advanced economies (described in Chapter 4) had been more significant, or conversely if China had not created as large a market (described in Chapter 3), then these foreign firms may not have been as willing to engage in technology transfers and forgo some of their technologies. Further assessing the rational for foreign firms to engage in technology transfer would therefore be a useful complement to the assessment of technological catch-up presented in Chapter 2. "}, {"section_title": "OTHER NEW CLIMATE FRIENDLY ENERGY TECHNOLOGY CASE STUDIES", "text": "The analysis presented in this thesis showed that the arguments of the hypothesis were indeed valid in the case of wind power. However, the hypothesis concerns new climate friendly energy technologies more broadly. A more complete assessment would therefore require testing the validity of the hypothesis for other new climate friendly energy technologies. As noted in Chapter 1, new climate friendly energy technologies refer to technologies which emit no or only limited amounts of greenhouse gases, which have the economic and technical potential to have a significant impact on global greenhouse gas emissions, but which have currently only fulfilled a fraction of this potential. Aside from wind power, the main new climate friendly technologies therefore consist of other renewable energy sources, such as solar energy or biomass, as well as CO 2 capture and storage technologies (CCS). 163 As detailed in previous chapters, in the case of wind power, testing the research hypothesis rests on a detailed assessment of technology progress, firm capabilities, and the role of government in the technology's development system. Nevertheless, without undertaking such an in-depth assessment it is possible to identify whether other new climate friendly energy technologies may hold some of the characteristics outlined in the research hypothesis. In particular, the hypothesis underscores two important variables. The first is that the Chinese government is able to create a relatively large domestic market by international standards for the technology. The second is that progress of the technology's frontier has evolved slowly relative to other technologies. I therefore discuss some other potential case studies based on these two variables and contrast them to the case of wind power discussed in this thesis."}, {"section_title": "The large domestic market variable", "text": "Wind power was an interesting technology case study as the Chinese government had already created the largest domestic wind power market in the world. Another candidate case study technology in this respect is solar hot water heater technology, as China has long had the largest market in the world for solar hot water heaters. However, market trends in other leading nations shown in figure 5.1 underscore that solar hot water heater technology has not attracted much policy support in these countries. This raises questions as to whether the prospects of this technology to mitigate climate change at a global level is significant and, therefore, whether it should be considered as a new climate friendly energy technology in the scope of this study. Data consists of solar thermal net direct-use measured in tera joules. Germany, Israel, and the United states were the countries with the highest solar thermal production in 2010. At the time of writing, no other climate friendly energy technologies appeared to meet the large market criterion. However, this does not mean other technologies will not do so in the near future as China is likely to expand its support to other climate friendly energy technologies. Indeed, as noted in the introduction to Chapter 3, the 12 th five-year plan, clearly identified clean energy technologies as priority areas for the country. Two potential future technology cases seem particularly relevant and are briefly discussed here: solar photovoltaic, and CO 2 capture and storage. Figure 5.2 shows the evolution of power production from solar photovoltaic (PV) in China and in the three leading countries in 2010. The figure reflects that the Chinese domestic market was still small in 2010 relative to leading countries. It is also interesting to note that solar PV market growth only started from 2000. In contrast, wind power deployment discussed in Chapter 2 started much earlier. In the case of Germany, the largest market in the world for solar PV, the market started to grow from the early 2000s. In the case of Italy, the second largest market in the world, market growth did not begin until 2008. As in the case of wind power, these national solar PV markets emerged in response to government support policies. One important characteristic of the solar PV market is that Chinese firms were important suppliers of PV modules to European and other markets, in large part due to lower costs of production. In 2011, the largest nine Chinese firms (in terms of total PV capacity produced) accounted for approximately 30% of global production (REN21, 2012). Nevertheless, the Chinese government enacted a domestic feed-in tariff law in 2011 to support the expansion of a domestic solar PV market. This led to a rapid growth in installed capacity, from a total of With respect to CO 2 capture and storage (CCS), deployment globally was still at an early stage with only few demonstration projects, for the most part linked to enhanced-oil-recovery. At the time of this research no CCS projects were underway in China. However, CCS is an amalgamation of various different technologies. In the scope of technological catch-up, considering CCS in its entirety may be misleading. One can notably distinguish between CO 2 capture technology and CO 2 storage technology. One promising approach to CO 2 capture technology is to remove CO 2 from the energy production process prior to combustion of the fuel. In this process the gasification of fuels typically plays a central role. Gasifiers convert fuels into synthetic gas which is then used for various other thermo-chemical processes. China has been active in the development of gasification technology for many years as the government has sought ways to use its large coal resources as feedstock for industries other than power generation, such as chemicals and plastics. China has notably become a leading market for gasification technology. Figure 5.3 shows the evolution of the gasification market in China and the United States, the two largest national markets in the world. China became the leading market in terms of synthetic gas production in 2004 and by 2009 had over twice the installed production of the United States. The cases of hot water heaters, solar PV, and gasification appear to be promising case study technologies with respect to the large domestic market variable. In the case of solar hot water heaters China already had a very large market by international standards. Similarly, though CCS technology is still in its infancy, China already plays a leading role in terms of gasification technology. Finally, while the Chinese solar PV market is still relatively small, the government's introduction of deployment support policies may change the market landscape in the future."}, {"section_title": "The slow frontier variable", "text": "Patenting rates were used in Chapter 4 as an indicator of the evolution of the wind power technology frontier relative to other technologies and sectors. I adopt the same approach here to compare patenting rates associated with some of the climate friendly technologies discussed above. The upper chart of figure 5.4 shows the evolution of the number of annual global patent applications associated with solar thermal technology, solar PV, CO 2 capture and storage, as well as wind power. 165 The chart shows that apart from the early 1980s period, during which solar technologies saw relatively high levels of patenting activity, the overall trends for solar technologies were comparable to that of wind power. Solar PV is the only technology for which patenting numbers were slightly above those of wind power from 1980 to 2008. CCS patenting activity in contrast was by far the lowest throughout the period. The lower chart shows the same data normalized using 1980 values. This chart also includes as a reference the trend for all technologies and all sectors combined (see Section 4.3 for details). One of the characteristics of wind power discussed in Chapter 4 was that its patenting rate relative to 1980 only surpassed all technologies taken together around the mid-2000. This trend is closely matched by that of solar PV. In contrast the trend for solar thermal technology shows that patenting levels have remained below 1980 levels from the early 1980s and throughout the entire time period considered. The trend line for CCS remains slightly above the line for all technologies taken together before increasing at a much faster pace from the mid-1990s. However, this reflects the much lower patenting levels discussed above rather than particularly high patenting activity.  , 1980-2008 These trends indicate that the frontier of other new climate friendly technologies has evolved at a similar, if not slower pace than that of wind power. Following findings discussed in Chapter 4 concerning the pace of the wind power technology frontier relative to other technologies and sectors, we can therefore conclude that the frontier for these other climate friendly technologies has also evolved relatively slowly."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS FOR GOVERNMENTS OF ADVANCED ECONOMIES", "text": "The analysis of technological catch-up by Chinese wind turbine manufacturers detailed in previous chapters highlights how in less than a decade the Chinese government was able to create a system of technology development capable of spurring rapid technological progress. Though many uncertainties remain with respect to the ability of Chinese firms to engage in innovation based technology development, it is likely that they will continue to enhance their capabilities and increasingly compete with firms at the frontier. This would undoubtedly have important economic consequences, notably with respect to the ability of Chinese firms to capture growing export markets for wind turbines and turbine components. As noted in Chapter 1, many governments of advanced economies have stressed the economic importance of successfully developing new climate friendly energy technology industries. I therefore discuss below some of the lessons which can be drawn from the case of wind power for governments of advanced economies wishing to encourage industrial development associated with new climate friendly energy technologies. I discuss the need to enhance the intensity of government technology support policies before considering one important implication related to the nature of command and control policies."}, {"section_title": "Increasing the intensity of government support policies", "text": "Chapter 4 highlighted the correlation between changes in government support policies for wind power technology and the level of knowledge development activity using patent application rates. It also showed that for much of the period from 1980 to 2008, development activity related to wind power was low relative to other technologies and sectors. Only from the early 2000s did patenting activity start to rise at a fast rate relative to all other technologies taken together. Still, relative to 1980 levels, wind power patenting activity only surpassed that of all technologies taken together around 2005. In addition, when compared to several other conventional energy technologies the growth in patenting activity relating to wind power remained small in absolute numbers. The relative low level of knowledge development associated with wind power indicates that there is significantly scope for enhancing the pace of knowledge development at the frontier. However this will require governments of advanced economies to increase the intensity of their support policies. The discussion in Chapter 4 highlighted that the rise in policy induced wind power deployment starting from the year 2000 in Denmark, Germany, and the United States played a particularly important role in spurring growth in patenting activity in those countries. The ability of governments to further increase the pace of deployment in these countries varies from case to case. In Denmark for example, wind power already accounted for approximately 20% of electricity consumption in 2010. In contrast, in Germany and the United States, wind power production was still a relatively small share of total electricity production, indicating that the pace of wind power deployment in these countries may be increased. Offshore wind power notably offers large market growth prospects, particularly for countries such as Denmark which have already heavily exploited onshore opportunities. Offshore wind power also raises new technological challenges, for example linked turbine foundations, O&M, or wind farm construction. Tackling these challenges will induce firms to develop new technologies and help maintain competitive advantages. The evolution of wind power deployment support policies in Denmark, Germany, and the United States highlighted a number of bottlenecks which hampered wind power technology deployment. One notable example was linked to power system infrastructures. In particular, building new transmission lines, connecting offshore wind farms, as well as managing the balancing of electricity systems appeared to have put a strain on efforts to expand wind power markets in each of the three case study countries. These bottlenecks indicated that wind power held certain characteristics which make it incompatible with the pre-existing organization of electricity grid infrastructures. As noted in the discussion on technology diffusion rates in Section 4.3, historically infrastructure technologies have required longer timeframes to evolve, which may in part explain the relatively slow penetration rates for wind power. Nevertheless, overcoming these infrastructure hurdles would contribute to accelerate market growth. Another important bottleneck to the growth in wind power deployment is institutional in nature. The pace of deployment is a reflection of the ability of governments to support through policy higher levels of deployment. This may be limited by budgetary constraints, inadequate government operational capabilities, as well as political resistance to wind power. In any event, addressing these institutional constraints would accelerate the pace of deployment and provide greater certainty to firms about future market prospects. The latter would notably allow firms to adopt longer term horizons in their technology development efforts. The discussion in Chapter 4 showed that the correlation between government R&D funding and patenting activity was not as strong as Governments in advanced economies should therefore consider increasing their support to wind power technology R&D and continue to target activities complementary to those undertaken at the firm level."}, {"section_title": "Command and control policies and their implications for technological catch-up", "text": "Chapter 1 highlighted that governments had two broad options to mitigate climate change and support the development of new climate friendly energy technologies. On the one hand, governments could seek to internalize the climate change externality by either introducing a tax on greenhouse gas emissions or by limiting total emissions using an emission permit trading scheme. On the other hand, governments could adopt so called command and control policies, which directly support or discourage specific industrial activities or technologies. In the first case, technology decisions are to a large extent made by firms in response to changes in the production costs they face. In the second case, decisions are to a large extent made by governments by favoring certain technologies and discouraging the use of others. In practice, the choice between such instruments has many implications beyond technology choices. Command and control policies notably give governments a certain amount of discretion with respect to the activities or technologies they target. These may therefore have more political appeal than emissions taxes or trading schemes. The discussion in Chapter 4 on wind power support measures in Denmark, Germany, and the United States also highlighted that energy security, not climate change, was the main driver of the early stages of government support for wind power. In particular the oil shock of 1973 decisively brought energy security concerns to the fore of the agendas of most advanced economies and effectively initiated what would become an intricate web of government support measures directly targeting the development and deployment of wind power. In contrast, the accumulation of scientific evidence linking emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning to climate change only progressively became an important driver of government support for climate friendly energy technologies starting from the 1980s and 1990s. By that time, wind power technology support policies were already part of the policy landscape of many countries. Nevertheless, the case of wind power technology catch-up discussed in previous chapters raises an important issue with respect to the merit of using command and control policies to support climate friendly energy technologies in advanced economies over emissions taxes or trading schemes. By clearly identifying the targeted technology, the means by which it is being supported, and possible long-term objectives, command and control measures also provide clear guidance to nations wishing to engage in technological catch-up. Returning to the definition of technological catch-up introduced in Chapter 1 as 'entities at lower levels along a technological path rising at a faster pace than the evolution at the technological frontier', command and control measures effectively sign-post the path to the frontier and beyond. As discussed in Chapter 3, in the case of wind power such policies in Europe and the United States contributed to fulfilling the 'guidance of search' function of the Chinese wind turbine technology development systems. In contrast, adopting emissions taxes or tradable permit schemes in advanced economies would provide greater autonomy to firms at the frontier to make technology choices. This would therefore remove much of the technology guidance to other nations implied by command and control policies as firms have a natural tendency to conceal technology choices to protect their position in the market. Emissions taxes or trading may notably foster new, unforeseen technology ventures among firms, similar to the more radical innovations discussed in the literature review in Chapter 1. This would likely help firms in advanced economies as the ability to innovate, after all, remains the greatest competitive advantage they have over firms in rapidly emerging economies such as China."}]
