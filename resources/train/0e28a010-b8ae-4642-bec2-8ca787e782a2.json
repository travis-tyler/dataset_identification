[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This study basically focused on the use of algebraic tiles to improve Senior High School (SHS) students' conceptual understanding of a system of two linear equations at St. Mary's Seminary Senior High School, Lolobi in the Volta Region of Ghana. The test instrument used for the data collection was an achievement test with eight essay type questions, with an internal consistency reliability of 0.78. The simple random sampling technique was used to assign 70 SHS two students equally to experimental and control groups. The two groups were pre-and post-tested in the study. A pairedsample t-test was used to analyze the data. The results showed that even though there was some improvement in the posttest across the board (both control and experimental groups), there was a statistically significant improvement in the experimental group which received the intervention for four weeks using the algebraic tiles."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "There is a general agreement among all stakeholders in education that every child should study mathematics at school; indeed, the study of mathematics is regarded by most people as being essential (Cockcroft, 1982; NCTM, 2000) . In Ghana, mathematics is made not only compulsory at the basic school level but also mandatory at the Senior High School level. This is to ensure that all students are mathematically empowered to further their studies without any impediment and pu rsue programmes of their choice (Fletcher, 2005) .\nHowever, in the past three decades, there have been growing concerns about falling standards of students' achievements in mathematics at both national and international levels (Blum 2002; T\u00f6rner and Sriraman 2006) . Research by Eshun (2004) and Eshun -Famiyeh (2005) , have also shown that mathematics continues to be perceived as the most difficult subject in the school curriculum; this general perception is reflected in students' performance over the years. For example, a Criterion Reference Test (CRT) conducted in 1996 and 2000 established that only 1.8% and 4.4% of primary six students nationwide obtained a mark of 55% respectively (MoE, 2002) . \"Between 1999 and 2008, a total of 905,102 candidates sat for the SSSCE/WASSCE. Out of that number, only 88,590 representing 9.8% passed to further their education at the tertiary level. The trend has not been any different from the subsequent years, 2009 -2015 . In 2014 and despite the increase in the number of candidates in 2015, the number of candidates qualifying dropped to 25%\" (Gavor, 2015) .\nIt is also on record that Ghana has never been represented since 1953 in any International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) which is an annual mathematics competition that is organized for preuniversity teams from all over the world. It is also disappointing to note that even in sub -Saharan Africa; representation at this prestigious international competition is woefully inadequate (Amponsah, 2010) . In the 2003 TIMSS (Trends In International Mathematics and Science Study) mathematics test for grade eight students, it was reported that out of the 45 countries that participated in the competition, Ghana finished 44 th . Ghanaian students scored a total of 276 compared to the international average of 466 (Anamuah Mensah et al., 2005; Fredua-Kwarteng, 2005) .\nThese are indications that all is not well with us as a nation (Ghana) in terms of mathematics achievement at the pre-university level. Among the challenges facing our educational institutions today are how to improve effectively on lesson delivery using appropriate teaching and learning materials, as well as how to teach students with diverse abilities such as visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic learners. To overcome these challenges, a variety of teaching and learning strategies have been advocated for use in mathematics classrooms. Among them are educators moving away from the teacher-centered approach to more students-centred ones, and the use of concrete materials. Also, there is substantial evidence of research done by other researchers on the various effects of the use of concrete learning materials on students (Lira & Ezeife, 2008; Kosko & Wilkins, 2010 ) research since they are substantial). Mathematics teachers are constantly considering various ways of improving their teaching and helping students to understand mathematical concepts. Researchers hold the view that mathematics instructions and students' understanding are more effective if concrete materials are used (Steedly et al. 2008) . However, Maslen (2014) , warns that concrete materials are potentially harmful if used improperly , especilly in vulnerable educational settings where such misappropriation can lead to falling stadnards of academic perfomance (Afach, Kiwan, & Semaan, 2018) . Improperly used concrete materials are likely to convince students that two mathematical worlds exist: concrete materials and symbolic (Milgram & Wu 2008) . Concrete materials must be relevant to the concept being developed and appropriate for the cognitive development level of students thus the utility of concrete materials in conveying mathematical concept is deeply rooted in the teachers' ability to select, organize and make appropriate linkages (Post,1981) .\nConcrete materials are regarded as a way of increasing mathematical understanding (Lee, 2014) . They are typically real-life objects that are used to represent mathematical concepts (Kosko & Wilkins 2010) . Teachers' utilize them to clarify abstract mathematical concepts that ordinarily may be difficult for students, such as adding and subtracting integers, solving inequalities and simplifying algebraic expressions (Lira & Ezeife, 2008) . The learning process involves transitioning from manipulating concrete material to creating images from the student's perception of concept and finally, to the development or adoption of some form of symbolic notation representing the concept (Ameron et al. 2011) .\nHowever, the mathematical research literature has revealed the importance of concept formation as a powerful tool for promoting teaching and learning of mathematics. As such, theoretical approaches to the teaching and learning of mathematical concepts should give way to practical activities that promote and facilitate easy learning. Duman and Karag\u00f6z(2016) rightly pointed out that the usefulness of educational systems and concepts are enshrined in the competence of teachers who organize, plan, and moderate teaching and learning process. It could, therefore, be seen that any current reform made in the field of mathematics education is deeply rooted in finding ways of empowering students to learn to do mathematics in a more simple and practical way (Franser, 2013) .\nIf Ghana is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and go beyond to attain the status of a successful knowledge-based economy, then she must ensure that her youth are equipped with stronger mathematical skills that include practical problem -solving skills at the pre-tertiary level. The researchers, therefore, are of the view that the traditional method of teaching mathematics is too \"imposing\" and \"intimidating\" which could only lead to a total dependency on the teacher. Teachers of mathematics should have positive attitudes toward teaching and learning of the subject by employing globalized approaches in the teaching and learning profession (Demirtas & Aksoy, 2015) . therefore, use a lot of alternative strategies including the use of concrete learning materials, to ma ke the teaching of mathematics more practical for easy understanding. This will not only reduce the cognitive load of the students but also make mathematics learning enjoyable and stress-free.\nAs stated earlier, students' understanding of algebr aic expressions serves as the basis for learning other kinds of equations such as linear, quadratic and simultaneous equations. Therefore, the teaching of simple algebraic expressions must be handled with care. Algebra as a topic is more concerned with the study of processes and basic structures than with particular answers to problems.\nIt is in this light that the researchers decided to make relentless efforts to identify the problems faced by students in the solving system of two linear equations and use algebraic tiles to teach the students to overcome their challenges in one of the less endowed schools in Ghana, the Lolobi St. Mary's Senior High School. Despite the availability of qualified mathematics tutors and some appreciable level of logistics regarding teaching and learning materials, form two students of St. Mary's Seminary Senior High School have difficulties in deducing mathematical statements from word problems and how to use the substitution method to solve a system of two linear equations. The overall purpose of this study, therefore, was to improve these Senior High School students' conceptual understanding of the system of two linear equations using algebraic tiles.\nThe research hypothesis designed to direct and guide the study is: Null hypothesis : There is no significant difference in the mean scores of students before and after introduction of Algebraic tiles in solving system of two linear equations.\ni. e. : = Alternate hypothesis is : There is a significant difference in the pre-test and post-test scores of students after introduction of Algebraic tiles in solving system of two linear equations (at \u03b1 = 0.05 level of significance (P < 0.05)).\n: \u00b5 \u2260 \u00b5 Any research which is aimed at improving students' conceptual understanding would go a long way to improve the quality of mathematics education. The researchers are of the view that this research would serve as an eye-opener to some teachers (and a reminder to others) to know the type of concrete materials they need to use to help students who are having difficulty in understanding how to solve a system of linear equations."}, {"section_title": "Algebraic tiles in system of equation", "text": "According to Austin (2008) , a system of linear equations consists of two or more equations with the same variables. To solve a system of equations with two or more variables, there is the need to find the ordered pair that satisfies all of the equations. We can solve a system of linear equations by using an algebraic method called substitution. This method can be modelled using algebraic tiles. From the diagram below, a rectangular shape tile represent s an \"x\" variable; while \"y\" represents a circular shape tile, and the square tile represents a constant. However, a change in colour (black) of the above tiles represents negatives. Manipulative materials are concrete models or objects that involve mathematics concepts. The most effective tools are the ones that appeal to several senses, and that can be touched and moved around by students (Heddens, 1997) . Some of these models are; Cuisenaire Rods, pattern blocks and snap cards.\nCuisenaire Rods: They are coloured wooden or plastic rods that have values from one to ten and are coloured by the number they represent. For example White rod=1, Red rod=2, Light green rod=3, Lavender rod=4, Yellow rod=5, Dark Green rod=6, Black rod=7, Brown rod=8, Blue rod=9 and Orange rod=10. Cuisenaire rods can be used for equations, fractions, additions, subtractions, probabilities and statistics."}, {"section_title": "Pattern Blocks:", "text": "Pattern blocks are one centimetre thick multicoloured blocks that come in six shapes such as hexagon, squares, trapezoids, triangles, parallelograms and rhombi. Each shape is a different colour. They are used for fractions, patterns, geometry, symmetry, addition, multiplication, equations and ratios."}, {"section_title": "Unifix cubes:", "text": "They are colourful, interlocking cubes that link in only one way. They come in ten solid colours that make them quite visual for demonstrations and easily allow for patterning and sorting. Unifix cubes can be used for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, patterns, fractions, equations and place value."}, {"section_title": "METHOD", "text": "This segment of the study looked at the research design, population, sample, instrumentation, data collection tools as well as validity and reliability of the test instrument."}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "The appropriate research design for this study was pretest -posttest control group design.

The pre-test was made up of eight (8) questions. The first four (4) questions were based on the formation of mathematical statements from word problems. Questions 5 to 8 were based on the students' ability to use the substitution method to solve the mathematical statement in a system of two linear equations.\nEach student was given a printed question paper and answer sheets. The duration for the pre-test was fifty (50) minutes. Answers of students to the pre-test were marked based on a prepared marking scheme. The researchers critically examined (evaluated) the wrong answers given by the studen ts to find out the possible causes. Discussions were held with the students to find out why they answered some questions the way they did.\nThere was also an interview for students to determine the effectiveness of the use of the Algebraic tiles in helping them solve a system of two linear equations.\nA questionnaire was also administered to the teachers who teach mathematics at the school with the emphasis on the solving system of two linear equations."}, {"section_title": "Intervention", "text": "The use of the Cuisenaire rods to solve a linear system of equations was the intervention in this research.

The researchers used the algebraic tiles model to address the lack of conceptual understanding in solving system of two linear equations with the experimental group. During the intervention stage, the students were exposed to strategies, opportunities and responses to what they were doing.

The students in the experimental sample realized that instead of competing for the right answers, they should rather learn how to share their problem-solving ideas and answers with each other\nIn another reaction, students discovered during the intervention that there are often several correct ways of finding a solution to a problem. This finding also confirms some of the earlier findings and assertion by researchers such as Clements (1999) , who hold the view th at teachers who employ concrete materials in their teaching usually outperform those who do not use them. This finding also shows that students' attitude towards algebra improves when they are taught using semi-concrete materials such as algebraic tiles model.

The statistical difference showed that the intervention tools Algebraic tiles model used had improved student's algebraic knowledge under the study. Nevertheless, some students could read, understand and accept challenging questions but become confused when translating the story problem to mathematical statements and use the substitution method to solve mathematical statements. The research revealed that students did not know that they could learn better from their classmates until the intervention stage. The intervention helped students develop a more positive attitude towards equations and mathematics as a whole because they were more excited as they could easily answer challenging questions and reach sound conclusi ons.
