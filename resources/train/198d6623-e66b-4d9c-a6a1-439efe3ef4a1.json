AD is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss in its early stages, followed by a progressive decline in other behavioral and cognitive functions. Recent therapeutic efforts have focused on early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) to enable earlier treatment of individuals with heightened risk of developing AD. Identifying biomarkers in these patients that might predict brain tissue loss is vital for drug trial enrichment, and to help identify those most likely to decline. Image-based predictors of decline may also offer new leads for understanding the development and pathogenesis of AD.\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a large multi-site longitudinal study to evaluate measures that may help to track or predict disease progression in AD. In addition to the more widely-accepted measures from anatomical MRI, PET, and CSF measures of pathology, ADNI recently added additional neuroimaging measures including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arterial spin labeling, and resting state functional MRI. The primary goal of ADNI is to identify sensitive biomarkers of very early AD progression to help monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy with greater precision.\nMRI-based image analysis methods have long been used to track structural atrophy of the brain. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to microscopic white matter (WM) injury not always detectable with standard anatomical MRI [1] . Diffusion imaging can be used to track the highly anisotropic diffusion of water along axons, revealing microstructural fiber bundles connecting cortical and subcortical regions. In diseases such as AD, and even in MCI subjects at risk for AD, these connections progressively deteriorate.\nBy combining DTI with standard MRI, we can measure the integrity and connectivity of white matter tracts. Connectivity mapping is a relatively recent direction in neuroimaging, and variations in the degree and extent of connections may be useful as measures of disease burden. Recent models of AD suggest that cognitive deficits arise from the progressive disconnection of cortical and subcortical regions, promoted by neuronal loss and white matter injury [2] . The two accepted pathological markers of AD, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, tend to affect association cortices early in the disease. From these cortical regions, long pathways of association fibers are linked to many other brain regions, made up of large populations of pyramidal neurons that support connections within and between hemispheres [3, 4] . AD patients also show a decrease in the volume and integrity of WM commissures such as the corpus callosum, as well as pathways such as the cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus [5, 6] , suggesting an ongoing disruption of connectivity.\nRecently, graph theory has been used to describe anatomical networks and characterize connectivity patterns based on signals in brain images. Structural brain networks are modeled as graphs where nodes designate elements (i.e., brain regions) linked by edges representing physical connections. A recent study found that AD patients have abnormal \"small-world\" architecture in large-scale brain networks, with increased clustering and longer shortest paths linking individual regions, implying a less optimal network topology [8] . However, as far as we know, small-world global network measures, such as characteristic path length (CPL) and mean clustering coefficient (MCC), have not yet been used to predict future WM disruption in AD.\nHere we assessed a group of 19 patients with early signs of cognitive impairment (also termed \"early MCI\"). We first examined whether baseline average fractional anisotropy (FA) measures in the corpus callosum (CC) were predictive of changes in white matter integrity, as measured by changes in FA, after a 6-month follow-up interval. When we found that this was not the case, we further examined whether small-world architecture measures calculated from baseline connectivity maps, derived from both MRI and DTI data, were able to predict changes in white matter integrity after 6 months. We found that global network measures may offer a potentially useful biomarker in predicting white matter changes at this critical time before the onslaught of AD."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and Image Acquisition", "text": "At the time of writing (November 2011), data collection for the ADNI2 project is still in its early stages.

Of those, 19 had returned for a 6-month follow up scan (mean age: 74.7 yrs, SD: 8.4 at baseline; 11 men/8 women).\nAll 19 subjects underwent whole-brain MRI scanning on 3-Tesla GE Medical Systems scanners, on at least two occasions: once at baseline and again 6 months later.

The resulting 3D deformation fields were applied to the remaining 41 DWI volumes prior to mapping diffusion parameters. A single diffusion tensor [13] was fitted at each voxel in the brain from the eddy-and EPIcorrected DWI scans using FSL, and scalar anisotropy maps were obtained from the resulting diffusion tensor eigenvalues ( 1 , 2 ,"}, {"section_title": "Template Creation & Spatial Normalization", "text": "A study-specific minimal deformation template (MDT) was created from a randomly selected subset of spatially aligned baseline FA maps (n=24). A customized template based on subjects in the study can reduce bias in the registrations [14] . The MDT template deviates least from the anatomy of the subjects, and can improve statistical power [15] . The MDT was generated by creating an initial affine mean template from all subjects, then elastically registering all the aligned individual scans to that mean [12] while regularizing the Jacobians [16] . A new mean was created from the registered scans; this process was iterated several times. Each subject's initial baseline FA map was elastically registered to the final MDT. To ensure white matter alignment across subjects, registered FA maps were thresholded at FA > 0.2 to include only highly anisotropic anatomy and the thresholded maps were elastically registered to the thresholded MDT (FA > 0.2).\nWe then elastically registered [12] each subject's 6 month follow up FA map to their registered baseline FA. To ensure white matter alignment, registered 6 month FA maps were thresholded at FA > 0.2 and again elastically registered to their respective thresholded baseline FA (FA > 0.2). The resulting registered baseline and 6 month follow-up FA images where then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (5mm FWHM).

Whether or not such deficits can be predicted in early MCI subjects is of great interest for identifying candidates for early treatment, and in pre-selecting groups for clinical trials. In this study we found no significant differences in FA maps between baseline and 6 months in eMCI subjects. We also found no significant association between the baseline average FA corpus callosum measures and FA difference maps. However, we did find an association between baseline small world global network measures and changes in FA after just 6 months.\nNetworks with higher levels of clustering are more densely connected and may indicate a more functionally coherent neural system [7] . We found that lower mean clustering coefficient at baseline was associated with larger decreases in FA in the right internal capsule. The fibers from the corona radiata, including the thalamocortical and long corticofugal tracts, all converge into the internal capsule. These systems are likely part of the overall network that becomes disconnected in AD.\nDTI has some limitations in gauging fiber integrity in regions with extensive fiber crossing and mixing. The simplistic single-tensor model assumes diffusion is Gaussian, with a dominant direction in 3D that can be inferred. For example, we found MCC associations with increases in FA in the thalamus, but the thalamus is known to have reciprocal connections to a large portion of the cortex potentially making it prone to fiber crossing. Such patterns have also been found in other studies of elderly patients [22] . Using high angular diffusion imaging (HARDI) in future studies, along with FA analogs derived to accommodate multimodal ODFs, may better characterize the integrity of complex intra-voxel structures. FA from the tensor distribution function (TDF) can better characterized the anisotropy where fibers cross [23] . Resolving the multi-fiber microstructure of WM in these regions may provide a better understanding of why we found increases in FA in the thalamus.\nThis study only examined eMCI subjects. As ADNI is a longitudinal study, we will later investigate which of these subjects eventually develop AD. If these early aberrations in connectivity accurately predict a patient's conversion to AD, there may also be certain connectivity patterns that reflect a cognitive reserve.\nThis study offers initial evidence that DTI-based network measures may be a novel predictor of AD progression. Corroboration of this finding in a larger cohort and with other imaging methods is needed and may help in understanding the symptoms and prognosis for patients."}]
