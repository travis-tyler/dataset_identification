[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: With a wide array of multi-modal, multi-protocol, and multi-scale biomedical data being routinely acquired for disease characterization, there is a pressing need for quantitative tools to combine these varied channels of information. The goal of these integrated predictors is to combine these varied sources of information, while improving on the predictive ability of any individual modality. A number of application-specific data fusion methods have been previously proposed in the literature which have attempted to reconcile the differences in dimensionalities and length scales across different modalities. Our objective in this paper was to help identify metholodological choices that need to be made in order to build a data fusion technique, as it is not always clear which strategy is optimal for a particular problem. As a comprehensive review of all possible data fusion methods was outside the scope of this paper, we have focused on fusion approaches that employ dimensionality reduction (DR). Methods: In this work, we quantitatively evaluate 4 non-overlapping existing instantiations of DR-based data fusion, within 3 different biomedical applications comprising over 100 studies. These instantiations utilized different knowledge representation and knowledge fusion methods, allowing us to examine the interplay of these modules in the context of data fusion. The use cases considered in this work involve the integration of (a) radiomics features from T2w MRI with peak area features from MR spectroscopy for identification of prostate cancer in vivo, (b) histomorphometric features (quantitative features extracted from histopathology) with protein mass spectrometry features for predicting 5 year biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients, and (c) volumetric measurements on T1w MRI with protein expression features to discriminate between patients with and without Alzheimers' Disease. Results and conclusions: Our preliminary results in these specific use cases indicated that the use of kernel representations in conjunction with DR-based fusion may be most effective, as a weighted multi-kernel-based DR approach resulted in the highest area under the ROC curve of over 0.8. By contrast non-optimized DR-based representation and fusion methods yielded the worst predictive performance across all 3 applications. Our results suggest that when the individual modalities demonstrate relatively poor discriminability, many of the data fusion methods may not yield accurate, discriminatory representations either. In summary, to outperform the predictive ability of individual modalities, methodological choices for data fusion must explicitly account for the sparsity of and noise in the feature space."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine has the potential to transform clinical practice by enabling the use of multi-scale, multi-modal, heterogeneous data to better determine the probability of an individual contracting certain diseases and/or responding to a specific treatment regimen. These heterogeneous modalities may characterize either imaging (such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), ultrasound, histology specimens) or non-imaging (gene-, protein-expression, spectroscopy) data, based on the method and type of data being acquired.\nThese modalities also have differing dimensionalities, where MRI, ultrasound are scalar intensity values, while spectroscopy is a multi-dimensional signal comprising metabolite concentrations at every image voxel (Fig. 1 ). More crucially, each of these modalities capture different types of information about the disease at different length scales. For example, gene expression levels represent cellular scale observations; changes in which would result in a phenotypic structural or vascular difference on tumor morphology that is captured at the pathologic scale via standard H&E tissue specimens [1] . While data acquired at different length scales may be considered to capture complementary characteristics (structural versus biological), the associated information is represented via fundamentally different data types (images versus molecular concentrations).\nWe define multi-modal data fusion as the process of combining a variety of complementary measurements from different data modalities, existing at different length scales, into an integrated predictor [1] . Combining complementary sources of information in this manner to yield a more comprehensive characterization of a disease or tissue region has been demonstrated to yield a more accurate predictor than using any individual data modality [2, 3] .\nRecently, our group and several others have explored different dimensionality reduction (DR) based fusion approaches, such as linear or non-linear projections [4] [5] [6] [7] , multi-kernel learning [8, 9] or feature selection [10] [11] [12] to address the challenge of multi-modal data fusion; specifically involving imaging and non-imaging data modalities. Note that while there is a plethora of fusion methodologies, we choose to focus here on DR-based multimodal data fusion.\nConsider the publicly available ADNI database which contains imaging (MRI and PET), as well as non-imaging (genetics, cognitive tests, CSF and blood biomarkers) information for a population of patients with and without Alzheimer's disease. Using the ADNI database, multiple data fusion methodologies have been proposed to integrate these different data types to build a fused predictor for Alzheimer's disease, including classifier-based [13] , dimensionality reduction-based [7] , as well as multikernel learning-based [14] . Given that these methods all attempt multi-modal data fusion, one can posit the following questions:\n(a) How are these approaches similar or different from one another? (b) How does a particular method compare to other fusion methods applied to same dataset, either methodologically or in terms of performance? (c) How can a particular method be selected over any other for a new application i.e. do the methods generalize or do they require specific types of information?\nMotivated by the seminal work by Yan et al. [15] , who demonstrated that different dimensionality reduction methods can be formulated as instantiations of the \"generalized graph embedding\" approach, in this paper we propose to identify common methods and thus an underlying workflow which govern existing multi-modal data fusion strategies. Further, we will compare a subset of these data fusion methods to better understand the contributions of the individual modules that comprise a data fusion strategy.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first briefly define the specific steps (representation and fusion) typically followed within a multi-modal data fusion strategy, based on a summary of existing work in this domain. We then provide a detailed description of the different modules that have been previously utilized for data representation as well as data fusion. Experiments to demonstrate the application of multi-modal data fusion in the context of different diagnostic and prognostic clinical problems are then described, followed by the results of quantitative and qualitative evaluation of representative data fusion strategies within these applications. Note that while we have attempted to diversify in terms of our choice of datasets and methods employed, this work is not meant as a comprehensive evaluation of all possible imaging and non-imaging fusion methods and datasets. For instance, we have not extensively explored the popular canonical correlation class of fusion approaches [6] . We have instead opted to systematically compare and relate a few different representative multi-modal data fusion strategies in the context of different clinical applications, to provide a basic understanding of the interplay of different individual modules that can comprise a data fusion method. As all the techniques compared in this study involved projecting the data modalities to construct a reduced fused representation, we have essentially focused on DR-based multimodal data fusion. Finally, we conclude by summarizing our takeaways and directions for future work. Fig. 1 Illustration of data acquired at different length scales from imaging (radiology, pathology) and non-imaging (MR spectroscopy, protein expression) data, which could be combined to create fused predictors of disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. In this illustration we use the example of prostate to illustrate the types of data that might be acquired before and after radical prostatectomy. In vivo information acquired prior to prostatectomy includes MR imaging and spectroscopy, while the surgical specimen yields digitized histological sections as well as undergoing genomic profiling via mass spectrometry. The middle column of the illustration depicts different knowledge representation methods (e.g. dimensionality reduction, co-association matrices) for uniformly representing multi-modal data. Once represented in a common space, these features can be combined to create a predictive model. An application of this predictive model could include survival curve analysis (far right column, obtained by combining histologic and proteomic features) for identification of prostate cancer patients who will later suffer from biochemical recurrence within 5 years (red) from those who will not (blue)\nGeneralized overview of a dimensionality reduction-based multi-modal data fusion strategy Table 1 summarizes a number of recently presented methods for multi-modal data fusion, including the variety of data that has been examined and the different methods that have been utilized in each case. Based on the literature, we observe that there appear to be two specific steps that are utilized (either explicitly or implicitly):\n1. Knowledge representation: We define this as transforming the individual data modalities into a common space where modality differences in terms of scale and dimensionality are removed. This includes methods such as kernel representations [16] , low-dimensional representations (LDR) [17] , or classifier-based decisions [18] . 2. Knowledge fusion: We define this as combining multiple different knowledge representations into a single integrated result to build a fused predictor, such that complementary information from different modalities is leveraged as best possible. Methods utilized in this regard include confusion matrices, weighted or unweighted combinations, as well as concatentation.\nBased on our summary of the literature in Table 1 , we further conceptualize the interplay of these two steps in the context of multi-modal data fusion as illustrated in Fig. 2 . We have additionally incorporated commonly used strategies of resampling (generating multiple representations from each data modality) as well as weighting (differentially considering data modalities depending on their contributions) into this series of steps. The different options for representation as well as fusion have been enumerated in the flowchart; note that any fusion method could be used with any representation method. This indicates that a wide variety of data fusion strategies can be enumerated, however, we must once again note that the current study is not intended as a comprehensive review of all these possible methods. The representative strategies we have chosen to compare in the current study have instead been chosen based on combining different aspects of the workflow depicted in Fig. 2 , and all of them involve some form of dimensionality reduction."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Description of methods utilized for multi-modal data fusion Notation", "text": "We define the original feature space associated with samples c i and c j for modality m as\nwhere N is the number of samples and M is the number of modalities. The corresponding class label for sample c i is given as \u03c9 i \u2208[ 0, 1]."}, {"section_title": "Knowledge representation", "text": "The primary goal of this step is to transform different multi-modal data channels into a common space to overcome inherent dimensionality and scale differences. Representation facilitates subsequent data fusion step by (a) preserving information from each of the input heterogeneous data modalities, while (b) accounting for factors that would be detrimental to combining this information.\nDecision representations This class of approaches involve deriving classifier outputs from independent data channels [18] . For example, Jesneck et al. [19] calculated individual sets of probabilities from different imaging modalities (mammograms, sonograms) as well as patient history (non-imaging). These sets of classifier probabilities were then quantitatively fused to yield an integrated classifier for improved breast cancer diagnosis (as the modalities had been transformed into a common classifier probability space).\nFor each modality m \u2208 M, decision representation involves calculating a probability for each sample as belonging to the target class, denoted as h m (c 1 ) . . . , h m (c N ), 0 \u2264 h m \u2264 1, which may be done via a wide variety of classifier methods that exist [18] . While classifier-based approaches have seen extensive use in as an implicit form of data fusion [20] [21] [22] , one of the major disadvantages to this class of approaches is that all inter-source dependencies between modalities are lost, as each modality is being treated independently when computing the decision representation [4] .\nKernel representations Kernels are positive definite functions which transform the input data to an implicit dot product similarity space [16] , and in typical use, different kernels are used to represent each data modality [9] , with the advantage being the flexibility to tweak and fine-tune the kernel depending on the type of data being considered [23] .\nFor each modality m \u2208 M, the kernel representation is calculated as\nis the implicit pairwise embedding between the feature vectors F m (c i ) and F m (c j ) being calculated between every pair of points c i and c j , i, j, \u2208 {1, . . . , M}, for modality m, while . denotes the dot product operation.\nKernels and multi-kernel learning are one of the most powerful representation strategies which has found wide application in many different domains [14, [24] [25] [26] . However, in addition to being computationally expensive, there is a lack of transparency in relating kernel representations to the input multi-modal data, as it is not possible to create an interpretable visualization of the joint kernel space."}, {"section_title": "Low-dimensional representations (LDR)", "text": "Dimensionality reduction transforms input data to a low-dimensional space while preserving pairwise relationships between samples as best possible [17] . Typically, these pairwise relationships can be quantified via affinities or distances (as used by methods such as spectral embedding [27] ); however, it is also possible to utilize measures such as covariance as considered within canonical correlation analysis (CCA) [6, 28] or principal component analysis (PCA) [29] .\nLow-dimensional representations first require calculation of an N \u00d7 N confusion matrix W =[ w ij ] which attempts to capture pairwise relationships between objects c i and c j , i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , N}, N being the total number of samples. The corresponding low-dimensional representation y can be obtained via Eigenvalue decomposition as,\nwith the constraint y T Dy = 1, where D ii = j w ij . Given M modalities, W m is calculated for every m \u2208 M, each of which are then subjected to Eigenvalue decomposition to yield the low-dimensional representations y m . Low-dimensional representations have proven very popular for biomedical applications [30] [31] [32] [33] , especially as they enable informative visualizations (such as cluster plots) while ensuring computational tractability. Similar to kernel representations, depending on the LDR method used, one cannot always relate the lowdimensional representation to the original multi-modal data."}, {"section_title": "Generation of multiple representations (resampling)", "text": "The robustness and generalizability of representation techniques has been shown to improve when multiple representations of input data are generated and combined [5, [34] [35] [36] . For example, combining multiple classifier outputs into an \"ensemble\" classifier result has been demonstrated to yield better classification accuracy and generalizability than any individual classifier (both analytically and empirically) [34, 37] . This idea of calculating a number of representations is typically implemented by resampling a given dataset as demonstrated for classifier decisions [34] , projections [38] , and clusterings [39] .\nThus, rather than calculate a single representation per modality (i.e. generating M representations for M distinct modalities), n \"weak\" representations could be generated for each of M modalities, in total yielding nM representations of heterogeneous data modalities.\nThese may be generated in any of the following ways:\n(a) Perturbing the samples: Given a set of N samples in a set C, n bootstrapped sets C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C n \u2282 C (with replication) are created, which in turn will yield n different representations. Each of C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C n will consist of samples drawn at random from C, but with replacement, such that every sample c \u2208 C may be repeated multiple times across all of C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C n . This approach has been termed \"bootstrapped aggregation\" (or bagging [37] ). (b) Perturbing the parameters: All knowledge representation schemes (kernels, decisions, low-dimensional) are known to be sensitive to the choice of parameters used [40] [41] [42] . For example, a neighborhood parameter must be optimized for calculating an accurate low-dimensional representation via locally linear embedding [42, 43] or for constructing an accurate k -nearest neighbor classifier model [44] . A range of n possible parameter values can be used to generate n different \"weak\" representations [45] . (c) Perturbing the features: Similar to perturbing the samples, we can create n bootstrapped sets of features with replication. By varying the feature space input to the representation scheme, it is possible to generate n distinct \"weak\" representations [5] ."}, {"section_title": "Knowledge fusion", "text": "Given nM knowledge representations of M input heterogeneous modalities, the objective of knowledge fusion [9, 19, 34] is to combine multiple different representations into a single integrated result, denoted as R. Note that this fusion may involve combining the knowledge representations directly (i.e. combining kernels or low dimensional representations) or by preserving specific relationships associated with a representation technique (e.g. affinitybased or structure-based fusion). R will be subsequently utilized to build a comprehensive predictor for a given dataset [23, 46, 47] ."}, {"section_title": "Direct fusion", "text": "The most popular class of fusion strategies involve directly combining a set of knowledge representations either through simple concatenation or a weighted combination. Concatenation has most popularly been used for combining information extracted from multiple imaging modalities which are in spatial alignment [2, [48] [49] [50] i.e. intensity values from across multiple modalities are concatenated at every spatial location into a single feature vector.\nCalculating a final fused representation, R, based on a set of representations \u03c6 t , t \u2208 {1, . . . , nM}, can be written as, \u03c6 \u2208 {F, h, y, K},\nwhere \u03be may be a weighted or unweighted combination function (including concatenation). For example, R = \u2200t \u03b1 t [ h t ] corresponds to a weighted combination of decision representations (\u03b1 corresponds to the weight), as typically performed via Adaboost [51] . Similarly, the combination method adopted in [46] , where PCA-based representations of MRI (denoted as y MRI ) and MR spectrocopy (denoted by y MRS ) were concatenated into a unified predictor, can be rewritten as R =[ y MRI , y MRS ].\nCo-association matrix fusion This fusion approach involves integrating information being derived from the knowledge representations (i.e. properties of the representations are extracted and combined). This information is captured within what we term a co-association matrix, which is then decomposed to yield a single, unified representation. Typically Eigenvalue decomposition is utilized for the latter as it will yield a mathematically interpretable representation of an input square matrix.\nWe denote the co-association matrix as W t = \u03b4(\u03c6 t ), where \u03b4 is any function used to quantify the information within the representations \u03c6 t , t \u2208 {1, . . . , nM}, \u03c6 \u2208 {F, h, y, K}. These W t , t \u2208 {1, . . . , nM}, can then be combined as W = \u03be \u2200t [ W t ], where \u03be is a weighted or unweighted combination function. The final fused representation, R, may then be calculated via Eigenvalue decomposition as,\nsuch that R T D R = 1 and D ii = j W ij (similar to Eq. 1). Note that depending on the type of association being captured in W t and the type of representation \u03c6 t , some modifications to Eq. 3 may be required to obtain an appropriate R. For example, when considering kernel representations, Eq. 3 is modified to result in a multi-kernel Eigenvalue decomposition problem as follows,\nsubject to same conditions as for Eq. 3. Here,\n. . , nM}, is the combined kernel representation based on the combination function \u03be . Co-association matrix fusion can be seen to encompass a wide variety of previous work, including combining pairwise distances extracted from multiple low-dimensional representations [5, 45] , combining correlations extracted from multiple kernel representations [52] , or combining CCA-based representations via regularization [6] .\nStructural fusion Fusing the structure inherent to a knowledge representation [53, 54] is a perhaps lesser explored approach to data fusion. In one of its earliest applications, Higgs et al. [54] demonstrated that spectral embedding revealed implicit complementary manifold structure information in both image and microarray data, which could be useful in classification. The idea of fusing representations (derived from different data modalities) at a structural level has thus been primarily explored in the context of low-dimensional representations [53, 55, 56] .\nGiven a set of representations \u03c6 t , t \u2208 {1, . . . , nM}, \u03c6 \u2208 {F, h, y, K}, structural fusion first involves some form of \"representation alignment\" to ensure that all of \u03c6 t lie in the same co-ordinate frame-of-reference, i.e., calculating \u03c6 t = T(\u03c6 t ), where T denotes the transformation required to align the representation into a unified frame-of-reference. For example, point correspondences have been used to drive an alignment of low-dimensional representations to one another, in previous work [57] .\nOnce aligned, the final fused representation, R, could be obtained via,\nwhere \u03be denotes the combination function. In addition to applications demonstrated in learning [55] and retrieval [56] , structural fusion was utilized by Sparks et al. [35] to develop a parametrized shape model to combine information from across multiple aligned low-dimensional representations and thus distinguish between tumor sub-types via pathology data."}, {"section_title": "Weighted and unweighted data fusion", "text": "For each of the data fusion strategies above, the combination function \u03be enables either a weighted or an unweighted combination of the different data modalities. Calculation of weights requires quantification of the relative contributions of the individual data modalities, and ensures that the resulting unified representation accurately captures these contributions. Further, the unified representation that leverages weighting may be expected to demonstrate better class separability compared to a naive, unweighted combination (or concatenation) of these data modalities, as demonstrated in the context of decision and low-dimensional representations. However, learning optimal weights for the data modality typically requires some form of class information.\nIn previous work, decision representations have been extensively explored in terms of both unweighted [37] and weighted [51] combinations, while kernel representations have classically been considered within weighted multi-kernel formulations [16, 23] alone. By contrast, lowdimensional representations have typically been combined within an unweighted formulation [5, 45] . Label information has, however, been used to regularize lowdimensional representations [6, 7] (i.e. to minimize outliers and ensure a smooth continuum between different classes). Thus, for each of the knowledge fusion strategies above, it is possible to utilize either of the following:\n(a) Unweighted : Instead of using label information, a data-driven estimation is typically utilized.

Thus the parameters governing the creation of the integrated representation as well as for constructing the classifier were kept as consistent as possible for all 3 datasets.\nClassifier construction and evaluation The Random Forests (RF) classifier [37] was utilized to construct classifiers in all experiments. RF uses the majority voting rule for class assignment by combining decisions from an ensemble of bagged (bootstrapped aggregated) decision trees.\nThe primary motivation for using RF over other classifier schemes were, (1) ability to seamlessly integrate a large number of input variables, (2) robustness to noise in the data, and (3) relatively few parameters that require tuning [59] .\nThe RF implementation within MATLAB (TreeBagger) was utilized, where the number of bagged decision trees was set to 100, and each decision tree was generated through subsampling 66% of the input training feature space. A separate RF classifier was trained and evaluated on each of the 4 multimodal fusion methods (see Table 3 ) as well as on each the 2 individual data modalities (i.e. a total of 6 classifiers). Evaluation of the RF classifier in each case was done through ROC analysis, to yield an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a measure of performance for each method.\nClassifier robustness was determined via a randomized three-fold cross validation procedure, with segregation of data on a per-patient basis. Each run of three-fold cross validation involved randomly dividing a given dataset into three folds, following which 2 folds (i.e. 2/3 rd ) were used for training and the remaining fold (1/3 rd ) for testing. This is repeated until all the samples are classified within each dataset. This randomized cross-validation was then repeated a total of 25 times, and done separately for each of the 6 RF classifiers.\nStatistical testing Through the three-fold crossvalidation procedure, each classifier yielded a set of 25 AUC values (corresponding to each cycle of the procedure) and for each of 6 strategies being compared. Multiple comparison testing to determine statistically significant differences in AUC values for each dataset considered (i.e. within the results for each of S 1 , S 2 , S 3 ) was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) [60] .

Both kernel-based methods (DFS-KC) and embedding-based methods (DFS-ES) appear somewhat robust to this effect, however DFS-EC (embedding representation, co-association fusion) appears to have been affected by this issue. One possible factor contributing to the poor performance of DFS-EC may be the relatively low dimensionality of the MRS feature space (6 dimensions), which would prevent the resampling step of DFS-EC from being effective. These conclusions are supported by the qualitative results in Fig. 3 , which depicts representative classification results for detecting the presence of CaP on a voxel-wise basis in vivo via different strategies. These results were obtained by visualizing the voxel-wise RF classifier result for this section as a heatmap, where red corresponds to a higher likelihood of CaP presence. Classifying the MRS (Fig. 3b) and T2w (Fig. 3c ) data modalities individually yields results that appear to detect CaP with widely varying accuracy (note poor overlap of red region with ground truth, depicted via a red outline). By contrast, multimodal data fusion via DFS-KC appears to show both optimal sensitivity and specificity, as much of the red in the heat map is located within the ground truth cancer region."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our preliminary findings from this work were as follows,\n\u2022 In terms of the knowledge representation module, a kernel-based method (DFS-KC) demonstrated the best classifier performance consistently across all 3 applications, implying that kernels may offer distinct advantages for multimodal data representation. This performance may have been further enhanced by the fact that DFS-KC utilized differential weighting for individual data modalities based on their contributions, in addition to using semi-supervised learning. However, we must note that this method was also amongst the most computationally expensive in terms of memory usage.\n\u2022 For the knowledge fusion module, co-association matrix fusion yielded consistently high classifier performance; albeit when combined with kernels (as done by DFS-KC) rather than when combined with embeddings (reflected by the poor performance of DFS-EC). However, further exploration of how each representation strategy interplays with each fusion strategy is required to understand this aspect better, which was out of the scope of the current work.\n\u2022 One of our multimodal data fusion methods (DFS-EC) demonstrated consistently poor classifier performance across all 3 applications. While this method has demonstrated significant success in previous work [5] , its poor performance in the current work could be attributed to (a) inability to handle sparse feature spaces (as seen in Dataset S 3 ), and (b) use of a linear embedding method (PCA) which is likely unable to handle representation of potentially non-linear biomedical data [30] .\n\u2022 Our experimental datasets demonstrated wide variability in terms of the classifier performance associated with the individual data modalities, which had significant bearing on the performance of different multimodal data fusion methods. For example, in dataset S 1 where both modalities showed a relatively high classifier AUC individually, a simple combination of decision representations offered the highest performance amongst the integrated representations (DFS-DD). However, in dataset S 2 where both modalities showed relatively poor discriminability individually, most of the data fusion methods failed to create accurate, discriminatory representations. this mismatch, we found that kernel-based approaches performed better in the absence of feature selection (i.e. when provided the entire feature space). By contrast, with feature selection applied, LDR-based approaches improved in performance, likely because they could better identify a discriminatory projection for the data. \u2022 Dataset S 3 was an example of a Small-P -Big-N (number of samples N >> number of features P ) problem, wherein very sparse feature space caused embedding-based methods (DFS-EC, DFS-ES) to throw a number of errors during our experiments. The issue of very few number of input dimensions was further exacerbated by having a large number of samples causing these methods to become more computationally expensive than when P >> N.\n\u2022 While one would expect multimodal data fusion strategies to always perform better than at least the weaker modality under consideration, our experimental results suggest otherwise. When suboptimal representation or fusion strategies are utilized e.g. using PCA within DFS-EC for representation, or simple structural fusion within DFS-EC, such data fusion methods tend to perform comparably or worse than the individual modalities. Conversely, when a method leverages different modules in a complementary manner (e.g. kernels, weighting, and semi-supervised learning in DFS-KC), we can construct a truly robust, accurate multimodal data fusion predictor.\nThe most significant finding of our methodological review and experimental results was the variety of factors affect the process of DR-based data fusion. For example, when combining fusion and representation strategies, one should consider how noisy the individual modalities are or how many samples are available for training the predictive model. Thus, while our initial results indicate that kernel-based methods (DFS-KC) yield highly discriminatory predictive models within all 3 biomedical datasets (each of which comprised different heterogenous modalities), a more wide-ranging evaluation is required to ratify this finding. Our current findings do echo previous work demonstrating the high performance offered by kernel-based representations [14, [24] [25] [26] .\nWe also acknowledge several additional limitations exist in our study. While we have attempted to diversify in terms of our choice of datasets and methods evaluated in the current study, we did not attempt a comprehensive evaluation of all possible imaging and non-imaging fusion methods. We have instead opted to systematically compare and relate a few representative DR-based multi-modal data fusion strategies in the context of different clinical applications, to provide an overview of the interplay between different individual modules that can comprise a data fusion method. For example our experiments did not explicitly include an examplar of CCA-based methods [61] . Methods we did implement and compare involved directly projecting data either linearly or non-linearly into a reduced embedding space. As CCA based methods optimize for correlations between modalities when projecting them, they did not fit within the strict definition we utilized in this study. Further, none of the datasets considered in this work comprise more than 2 modalities, nor did we examine multi-class or multi-task learning problems. However, our methodological description (as well as the methods we compared in this work), have been described to be easily extensible to multiple data modalities or labels.\nRecently, several papers have examined the use of imputation between heterogeneous data modalities i.e. predicting \"missing\" values on one modality based on available values on a complementary data modality [62] [63] [64] . We have instead examined how to combine the information from across heterogeneous modalities to build predictive models. Our framework also specifically focuses on the steps associated with data fusion, rather than the entire pipeline for building predictive models. For example, while we did perform additional experiments regarding the effect of feature selection (not shown), we did not evaluate this in more detail due to the complexity it would add to our experimental design. The effect on the data fusion method of varying the input feature space or the number of samples required for training are also avenues for future work."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have presented common concepts, methodological choices, and a unifying workflow to address the major challenges in quantitative, heterogeneous multi-modal data integration. In addition to a wide variety of choices for representation and fusion techniques, we have acknowledged the contribution of resampling or weighting approaches; all of which enable the construction of a variety of different data integration approaches which can be tuned for a particular application, dataset, or domain. In addition to providing an overview of different modules, we experimentally implemented and compared 4 representative data fusion methods in the context of 3 clinically significant applications: (a) integrating T2w MRI with spectroscopy for prostate cancer (CaP) diagnosis in vivo, (b) integrating quantitative histomorphometric features with protein expression features (obtained via mass spectrometry) for predicting 5 year biochemical recurrence in CaP patients following radical prostatectomy, and (c) integrating T1w MR imaging with plasma proteomics to discriminate between patients with and without Alzheimers' Disease.\nOur preliminary results indicate that kernel-based representations are highly effective for heterogeneous data fusion problems such as those considered in this work, as seen by the fact that a weighted multi-kernel data fusion method yielded the highest area under the ROC curve of over 0.8 in all three applications considered. Our results also suggest that in situations where the individual modalities demonstrate relatively poor discriminability, many of the data fusion methods may not yield accurate, discriminatory representations either. This implies that when developing such multimodal data fusion schemes, one must account for how noisy or sparse individual modality feature spaces are, as this could significantly affect embedding-based representations. Optimally weighting individual modalities or samples as implemented in the most successful data fusion strategy also appear to have a significant effect on the discriminability of the final integrated representation.\nWith the increasing relevance of fused diagnostics in personalized healthcare, it is expected that such heterogeneous fusion methods will play an important role in developing more comprehensive predictors for disease diagnosis and outcome.
