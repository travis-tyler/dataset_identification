[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "There is a great interest in developing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). CSF alpha synuclein (\u03b1-syn) species, namely total and oligomeric \u03b1-syn (t-\u03b1-syn and o-\u03b1-syn), have shown to be of help for PD diagnosis. Preliminary evidences show that the combination of CSF t-\u03b1-syn and classical Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers-\u03b2-amyloid 1-42 (A\u03b2 42 ), total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau)-differentiate PD patients from controls, and that reduced levels of A\u03b2 42 represent a predictive factor for development of cognitive deterioration in PD. In this prospective study carried out in 44 PD patients and 25 neurological controls we wanted to verify whether the combination of CSF \u03b1-synuclein species-t-\u03b1-syn and o-\u03b1-syn-and classical AD biomarkers may help in differentiating PD from neurological controls, and if these biomarkers may predict cognitive decline. The median of follow-up duration was 3 years (range: 2-6 years). Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used for monitoring cognitive changes along time, being administered once a year. Oligo/total \u03b1-syn ratio (o/t-\u03b1-syn ratio) confirmed its diagnostic value, significantly contributing to the discrimination of PD from neurological controls. A greater diagnostic accuracy was reached when combining o/t-\u03b1-syn and A\u03b2 42 /tau ratios (Sens = 0.70, Spec = 0.84, AUC = 0.82; PPV = 0.89, NPV = 0.62, LR+ = 4.40, DOR = 12.52). Low CSF A\u03b2 42 level was associated with a higher rate of MMSE and MoCA decline, confirming its role as independent predictive factor for cognitive decline in PD. None of the other biomarkers assessed (t-tau, p-tau, t-\u03b1-syn and o-\u03b1-syn) showed to have prognostic value. We conclude that combination of CSF o/t-\u03b1-syn and A\u03b2 42 /tau ratios improve the diagnostic accuracy of PD. PD patients showing low CSF A\u03b2 42 levels at baseline are more prone to develop cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder evolving, in a substantial proportion of patients, to dementia. Although it is defined as a typical movement disorder and its diagnosis is mainly based on motor-related clinical criteria, other functional domains are also involved. Accordingly, post-mortem findings of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) pathology-the histopathologic hallmark of PD-show that the involvement of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve and the olfactory bulb takes place much earlier before midbrain involvement (Braak et al., 2003) .\nPD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder in which many different pathophysiological processes take place, such as protein aggregation, oxidative damage and lysosomal dysfunction (Parnetti et al., 2013) . Concomitant pathologies (i.e., Alzheimer and Lewy bodies pathologies) resulting from the mutual interaction between A\u03b2 42 , tau and \u03b1-syn during the course of the disease have major role in the neuropathological processes underlying dementia in PD (Tsigelny et al., 2008; Ciaccioli et al., 2013) . In PD the spread of fibrillar \u03b1-syn pathology from the brainstem to limbic and neocortical structures, and the cortical deposition of \u03b2-amyloid plaques, represent major events (Compta et al., 2011; Irwin et al., 2012) . Co-occurrence of tau and \u03b1-syn pathology has been found in neurons of brains affected by tauopathies and synucleinopathies, including PD (Vekrellis et al., 2011) . Also, \u03b1-syn causes aggregation and polymerization of tau, which then induces the formation of intracellular amyloid-tau inclusions (Waxman and Giasson, 2011) .\nSince molecular changes in the brain are reflected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition, the CSF represents an ideal source for biomarkers of different pathophysiological processes characterizing the early phases of the disease, when the clinical diagnosis is more challenging. For example, A\u03b2 42 , total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are state markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as they reliably reflect AD pathology also in predementia phases. This knowledge has been translated into operational diagnostic criteria (Dubois et al., 2010) . Analogously, there is great interest for improving early diagnosis in PD, hopefully in the pre-motor phases, as well as for detecting PD patients at risk of dementia.\nCurrently, detection of reliable CSF biomarkers for PD is under intensive investigation. Several recent studies have explored the potential use of CSF total \u03b1-syn (t-\u03b1-syn) as a putative PD biomarker. A clear trend of lower CSF t-\u03b1-syn levels in PD and other synucleinopathies has been consistently reported (Tokuda et al., 2006; Noguchi-Shinohara et al., 2009; Spies et al., 2009; Hong et al., 2010; Mollenhauer et al., 2011; Parnetti et al., 2011; Aerts et al., 2012; Tateno et al., 2012) , although with a large overlap between the PD and control groups (Noguchi-Shinohara et al., 2009; Spies et al., 2011) . Therefore, the measurement of CSF t-\u03b1-syn doesn't seem to have enough specificity to correctly discriminate patients with synucleinopathies from normal individuals or other neurodegenerative diseases. The measurement in CSF of other \u03b1-syn species, namely soluble oligomers (o-\u03b1-syn) has improved the discrimination between PD and other diseases. O-\u03b1-syn levels are elevated in brain homogenates in PD and dementia with Lewy bodies compared with normal brains (Paleologou et al., 2009 ) suggesting a role for o-\u03b1-syn in PD pathogenesis. CSF o-\u03b1-syn levels and o/t-\u03b1-syn ratio have been consistently found to be significantly higher in PD patients as compared to other neurological disorders, with good sensitivity and specificity, as confirmed in independent reports (Tokuda et al., 2010; Park et al., 2011; Sierks et al., 2011; Parnetti et al., 2014) . The high risk of cognitive impairment in PD also calls for biomarkers able to predict dementia onset. Many studies have focused on classical AD CSF biomarkers (Parnetti et al., 2008; Compta et al., 2009; Alves et al., 2010; Montine et al., 2010; Siderowf et al., 2010; Leverenz et al., 2011) and most of them have identified the reduction of CSF A\u03b2 42 levels as a prognostic factor for cognitive impairment in PD. Data on the possible relationship between \u03b1-syn species and the risk of dementia in PD are still scanty.\nIn this study we evaluated both the diagnostic accuracy and the capability in predicting cognitive decline of CSF AD biomarkers (A\u03b2 42 , t-tau, p-tau and A\u03b2 42 /t-tau ratio) and \u03b1-syn species (t-\u03b1-syn, o-\u03b1-syn and o/t-\u03b1-syn ratio) in PD patients and neurological controls with a median follow up duration of 3 years."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PATIENTS", "text": "The subjects included in this study (44 PD, 25 neurological controls) were consecutively recruited between 2007 and 2011 and followed-up. They underwent a baseline clinical examination by experienced neurologists, detailed neuropsychological testing, blood chemistry, neuroimaging (computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging), and lumbar puncture. CSF was collected according to the hospital standard protocol and with the local ethical committee approval, after informed written consent was given by the patient. All PD patients fulfilled the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria. All of them were treated with L-DOPA and the great majority (39 out of 44) were also taking DA-agonists. PD patients had good control of motor symptoms (mean UPRDS-III 25.39 \u00b1 12.97), and were functionally independent or minimally dependent (Hoehn and Yahr, 1-2.5). Disease duration was calculated from the onset of the first motor symptoms to the time of lumbar puncture. As a control group, 25 cognitively normal age-matched subjects who underwent lumbar puncture as a part of diagnostic work up for other neurological conditions (OND) were recruited to our study. The OND group included: primary headache (n = 15), postural instability (n = 3), seizures (n = 2) and polyneuropathy (n = 5). Follow-up visits included clinical examination and neuropsychological testing carried out yearly by means of MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) , a popular screening tool mostly measuring cortical functions with special attention to memory, and MoCA (Gill et al., 2008) , another screening tool assessing executive functions."}, {"section_title": "CSF SAMPLING", "text": "Lumbar puncture was performed between 8:00 and 10:00 A.M., after an overnight fast.

Analogously to previous observation (Balducci et al., 2007) , a significant decrease of t-\u03b1-syn (p = 0.015) and an increase of o-\u03b1-syn levels (p = 0.041) were found in PD group ( Table 2) .

The disease's natural history includes a first asymptomatic stage, followed by a long pre-motor phase; finally, when the classical motor symptoms appear, the majority of nigral dopaminergic neurons are already affected by degeneration. The classical diagnostic criteria for PD mostly rely on motor symptoms, making the formulation of an early diagnosis very challenging.

It would be very important to have the possibility to individuate those patients at risk to develop this devastating complication to initiate possible protective pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Thus, the availability of objective measures such as reliable \"biomarkers,\" indicators of biological/pathogenetic processes, will be of great importance both for diagnostic accuracy and prognostic evaluation. In this context, CSF analysis might be of great importance since CSF dynamically reflects the pathophysiological processes taking place in the brain. At present, CSF biomarkers are a routine analysis for early diagnosis of AD. Accordingly, increasing interest is focused on CSF biomarkers in PD, with major expectations on \u03b1-syn species and other misfolding proteins, namely \u03b2-amyloid and tau. With respect to diagnostic performance, data available so far indicate that there is not a unique ideal CSF biomarker, rather the combination of molecules related to different pathophysiological pathways involved in PD may represents a good strategy for obtaining a more accurate diagnosis (Parnetti et al., 2014) . Concerning the prediction of cognitive decline in PD, the most consistent role as predictive factor is played by low CSF A\u03b2 42 levels (Parnetti et al., 2008; Alves et al., 2010; Siderowf et al., 2010; Leverenz et al., 2011) although also tau species have been postulated to represent prognostic factors (Zhang et al., 2013) . Interestingly, a recent investigation (Kang et al., 2013) carried out in drug-na\u00efve patients with early PD, showed slightly lower CSF levels of both t-tau and t-\u03b1-syn in PD compared to healthy controls. This finding offered the Authors the opportunity to speculate that the interaction between tau proteins and \u03b1-syn may limit the release of tau proteins into CSF.\nIn this investigation we assessed both the diagnostic accuracy and the performance in predicting cognitive decline of the combination of CSF AD biomarkers (A\u03b2 42 , t-tau, p-tau, and A\u03b2 42 /t-tau ratio) and \u03b1-syn species (t-\u03b1-syn, o-\u03b1-syn, and o/t-\u03b1-syn ratio) in a cohort of PD patients and neurological controls followed up for 2-6 years (median follow-up duration: 3 years).\nWith respect to the diagnostic performance of the biomarkers considered, none of them demonstrated acceptable values in terms of sensitivity and specificity when taken separately. A\u03b2 42 /ttau and o/t-\u03b1-syn ratios showed good sensitivity (0.82) but low specificity (0.56 and 0.64, respectively). While the usefulness of o/t-\u03b1-syn ratio in discriminating PD and controls has already been reported in recent investigations (Tokuda et al., 2010; Park et al., 2011; Sierks et al., 2011; Parnetti et al., 2014) , the A\u03b2 42 /ttau ratio deserves some comments. Interestingly, in the PD group, we found slightly higher values of A\u03b2 42 together with lower values of t-tau as compared to OND group. As a consequence, the mean value of A\u03b2 42 /t-tau ratio was significantly higher in PD patients with respect to the OND group. This may be due to the fact that our control group was not including healthy subjects, being composed by patients with other neurological diseases. Interestingly, reduced CSF A\u03b2 42 levels at baseline represented a predictive factor for cognitive decline only in the PD group. In fact, only in PD patients lower CSF A\u03b2 42 levels were correlated to a more marked decrease in MMSE and MoCA scores at followup. The finding of reduced CSF A\u03b2 42 levels in PD patients is quite controversial, being reported in some (Sj\u00f6gren et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2008; Alves et al., 2010) but not in other papers (P\u00f8ikrylov\u00e1 Vranov\u00e1, 2010; Siderowf et al., 2010; Leverenz et al., 2011) . A clear positive association was also observed between t-tau and t-\u03b1-syn in PD group. These findings are consistent with the observation of Kang and coworkers, describing the occurrence of lower CSF levels of t-tau and t-\u03b1-syn in PD patients. A reasonable explanation may be the mutual interaction of the two molecules, leading to a reduced release of tau in CSF. The discriminative power between PD and OND significantly improved when considering both o/t-\u03b1-syn ratio and A\u03b2 42 /t-tau ratio, as shown by the logistic regression analysis, and further illustrated in Figure 2 . This confirms that the combination of several biomarkers is more helpful than single biomarkers for adding diagnostic accuracy of PD.\nAbout the predictive value of CSF biomarkers for cognitive decline in PD, our study confirmed the specific role of low CSF levels of A\u03b2 42 in this pathological condition; no other biomarker was significantly associated to this outcome measure. For assessing cognitive function along time, we used both MMSE and MoCA (Gill et al., 2008) . Both neuropsychological instruments showed to be related to CSF A\u03b2 42 levels, i.e., lower the CSF A\u03b2 42 levels, greater the decrease in MMSE and MoCA scores. The same holds true for A\u03b2 42 /t-tau ratio with respect to MMSE. Multivariate analysis (adjusting for follow-up time and baseline measurements) confirmed that low CSF A\u03b2 42 levels are independent predictor of cognitive decline in PD, either measured by MMSE or MOCA.\nIn conclusion, this study further contributes to the evidence of the usefulness of CSF biomarkers for PD diagnosis and prognosis. Major points are the need to combine several CSF biomarkers for improving the diagnostic accuracy, and the confirmed role of low CSF A\u03b2 42 levels as independent predictor of cognitive decline in PD. Longitudinal studies measuring biomarkers and clinical parameters over several years represent a major contribution in this field. Analogously to the longitudinal AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, http://adni-info.org/) in AD, the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, http:// ppmi-ifo.org/) will give important knowledge in the field of PD, thanks to the measurement of several CSF, blood, and imaging biomarkers in early de novo PD followed up for several years."}]
