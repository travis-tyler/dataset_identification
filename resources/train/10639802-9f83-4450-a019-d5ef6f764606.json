Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians, as a group, earned about 2,200 S&E doctorates from U.S. universities in 2003, about 9% of all S&E doctorates (NSF 2004). Blacks earned 835, Hispanics earned 1,336, and American Indians/Alaska Natives earned 75 S&E doctorates in 2003. Asians earned 6,632 S&E doctorates in 2003, about 26% of all S&E doctorates. Of these, 1,030 were awarded to U.S. citizens and 525 to permanent visa holders. 1 In this report, the racial/ethnic categories are mutually exclusive. The non-Hispanic white, black, Asian and American Indian/Alaska Native categories are referred to here as white, black, Asian, and American Indian/Alaska Native, respectively. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders and respondents choosing multiple races (excluding those selecting an Hispanic ethnicity) are included in the \"other\" race/ethnicity category. The faculty data included in this report refer only to U.S. faculty with doctoral degrees in science, engineering, or health fields from U.S. institutions. See Data Notes at the end of this InfoBrief. 2 Although the number of S&E doctorates awarded to Asians is much larger than the numbers awarded to blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians, most (85%) are to non-U.S. citizens on permanent resident or temporary visas. Among employed S&E doctorate holders in 2003, higher percentages of blacks (62%) and Hispanics (59%) than of all other racial/ethnic groups (37-49%) were employed in education in 2003 in a variety of settings and appointments. About 49% of white and 37% of Asian S&E doctorate holders in the United States were employed in education (table 1). Differences in field of doctorate account for some of the differences in employment by sector. Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native doctorate holders are more likely than white and Asian doctorate holders to have doctorates in social and behavioral sciences, fields in which academic employment is prevalent (NSF 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Minority Faculty with S&E Doctorates", "text": "Of the approximately 280,000 S&E doctorates employed 3 in educational institutions in 2003, 214,000 were faculty in universities and colleges. Of these, 12% were Asian, 4% black, 3% Hispanic, and less than 1% American Indian/Alaska Native (table 2). Because the fraction of science and engineering doctorates awarded to minorities has increased over time, minorities are a higher percentage of faculty with recent S&E doctorates than they are of all faculty with S&E doctorates. Among faculty who received S&E doctorates in 2000 or later, 16% were Asian, 7% were black, 4% were Hispanic, and less than 1% were American Indian/ Alaska Native."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "Differences in years since doctorate are likely to account for some of the differences by race/ethnicity in rank and tenure. Smaller percentages of black, Hispanic, and Asian doctoral faculty with S&E doctorates than of white and American Indian/Alaska Native such faculty are full professors and larger percentages are assistant professors. Similarly, smaller percentages of blacks, Hispanics, and Asians than of whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives are tenured. As is the case with field of doctorate, faculty with S&E doctorates differ by race/ethnicity in field of employment. A higher percentage of black faculty than of all other faculty with S&E doctorates are employed as non-S&E faculty (figure 1). A lower percentage of Asian than of all other faculty with S&E doctorates are employed as social science faculty and a higher percentage are computer science, mathematics, or engineering faculty. Minority faculty with S&E doctorates also differ in citizenship status and sex. About one-third each of black and Hispanic, 90% of Asian, 10% of white, and 2% of American Indian/Alaska Native S&E doctoral faculty members are non-U.S. born, most of them naturalized citizens (table 2). Higher percentages of black and Hispanic faculty with S&E doctorates are female than is the case for other racial/ethnic groups."}, {"section_title": "From What Types of Schools Did They Earn Their Doctorates?", "text": "Most (77%) faculty with S&E doctorates employed in U.S. academic institutions earned their doctorates at Research I institutions. 4 Lower percentages of black, Hispanic, and American Indian faculty (69%, 72%, and 68%, respectively) than of white or Asian faculty (77% each) earned their doctorates at Research I institutions and higher percentages earned them at Research II or other types of doctorate-granting institutions (table 3). In particular, a higher percentage of black faculty than of all other groups earned their doctorates at Doctorategranting I institutions. The majority of the top 20 (including ties) institutions awarding S&E doctoral degrees to blacks, to Hispanics and to American Indians during 1999-2003 were Research I institutions. About 9% of blacks earned their S&E doctorate at historically black colleges and universities (HBCU). Howard University was the leading S&E doctorate-origin institution of blacks, followed by the University of Michigan and the University of Maryland. For Hispanics, Texas A&M was the leading doctorate-origin institution, followed by the  Among faculty who received their S&E doctorates from Research I institutions, 35% of black faculty were employed in Research I institutions compared with 40-47% of faculty of most other racial/ethnic groups. A higher percentage of black faculty (28%) than of most other racial/ethnic groups (21% or less) were employed in comprehensive institutions. The relative prevalence of black faculty in comprehensive institutions is at least partly attributable to their prevalence in HBCUs (figure 2), most of which are comprehensive institutions. Although HBCUs are the employers of only 2% of all faculty with S&E doctorates, they are the employers of 28% of black doctoral S&E faculty."}, {"section_title": "Data Notes", "text": "This InfoBrief draws upon the National Science Foundation's 2003 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) to describe the characteristics of minority faculty with science, engineering, or health doctorates. The SDR provides data on people who have earned S&E or S&E-related doctorates from U.S. institutions and who are employed in the United States. Thus, the faculty data included in this report refer only to U.S. faculty with doctoral degrees from U.S. institutions. The term faculty in this report refers to full, associate, and assistant professors and instructors and includes adjunct faculty. The Carnegie classification used in this InfoBrief is the 1994 version of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching's classification of academic institutions. The 1994 classification system, although the data used for classification are from the early 1990s, better describes the different institutional characteristics for S&E than the subsequent 2000 version, which uses more aggregate categories. The 2005 version had not been released when this InfoBrief was written.  "}]
