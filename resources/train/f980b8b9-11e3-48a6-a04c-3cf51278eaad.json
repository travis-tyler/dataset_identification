The development of analytical methods for the joint analysis of neuroimaging phenotypes and genetic data is an important area of statistical research with many challenges. Recent reviews are provided in Liu and Calhoun (2014) and also in Nathoo et al. (2018) .\nThe subfield of connectome genetics involves the investigation of relationships between genetics and connectivity in the brain (Thompson et al., 2013) . In this paper we examine the relationship between genetics and effective brain connectivity as measured by resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) within regions of the default mode network (DMN), with an emphasis on the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nAD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and progressive dementia and is thought to be caused by aberrant connections between cerebral regions involved in cognitive functioning (Li et al., 2013) . The DMN consists of a set of brain regions that tend to be active in resting-state, when a subject is mind wandering with no intended task. In this state DMN regions will exhibit low frequency signals that tend to couple together. It is a key member of a number of resting-state networks which have been studied over the last 10 years and is believed to be involved in the function of consciousness.\nPrevious literature focussing on AD has found alterations to both effective and functional resting-state connectivity in the DMN (see e.g., Wu et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2018) . Here, effective connectivity refers to the directed influence of one brain region on others (Friston 1994) while functional connectivity refers simply to the correlation between measured time series over different locations. For example, Zhong et al. (2014) conduct an rs-fMRI study and demonstrate changes in effective connectivity in the DMN for subjects with AD, while Dipasquale et al. (2015) apply high-dimensional independent component analysis (ICA) to an rs-fMRI study and demonstrate changes in functional connectivity in subjects with AD.\nIn general, the resting-state paradigm in neuroimaging is considered useful for investigating the functional or effective connectivity of the brain in order to determine if it is altered in neurological disorders. Resting-state fMRI data are collected with the goal of evaluating the interaction between different areas of the brain, and one of our primary goals is to understand the relationship between this neuronal interaction in the DMN and genetic variables that are related to AD. Within this paradigm we consider effective connectivity between four regions of the brain, known to be involved in the DMN, namely, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the left and right intraparietal cortex (LIPC and RIPC) with Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) locations depicted in Figure 1 .\nTo date, a great deal of work in imaging genetics has focussed on the relationship between brain structure and genetics (see e.g., Stein et al., 2010; Hibar et al., 2011; Ge et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2014; Greenlaw et al., 2017; Szefer et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2017) . Studies examining the relationship between brain connectivity and genetics have been considered to a lesser extent. Our analyses involve estimating effective connectivity networks from rs-fMRI data using Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM; Li et al., 2011; Friston et al., 2003; Friston et al., 2014; Razi et al., 2015; Friston et al., 2017) , a state-space framework for inferring interaction between hidden neuronal states. The DCM framework leads to estimated directed networks and these networks are used as a neuroimaging phenotype in our genetic analyses.\nGiven a set of R brain regions, DCM in the case of fMRI models the haemodynamic response over these regions through a nonlinear state-space formulation with a model allowing for interaction between regions and with model parameters that characterize effective connectivity and, when relevant, how this connectivity is modulated by experimental inputs.\nIn the case of resting-state fMRI with no experimental inputs the model can expressed as (see, e.g., Razi et al., 2017) \u1e8b (t) = Ax(t) + v(t) y(t) = h(x(t), \u03b8) + e(t) where x(t) = (x 1 (t), . . . , x R (t)) are latent variables used to represent the states of neuronal populations at some time t and\u1e8b(t) is a time derivative defining a differential equation approximating neuronal dynamics, with the R\u00d7R matrix A approximating effective connectivity to first-order; h(x(t), \u03b8) is a nonlinear mapping from neuronal states to the haemodynamic response also depending on parameters \u03b8 (see, e.g., Friston, 2007) ; y(t) = (y 1 (t), . . . , y R (t)) with y j (t) being a summary of the response obtained from all voxels within region j; v(t) and e(t) represent state and measurement noise respectively.\nFor resting-state fMRI the DCM model can be fit in the time-domain using Bayesian filtering based on a mean-field variational Bayes approximation (see, e.g., Li et al., 2011) which involves inference on both model parameters and latent states. Alternatively, the model can be fit in the spectral domain using an approach known as spectral DCM (Friston et al., 2014) . The latter approach involves relating the theoretical cross spectra associated with the dynamic model to the sample cross spectra in order to estimate parameters. More specifically, Friston et al. (2014) assume a parameterized power law form for the spectral densities of the noise terms in the state-space model and then express the empirical cross spectra as the sum of the theoretical cross spectra and measurement error. This formulation then yields a likelihood for the observed cross spectra depending on the time-invariant parameters but not depending on the latent variables x(t). The likelihood is then combined with a prior distribution for model parameters and an approximation to the associated posterior distribution for these parameters is obtained using variational Bayes. Interestingly, Razi et al. (2015) report simulation results that demonstrate estimators obtained from spectral DCM having higher accuracy (in the sense of mean-squared error) than those obtained from stochastic DCM. In addition, the former has a higher computational efficiency since estimation of the latent states is not required.\nTo our knowledge, ours is the very first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to use a DCM-based neuroimaging phenotype, and this is an innovative aspect of our analysis. Our use of this measure as a phenotype is justified by the work of Xu et al. (2017) who examine effective connectivity within the DMN using DCM and structural equation modelling in a twin study based on rs-fMRI. These authors estimate the heritability of DMN effective connectivity to be 0.54. Their study provides evidence that there are genes involved in DMN effective connectivity. This analysis then paves the way for our study which aims at identifying the genetic signals that influence DMN effective connectivity. We do this within the context of disease by first using a GWAS to determine a priority set of SNPs that are most relevant to MCI and AD. Previous work in Glahn et al. (2010) use an extended pedigree design and rs-fMRI to examine genetic influence on functional connectivity within the DMN.\nTheir study estimates the heritability of DMN functional connectivity to be 0.424 \u00b1 0.17 and it also suggests that the genetic factors that influence DMN functional connectivity and the genetic factors that influence gray matter density in these regions seem to be distinct.\nWe conduct global tests of association between this multivariate phenotype and genetic variables using the Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery, 1995) . While the Bayes factor is the gold standard for Bayesian hypothesis testing and it has seen application in statistical genetics (see e.g., Marchini et al., 2007) , its use in imaging genetics has surprisingly not been previously considered, as far as we are aware. Thus this first use of the Bayes factor in imaging genetics is another innovative and original aspect of our analysis. in our studies: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the left and right intraparietal cortex (LIPC and RIPC) with MNI coordinates mPFC (3, 54, -2), the PCC (0, -52, 26), LIPC (-50, -63, 32) and RIPC (48, 35) ."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Our proposed pipeline for preprocessing and analyzing the data is depicted in Figure   2 . While it has been developed with our studies in mind, the pipeline can be applied more generally and is in and of itself a novel contribution of our work. In addition to genetic data preprocessing and neuroimaging data preprocessing and network estimation, the pipeline involves four studies. The first study examines the neuroimaging data in an effort to determine how the estimated effective connectivity networks vary by disease group.\nThe second study examines the genetic data in order to determine which SNPs are most relevant to disease and to obtain a priority set of SNPs potentially related to disease. The third study relates the priority set of disease related SNPs found in the second study to effective brain connectivity networks in order to determine which SNPs have the highest evidence of being related to connectivity and what specific connections might be modulated by genetics. Finally, the fourth study examines how well disease progression can be predicted using the combination of genetic data and brain connectivity data through a set of classifiers.\nThe overall goal of the four studies is to further our understanding of the relationship between information flow within the DMN and genetics within the context of disease, and to detect genetic signals exhibiting evidence of a relationship with brain connectivity and/or disease. Stingo et al. (2013) focus on relating brain connectivity to genetics and develop a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model for studies involving fMRI data. The mixture components of the proposed model correspond to the classification of the study subjects into subgroups, and the allocation of subjects to these mixture components is linked to genetic covariates with regression parameters assigned spike-and-slab priors. There are four key distinctions between our work and that of Stingo et al. (2013) . First, rather than the development of a single novel hierarchical model our emphasis is on the development of a pipeline that can be applied to understand the relationship between brain connectivity and genetics within the context of disease. Second, our analysis considers effective connectivity as opposed to functional connectivity in order to give a detailed picture of information flow within the brain and how this flow might be mediated by genetics. This is important as studies of effective connectivity in Alzheimer's disease are relatively few compared with studies of functional connectivity. This relates to the third distinction, namely, that the focus of our study is on Alzheimer's disease as opposed to Schizophrenia. Fourth, our analysis involves the inclusion of a larger number of genetic variables; we consider 1,220,955 SNPs while Stingo et al. (2013) evaluate associations with 81 SNPs. It is worth clarifying again that our work involves the development of a pipeline and specific studies with analyses involving several innovations that are new to imaging genetics, while Stingo et al. (2013) have a primary focus on new methodology and the development of a novel Bayesian mixture model. Our study focuses on the relationship between genetics, more specifically, SNPs that are found related to AD and MCI, and effective brain connectivity in the DMN, a key restingstate network. The goal is to simultaneously investigate potential genetic biomarkers for early prediction of AD and MCI while trying to understand the mechanism by which these potential biomarkers impact effective brain connectivity within the DMN. The four regions of interest considered in our work, depicted in Figure 1 , are a subset of the regions that constitute the DMN.\nThese regions are also a subset of the DMN regions considered in the rs-fMRI study of Wu et al., (2011) , which demonstrated altered DMN functional and effective connectivity in AD, and they are the same four DMN regions considered in the rs-fMRI study of Sharaev et al. (2016) , which investigated internal DMN relationships.\nUsing rs-fMRI, genetic and demographic data from 112 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, the primary questions/objectives that we wish to address are as follows: (1) we aim to investigate how effective brain connectivity in the DMN differs when comparing cognitively normal (CN) subjects, subjects with MCI, and subjects with AD; (2) beginning with a set of 1,220,955 SNPs from non-sex chromosomes, we wish to obtain a smaller set of priority SNPs that are potentially related to AD; (3) we examine how effective brain connectivity in the DMN depends on the priority SNPs that we find potentially related to AD in the second study; (4) we investigate the usefulness of genetic data and estimated effective brain connectivity networks for predicting disease progression towards AD. A key issue in the latter case is determining if the combination of genetic and brain connectivity data is more useful for predicting disease progression than either genetic data or brain connectivity data alone.\nThe remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the neuroimaging and genetic data, summarize sample characteristics, the required preprocessing steps, and the construction of effective brain connectivity networks using DCM in more detail. In Section 3 we compare the brain networks across the three disease groups (CN, MCI, AD) in order to investigate how effective connectivity in the DMN differs across these groups.\nIn Section 4 we examine how the genetic data are related to disease using a GWAS, and in doing so, obtain a priority subset of 100 SNPs for subsequent analysis. We also include this subset in a larger regression model and use the LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996; Friedman, 2010) to determine both the active SNPs as well as those SNPs that have the highest estimated 9 effect on the probability of disease. In Section 5 we relate the brain connectivity networks to the priority subset of SNPs determined in Section 4 using a multivariate linear model and the Bayes factor. Section 6 considers the problem of predicting disease progression, and we investigate the utility of genetic data and effective connectivity data for prediction while comparing a number of classification algorithms. The paper concludes in Section 7 with a summary of our findings."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND PREPROCESSING", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD.\nThe primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). For up-to-date information, see www.\nadni-info.org. ADNI is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of AD.\nThe selection criteria for our sample is as follows. We first begin with ADNI2 subjects (1437 at this stage) and considered those subjects with genome-wide SNP data (774 left at this stage) and also with at least one resting-state fMRI scan at 3T (112) . This leads to 112 subjects comprising 37 CN, 63 MCI and 12 AD subjects, with these subjects having a mean age of 73.8 years with the range being 56.3-95.6 years, 46 of these subjects being male, 5 being left-handed, and with education measured in years ranging from 11 to 20. Table 1 displays several summary statistics associated with our sample including a summary on the APOE gene.\nThe APOE gene is a known genetic determinant of AD risk and individuals carrying the 4 allele are at increased risk of AD (see, e.g., Liu et al. 2013) . Table 1 summarizes the 10 number of APOE 4 alleles for the subjects in each disease category. In line with expectations from the literature, a signal from the APOE gene appears to be present in the data with the AD group having a higher percentage of subjects with at least one 4 alleles. The freely available software package PLINK (Purcell et.al., 2007) was used for genomic quality control. The genetic data are SNPs from non-sex chromosomes, i.e., chromosome 1 to chromosome 22. SNPs with minor allele frequency less than 5% are removed as are SNPs with a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value lower than 10 \u22126 or a missing rate greater than 5%. After preprocessing we are left with 1,220,955 SNPs for each of the 112 subjects."}, {"section_title": "rs-fMRI Data Preprocessing and Network Construction", "text": "The fMRI and anatomical data are pre-processed using a combination of the FSL software (available at http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/) and the SPM12 software (available at http://www.l.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/). Non-brain tissue in the raw T1 images is removed using the automated Brain Extraction Tool (Smith, 2002) , followed by manual verification and optimization for each subject. BOLD data preprocessing was performed in FSL's FEAT as follows: each functional image was motion corrected and registered to their high-resolution T1 structural image that was linearly registered to standard stereotaxic space using a 12 degree of freedom transformation. A non-linear registration of the structural image to standard stereotactic space was also applied to account for potential local deformations in brains of the patient group. Each subject's imaging data are normalized to a standardized space defined by a MNI template brain.\nThe Figure 3 . A 16-parameter graph with weights representing effective connectivity between and within regions is then estimated for each subject. The imaging preprocessing pipeline is summarized in Figure 4 .\nWe fit the DCM in SPM12 with the option of one state per region and with the model fit to the cross spectral density (spectral DCM). That is, the case where the strength of connection is not related to disease. In our case the smallest p-values across the network correspond to p = 0.081 for the connection from RIPC to LIPC, and p = 0.087 for the connection from PCC to mPFC. After accounting for multiple comparisons at all edges, the false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-values are depicted as a network in Figure 6 . The FDR corrected p-values are p = 0.696 (RIPC \u2192 LIPC) and p = 0.696 (PCC \u2192 mPFC). From these values and Figure 6 it appears as though the data are not incompatible with the null hypothesis that the network connections do not differ across disease groups. Nevertheless, the RIPC \u2192 LIPC and PCC \u2192 mPFC connections may be of interest from an exploratory standpoint given the point estimates and their relative differences for the AD group."}, {"section_title": "STUDY II: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISEASE AND GENETICS", "text": "Beginning with the 1,220,955 SNPs discussed in Section 2, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with the goal of identifying a smaller subset of SNPs that are related to disease (CN/MCI/AD). A multinomial logistic regression with disease category as the response is fit for each SNP to assess that SNP's marginal association with disease after adjusting for covariates representing age, sex, right hand or left hand, and education. SNPs are included in the model as the number of a particular allele so that a SNP's effect on the log-odds ratio is additive. We sort the SNPs by the resulting p-values from a likelihood ratio test, where the null hypothesis corresponds to the case where the probability distribution of disease does not depend on the given SNP. A subset of the top 100 SNPs is selected based on this ranking. The distribution of p-values by chromosome and the cut-off for selecting the best subset of 100 SNPs is depicted in Figure 7 . To jointly assess the effect of the 100 priority SNPs, we include these variables along with covariates representing age, sex, right hand or left hand, and education and the disease status (CN/MCI/AD) as the response in a new symmetric multinomial logistic regression with LASSO penalty to jointly identify the SNPs that are most related to disease. The glmnet software (Friedman et al., 2010) is used to fit the LASSO penalized symmetric multinomial logistic regression model, where each class is represented by a linear model on the log-scale and the penalty allows for redundancies so that all levels of the response have an associated parameter in the model. The LASSO penalty parameter is selected using 10-fold cross validation. The estimated coefficients are summarized in Figure 8 . The values represent how a unit increase in the coded allele will increase the log-odds ratio for a particular category of disease (NC/MCI/AD).\nFor each of the three disease categories (CN, MCI, AD), the top five SNPs selected based on the magnitude of their estimated LASSO coefficients are listed in Table 2 . These findings suggest that SNPs kgp5568290, rs7617199 and kgp239829 have the largest estimated effects on the log-odds of AD.\nWhile Table 1 indicates a potential APOE signal in our data from the 4 allele, we note that there are no APOE SNPs in our subset of the top 100. Our data have two SNPs rs769449 and kgp2187574 that are located within the range of APOE (chr19:45409039, chr19:45412650). The individual associations between these two SNPs with the disease are not found to be significant, where the specific results are p = 0.07 for rs769449 and p = 0.57 for kgp2187574. As a result, neither of these two APOE SNPs are within the top 100\nSNPs that we have identified and included in the larger model as their rank is quite low.\nIf we define APOE related SNPs as those within a 1 million base pair range of APOE, we find 503 SNPs with p-values between 0.0005 and 0.99. In this case none of these 503\nSNPs fall within the top 100 SNPs, though the highest rank among these is a rank of 1002 obtained by SNP kgp3912453. Given this, we look for more SNPs that might not be in the neighborhood of APOE, but may still be related to the APOE SNPs. To do this we start with the top 100 SNPs that are associated with disease status and we correlate them with 18 the first principal component obtained from those 503 SNPs that are in the 1 million base pair window of APOE. In this case the largest correlation is only about 0.28. As a result, there are no APOE SNPs in our subset of the top 100, though the highest ranking APOE SNP is kgp3912453 which obtains a rank of 1002 based on a p-value of 0.0005. "}, {"section_title": "STUDY III: RESTING-STATE BRAIN CONNECTIVITY BY GENETICS", "text": "We relate the resting-state effective connectivity networks estimated using DCM in Section 2.1 to each of the 100 priority SNPs most related to disease identified as part of the GWAS in Section 4 using the multivariate approach proposed in Marchini et al. (2007) . This approach tests for SNP effects on a multi-dimensional phenotype using the Bayes factor. The test is based on a multivariate linear model\nwhere y i = (y i 1 , . . . , y i 16 ) T denotes the vector of residual adjusted brain connectivity edge weights for the ith individual. Prior to fitting the multivariate model, adjusted connectivity is calculated by subtracting a baseline term based on linear regression estimates of an overall mean and the effects of covariates sex, age, left or right hand and education; x i represents the number of a particular allele for a given SNP for the i th individual; \u03b2 = (\u03b2 1 , . . . , \u03b2 16 ) T are the parameters that characterize the manner in which this SNP relates to the effective connectivity network; e i = (e i 1 , . . . , e i 16 ) T is the error term. An inverse Wishart prior IW (c, Q)\nprior is assigned to the error covariance matrix \u03a3 and a Gaussian prior is assigned to \u03b2 as in Marchini et al. (2007) .\nThe Bayes factor is computed to test the null hypothesis H 0 : \u03b2 = 0 against H 1 : \u03b2 = 0, where the Bayes factor is defined by the ratio of marginal likelihoods BF = m(y|H 1 )/m(y|H 0 ), and quantifies the strength of evidence in favour of H 1 ; that is, the hypothesis that at least one network edge depends on the included SNP. The model is fit and the Bayes factor computed separately for each of the 100 priority SNPs, and based on this, the top 10 SNPs with the corresponding values of their Bayes factor are indicated in From Table 2 we can see that there are two distinct SNPs, rs11036476 (Bayes factor = 69.18) and kgp239829 (Bayes factor = 54.95), which give values of the Bayes factor indicating very strong evidence that effective connectivity in the DMN depends on these SNPs. We notice that among the top 10 SNPs listed in Table 2 that these two SNPs have Bayes factors that are noticeably larger than the other SNPs. Thus when we rank the SNPs according to the Bayes factor we see a rather large jump in the values of the Bayes factor when comparing the top two SNPs with the remaining SNPs on the list of the top 10. As demonstrated below, these SNPs both correspond to the same genetic signal from chromosome 11."}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "An important point to note is that SNP kgp239829 is also one of the top three SNPs found related to AD by LASSO in Study II, listed in Table 1 , with estimated coefficient\u03b2 = 1.33 representing this SNP's effect on the log-odds ratio of AD. Our analysis thus suggests a SNP that is related to both AD and effective connectivity in the DMN.\nTo further investigate what specific connection in the networks depend on each SNP, we conduct a posthoc analysis independently for each of the top two, associating each edge value to a given SNP by fitting a linear regression of the edge value onto the SNP while also including covariates representing sex, age, left or right hand and education. The importance of the given SNP to each edge is then summarized through a p-value from an F-test.\nExamining the networks for both SNPs and the p-values arising from the posthoc analysis relating each SNP to the 16 specific connections of interest, we find looking at both networks that these two SNPs are both strongly related to the same connections, namely, MPFC \u2192 LIPC (rs11036476, p-value = 0.0055; kgp239829, p-value = 0.0052) and LIPC \u2192 RIPC (rs11036476, p-value = 0.0058; kgp239829, p-value = 0.0063). We account for multiple comparisons across each network by computing FDR corrected p-values and these are depicted in Figure 9 . For the strongest connections, the FDR corrected p-values are MPFC \u2192 LIPC (rs11036476, p-value = 0.0462; kgp239829, p-value = 0.0500) and LIPC \u2192 RIPC (rs11036476, p-value = 0.0462; kgp239829, p-value = 0.0500). We further notice that the networks of p-values for both of the top two SNPs are very similar. Investigating further, we find that both rs11036476 and kgp239829 are very close to each other on chromosome 11\nand their sample correlation is very high\u03c1 \u2248 1, so that both SNPs are in high linkage and represent the same genetic signal from chromosome 11 onto DMN connections MPFC \u2192 LIPC and LIPC \u2192 RIPC. As noted earlier, this same signal is also related to AD and thus suggests a potential a biomarker for AD that may also have a relationship to DMN effective connectivity at the two aforementioned connections.\nIt is also worth noting that the SNP with the third highest value of the Bayes factor rs4910743 (Bayes factor = 14.13) also exhibits a high correlation of\u03c1 = 0.93 with the top two SNPs and its network obtained from a posthoc analysis exhibits a pattern very similar 22 to that seen in Figure 9 . This further suggests the same genetic signal potentially related to AD and DMN effective connectivity. We also note that while only one (kgp239829) of the top three SNPs listed Table 2 is also listed in Table 1 as having a large estimated effect on the probability of AD, this is likely the result of the well known property of the LASSO to choose one of a group of highly correlated predictors to include in the model. In this case LASSO has chosen kgp239829 to represent the chromosome 11 signal.\nIn summary, our analysis has detected a genetic signal from chromosome 11, SNP rs11036476 (Bayes Factor = 69.18), SNP kgp239829 (Bayes Factor = 54.95), and rs4910743\n(Bayes factor = 14.13) all in high linkage exhibiting both a potential relationship to AD as well as a potential relationship to DMN connections MPFC \u2192 LIPC and LIPC \u2192 RIPC. As a result, it appears as though this genetic signal may modulate a path of information flow within the DMN from MPFC to RIPC through LIPC."}, {"section_title": "STUDY IV: CLASSIFICATION OF LONGITUDINAL DISEASE PROGRESSION FROM EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY NETWORKS AND GENETIC DATA", "text": "In our final study we examine longitudinal disease status data for each of the 100 out of 112 subjects included in our analyses that did not have AD (i.e., they were CN or MCI) at the time of their baseline rs-fMRI scan. In the ADNI2 study each subject's disease status is monitored over time over a sequence of follow-up visits, with the number of visits varying from one to eight for the subjects included in our analyses. We define a subject to be a converter if their disease progressed, e.g., from CN to MCI, CN to AD or from MCI to AD during the course of follow-up. Subjects with only one visit (there are two such subjects) or those whose disease did not progress over multiple visits are called non-converters.\nWe investigate the development of a classifier that can predict disease progression with the goal of determining if the DMN effective connectivity networks from the baseline rs-fMRI scan and the genetic data (the subset of 100 SNPs from the GWAS of Study II) are useful as inputs into such a classifier. A primary question of interest in this study is whether the combination of brain imaging and genetic data yields a classifier that can perform in predicting disease conversion better than the same classifier trained with genetic data only or brain imaging data only. In addition to SNP and estimated brain connectivity parameters, we include the age of subjects and the baseline disease state (either NC or MCI) as additional features in all of the classifiers. The data comprise 25 converters and 75 non-converters in total. We assess the accuracy of each classifier using five-fold cross-validation (CV) with the set of 100 subjects partitioned into five subsets. To keep the ratio of converters and nonconverters roughly the same in the training and test sets, we randomly split the converters and non-converters into five folds separately, and we combine the ith fold of the converters and the ith fold of the non-converters as the ith fold for the entire dataset. We report the average (over CV repetitions) test set sensitivity and test set specificity for all classifiers considered. The sensitivity is defined as the proportion of actual converters that are correctly identified by the classifier; the specificity is defined as the proportion of non-converters that are correctly identified by the classifier.\nWe consider classifiers that include some or all of the following inputs: We trained various classifiers with different sets of inputs: For the case where the classifier uses age and state as the only inputs, we apply the following classification procedures: logistic regression, random forest (Liaw and Weiner, 2002) , naive-Bayes (with and without a kernel), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and a generalized additive model (GAM). For the cases where genetics and/or effective brain connectivity are also included as inputs, the number of predictors increases and we apply classifiers that are applicable to this setting, where the number of features is significantly larger: regularized logistic regression with LASSO penalty, random forest, naive-Bayes (with and without a kernel), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and generalized boosted machine (gbm). The results of comparing the different classifiers are summarized in Table 4 , with the sensitivity and specificity for different classifiers listed in Table 4 all being based on a 0.5 cut-off value.\nA very simple baseline for comparison is a classifier that simply chooses a class at random, and for such a classifier the sensitivity is 0.22 and the specificity is 0.78. Aside from this we evaluate four classes of classifier, the first with age and state, the second adding genetics to the first, the third adding effective brain connectivity to the first, the fourth adding both genetics and brain connectivity. In the first class the performance is quite poor as the sensitivity is far below baseline and it appears difficult to predict converters when only age and baseline state are used as inputs. For the remaining three classes we notice that the performance depends substantially on the type of classification algorithm used, and we also notice that in all three classes LDA and naive-Bayes achieve the best performance in terms of being able to predict disease progression.\nThe fact that it is LDA and naive-Bayes that perform best in all three classes suggests a genuine pattern with respect to the relative performance of algorithms for these data leaning towards simpler algorithms, perhaps because of the training set size. For these algorithms, we see that there is indeed an advantage to including both genetic data and brain connectivity data as inputs into the classifier, as the overall best performance is obtained when both brain connectivity and genetics are included. The LDA algorithm with age, state, genetics and brain connectivity appears to achieve the best performance overall, with a sensitivity of 0.56 and a specificity of 0.59. The ROC curves corresponding to the four LDA classifiers generated from varying the cut-off values are depicted in Figure 10 .\nA key result here is that the best classifier combines both brain connectivity and genetics (sensitivity = 0.56, specificity = 0.59) and that the ability of this same classifier to predict disease progression degrades when either brain connectivity is removed (sensitivity = 0.31, specificity = 0.61) or when genetics are removed (sensitivity = 0.28, specificity = 0.83)."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": "The baseline classifier yields a sensitivity of 0.22 (with specificity of 0.78). We reiterate that the best performance was achieved when both genetic data and brain connectivity data were included as inputs into LDA. This suggests that the combination of both genetic and neuroimaging data may be useful for predicting disease progression. As far as we are aware, this is the first time this genetic signal has been identified on both DMN effective connectivity (Study III) and the probability of AD (Study II). Some caution is required here since the number of AD subjects in our study is low. The result for AD is based on LASSO with n AD = 12 in the AD category for the multinomial logistic regression and n = 112 subjects in the model overall. The results for effective connectivity are based on the Bayes factor with n = 112.\nA primary goal for follow-up work will involve studies that look at replicating the results found here. The results from Study II will be examined using a larger dataset with a targeted SNP analysis in order to determine if the chromosome 11 signal on the aforementioned DMN path can be replicated using a larger sample size.\nAnother approach to increasing the sample size is to extend our analysis to incorporate a longitudinal network analysis that uses rs-fMRI scans from multiple visits for each subject in the ADNI study. A primary challenge in this case is the need to accommodate withinsubject clustering of the effective connectivity networks when relating these phenotypes to genetics in a repeated measures analysis. We are currently extending the analysis proposed here with longitudinal rs-fMRI data and random effects modelling.\nThe neuropathological mechanisms that underly the altered effective connectivity found here could be related to the usual hallmarks of AD. For example, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and/or structural neurodegeneration may underly the altered connectivity and its observed association with genetics. Therefore, our current results also suggest followup studies examining measures of amyloid beta and tau (as measured in CSF or by PET imaging) and measures of brain structure (as measured by high resolution anatomical and diffusion tensor imaging) and the relationship between these measures and the genetic signal found in Studies II and III. Follow-up studies will also apply our pipeline to examine genetic effects on the effective connectivity in other resting-state networks relevant to AD such as 29 the Executive Control Network (Cai et al., 2017 ).\nAn alternative albeit more subtle way to increase the sample size associated with our analysis is to incorporate simulated rs-fMRI data based on a computer model of the brain.\nMore specifically, a large number of subjects within the ADNI study do not have rs-fMRI data but instead have diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images (DTI) along with genetic data.\nThe DTI for a given subject can be used to parameterize a complex computer model of neural activity that can be used in conjunction with appropriate forward modelling to simulate fMRI data and create a synthetic rs-fMRI dataset that is specific for that subject based on a model parameterized by their DTI. The result will be a larger sample size consisting of subjects with genetic data and either real rs-fMRI or synthetic computer model generated rs-fMRI data. We are currently investigating procedures for how to best simulate computer model data of the brain and methods for combining the computer simulated and real rs-fMRI data so as to achieve an optimal bias-variance tradeoff in the analysis of the combined data. This issue has received a great deal of attention in other areas such as climate modelling but has, as far as we are aware, never been considered for neuroimaging.\nAs fMRI reproducibility is a known issue (Eklund et al., 2016) and the results from GWAS in the absence of large sample sizes are also prone to similar problems arising from the small effects conferred by individual loci (Munafo and Flint, 2011) , a priority at this point is investigating a potential theoretical explanation of our key results from Study III and designing candidate SNP studies to replicate them.\nFinally, from a methodological perspective we note that our analysis in Study III is based on a two-stage approach and a problem with this approach is that the uncertainty associated with the parameters estimated in the first stage is not accounted for in the second stage analysis. Another problem with the two-stage approach is that the estimates of connectivity computed from each subject separately do not provide shrinkage. Shrinkage would offer the benefit of decreasing the variance of effective connectivity estimates compared with the current approach of estimating effective connectivity independently for each subject. Friston et al. (2015) discuss group analysis and shrinkage estimation for DCM and develop an iterative approach where empirical priors from the second stage are used to iteratively optimize posterior densities over parameters at the first stage. Within our setup where interest lies in genetic effects one potential solution is to develop a fully Bayesian multi-subject model combining the DCM with a regression specification directly so that subject-specific parameters of the model representing neuronal connectivity are related to genetic variables through regression parameters modulating the dynamics of neural activity. Inference for this multi-subject genetic DCM model would then account for all sources of uncertainty, provide shrinkage in effective connectivity estimates and unify the two-stage analysis."}]
