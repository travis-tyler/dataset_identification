[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "In the past decade, a large number of genetic biomarkers have been discovered through large-scale genome wide association studies (GWASs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as APOE, TOMM40 and CLU. Despite this significant progress, existing genetic findings are largely passengers not directly involved in the driver events, which presents challenges for replication and translation into targetable mechanisms. In this paper, leveraging the protein interaction network, we proposed a modularity-constrained Lasso model to jointly analyze the genotype, gene expression and protein expression data. With a prior network capturing the functional relationship between SNPs, genes and proteins, the newly introduced penalty term maximizes the global modularity of the subnetwork involving selected markers and encourages the selection of multi-omic markers with dense functional connectivity, instead of individual markers. We applied this new model to the real data in ROS/MAP cohort for discovery of biomarkers related to cognitive performance. A functionally connected subnetwork involving 276 multi-omic biomarkers, including SNPs, genes and proteins, were identified to bear predictive power. Within this subnetwork, multiple trans-omic paths from SNPs to genes and then proteins were observed, suggesting that cognitive performance can be potentially affected by the genetic mutations due to their cascade effect on the expression of downstream genes and proteins."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "pathogenesis remain a challenge. Identification of novel biomarkers or functionally 10 validating existing biomarkers becomes increasingly important for discovery of new 11 potential future therapeutic targets. 12 Recently, there is a substantial increase in AD multi-omic data. Example projects 13 include the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [2] and the Religious 14 Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) [3] . Instead of limiting 15 their perspective to a single -omics layer, these data collections create a molecular 16 landscape spanning the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. Coupling 17 with systems biology networks (e.g., protein-protein interaction (PPI) network), these 18 data provides a valuable resource with rich content and opens numerous opportunities 19 for more comprehensive analyses of AD. These multi-omics data has been increasingly 20 recognized to be a potential key enabler of novel biomarker discovery [4, 5] . It not only 21 allows us to examine the disease from different -omics layers, but also provides insights 22 into their interactions which is critical for translation of genetic findings into targetable 23 mechanism. 24 Despite this great potential, the power of multi-omic data has not been fully unleashed. 25 Much research effort of existing studies has been on single type of -omics data without 26 acknowledging the interconnections between -omics layers. This shortcoming is largely 27 due to the limited availability of computational methods that are sufficiently powerful 28 and comprehensive enough to handle the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of multi-29 mic data. In addition, major findings generated from current -omics studies have been 30 largely restricted to relatively simple patterns. They are mostly individual biomarkers, 31 possibly without functional interactions, which presents difficulties to validate these 32 findings and to relate them to downstream biology [6, 7] . To address this problem, some 33 recent studies propose to seek common genetic markers with evidence from more than 34 one -omics layer [8] [9] [10] , which are expected to more reliable for further experimental 35 validation. However, this simple overlap strategy may be too stringent as -omic features 36 in different layers are not completely mapped in a one-to-one relationship. 37 In this paper, leveraging the functional interaction network in REACTOME, we pro-38 pose a modularity-constrained Lasso model to jointly analyze genotype, gene expression 39 and protein expression data. We aim to identify a set of SNPs, genes and proteins as 40 biomarkers, forming a subnetwork with functional connections cutting across different 41 -omics layers. Compared to individual mutations, genes or proteins identified using 42 traditional methods, such connected pattern can help improve not only the reliability of 43 identified biomarkers, but also their replicability and interpretability. 44 "}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "45", "text": "Study cohort 46 All the data analyzed in the present report were obtained from the Religious Orders Study 47 (ROS) and Memory and Aging Project (MAP).

It minimizes the usual sum of squared errors with a 132 bound on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, which is also known as L1 133 norm (Eq. 1).\nWith this constraint, Lasso aims to minimize the number of selected features, which 135 significantly improved the interpretability of results compared to traditional linear 136 regression, where almost all features are considered to be outcome-relevant with non-137 zero weight. However, when dealing with a group of highly correlated features, L1 138 norm penalty will result in a random selection. In this case, multiple runs of Lasso 139 on the same set of data will possibly generate different set of selected features, which 140 presents challenges for replicating and interpreting the results. To address this problem, 141 several groups proposed to explicitly incorporate the correlation structure into the 142 sparse prediction model and encourage the selection/exclusion of all highly correlated 143 features [21] [22] [23] [24] . Among those is GraphNet, where a graph G \u2286 R p\u00d7p indicating the 144 correlation structure between predictors is used as a priori to guide the feature selection 145 (Eq. 2) [24] . Here, L is the corresponding Laplacian matrix of graph G. However, 146 GraphNet only takes account into local topology information with a focus on pairwise 147 similarity. For multi-omic biomarker discovery, using this penalty can not guarantee the 148 selected features are densely connected in the prior network.\nIn this paper, we propose a new modularity-constrained Lasso which leverages the 150 global network property to encourage the selection of a sub-network module rather 151 than individual markers scattered in the prior network. Given the trans-omic network 152 capturing the functional interaction between SNPs, genes and proteins, we formulate 153 it as a graph and its corresponding adjacency matrix is denoted as\n. It evaluates whether the number 155 of links is significantly more than expected. h i and h j are the degrees of the i-th and 156 j-th node in the network, and m is the total number of links in the network. To impose 157 a modular structure in the identified biomarkers, we propose a new penalty term as 158 P M (w, B) =< w T w, B >, inspired by the module identification problem [26, 27] . Here, 159 <> is the Frobenius inner product defined by < A, B >= tr(A T B). Maximizing the 160 Frobenius inner product between w T w and the modularity matrix B encourages the 161 selection of features with dense functional connections in the prior multi-omic network. 162\nTaken together, our new modularity-constrained Lasso objective is formulated as in Eq. 163 3.\nHere, \u03bb and t are the parameters that control and balance the contribution from two 165 regularization terms. Note that the objective function in Eq. 3 is not convex because 166 the modularity matrix B used in P M (w, B) =< w T w, B > is indefinite. To make B 167 negative-definite, we introduced an auxiliary function where B is replaced by B \u2212 \u03bb B I 168 and \u03bb B is the absolute maximum eigenvalue of B. Eq. 3 can be easily solved by obtaining 169 a closed form solution without L1 constraint, followed by soft-threshold method [20] ."}, {"section_title": "170", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "171", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Performance comparison between M-Lasso and G-Lasso", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "172", "text": "In this section, we denote our modularity-constrained Lasso as M-Lasso and GraphNet-173 constrained Lasso as G-Lasso.

As we can observe, M-Lasso consistently outperforms 182 G-Lasso with smaller prediction error over all 5 folds. For feature selection, M-Lasso identified around 600 -omics features, including SNPs, 184 genes and proteins, to be predictive of cognitive performance, while G-Lasso only 185 identified a handful of them (i.e., less than 20 for all 5 folds). When mapped to the 186 prior functional connectivity network, markers identified by G-Lasso scatters across 187 the network with few connections, which suggests that the local topology information 188 used in GraphNet penalty is not strong enough to form subnetwork structure among 189 identified biomarkers. For M-Lasso, -omics biomarkers identified are largely connected 190 to each other in the prior network. Take the result from one fold as example, 650 -omics 191 features were selected, including 255 SNPs, 339 genes and 56 proteins. The largest 192 connected network component involves 276 -omics features with 366 edges (Fig. 2) . 193 The rest of the multi-omic markers identified in M-Lasso mostly form small connected 194 components, ranging in size from 2 to 50. These features are found predictive yet not 195 well functionally connected, possibly due to the fact that they are false positives or their 196 functional connections have not been previously studied yet. In the subsequent part, we 197 focus on the multi-omic biomarkers in the largest connected component, which are both 198 predictive of cognitive performance and functionally connected with evidence from prior 199 knowledge.\nFunctionally connected multi-omic biomarkers 201 Shown in Fig. 2 are the top 7 connected components obtained after mapping 650 -omics 202 features back to the prior network. Size of each node is made proportional to their degree. 203 It can be easily observed that there are multiple trans-omic paths from SNPs to genes 204 and then proteins. Note that these SNPs are located upstream of their connected genes 205 and has significant effect on the transcription factor binding activity. Thus, these SNPs 206 are very likely to have an influence on the expression of their connected genes. Also, 207 the functional interaction between genes and proteins are curated from REACTOME 208 pathways with direction information. Therefore, genes have a regulatory role toward 209 the expression of their connected proteins in the prior network. Taken together, these 210 trans-omic paths suggest that cognitive performance can be potentially affected by the 211 genetic mutations (i.e., SNPs) due to their cascade effect on the expression of downstream 212 genes, which further regulate the protein expression. We further examined all 28 SNPs 213 involved in the largest connected component in BRAINEAC database. 25 of them were 214 found to be expression quantitative locus (eQTLs) in the prefrontal cortex tissue, which 215 gives further support to our discovery of trans-omic paths as biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "216", "text": "For the largest connected components, we further performed network analysis using 217 NetworkAnalyzer in Cytoscape [28] and identified the -omic biomarkers with top centrality 218 values, such as degree, betweenness and closeness (Table 3) .

Most hub nodes are also found to have the top 221 centrality value in betweenness, closeness and clustering coefficient, such as PIK3R1, 222 FYN, and EP300. Majority of these genes and proteins have been previously reported 223 in association with AD. For example, PIK3R1 encodes the regulatory subunit of the 224 phosphoinositide-3-kinase protein complex PI3Ks, which are known to play a key role in 225 insulin signaling. Results from recent studies start to show evidence of intrinsic insulin 226 resistance inside AD brains [29] . The hub gene EP300 encodes the enzyme histone 227 acetyltransferase p300 or E1A-associated protein p300, also known as EP300 or P300. 228 This enzyme functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription of genes 229 via chromatin remodeling. Findings from multiple studies have suggested the potential of 230 P300 to act as a biomarker for dementia assessment and monitoring AD. Meta-analysis 231 of P300 amplitude and latency reveals useful information about the early stages of 232 AD [30, 31] . In addition, both GRB2 and FBXO2 were found to interact with APP, a 233 well-known gene related to AD. GRB2 interacts with APP requiring phosphorylation 234 of APP at Tyr-682 [32] . This could lead to the activation of the MAPK pathway, 235 since GRB2 are known to link growth factor receptors to signaling pathways, such as 236 MAPK and PI3K, and participate in oncogenic proliferation, neuronal development, 237 cell differentiation, and apoptosis [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] The hub gene FBXO2 participates in APP 238 processing by promoting degradation of APP cleaving \u03b2-secretase [39] ."}, {"section_title": "239", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Pathway enrichment analysis 240", "text": "For 168 genes and 37 proteins in the largest connected subnetwork, we performed 241 pathway enrichment analysis using ClueGO based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 242 and Genomes (KEGG) database [40, 41] .

Two recent studies have found a significant 247 correlation between peripheral insulin resistance and brain A\u03b2 levels as measured by 248 Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) [42, 43] . The impaired 249 insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling observed in the AD brain has led to clinical trials studying 250 whether the enhancement of this pathway using intranasal insulin (IN) treatment is 251 beneficial [44] .
