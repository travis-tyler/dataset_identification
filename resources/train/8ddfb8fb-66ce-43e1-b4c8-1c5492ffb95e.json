We examined the APOE-e4 dose effect on cross-sectional hippocampal morphology analysis in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) database of 117 cognitively unimpaired subjects aged between 50 to 85 years (mean=57.4, SD=6.3), including 36 heterozygotes (e3/e4), 37 homozygotes (e4/e4) and 44 non-carriers (e3/e3). The proposed automated framework includes hippocampal surface segmentation and reconstruction, higher-order hippocampal surface correspondence computation, and hippocampal surface deformation analysis with multivariate statistics. In our experiments, the surface-based method identified APOE-e4 dose effects on the left hippocampal morphology. Compared to the widely-used hippocampal volume measure, our hippocampal morphometry statistics showed greater statistical power by distinguishing cognitively unimpaired subjects with two, one, and no APOE-e4 alleles.

Cognition decline especially memory loss is the clinical hallmark of AD onset, resulting from an irreversible neurodegenerative progress. For therapy to be successful, timing may be critical, and current trial trends have emphasized intervention at the earliest possible stage, including pre-symptomatic. However, it is challenging to determine obvious AD in the pre-symptomatic stage (Hyman, 2011) . Discovery that a common gene, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele, is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD (!!! INVALID CITATION !!! (Corder et al., 1993; Saunders et al., 1993) ), has made it possible to study large numbers of genetically at-risk individuals before the onset of symptomatic memory impairment and has led to the concept of the preclinical stage of AD (Sperling et al., 2011) , a concept validated in autopsy studies of non-demented elderly subjects with neuropathological evidence of AD at autopsy (Dickson et al., 1992; Gouras et al., 1997; Bennett et al., 2009; Kok et al., 2009; Caselli et al., 2010) , magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of infants at differential genetic risk (Dean et al., 2014; Knickmeyer et al., 2014) , MRI studies of whole brain atrophy rates (Chen et al., 2007) , fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies of APOE-e4 carriers that have revealed AD-like patterns of reduced CMR glucose (Reiman et al., 1996; Reiman et al., 2005) , amyloid ligand binding studies using Pittsburgh Imaging Compound B (PiB) that show evidence of cerebral amyloidosis in APOE-e4 carriers , cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta amyloid that begin to fall, suggesting the onset of AD, in the early 50's in e4 carriers (Morris et al., 2010) , and neuropsychological studies showing the accelerated decline of memory scores in a gene-dose pattern in APOE-e4 carriers beginning between age 55 and 60 ) that is further accelerated in APOE-e4 homozygotes by cerebrovascular risk factors (Chen et al., 2007; Caselli et al., 2011) .\nIn AD research, structural MRI-based measures include whole-brain (Fox et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2007; Josephs et al., 2008) , entorhinal cortex (Cardenas et al., 2011) , hippocampus (Reiman et al., 1998; Jack et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2004a; den Heijer et al., 2010; Wolz et al., 2010) , and temporal lobe volumes (Hua et al., 2010) , as well as ventricular enlargement (Jack et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2004a; Wang et al., 2011) . These measures correlate closely with differences and changes in cognitive performance, supporting their validity as markers of disease progression. In particular, the hippocampus is a primary target region in both cross-sectional and longitudinal structural MRI analysis of AD progress (de Leon et al., 1989; Soininen et al., 1995; Reiman et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2004a; Qiu et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2009; Apostolova et al., 2010; Crivello et al., 2010; O'Dwyer et al., 2012; Kerchner et al., 2014) , and studies show that the presence of more APOE-e4 alleles results in increased hippocampal atrophies on AD (Filippini et al., 2009; Hostage et al., 2013; Kerchner et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016; Saeed et al., 2018) , mild cognitive A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T impairment (MCI) (Hostage et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2016) and non-demented subjects (pooled MCI and cognitively impaired subjects) Li et al., 2016) .\nEvaluating the genetic influence of APOE-e4 on hippocampal morphology before the onset stage of AD may enrich our understanding of the involvement of this allele in AD pathology, and have implications for prevention strategies. In an early study involving 11 cognitively normal APOE-e4 homozygotes (HM) and 22 APOE-e4 non-carriers (NC) with a reported family history of AD who were matched for sex, age, and level of education, Rieman et al. (1998) reported that the HM showed nonsignificant trends for smaller left and right hippocampal volumes. By studying the dose effect of APOE-e4 on hippocampal volume loss in a large MRI database of cognitively unimpaired subjects, a series of studies (Lemaitre et al., 2005; Crivello et al., 2010) found significant hippocampal atrophies in HM compared to heterozygotes (HT) and NC but observed no significant morphometric differences between HT and NC/HM. Another popular research strategy pooled HM and HT into a single APOE-e4 carrier category. Significantly smaller hippocampal volumes were observed in APOE-e4 carriers than in NC (Reiter et al., 2017) , but the hippocampal volumes of HT were not significantly different from NC. Similarly, voxel-wise techniques did not report meaningful findings about APOE-e4 dose effects (Matura et al., 2014; Gonneaud et al., 2016) . Recently, Cacciaglia et al. (2018) found APOE-e4 additive grey matter volume reductions in the right hippocampus, caudate, precentral gyrus, and cerebellar.\nAlthough the majority of existing studies used hippocampal volumes (Reiman et al., 1998; Lemaitre et al., 2005; Crivello et al., 2010; Reiter et al., 2017; Cacciaglia et al., 2018) , recent research (Styner et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2004a; Morra et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2009; Apostolova et al., 2010; Costafreda et al., 2011; Younes et al., 2014) has demonstrated that surfacebased subregional structure analysis may offer advantages over volume measures. However, the dosedependent impact of the APOE-e4 allele measured by a surface-based hippocampal morphometry system on cognitively unimpaired individuals is still elusive.\nIn our previous studies (Wang et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2014) (Lepor\u00e9 et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010) and radial distance (distances from the medial core to each surface point) (Styner et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2004a) . With surface MMS, our experimental results have shown that APOE-e4 exerts dose effects on the left hippocampus (LH) of non-demented individuals (i.e., atrophies of LH HM > atrophies of LH HT > atrophies of LH NC ) Li et al., 2016) .\nMeanwhile, the hippocampal morphometric measures have been verified in our previous AD-related"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "neuroimaging research, showing stronger statistical power than volume-based analysis in capturing subtle structural alterations (Wang et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016) .\nIn the present study, we hypothesized that our unique automated hippocampal morphometry system may help reveal the dose effects of APOE-e4 on the hippocampal morphology for cognitively unimpaired individuals. We aimed to capitalize on the study of a large number of cognitively unimpaired late middle aged and older adults with two, one and no APOE-e4\nalleles (Caselli et al., 2004) to characterize the ability of our automated hippocampal morphometry algorithm to distinguish between these three levels of genetic risk for AD and demonstrate its superiority to a commonly used hippocampal volume measurement. With the cross-sectional structural MR imaging data and APOE-e4 genotypes of 117 cognitively unimpaired individuals, we set out to test this hypothesis by computing bilateral hippocampal morphometries and analyzing morphometric differences related to the APOE-e4 dose effect.\nOur previous work proposed a novel hippocampal surface morphometry method, which performed well for studying APOE-e4 dose-dependent effects on the hippocampal deformations of non-demented groups. The current work adopted a similar strategy to study APOE-e4 effects on the hippocampal morphometry of cognitively unimpaired people, as shown in Figure 1 .\nWith FIRST in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL), hippocampal structures were segmented in the MNI152 standard space (Patenaude et al., 2011; Paquette et al., 2017 ) (see Figure 1A ). Surface meshes were constructed based on the hippocampal segmentations with the marching cubes algorithm (Lorensen and Cline, 1987 ) and a topology-preserving level set method (Han et al., 2003 ) (see Figure   1B ). Using the holomorphic flow segmentation method (Wang et al., 2007) , each hippocampal surface was parameterized with refined triangular meshes, and the parameterized surfaces were then registered to a common rectangular grid template using the surface fluid registration algorithm (see Figure 1C ). To evaluate the deformation, the hippocampal morphometric features were extracted by concatenating the mTBM and the radial distance features. Eventually, by applying Hotelling's T 2 test with a permutation test, differences of hippocampal morphometry among the APOE-e4 genotype groups were studied.\nand loop subdivision (Loop, 1987 ) that down-sampled the mesh to a consistent number of vertexes (15000 vertexes for each side of the hippocampus).\nobserve significant volume losses for the carriers (Mondadori et al., 2007; Burggren et al., 2008; Protas et al., 2013) . We estimated the hippocampal deformations with cross-sectional analysis and expected to observe significant hippocampal deformations between APOE-e4 carriers and noncarriers. The group hippocampal morphometric comparisons were conducted between 44 NC and 73 e4 carriers (36 HT and 37 HM). Figure 2 shows the p-maps of group differences on the LH and right hippocampus (RH). Non-blue colors show vertices with statistical differences at the nominal 0.05 level, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. We found significant morphometric differences on the LH (p < 0.02, corrected); however, no overall significances were observed on the RH (p > 0.05, corrected).\n\n\nmay be also true for three other group contrasts ( Figure 5A, B and C) .\nAs shown in Figure 6 , we note that the curve deviation of the statistics from the null distribution generally increases with the number of APOE-e4 alleles, curve deviations of the comparison of NC vs.\nHM (brown line) typically are larger than the comparison of NC vs. HT (blue line), which suggested a clear APOE-e4 dose effect. Additionally, large curve deviations of the comparison APOE-e4 carriers vs. NC means there are significant LH morphometric differences between carriers and NC, which is consistent with prior studies (Burggren et al., 2008; Reiter et al., 2017) . The curve deviations of the comparison HT vs. HM are also larger than the null hypothesis distribution, it means that there are significant LH morphometric differences between HT and HM, which was not reported by any existing studies, e.g. (Burggren et al., 2008; Mondadori et al., 2007; Protas et al., 2013) . hypothesis of no group differences among the comparisons. In false discovery rate methods, any cumulative distribution plot that rises steeply is a sign of a significant signal being detected, with curves that rise faster denoting higher effect sizes. The steep rise of the cumulative plot relative to p-values that would be expected by chance can be used to compare the detection sensitivity of different statistics derived from the same data.\nBy analyzing cross-sectional structural MR images, the present study has revealed that the APOE-e4 allele has a dose-dependent impact on the left hippocampal morphology of 117 cognitively unimpaired individuals. Significant hippocampal deformations were observed in the comparisons of different genotype groups. The results validated our hypothesis that surface-based hippocampal morphometry analysis could identify the dose effect of the APOE-e4 allele on cognitively unimpaired individuals. To compare the performance of the proposed morphometry measure with the volume measure, we also made genotype volume contrasts on the same dataset. \nfrom NC using a cross-sectional analysis strategy."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Database", "text": "Since January 1, 1994, cognitively normal residents of Maricopa County aged 21 years and older have been recruited through local media ads into the Arizona APOE cohort, a longitudinal study of cognitive aging (Caselli et al., 2004) .

All scans were checked for movement and other quality measures prior to post-processing.\nIn this study, we sought to focus on the influence APOE-e4, and due to the protective influence of APOE-e2 against AD, APOE-e2 carriers were excluded (but will be the focus of a future analysis).\nThe selected 117 cognitively healthy subjects aged between 50 and 85 years (mean=57.4, SD=6.3)\nwere separated into three subgroups according to the number of e4 alleles: 44 NC, 36 HT, and 37 HM.\nAmong them, 34 NCs, 31 HTs, and 32 HMs reported a first-degree family history of probable AD; 5\nNCs, 5 HTs and 2 HMs had no first-degree family history; 5 NCs and 2 HMs did not report the firstdegree family history.

The segmentation results of the bilateral hippocampi were manually inspected by projecting the results back to the original structural brain images, so that segment errors could be corrected. There were 2 subjects with significant segmentation errors, i.e., a small cluster of outlier voxels, in the binary mask of hippocampus.\nWe manually remove those voxels and then reconstruct the hippocampus surfaces. Then, the left and right hippocampal surfaces were modeled with a topology-preserving level set method (Han et al., 2003) . Based on the voxel-wise binary surfaces, the marching cubes algorithm (Lorensen and Cline, 1987 ) was applied to generate the triangular surface meshes. To refine the generated mesh and reduce the noise and obtuse angles, we further smoothed surfaces using progressive meshes (Hoppe, 1996) "}, {"section_title": "Conformal Parameterization-based Hippocampal Surface Registration", "text": "Generally, morphometry analysis requires defining a common geometrical structure on surfaces so that all surfaces can be parameterized to a canonical space for the following surface registration and group differences estimation, e.g. (Thompson et al., 2004b; Fischl, 2012) . To generate a planar surface conformal parameterization for a closed hippocampal surface, the topological optimization algorithm (Wang et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2013) was applied to automatically generate two cuts on each hippocampal surface, converting it to a genus zero surface with two open boundaries. The location of the two cuts were at the front and back of the hippocampal surface representing its anterior junction with the amygdala, and its posterior limit as it turned into the white matter of the fornix. They were biologically valid and consistent landmarks across subjects. These two landmark curves were automatically determined by searching along the first principle direction of geometric moments of hippocampal surfaces (Wang et al., 2011) and were manually inspected for quality control. Next, the holomorphic 1-form was computed. It induced a conformal grid which demonstrated the angle preserving property on the tube-like hippocampal surfaces (Wang et al., 2007) .

With conformal representations , a 3D hippocampus surface can be realized as a 2D image so that general image registration algorithms can be applied. In this study, we carried out a surface fluid registration algorithm (Bro-Nielsen and Gramkow, 1996; D'Agostino et al., 2003) and added an inverse-consistent surface registration framework to increase robustness . The obtained surface registration was guaranteed to be diffeomorphic and thus independent of the order of source and target images.

Radial distance has been applied in several subcortical studies (Gerig et al., 2001; Morra et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 2004) and served as an ideal complement to mTBM statistics for a comprehensive description of the hippocampal structural changes.\nFinally, MMS for each vertex in the individual hippocampal surface was formed as a 4 x 1 vector by combining the mTBM and the radial distance.

On LH, HM had larger atrophic regions than HT (see Figure   5C , D), while in some subregions, HT subjects express deeper LH atrophic than HM (see Figure   5B ).

First, this work was based on cross-sectional MRI analysis and compared the hippocampal morphometries of cognitively unimpaired HM/HT/NC without considering the temporal trends of the hippocampal deformation. In future, we will conduct longitudinal analyses of cognitively unimpaired individuals as well. Second, it would be useful to check and compare the prediction power on subsequent memory decline with our surface multivariate statistics versus hippocampal volumes.\nFor example, our prior work "}, {"section_title": "reported the longitudinal Auditory Verbal Learning", "text": "Test Long-Term-Memory score (AVLT-LTM) as a sensitive measure for detecting accelerated memory decline in subjects with the APOE-e4 allele who were over the age of 50 years. In the present work, we only had cross-sectional AVLT-LTM scales of 117 subjects, and we did not find significant genetic group differences (see Table 1 ). In our future work, we will study the correlations between longitudinal surface-based hippocampal morphometry deformations and AVLT-LTM declines in each genetic groups.

Results showed that the proposed approach encoded a great deal of information that may be inaccessible or overlooked by volume measures. This work found additive APOE-e4 effects on the left hippocampal morphometry of cognitively unimpaired individuals. The results, combined with our previous findings in the ADNI database Li et al., 2016) , support prior reports that the APOE-e4 genotype is associated with accelerated brain deformations along with disease progression, and that these differences can be mapped to morphological changes in subsections of the hippocampal surfaces. The work also demonstrated that our surface-based morphometry analysis may serve as a useful brain imaging marker to study AD induced brain morphometry changes in preclinical AD stage."}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "Highlights \uf0b7 Applied surface-based hippocampal morphometry on cognitively unimpaired subjects. \uf0b7 Our study identified APOE-e4 dose effects on cognitively unimpaired subjects. \uf0b7 Surface-based hippocampal morphometry outperformed the hippocampal volume measure. \uf0b7 Surface-based hippocampal morphometry may be a potential preclinical AD biomarker."}]
