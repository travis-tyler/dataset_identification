This previously unknown disease was later identified as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and named COVID-19. The pandemic has since spread to a total of 213 countries and territories with more than 738,600 deaths among > 20.2 million infected people (by August 10, 2020 -Worldometers) . 1 The spread has been so swift that our general population, public health workers, medical professionals, scientists, and government officers have found it difficult to respond in a coordinated and effective manner. Many countries have taken vastly different but effective approaches to fight the virus, 2 ranging from the complete lock-down observed in Wuhan, China, widespread testing in South Korea, diligent contact tracing from Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong; and a luckily averted initial plan by the UK government to build non-vaccinated natural herd immunity. 3 The United States has taken its own unique approach to combat COVID-19, leaving it largely up to the individual states to implement shelter-in-place and social distancing policies as the coronavirus crisis began to consume the country. The delayed response by the federal government has been critiqued both within the U.S. and around the world and has called into question the ability of the U.S. government to exert global leadership during the pandemic. The U.S. currently holds the record for the highest total numbers of COVID-19 cases (> 5.2 million) and deaths (~ 166,000) in the world (by 08-10-2020). 1 The delayed response to the global crisis and other key missteps in early action have highlighted the fact that the U.S. government needs to: 1) invest more in public health infrastructure; 2) coordinate fiscal and health policy implementation; and, 3) slash the bureaucratic red tape. Although we could not have completely prevented the advent of this virus and its consequences, we can utilize biomarkers (for detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention) as an important tool to address the needs of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis."}, {"section_title": "Importance of biomarkers", "text": "Use of biomarkers are particularly important during our current pandemic state since they can enhance the development and approval of new, innovative drugs and biological products, particularly in the field of vaccines. Clinical biomarkers are generally defined as the measurable biological indicators of the presence, severity or type of disease in medical settings. 4 Biomarkers can be applied to describe observable characteristics of a certain disease and to determine optimal treatments based on these phenotypes, as well as genotypes, thence, they have received substantial attention. 5 In particular, respiratory disease biomarkers, such as those associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), have been associated with increased mortality (IL-8, ICAM-1) and improved survival (nitric oxide). 6 These biomarkers play a pivotal role in predicting future complications or severity of disease, and could be useful as an indicator for COVID-19 prognosis.\nAs the number of COVID-19 cases has rapidly increased, the amount of scientific publications on COVID-19 research has also grown exponentially. Among the myriad reports of coronavirus investigations and innovations, however, there remains a limited number of publications regarding COVID-19 biomarkers. In this current article, we aim to provide an overview of biomarker applications throughout this pandemic crisis and to review several known and emerging biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 detection, COVID-19 diagnostics, treatment and prognosis, as well as ongoing biomarker development for new drugs and vaccines. 6 of individual atoms.

Its RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length. 7, 8 The four main structural proteins of coronavirus particles are crown-like spike (S-) glycoprotein, membrane (M-) glycoprotein, envelope (E-) protein on the viral surface, and nucleocapsid (N-) protein ( Figure 1a) . 7, 9 Among the known viral proteins, M-and E-proteins form a ball protecting the RNA genetic core, which is wrapped by the N-protein in a \"beads-on-a-string\" type conformation. The S-protein is responsible for facilitating entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the target cell, forming protrusions that can bind to receptors on target cells for infection and giving the virus a crown-like shape, hence the name \"coronavirus\". A detailed observation of the S-protein structure and sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome provide indications of the origin of this mysterious new coronavirus: the bat. 10 "}, {"section_title": "The origin of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "There have been a host of different theories surrounding the original source of SARS-CoV-2. One persistent myth of how the new coronavirus entered the human world is that it originated from a research laboratory. Scientists, however, remain firm that the virus was transmitted from the natural selection in the environment. It is evident that the virus originated in bats, then expanded to an unknown intermediate carrier before finally jumping to the human population. 11 Multiple analyses of the viral S-protein structure and genome sequence suggest that the intermediate host responsible for passing the SARS-CoV-2 from bats to human is pangolins. 10, 12 Additionally, a new RmYN02 virus, recently discovered in bats, contains insertions of amino acids in its spike protein that are similar to SARS-CoV-2, providing further evidence to support the natural evolution of SARS-CoV-2. 13 Thus, many scientists agree the proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus, but a result of natural selection. 11 "}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 entry required factors", "text": "Like all other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells through an interaction between the spike protein (S-protein) on the viral particle surface and a receptor protein on the membrane of the host cell. Once inside, the virus hijacks the cell's reproductive machinery to produce more viral copies to eventually infect more cells. Structural analysis has suggested that the receptor for the virus is a protein called the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). 11, 14, 15 SARS-CoV-2 often requires cofactors, furin and TMPRSS2, two protein-cleaving enzymes that enable cellular infection by cleaving the viral S-protein and activating it for virus-cell fusion ( Figure 1b) . 16, 17 Additionally, furin plays an important role in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, which is distinctly different than SARS-CoV. 18 Several other protein-protein interactions have been reported between SARS-CoV-2 and human host cells that could potentially be targets for COVID-19 treatment. 19 2.4 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as potential therapeutic targets SARS-CoV-2 entry, which is heavily dependent on the human ACE2 receptor and serine protease TMPRSS2, has been shown to be blocked in vitro by a serine protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate. 14 This finding suggests that the viral S-protein and cellular TMPRSS2 could be potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Examples of possible therapies include antibodies (convalescent or recombinant) against the spike protein and camostat-like protease inhibitors."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "ACE2 receptors to direct SARS-CoV-2 away from vulnerable host cells.

Due to the role that ACE2 plays in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, there has been a growing concern that anti-hypertensive medications such as ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) could affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19 ( Figure 1c ). 21 This concern is two-fold: 1) ACEIs could potentially inhibit ACE2 due to the high degree of sequence similarity between ACE and ACE2; and, 2) the use of ACEIs and ARBs could increase expression of ACE2, rendering patients more susceptible to viral host cell entry and propagation. Although a prior study has shown that ACEIs in clinical use did not directly affect ACE2 activity, 25 the significance of ACE2 expression on COVID-19 pathogenesis and mortality is still unclear and warrants further investigation. 21, 22 2.6 ACE2 expression in susceptible cell types and at-risk human populations SARS-CoV-2 viral tropism: Respiratory cells are vulnerable to coronavirus infection because they express ACE2, which engages the viral S-protein, and TMPRSS2, which helps merge virus and target cell membranes. ACE2 is known to be expressed in the human nose, lungs, heart, kidneys, intestines, brain, and testicles ( Figure 2 ). 26 Results from multiple studies have indicated that the higher the ACE2 (or its expression) level is, the higher the COVID-19 risk. Recent analyses from single-cell sequencing datasets support the idea that COVID-19 is not just a respiratory disease but can also affect the gastrointestinal tract, the nervous system, and other organs in the body (e.g. strokes, blood clots, hypoxia, and cardiovascular complications), thus explaining the multifaceted nature of COVD-19 infection. 27 However, which cells are the most vulnerable and who is at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection? Vulnerable cell types: SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted between people through respiratory droplets from the nose and lungs where some specific cell types have been identified as likely initial infection sites. Using single-nuclei and single-cell RNA sequencing, one study reported that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are most richly expressed in bronchial transient secretory cells among diverse cell types in respiratory tissues ( Figure 2 ). 28 Similarly, another study analyzed the expression of viral entry-associated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes and found high expressions in nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet and ciliated cells in the nose (Figure 2 ). 29 These results were further confirmed by a larger study. 30 Besides cells in the respiratory system, cells in the eyes and some other organs also contain the critical viral-entry proteins. For instance, gastrointestinal cells are loaded with ACE2. A new study carried out in 3D models showed that SARS-CoV-2 could infect organoid cells not only from the airway, but also the gut. 31 Despite that, it remains unclear whether intestinal cells could actually get infected and produce viral particles. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in human stool long after respiratory symptoms resolved and gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients are prevalent, which suggests that the gut could be a likely reservoir, indicating the potential of transmission via the fecal-oral route."}, {"section_title": "Susceptible human populations:", "text": "Interestingly, studies also indicated that ACE2 receptor density in bronchial cells is higher with age, and in men compared with women, which correlates to the higher infection rates in seniors and males as reported from epidemiological studies. 28 Plasma ACE2 has also been reported at a much higher level in men than in women. 32 Notably, the gene encoding ACE2 protein is X-linked and is expressed at a particularly high level in the testes, which could explain the gender differential observed in infection and mortality. 33 Moreover, ACE2 gene expression in nasal epithelium, reported as age-dependent, is significantly lower in younger children than adults, which may explain why COVID-19 is less prevalent in children. 34 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f"}, {"section_title": "Epigenetics of ACE2", "text": "The COVID-19 symptoms for infected individuals range from no symptoms at all to mild, moderate or severe disease. A few recent studies have pointed to epigenetics explain the difference. One study reports that epigenetic dysregulation of ACE2 and other interferon-regulated cytokine genes may increase COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in lupus patients. 43 A separate study has reported that DNA methylation patterns associated with the ACE2 gene differ among individuals: by gender in lung tissues, and by age in epithelial cells. 44 In general, epigenetic mechanisms are an important part of the pathophysiology and illness severity of COVID-19. It is not only identified in SARS-CoV-2, but also in other viral infections. 45 When these mechanisms are confirmed, epigenetic interventions influencing DNA methylation could be indicated as primary and/or secondary preventive options besides the current classical epidemic controls."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 Detection and COVID-19 Diagnostics", "text": "Detection refers to the act of identifying disease-specific molecules, molecular changes, or distinct physiological signatures. These detection biomarkers often enable diagnosis of disease and are useful not only for identifying patients, but also for detecting infected carriers who display no symptoms, which is a distinct characteristic of SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that since asymptomatic carriers do not manifest any clinical symptoms, their nucleic acid testing is only a measure of viral detection not the disease diagnosis. For symptomatic COVID-19 patients, meanwhile, the methods described below could serve for both SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis. For readers' convenience, we have summarized these detection methods and their applications in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Biomarkers of viral detection", "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome currently serves as a major biomarker of direct viral detection and the primary COVID-19 diagnosis. Viral proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 could theoretically serve as alternative biomarkers of viral detection, but due to the complexity of protein detection and the significantly larger amount of biological samples required, and are often impractical targets. Many of these viral proteins, however, could serve as potential targets for anti-viral drugs or biomarkers of drug development for COVID-19 treatment, 46 which will be discussed in Section 4. "}, {"section_title": "PCR-based analysis", "text": "The primary method of SARS-CoV-2 detection relies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique widely used in molecular biology to amplify DNA samples. Since the novel coronavirus genome consists of single-stranded RNA, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is commonly required to convert RNA transcripts into complementary DNA (cDNA) in a biological sample. Real-time PCR/RT-PCR enables early, sensitive, and specific viral detection because: 1) it directly detects nucleic acid (e.g., viral RNA); and, 2) it amplifies the genomic material even when only a low level of the viral RNA is present in collected biological samples. 47 At the present, however, current PCR-based methods do not support the testing volume needed for a rapid COVID-19 response. In order to accommodate the higher testing demand, BillionToOne -a precision diagnostics developer -has recently developed a novel assay that utilizes high-throughput Sanger sequencing and machine learning (ML) algorithms to sequence the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, high throughput detection methods such as BillionToOne's new assay, often require a centralized clinical laboratory with high-throughput equipment and well-trained personnel. Thus, point-ofcare diagnostic applications are far more suitable for the simple, rapid, mobile testing that is critical to slow the spread of COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Point-of-care detections", "text": "There are currently many small, rapid and readily usable devices for viral detection that are appealing to healthcare providers. One of the first to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was Cepheid's Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, an automated molecular test that targets multiple regions of the viral genome for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in around 45 minutes. Another assay, the Accula TM System, developed by Mesa Biotech, is a qualitative, visually read test for SARS-CoV-2 with results available in 30 minutes. The quickest point-of-care testing system currently on the market for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, however, is Abbott's ID NOW TM . This unique isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology provides molecular results in just 2-5 minutes, allowing medical workers to make effective clinical decisions much sooner than other testing methods. Recently, however, the accuracy of the Abbott ID NOW test has come under question. 48 A new test, dependent on RT-LAMP (Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification), a technique similar to RT-PCR but amplifies RNA rather than DNA, has been developed by researchers from the Beaumont Health System in Michigan. 49 This method is simpler and cheaper than PCR, since it does not require the repeated heating cycles of PCR, and can detect infection in less than 45 min in urine, blood and saliva."}, {"section_title": "Advanced digital PCR detections", "text": "Recently, Stilla Technologies announced that its digital PCR (dPCR) test, the Naica system, is readily available to all research centers and hospitals involved in the fight against COVID-19. The Naica System reportedly offers a more accurate and sensitive method than RT-PCR, making it possible to cut down on the false negative results that currently hamper efforts to contain the re-emergence of the disease.\nAdditionally, an alternative analysis technique, droplet-digital PCR (ddPCR), with a greater sensitivity than the commonly used qPCR, is being trialed to detect SARS-CoV-2 in spit samples.

This at-home assay depends upon the programming of a 12 CRISPR molecule to pick up the genetic signature of SARS-CoV-2. If the signature is sensed, the CRISPR enzyme is activated and releases a detectable signal, providing results in an hour. Additional CRISPR-based efforts include the University of Connecticut's All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR) 52 for detection and Stanford University's PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR-Cas13 in huMAN cells) for treatment. 53 The latter has been shown to be effective in vitro, although an effective and safe in vivo delivery method into human cells must be developed before therapeutic use. 53 "}, {"section_title": "Antibodies binding to S-protein against viral infection", "text": "In many infected patients, their adaptive immune response will naturally develop antibodies to the spike protein in a process called \"active immunity\". The antibodies bind to the S-protein and \"neutralize\" the virus by preventing it from interacting with ACE2, inhibiting its ability to infect more cells and therefore limiting disease progression. Similarly, this neutralization can also happen through \"passive immunity\" which involves giving patients antibodies against the spike protein as a treatment.\nThus, these antibodies are often used as a biomarker of viral detection, disease diagnosis and treatment. The antibodies to the spike protein can be measured by immunological assays like ELISA (enzymelinked immunosorbent assay), which can detect antibodies, peptides, or proteins to verify the presence of virus in biological samples. ELISA kits are currently being used to detect the viral S-protein and human ACE2 to study the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and its host receptor. 14, 20 The CDC has also developed a S-protein ELISA assay for use in performing contact investigations and conducting large-scale, crosssectional studies to define disease burden in the population via sero-surveillance. 54 For COVID-19, ELISA testing has been employed to: 1) diagnose patients who are more than 1-week post symptom onset, 2) determine potential immunity and risk of infection, 3) advance contact tracing, and 4) understand the extent of COVID-19 spread and immunity in communities through epidemiological studies."}, {"section_title": "Glycan as an emerging biomarker for viral detection", "text": "Both the viral S-protein and the host ACE2 receptor are known to be extensively glycosylated.

The viral S-protein has recently been shown to contain 66 glycosylation sites, 55 each of which can be occupied by up to 10 different glycans when tested with SARS-CoV-2 glycoproteins. 56 Despite this fact, glycans are often overlooked because of their chemical complexity and the limited throughput and sensitivity of existing analytical instruments. A new home-use coronavirus test that utilizes this glycan biology to identify the virus is currently under development by Iceni Diagnostics. Beyond viral detection, the SARS-CoV-2 glycans could be of benefit for COVID-19 drug design. For example, S309, a monoclonal antibody identified from a SARS-CoV-2 survivor, can recognize and interact with glycan epitopes on the spike protein and neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. 57 This novel approach is advantageous since glycans remain relatively constant compared to the viral genetic code, which could be prone to mutation."}, {"section_title": "Biomarkers of COVID-19 Treatment", "text": "Currently, there are no proven drug therapies for treating COVID-19.

This phenomenon seems to indicate that for COVID-19, biological age (how old one's body seems) is just as relevant as chronological age (the number of living years). A good biomarker of biological age takes into account genetics, lifestyle factors, health conditions, and toxic exposures (pathogens or chemicals). The most prominent biomarkers of biological age are the epigenetic clock and the glycan clock. 97 Epigenetic clocks, partially originated from chronological age, include DNA methylation (e.g. GrimAge methylation clock), telomere length and several other models, and have recently been shown to predict prevalence and incidence of leading causes of death and disease. 98 Glycan clocks, associated with unhealthy lifestyle indicators, are also potentially effective tools for biomarker discovery since IgG glycosylation appears to be closely linked with both chronological and biological ages. 99 "}, {"section_title": "COVID-19 recurrence", "text": "There are concerns that patients who recover from COVID-19 may be at risk of reinfection.

Secondary viral infection is characterized by the elevation of SARS-COV-2specific IgG, which is often accompanied by elevated levels of IgM in the majority of the cases. In combination with direct viral RNA detection, these serological antibody (IgM and IgG) tests will give us a spectrum of phenotypic outcomes of a person's current, historical and future status of COVID-19, which is summarized in Table 3 .
