Cerebral microvasculature in AD is consistently shown distorted with endothelial atrophy and pericyte degeneration, 2 and similar capillary affection is shown in most conditions predisposing to stroke. 3 The presence of large-vessel cerebral atherosclerosis is associated with amyloid plaques postmortem, 4 and the neurovascular unit and blood-brain barrier are disrupted in both CVD and AD, leading in turn to neurochemical imbalance. 5 White-matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are characterized by demyelination and axonal rarefaction, and are used as surrogate markers of small vessel CVD. 6 Though associated with lower levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid \u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b242) (and other amyloid precursor protein metabolites), 7 hypoxia is known to upregulate \u03b2-secretase activity and is associated with amyloid deposition and neuritic plaque formation. 8 Hippocampal atrophy in CVD is well described in patients with and without evidence of amyloid plaques, 9 and up to 50% of poststroke patients will develop dementia. 10 The hippocampus consists of several histologically heterogeneous subregions: the cornu ammonis (CA) comprising sectors 1 to 4 and the dentate gyrus (DG). AD typically involves atrophy of the hippocampal complex (the hippocampus and interconnected subhippocampal entorhinal (ERC) and perirhinal (PRC) cortices), and recent reports suggest selective and consecutive vulnerability of pertinent hippocampal complex substructures (HCSs) and cerebral cognitive networks. 11 Substantial atrophy of ERC layer II is seen in very mild AD, 12 and ensuing degeneration of the perforant pathway (originating in this layer and a major hippocampal input for memory processing) is important in hippocampal neocortical deafferentation. 13 ERC atrophy is also a predictor of deterioration from mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a heterogeneous clinical condition associated with an increased risk of dementia 14 ) to Alzheimer's dementia, 15 but whether neurons within the HCS are similarly affected in CVD and early-stage AD remains an open question.\nEarly-stage neurofibrillary pathology is seen in the medial temporal lobe, first affecting the PRC, then the ERC, 16 before moving on to the hippocampus (first appearing in CA1). Both CSF total microtubule-associated protein tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (P-tau) are established biomarkers of AD neurofibrillary pathology, but T-tau is an unspecific marker of neurite damage (and increased in both AD and poststroke), whereas increased P-tau is considered AD specific. 17 To reveal putative interacting or distinct pathways for HCS atrophy and cognitive affection in predementia AD and CVD, we included healthy controls, poststroke cases, and patients with MCI (stratified according to CSF A\u03b242 levels into amyloid-positive MCI and all-cause MCI) to answer the following research questions (RQ): RQ 1: Are there differences in HCS size between the three groups?\nRQ 2: Is WMH load related to HCS atrophy? RQ 3: Are the CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242, T-tau, and P-tau) related to HCS size?

Spouses of participating patients were potentially eligible as controls provided clinically established normality with regard to memory, emotionality, and tempo. The inclusion procedure adheres to the Petersen criteria and is extensively documented elsewhere. 18 Stroke patients were recruited from a university-hospital based stroke unit. Inclusion criteria for these patients were cortical and lacunar ischemic infarctions, between 40 and 79 years of age, and mini-mental state examination 19 (MMSE) score \u2a7e 23, no severe problems of language, and visual/auditory neglect. Exclusion criteria were a history of somatic or psychiatric disorder including depression. Only patients who agreed to undergo CSF sampling were included. Thirty-seven poststroke subjects fulfilled these criteria, but ten were excluded due to pathologic CSF A\u03b242 (see Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers). MCI is a heterogeneous condition, and subtypes exhibit differing patterns of atrophy. 20 This underlines the importance of excluding subjects with non-AD MCI.

Thirty-four of these subjects assented and successfully underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (on a different scanner). Normality with regard to memory, emotionality, and tempo (as with the primary control group) was established in a subsequent clinical interview. Three subjects were excluded due to pathologic CSF A\u03b242, and five subjects were excluded due to cognitive complaints, leaving twenty-six subjects for the secondary control group.\nThe patient populations and the primary control group were directly comparable, but CSF was not available for the primary control group (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ).\nAll subjects gave their written consent, and the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethic South-East evaluated (based on the Norwegian Health and Research Act and the Helsinki Declaration of 1964; revised 2013) and approved the study.

Chisquare tests were used to assess gender composition within the groups.

Linear regression was used to correct for age and gender (across the three groups as a whole), and the residuals were used in further statistical computations.

Visual inspection of the histograms and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess whether the resulting residuals were normally distributed.

Further, because the amyloid-positive MCI group was already split according to CSF A\u03b242 levels (and there are no indications that variations of already below threshold CSF A\u03b242 should correlate with HCS size), we chose to use the all-cause MCI subgroup (i.e., MCI not split according to CSF A\u03b242 levels) for this particular RQ.

The main finding of this study is that the hippocampal complex is similarly affected poststroke and in early-stage AD, but there are different associations with WMH and CSF biomarkers. Also, we find a significantly higher WMH load poststroke compared with controls and amyloidpositive MCI. All examined HCSs were smaller in amyloid-positive MCI than in controls, and the presubiculum and the subiculum were smaller in poststroke than in controls. Neuropsychological measures of memory were reduced in amyloid-positive MCI as compared with controls, and measures of psychomotor speed and executive function were reduced in both poststroke and amyloidpositive MCI as compared with controls. Poststroke (but not MCI) WMH load correlated with total hippocampal and size of the presubiculum, PRC and ERC. In both poststroke and amyloidpositive MCI, there were several correlations between measures of neuropsychological function and both WMH load and hippocampal volume. Strikingly, in amyloid-positive MCI, there was a strong correlation between WMH load and the archetypal AD type impairment delayed recall.\nThe present results support previous reports that both CVD 9 and AD cause medial temporal lobe atrophy. Although the patterns of medial temporal lobe atrophy in MCI and CVD are similar, there are differential associations with WMHs and CSF biomarkers. In terms of medial temporal atrophy, CVD is important in poststroke patients but has a minor role in amyloid-positive MCI. Vice versa, CSF biomarker pathology is important in MCI, but not in stroke. The hippocampal complex is vulnerable due to plasticity, neuronal projections, transmitter systems, and oxygen demand. There are high concentrations of NMDA receptors, the presubiculum has consistently been identified with strong acetylcholine staining, and several other diseases (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and schizophrenia) are associated with hippocampal degeneration. 29 Neurofibrillary pathology appears early in the hippocampal complex, 16 and soluble amyloid oligomers are neurotoxic. 17 As such, pre-plaque A\u03b2 induced hippocampal complex degeneration is possible (also in the poststroke group). A\u03b2 accumulates around and affects perivascular cells, and amyloid angiopathy is present in a majority of cases. Brain amyloid is in equilibrium with amyloid in CSF and plasma, and can be transported both ways across the blood-brain barrier. Damage to the neurovascular unit and the blood-brain barrier may disrupt this equilibrium. 5 Putatively (in CVD) this may cause or worsen pre-plaque amyloid dysmetabolism, or (in AD) amyloid dysmetabolism may cause or worsen impairment of cerebrovascular autoregulation; adding to the pathogenetic load. Further research must determine the exact underlying mechanisms and which factors predispose plaque deposition and which factors cause accelerated spreading of neurofibrillary pathology. Analyses of variance do not show significant differences in age between groups; F(2,93) = 0.705, P = 0.497. Chi-square tests do not show any significant difference in gender composition within the control (\u03c7 2 = 0.220, df = 1, P = 0.639) or MCI (\u03c7 2 = 1.286, df = 1, P = 0.257) groups, but there are significantly more men in the poststroke group (\u03c7 2 = 8.333, df = 1, P = 0.004).\nc WMHs = White matter hyperintensities.

"}, {"section_title": "Hippocampal atrophy in poststroke and MCI P Selnes et al", "text": "In line with the current findings, a recent neuropathological study did not find reduced neuronal volumes in the ERC (layer V) poststroke. 30 The current methodology has not allowed for testing the integrity of the perforant path per se, but with ERC atrophy in the MCI group, one should expect degeneration of the perforant path with ensuing partial hippocampal deafferentation. This may contribute to hippocampal subfield atrophy in the MCI group, but in the poststroke group, we see presubicular and subicular atrophy in the absence of discernible amyloid pathology and ERC atrophy, suggesting other mechanisms. We do, however, see a clear correlation between WMH load and PRC and ERC size in the poststroke group, suggesting that these anterior subhippocampal areas are affected in a manner not readily detected by the presently applied methodology. Alternatively, the observed hippocampal complex atrophy in the poststroke cases may be explained by impaired hippocampal microcirculation due to local capillary affection or reduced neocortical hippocampal input due to WMH-associated projection fiber damage not related to ERC atrophy. CA1 is the first hippocampal subfield in which neurofibrillary pathology appears, 16 and several neuropathological (discussed in Lim et al 31 and La Joie et al 32 ) studies have shown CA1 atrophy in Alzheimer's dementia, whereas not in preclinical (i.e., until death cognitively intact subjects fulfilling neuropathological criteria) AD. 33 One study even reported hypertrophy of CA1 34 in preclinical AD. Morphometric studies have shown that CA1 and subicular atrophy can predict progression to dementia from MCI and the cognitively normal. 35 Other studies using the same hippocampal segmentation technique in predementia Mann-Whitney U = 240, P = 0.002 compared with controls, Mann-Whitney U = 184, P = 0.004 compared with MCI. populations 31, 36 did not report CA1 atrophy. The present MCI group differs in being amyloid positive, and it is not surprising to see more extensive atrophy. We do, however, not find CA1 atrophy or a correlation between WMH and CA1 size in the poststroke group. Discernible CA1 atrophy may not occur at the earliest predementia stages, or this may be related to naming conventions and how different segmentation techniques define the boundaries between the different structures; parts of what herein is defined as subiculum in other techniques have been labeled CA1 (as discussed in Lim et al 31 and La Joie et al 32 and below). The presubiculum and the subiculum are nevertheless consistently found to be among the most affected hippocampal subfields in AD. 37 Two studies utilizing the same hippocampal segmentation as the present publication on amnestic MCI found subicular and both presubicular and subicular atrophy as compared with controls respectively, 31, 36 similar to our findings in poststroke. When comparing neuropathological and imaging findings, it is important to note that the definition of the CA1-subiculum boundary is particularly inconsistent across neuroimaging studies. 32 The parcellation procedure used here is among the conservative procedures in estimating CA1 volume. A wedgeshaped portion of the CA1 (often confusingly called the prosubiculum, and known for a particularly high density of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques) extends into the subiculum, 16 and is likely herein segmented as part of the subiculum. This highlights central problems in MRI studies of the hippocampus and the most important limitation of the present study. Due to limited MRI resolution, it is difficult to accurately map histoanatomic areas, and naming conventions differ in terms of both microstructural histologic delineation and folding patterns. This makes cross-study comparison difficult particularly for hippocampal subsegmentation procedures. There is, however, an extensive effort of harmonizing a manual protocol for hippocampal segmentation that has just been validated and published by EADC-ADNI, 38 but there is still much work before a unified parcellation scheme can be agreed on. It should be noted that also manual delineation has its own problems, e.g., the segmentations are typically more consistent in the plane they were drawn and different operators make different but repeated errors. A recent study comparing the reproducibility of hippocampal volume change measurement between manual outlining and common automated methods 39 found similar measures of volume change but superior reproducibility in FreeSurfer.\nAlthough all segmentations were manually inspected and the image and segmentation quality and consistency were deemed good, the segmentation procedure was automated and not performed on ultra-high field strength, high-resolution MRI and segmented according to a harmonized protocol. When choosing hippocampal subregions of interest, we only included the larger structures with the best Dice overlap measures with manual delineation. 22 Nevertheless, when interpreting the results from the present study it should be noted that the subiculum is most likely overestimated on the expense of CA1, and that there does not exist a generally accepted protocol for subsegmenting the hippocampus.\nIn poststroke, the anterior part of the hippocampus is smaller than in controls and in particular the anterior subhippocampal areas (ERC and PRC) correlate (inversely) with WMH load. At the present stage, the hippocampal affection is more advanced than ERC and PRC, and there is a borderline significant correlation between delayed recall of story (context-rich) and WMH load, whereas not between WMH load and delayed word list recall (context free). This is in line with the supposition that anterior subhippocampal areas are important in context-free (or episodic) memory whereas the hippocampus is thought to be important in context-rich memory. 40 The observation that, in the poststroke group, delayed recall of story memory is strongly correlated with total hippocampal volume (with a smaller, only trend significant correlation for delayed word list memory) further underlines this (Table 6 ).\nIn MCI, the relatively moderate WMH load is most strongly (inversely) correlated with the early AD-specific context-free word list memory. Even though WMH does not seem to be a major factor in in the majority of MCI cases, its occurrence adds to the archetypal AD type impairment of context-free (episodic) memory. In line with this, a recent study 9 found that an amyloid-PET positive subgroup of patients with subcortical vascular dementia performed worse on neuropsychological tests and had more Table 6 . Within-group Spearman correlations between relative hippocampal volume (corrected for age and gender) and T scores of extensive hippocampal atrophy (but were also older, mean age 79.5 vs. 71.9 years) than the amyloid-PET negative subgroup. Although we have included CSF Tau biomarker data also for the stroke group, lumbar puncture was performed at a time when CSF Tau (but not A\u03b242) levels are expected to be increased due to acute stroke. 17 Also, it is not known whether very early atrophy presumptively due to neurofibrillary pathology would be reflected in CSF Tau levels.\nA limitation that also needs to be addressed is the relatively moderate WMH load in the MCI group as compared with poststroke. It could be construed that with a more extensive WMH load, the effects on the hippocampal complex would be more pronounced. The relative sparseness of WMH in a memoryclinic recruited MCI population is nevertheless important to note, but even though on the same volume level as controls, WMH does affect neuropsychological function in MCI.\nIn conclusion, we show similar patterns of HCS atrophy in CVD and amyloid-positive MCI. Different associations with WMHs and CSF biomarkers underline the separate etiologies. The effects of WMHs on neuropsychological function are in line with mounting evidence for a mechanistic link between primary AD pathology and small vessel disease (e.g., putatively reciprocal effects of hypoperfusion and AD pathophysiology 2, 3 or effects of hypoxia on amyloid metabolism 7, 8 ), strengthening the connection between the two entities. The similarities in patterns of structural affection may, however, limit the applicability of structural scans for differential diagnosis of predementia cognitive affection."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "PS contributed to the conception and design of the study, acquisition of data, analyzed the data, and contributed to the interpretation of the data.
