[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract The combined effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), obesity, and elevated visceral adipose tissue (VAT) on brain structure are unknown. In a cross-sectional analysis of Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) participants, we determined associations between HIV serostatus, adiposity, and brain structure. Men (133 HIV+, 84 HIV-) in the MACS Cardiovascular 2 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) substudies with CT-quantified VAT and whole brain MRI measured within 1 year were assessed. Voxel-based morphometry analyzed brain volumes. Men were stratified by elevated (eVAT, \u2265100cm 2 ) or \"normal\" (nVAT, <100cm 2 ) VAT. Forward stepwise modeling determined associations between clinical and demographic variables and regional brain volumes. eVAT was present in 67% of men. Groups were similar in age and education, but eVAT men were more likely to be HIV+ and have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, body mass index >25 kg/m 2 , smaller gray and white matter volumes, and larger cerebrospinal fluid volume than nVAT men. In multivariate analysis, hypertension, higher adiponectin, higher interleukin-6, age, diabetes mellitus, higher body mass index, and eVAT were associated with brain atrophy (p < 0.05, ordered by increasing strength of association), but HIV serostatus and related factors were generally not. No interactions were observed. Greater VAT was associated with smaller bilateral posterior hippocampus and left mesial temporal lobe and temporal stem white matter volume. Traditional risk factors are more strongly associated with brain atrophy than HIV serostatus, with VAT having the strongest association. However, HIV+ MACS men had disproportionately greater VAT, suggesting the risk for central nervous system effects may be amplified in this population."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Cognitive decline and structural brain changes have been described among HIV-infected persons on and off antiretroviral therapy (ART). In the absence of ART, dementia onset is associated with progression to AIDS. With suppressive ART, more subtle forms of neurocognitive decline are more common than frank dementia (Heaton et al. 2010; Sacktor et al. 2002) , and cognitive decline likely results from a combination of traditional (age, diabetes, vascular disease, obesity), HIV-and ART-specific risk factors (Ances et al. 2012; Cysique and Brew 2009) . With improved control of HIV, white matter abnormalities (which are associated with cognitive impairment) have also declined in this population. Petito et al. 1986) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived volumetric analysis is a robust method for assessing brain integrity (Paul et al. 2008) . While structural changes occur prior to measurable cognitive decline (Clark et al. 2012) , we and others have demonstrated that brain atrophy correlates with poorer neurocognitive performance in HIV-infected persons (Becker et al. 2012; Cohen et al. 2010) . In the general population, visceral adiposity and obesity have been associated with declines in cognitive function and brain volume (Debette et al. 2010; Ho et al. 2010; Kanaya et al. 2009 ). In persons with well-controlled HIV infection, visceral adiposity and generalized obesity are common problems (Jacobson et al. 2005; Sculier et al. 2014; Sharma et al. 2014) ; however, the contribution of metabolic disease, including obesity and lipohypertrophy, to structural brain changes in HIV-infected persons is not well defined.\nWe designed a cross-sectional analysis of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) who underwent both MRI structural brain imaging and computed tomography (CT)-quantified abdominal adipose tissue measurement within a 12-month period. We predicted that there would be independent effects of HIV serostatus, ART, and abdominal fat deposition on brain structure in this convenience sample of men living with or at risk for HIV infection."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "The MACS began in 1984 to study the natural history of HIV infection among men who have sex with men and to establish a repository of biologic specimens for future study (Kaslow et al. 1987) .

Of note, men enrolled in CVD2 are generally similar to the larger MACS cohort. In 2011 and 2012, CT-quantified visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area measurements were obtained on CVD2 participants. Also in 2011, MRI brain examinations were performed on a subset of CVD2 participants, including high-resolution anatomic sequences.

MRI data were first processed through a non-parametric, non-uniform intensity normalization (Boyes et al. 2008; Sled et al. 1998) to reduce between-scan and between-site differences. We used a normal template image created with the Template-O-Matic (TOM8) toolbox using 68 randomly selected, HIV-uninfected men from the Information eXtraction from Images (IXI) Project (whose age distribution mimics the controls in this analysis) and estimated the prior probabilities of each tissue class (i.e., gray matter [GM], white matter [WM], cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] ) for use in the segmentation routines . We then used the voxel-based morphometry-8 (VBM8) toolbox SPM12 (http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm8/vbm8_spm12_r442.zip) for affine-registration, normalization, and segmentation of the data. The resulting GM maps were modulated to render the values in each of the 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm voxels as a volume, which were then smoothed using an 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 mm Gaussian filter to reduce the effects of registration error and render the data more amenable to parametric analysis. Because participants were scanned at different sites (and on two different model scanners), we also entered three binary dummy variables to adjust for possible between-site differences. We also adjusted for enrollment cohort effect. For all analyses, the default threshold for reporting statistical significance was set at a false discovery rate of p \u2264 0.05, with an extent threshold of 100 voxels (Genovese et al. 2002) .

The mean whole brain image created from the HIV-uninfected participants was used to project all study findings.\nUnivariate associations between clinical and demographic characteristics and brain volume were then determined. After determining brain regions of interest for key variables, we extracted eigenvariates from the three largest regions associated with VAT and the two largest associated with BMI (Table 2 ). These individual volumes were extracted from 4-mm radius spheres centered on the peak voxel within each of the five regions of interest. We then used stepwise forward regression (p < 0.05 for model inclusion) to regress these five values on significant predictor variables from the univariate analysis in the following order: age, race (white vs non-white), diabetes, hypertension, BMI (<30 vs \u226530 kg/m 2 ), VAT (<100 vs \u2265100 cm 2 ), log IL-6, and adiponectin levels as continuous variables and HIV serostatus.

Older age was associated with atrophy in the cingulate gyrus (including the precuneus and the anterior cingulate), insula, medial and superior frontal gyri, and middle temporal gyrus (Table 2 , Fig. 1) . BMI was significantly associated with volume in the right caudate nucleus and the left inferior frontal gyrus. VAT area, by contrast, was associated with volume in the superior temporal gyrus, insula, and right caudate nucleus. HIV serostatus was associated with smaller total GM and caudate volume. There were no interactions between HIV serostatus and any factors associated with body habitus.\nIn the regions associated with VAT area in univariate analysis (superior temporal gyrus, insula, and caudate nucleus), VAT area remained a significant predictor of these volumes after controlling for age, BMI, waist circumference, diabetes, hypertension, and adiponectin, leptin and log IL-6 levels ( Table 3 ). Caudate nucleus volume was significantly associated with the presence of diabetes. In multivariate analysis, the effect of HIV serostatus on total GM volume was smaller and no longer statistically significant. Only a region of the caudate nucleus remained significantly associated with HIV infection after controlling for age, study site, BMI, and VFA. No other covariates demonstrated significant associations in these brain regions. Further, in an HIV-restricted analysis, no significant correlations between regional brain volumes and current or nadir CD4 + T lymphocyte count, or current or peak plasma HIV-1 RNA were apparent (all r's <0.17).\nOlder age and white race were significantly associated with same brain regions as BMI (right caudate nucleus and left inferior frontal gyrus [BA11]).

These data also highlight the importance of traditional risk factor management in the prevention of chronic, noninfectious comorbid disease in treated HIV infection. In fact, in this analysis, we observed relationships between BMI and brain volume in participants with a mean age of 55 that were similar but attenuated compared to relationships we previously described in HIV-uninfected populations over the age of 65 Ho et al. 2011; Raji et al. 2010) , suggesting a cumulative adverse effect of obesity on brain volume over time. Further, complicating this relationship is the observation that HIV-infected men may have greater VAT relative to BMI, particularly when clinical lipodystrophy is present (Brown et al. 2009; Joy et al. 2008 ; Study of Fat and Metabolic Change in 2006), a finding we also observed in this cohort. As such, it has been hypothesized that a higher prevalence of eVAT may contribute to both increased risk for and earlier onset of neurologic disease in HIV-infected persons on ART compared to HIV-uninfected controls (Mateen et al. 2012) . Similarly, because VAT may be elevated in the face of a \"normal\" BMI among HIV-infected men, BMI may not be a clinically sufficient surrogate for visceral adiposity burden in this population.\nThere is a potential link between visceral adiposity, chronic inflammation, and brain atrophy: HIV infection is characterized by immune activation and systemic inflammation that persists in the face of suppressive ART (Baker et al. 2011) , and chronic systemic inflammation has been associated with neuro-inflammation, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline, particularly in the hippocampus (Daulatzai 2014) . In fact, poorer neurocognitive function has been significantly linked to abdominal obesity (as measured by waist circumference), systemic inflammation (high IL-6 levels), and immune activation in plasma (high soluble CD14 levels) and CSF (high soluble CD40L levels) in HIV-infected persons with plasma HIV-1 RNA <1000 copies/mL (Sattler et al. 2014) . Additionally, in older adults, higher IL-6 levels have been associated with poorer executive function (Mooijaart et al. 2013; Schram et al. 2007) . In this analysis, higher log IL-6 levels were associated with greater caudate nucleus atrophy particularly among HIV-infected men. Among the HIV-infected men, the relationship between IL-6 and brain volume was more complex, and likely affected by both cohort sampling difference and selective survival bias from the early days of the HIV epidemic (data not shown). However, these data support a relationship between chronic systemic inflammation and brain atrophy.\nAnother possible mediating link between visceral adiposity and brain atrophy is adipocytokine imbalance. In HIV-infected persons, visceral adiposity is associated with decreased growth hormone and adiponectin levels (Diaz-Delfin et al. 2013) . Leptin levels are suppressed in HIV-associated lipodystrophy but elevated in generalized obesity (Paruthi et al. 2013; Sinha et al. 2012) , and both growth hormone and leptin replacement therapy decrease VAT in HIV-infected persons (Diaz-Delfin et al. 2013; Mulligan et al. 2009 ). Adiponectin is preferentially produced by VAT, whereas leptin is preferentially produced by (Gustafson 2010) , and adipokine homeostasis could be important for maintaining cognitive function. Supporting this hypothesis are the findings that lower adiponectin and leptin levels are associated with cognitive impairment and brain atrophy (Kamogawa et al. 2010; Lieb et al. 2009; Narita et al. 2009 ). Additionally, adiponectin may variably serve proand anti-inflammatory roles Tomizawa et al. 2008) . In this analysis, adiponectin and leptin were not significantly associated with regional brain volume, although any effect might have been overshadowed by the effect of VAT area. This study has several limitations. First, it represents a cross-sectional analysis, and therefore cannot account for longitudinal changes in risk factors overtime. However, the MACS is a well-described cohort of HIV-infected and HIVuninfected men, and both the HIV-uninfected control group and the sample size are strengths of this analysis. Another limitation is that our findings may not be generalizable to women or ART-na\u00efve HIV-infected persons; however, our findings support those observed in the general population, which enhances generalizability.\nIn conclusion, increased VAT area, obesity, and higher log IL-6 levels were associated with regional brain atrophy in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men in the MACS. These findings are consistent with previously published studies in the general population, but have not previously been reported among HIV-infected persons. Additionally, HIV-and ARTspecific risk factors did not predict brain atrophy. However, since HIV infection is a chronic inflammatory state and ARTtreated, HIV-infected persons may have higher VAT-to-BMI ratios than HIV-uninfected persons; these findings may be important for clinical risk factor management and prevention of cognitive decline in HIV-infected adults on suppressive ART.
