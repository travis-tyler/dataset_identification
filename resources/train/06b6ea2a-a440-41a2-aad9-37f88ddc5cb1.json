Previous studies have shown that A\u242442 and tau protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 1 region-specific fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) uptake using positron emission tomography (PET), 2 and hippocampal volume using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 3 were markers associated with AD. Postmortem examinations further demonstrated that the burden of AD pathology was reflected by the antemortem A\u242442 level in CSF, 4 the region-specific FDG uptake using PET, 5 and the hippocampal volume using MRI, 6 which suggests that these markers are indicative of the altered biological states in AD.\nAlthough lower levels of A\u242442 in CSF are associated with the risk of incipient AD, 7 CSF biomarkers appear to be relatively stable over time within individuals. 8, 9 Greater hippocampal atrophy rates measured by serial MRI correlated with faster cognitive decline in normal aging For editorial comment see page 1237 CME available online at www.jamaarchivescme.com and questions on page 1236\nand early conversion to dementia in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in previous studies. [10] [11] [12] [13] Several longitudinal FDG-PET studies also suggested that regional hypometabolism predicted clinical progression or conversion to AD. [14] [15] [16] [17] Because these time-varying biomarkers as well as the APOE4 gene are all associated with AD or cognitive impairment, it is conceivable that they are correlated with one another.

We first delineated the trajectories of different biomarkers and used repeated measures linear regression (an exchangeable, working-within-subject correlation model via a generalized estimating equation) 28 to estimate population average rates of change in levels of CSF proteins, FDG-PET regions of interest, hippocampal volume, as well as ADAS-cog scores for participants with NC, MCI, or AD.\nTo account for the residual correlation due to repeated measures on the same subject, we could have also used a more parametric, mixed-model approach. However, given that our focus was on the average rate of change in biomarkers (and not on the variance components), and because we wanted to derive a robust inference (standard errors not sensitive to the specified correlation model), we chose the generalized estimating equation approach rather than a parametric maximum likelihood approach. 29 Time-varying biomarkers were treated as the outcome and modeled by time and baseline age in the regression. In these models, a significant time coefficient indicated a nonzero rate of change. We also made intergroup comparisons of rates of change. In a separate analysis, we included APOE4 allele carrier status in the model to evaluate its influence on the rate of change for each biomarker, reflected by the coefficient of the interaction term (APOE4\u03ebtime).\nWe then examined the relation between the change of cognitive function and the change of different biomarkers. Timevarying ADAS-cog scores were treated as the outcome of interest and modeled by time and the change in biomarkers after adjusting for baseline age and baseline biomarker value. Values of R 2 were calculated for each longitudinal model to represent the goodness of fit or the extent to which the marginal variance of cognitive function was explained by the model. Models differed by biomarker of interest and sample size because only a limited number of participants had all 3 biomarkers available. We conducted model comparisons by restricting participants to those with 2 biomarkers available (A\u242442 level in CSF and FDG uptake; A\u242442 level in CSF and hippocampal volume; or FDG uptake and hippocampal volume) so as to make models more comparable. All statistical analyses and graphics were performed in R version 2.11.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The demographic features of all participants are summarized in Table 1 . The sample size declined over time, and the number of repeated measures available for longitudinal analysis varied across different biomarkers and diagnostic groups ( Table 2 ). The A\u242442 level in CSF (measured in units of picograms per milliliter per month) appeared to decrease faster in participants with NC (\u22120.46 pg/mL/mo) than in participants with MCI (\u22120.26 pg/mL/ mo) or AD (\u22120.29 pg/mL/mo), but intergroup differences were not significant; changes in total tau and phosphorylated tau levels in CSF for the most part were not significantly different from zero (Table 2 ). Brain regional glucose metabolic decline (measured in units of normalized intensity per month) was significantly slower in participants with NC (\u22127.4\u03eb 10 \u22124 normalized intensity per month) than in participants with MCI (\u22121.9\u03eb10 \u22123 normalized intensity per month) or AD (\u22124.2\u03eb10 \u22123 normalized intensity per month) and slower in participants with MCI than in participants with AD ( Table 2 ). The rate of MRI hippocampal atrophy (measured in units of cubic millimeters per month) was also significantly slower in participants with NC (\u22122.95 mm 3 /mo) than in participants with MCI (\u22125.52 mm 3 /mo) or AD (\u22128.01 mm 3 / mo) and slower in participants with MCI than in participants with AD (Table 2) . Cognitive function assessed by the ADAS-cog declined (increased in ADAS-cog score) in participants with MCI and declined even faster in participants AD, but it improved (decreased in ADAS-cog score) a little in participants with NC. The hypothetical average changes of these biomarkers and the ADAS-cog scores for a 75-year-old person in the 3 diagnostic groups are illustrated in our Figure. The associations between APOE4 status and the baseline value of biomarkers were significant in the NC group for A\u242442 level in CSF and FDG uptake and in the MCI group for all 3 biomarkers ( Table 3) . Positive APOE4 status did not appear to modify the rate of change in the A\u242442 level in CSF or glucose metabolism in all 3 groups, but it accelerated hippocampal atrophy in the MCI and AD groups.\nFor participants with NC, although changes in cognitive function were not captured by any of these timevarying biomarkers, A\u242442 level in CSF (R 2 = 0.12) appeared to better explain the total variance of ADAS-cog scores over time than did FDG uptake (R 2 =0.07) or MRI hippocampal volume (R 2 =0.03) ( Table 4) . For participants with MCI, changes in cognitive function were associated with all of these biomarkers, such that cognitive decline (increase in ADAS-cog score) was associated with the decrease in the A\u242442 level in the CSF, FDG-PET regional metabolism, and MRI hippocampal volume. Cognitive function at the MCI stage was about equally well modeled by FDG uptake (R 2 =0.18) and hippocampal volume (R 2 =0.16). For participants with mild AD, cognitive decline was still captured by FDG uptake and hippocampal volume, but not by the A\u242442 level in CSF. The variance of the ADAS-cog score during the course of dementia seemed better modeled by FDG uptake (R 2 =0.36) than by hippocampal volume (R 2 =0.19). We further conducted head-to-head comparisons in sample-size matched groups (A\u242442 level in CSF vs FDG uptake; A\u242442 level in CSF vs hippocampal volume; and FDG uptake vs hippocampal volume), and their relative contributions to model cognitive decline remained largely unchanged (eTable; http://www.archneurol.com)."}, {"section_title": "COMMENT", "text": "Annualized changes in the biomarkers of the A\u242442 level in CSF, FDG uptake, and hippocampal volume as well as cognitive function during the first 12 months of follow-up in ADNI have been reported. 30 We extended the follow-up study to up to 36 months and found evidence of significant change in the biomarkers of A\u242442 level, glucose metabolism, and hippocampal volume in all 3 groups of participants: NC, MCI, and AD. These biomarker trajectories showed that rates of change in the A\u242442 level were not different among the groups, but changes in glucose metabolism and hippocampal volume accelerated as cognitive function deteriorated. For participants with NC, cognitive change was not related to change in any of these biomarkers, although a model that included the A\u242442 level in CSF captured more variance than models that contained other biomarkers. The lack of association between cognitive change and biomarker dynamics in participants with NC may be due to only a subtle functional difference at this stage or to the limitation of our cognitive measurement tool. For participants with MCI, all 3 categories of biomarkers were related to cognitive decline, whereas for participants with AD, only glucose metabolism and hippocampal atrophy, and not the A\u242442 level in CSF, were related to cognitive decline. These findings imply that the A\u242442 level in CSF declines prior to the onset of cognitive impairment, in relation to aging or preclinical AD, whereas measures of neuronal dysfunction and injury (glucose metabolism and hippocampal atrophy) change with disease severity and stage.\nPrevious studies showed that, prior to cognitive impairment, APOE4 carriers have accelerated memory decline, 31 greater MRI hippocampal atrophy rates, 32 and faster decline in regional FDG uptake using PET. 33 Our data in Table 3 demonstrated that APOE4 was associated with a baseline A\u242442 level in CSF and a baseline FDG uptake (but not a baseline hippocampal volume) in participants with NC, whereas in participants with MCI or AD, the presence of APOE4 accelerated hippocampal atrophy (but not the A\u242442 level in CSF or FDG uptake). The influence of the APOE4 gene on A\u242442 level in CSF and FDG-PET regional metabolism appeared to begin earlier than on hippocampal atrophy. There is evidence from pathological examinations and amyloid PET imaging showing that the APOE4 gene increases the risk of AD through A\u2424 accumulation in the brain. 34, 35 Therefore, the effect of APOE4 on biomarkers at different stages may reflect the pathological sequence led by the pivotal event in AD, \u2424-amyloid deposition. The decrease in the A\u242442 level in CSF as an early event shown in our biomarker trajectories and the influence of APOE4 on hippocampal atrophy that occurred after A\u242442 deposition in CSF and FDG uptake both imply that the FDG-PET marker changes after A\u242442 deposition in CSF but before hippocampal atrophy. Our study supports the hypothetical model of the AD pathological cascade proposed by Jack et al, 36 in which brain A\u2424 deposition heralds the onset of the entire AD pathological process and is followed by regional synaptic dysfunction or glucose hypometabolism that eventually culminates in cell loss or brain atrophy.\nOne of the unique features in our study is that we have follow-up information on the biomarkers of the A\u242442 level in CSF, FDG uptake, and hippocampal volume from our study participants, as well as ADAS-cog scores, to address the dynamics of the pathological course of AD. These biomarker dynamics have been examined by the ADNI a The study population's average rate (unit per month) was calculated using a generalized estimating equation approach, adjusting for baseline age. Sample sizes were limited to participants with 2 or more repeated measures during a 3-year follow-up period. Biomarker change is statistically significant if different than zero. Intergroup rate comparisons were tested in the longitudinal models with 2 diagnostic groups each time, and the intergroup rate difference was reflected by the coefficient of the interaction term (group \u03eb time).\nb Referent group. c P \u03fd .001. d P \u03fd .01. e P \u03fd .05.\nusing a cross-sectional approach 37 ; however, to translate cross-sectional results into actual patterns of change requires a strong assumption that all participants follow the same pattern of disease progression from normal all the way to dementia. We understand that this assumption may hold true for participants who developed MCI and for participants with AD, but it is unlikely for participants with NC who did not develop MCI. Nearly half of the participants with MCI developed AD during followup, but very few people changed from NC to MCI or AD in the ADNI. Participants with NC may be a very different group of people from those who used to be cognitively normal but currently have MCI or AD. Ideally, the longitudinal change of biomarkers could have been better delineated had our study continued with follow-up that was long enough to observe the same group of participants with NC transitioning to MCI and AD. Limited by this design, we might be observing biomarker dynamics in aging but not necessarily disease progression in AD; therefore, we should be conservative about making inferences from participants who remained cognitively intact.\nPrevious longitudinal CSF studies showed that the decrease in the A\u242442 level correlated with cognitive decline in a healthy elderly population 38 but that the decrease might be too slight to detect later in the disease course, 22, 39, 40 which suggests that the level of A\u242442 in CSF might stabilize long before symptomatic dementia. These longitudinal CSF studies were, however, limited by, at most, 2 repeated measures and relatively small sample sizes. Our longitudinal study of CSF biomarkers is based on up to 3 repeated measures, which is the minimum number of time points allowing us to evaluate the variance of change. A baseline measure and 1 follow-up measure can only generate 1 single slope or change for each individual, and therefore there is no variance of slope to evaluate. The 2-point difference may result from either actual change or simply measurement error. In addition, if CSF biomarker measurement error exists, which is very likely for all laboratory tests, the magnitude of difference can be subject to the \"regression toward the mean\" effect. In other words, the more the baseline value deviates from the population mean, the larger the change is likely to be. We used the ADAS-cog score to monitor cognitive function and mapped the change of biomarkers to the ADAS-cog score as a way to assess the extent to which pathological markers correlated with clinical progression over time. There is no gold standard for measurement of cognitive function, particularly when our outcome of interest includes multiple stages of AD from normal to overt dementia. We noticed that ADAS-cog scores in participants with NC even improved over time, and we recognized that the possible learning effect might hinder us from using the ADAS-cog to track cognitive change among healthy elderly people. Nevertheless, ADAS-cog is still the standard tool in many clinical trials to assess AD, which allows our results to be more interpretable across different studies.\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, research participants in the ADNI were volunteers and from clinics, not from the general population. Although they all met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for NC, amnestic MCI, or mild AD, they were not newly diagnosed or incident cases. Within the same diagnostic group, participants were enrolled in our study at different stages in the disease course. Baseline evaluation did not adequately reflect their clinical states when they first had the disease. Therefore, we want to be clear that our target population is patients who come to the clinic rather than the general community; and we applied a generalized estimating equation approach to avoid the unverifiable assumption about their biological states at the beginning of cognitive impairment. Second, not all ADNI research participants underwent all biomarker examinations, especially lumbar puncture for CSF. Like many longitudinal studies, we had substantial missing data for biomarkers during the 36-month follow-up period. Although a generalized estimating equation approach can handle missing time points within individuals, there is no way that we can recover the actual biomarker profiles for those individuals who did not end up being in the analyses. The differences in sample size, particularly the smaller samples of individuals with longitudinal CSF samples compared with the other biomarkers, may limit our ability to draw inferences about the rela- tive changes in these biomarkers. Participants whose data were used in the analyses might be different from those whose data were not included or who dropped out; we do not know whether this is informative censoring or random missing data. Nevertheless, we focused on the relative rates of change or associations with cognitive change but not true rates. The calculated biomarker values would be biased by informative censoring, but the interrelationship among these biomarkers might not be affected. In sum, longitudinal patterns of biomarkers suggest that A\u242442 level in CSF, FDG uptake using PET, and hippocampal volume using MRI capture AD pathological states sequentially and that their predictive values for cognitive decline depend on the stage of the disease. Repeated measurement of these candidate biomarkers provides a potential approach for early diagnosis of AD. "}]
