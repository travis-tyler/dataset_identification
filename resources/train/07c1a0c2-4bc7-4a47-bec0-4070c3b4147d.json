[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The southern Okhotsk Sea consists of a shelf region between Sakhalin Island and Hokkaido and a deep sea region in the western part of the Kuril Basin (Figure 1). In the shelf region, temperature and salinity distributions show notable seasonal variations (e.g. Itoh and Ohshima, 2000). During summer and autumn, the Soya Warm Current (SWC) flows along the coast of northeastern Hokkaido and brings warm saline subtropical water from the Japan Sea. In winter, the East Sakhalin Current (ESC) flows southward from Sakhalin Island to Hokkaido, while SWC weakens. East Sakhalin Current water (ESCW) is characterized by salinity less than 32.0 (Takizawa, 1982). Surrounding these currents, surface water with salinity less than 32.5 named Okhotsk Surface Water (OSW) distributes on the offshore side Takizawa, 1982 . OSW forms seasonal thermocline with underlying Intermediate Cold Water (ICW), which is formed by convective mixing under sea ice in winter and characterized as the temperature minimum layer (Kitani, 1973;Takizawa, 1982). Stratification between OSW and ICW formed within euphotic zone causes the formation of subsurface chlorophyll-a maximum during summer and autumn (Kasai et al., 2010). OSW is also considered as an optimum water mass for growth of the toxic dinoflagellate, Alexandrium tamarense, the causative agent of paralytic shellfish poisoning (Shimada et al., 2009). In the deep sea region, on the other hand, an anticyclonic gyre exists in the Kuril Basin, which involves mesoscale anticyclonic eddies (Wakatsuchi and Martin, 1991;Ohshima et al., 2002;Ebuchi, 2006). OSW seems to be important for biogeochemical conditions in the southern Okhotsk Sea (e.g. Shimada et al., 2009;Kasai et al., 2010), however, formation process of OSW has not been deeply discussed, while formation processes of subsurface water masses in the Okhotsk Sea have been studied in detail (e.g. Kitani, 1973;Takizawa, 1982;Tally and Nagata, 1995;Watanabe and Wakatsuchi, 1998;Yamamoto et al., 2001). Kitani (1973) showed seasonal change of temperature and salinity of surface water in the southern Okhotsk Sea, and suggested that the salinity is lowered by the sea ice melt water and/or the inflow of river water. Takizawa (1982) suggested that OSW is freshened by sea ice melt water and/or precipitation, separating from ESCW freshened by the Amur River discharge. However, as Iida (1962) previously indicated, it is questionable that if OSW maintains a low salinity in the warm season when the sea ice has already disappeared. It is also difficult to consider Amur River runoff as the only freshwater source of OSW especially in summer, because moving in ESC region from river mouth of Amur River would require over six months to reach to off Hokkaido (Mizuta et al., 2003). Sugiura (1958) firstly indicated that Aniva Bay located at the southern end of Sakhalin Island (Figure 1) might lower the salinity of OSW in summer. Watanabe (1963) showed a tongue-like distribution of low salinity water from off Aniva Bay. Monthly variations of the horizontal distributions of sea surface salinity in the southern Okhotsk Sea drawn by Itoh and Ohshima (2000) also suggested that low salinity water appeared in the vicinity of the southern tip of Sakhalin Island in summer, though they classified water mass with salinity less than 32.0 as ESCW. Based on data from a recent survey in the southern Okhotsk Sea, Figure 2 shows the horizontal distribution of salinity at 10 m depth in August 1995 obtained by the Hokkaido Fisheries Experimental Station (HFES, 2004). OSW distributed just off Soya Warm Current water (SWCW) and horizontal temperature minimum water named as Cold Water Belt (CWB) (e.g. Iida, 1962;Ishizu et al., 2008). In OSW region with salinity less than 32.5, the freshest water with salinity less than 32.0 appeared from the mouth of Aniva Bay, indicating that Aniva Bay was possibly a source region of freshwater of OSW (Sugiura, 1958;Watanabe, 1963). In this study, we examine the relationship between the low salinity water in the shelf region of the southern Okhotsk Sea, and Aniva Bay. We use oceanic data obtained seasonally at depths shallower than 200 m in the southern Okhotsk Sea. To determine the source of freshwater mixing in the surface layer, we apply total alkalinity (TA), \u03b4 13 C of oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon (\u03b4 13 C DIC ), and \u03b4 18 O of seawater as chemical tracers, together with conventional water mass tracers, temperature and salinity. TA and \u03b4 18 O have been applied as powerful tools to distinguish freshwater sources, such as river runoff, precipitation, sea ice melt water, and brine, in the arctic and subarctic regions (e.g. Yamamoto et al., 2001Yamamoto et al., , 2002Anderson et al., 2004;Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2005;Pavlova et al., 2008). \u03b4 13 C DIC , on the other hand, has been used to trace globally or regionally the water mass which experienced air-sea CO 2 exchange reflecting temperature at the sea surface (e.g. Broecker and Maier-Reimer, 1992;Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1995;Itou et al., 2003). In this paper, we firstly show our observation results obtained in the southern Okhotsk Sea. We then compare these results with historical data in other areas of the Okhotsk Sea to describe the source region of low salinity water, and discuss its formation and transport processes."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "We use data obtained in July 2004 (TKN0407, Jul 22-Aug 1, 2004), October 2004 (TKN0410, Oct 1-5, 2004) and May 2005(TKN0505, May 11-15, 2005 along the 'N-line' off Cape Notoro during cruises of the R/V Tankai-Maru of the Hokkaido National Fisheries Research Institute, Fisheries Research Agency (Oguma et al., 2008;Kasai et al., 2010). Observation stations of the N-line are shown in Figure 1b. Vertical seawater sampling was operated using Niskin bottles with a rosette multi sampler at standard depth. The nutrient samples were placed in acrylic tubes and frozen on board until measurement in the laboratory. Nutrient concentrations were determined colorimetrically using Bran+Luebbe Autoanalyzer TRAACS 800 and AACS-III (Parsons et al., 1984) with nutrient reference material produced by the Kansai Environmental Engineering Center Co., Ltd. The mean difference of duplicate phosphate samples was \u03c3 (PO 4 ) = 0.084 \u00b5mol/L. Samples for TA analysis were collected in 100 ml glass vials and sealed immediately. TA was determined by the method of Ono et al. (1998). Samples for \u03b4 13 C DIC sampling were collected in 100 ml glass bottles and fixed with HgCl 2 , while for \u03b4 18 O they were collected in 50 ml glass bottles. These samples were sealed on board and refrigerated in the laboratory until analysis. The measurements for \u03b4 13 C DIC analysis were carried out following the methods detailed in Tanaka et al. (2003), while \u03b4 18 O was determined following Yamamoto et al. (2002). Both \u03b4 13 C DIC and \u03b4 18 O were measured using a mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Delta-S). The precision of replicate analyses for \u03b4 13 C DIC (n = 17) was \u03c3(\u03b4 13 C) = 0.033 , and the variability of \u03b4 13 C DIC among duplicate samples was 0.020 0.015 (n = 20). The standard deviation of \u03b4 18 O value of differences between two standard waters (n = 119) was 0.021 , and the variability of \u03b4 18 O among duplicate samplings was 0.026 0.017 (n = 21). We also used wintertime data obtained in the southern Okhotsk Sea by P/V Soya of the 1 st Regional Coast Guard Headquarters, Japan, in February 2006 (Toyota, 2006;Nomura et al., 2009aNomura et al., , 2009b. Sampling points are shown in Figure 1b. Sea surface water samples for nutrients, TA, \u03b4 13 C DIC and \u03b4 18 O were collected through cracks between sea ice floes with a bucket. Samples for nutrients and TA measurements were stored and measured following Nomura et al. (2009a), and for \u03b4 C DIC and \u03b4 18 O were in the same method as for the N-line samples.  (Wakita et al., 2003). We also used historical data of the World Ocean Database 2005 (WOD05) (Boyer et al., 2006). From WOD05, data for stations in Aniva Bay and off the southeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, where temperature, salinity and TA were observed, were extracted. They were mostly obtained in the 1960s and 1970s. Observed locations of these historical data are shown in Figure 1a. To discuss the transport processes of sea surface water from Aniva Bay, we used zonal/meridional momentum flux (wind stress) data provided from the web site of the Japanese Ocean Flux datasets with Use of Remote Sensing Observations (J-OFURO) (http://dtsv.scc. u-tokai.ac.jp/j-ofuro/). Before data analysis, we made an offset collection for TA data of the N-line cruises assuming that the water mass below 27.4 \u03c3 \u03b8 has not changed over a decadal time scale (Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2004;Watanabe et al., 2009). We compared with TA data obtained by R/V Professor Khromov cruises (Wakita et al., 2003) and calculated offset values for each N-line cruise based on the data sets below 27.4 \u03c3 \u03b8 . Since TA is affected by the processes of organic matter decomposition, potential alkalinity is preferable in the high productive area such as the Okhotsk Sea (Pavlova et al., 2008). However, historical data obtained in Aniva Bay included few nutrient data, and then we could not calculate PA values. Although we found that nitrate considerably increased from less than 1 \u00b5mol kg -1 to over 20 \u00b5mol kg -1 at depths shallower than 200 m (Kasai et al., 2010), distribution patterns of PA and TA were not largely changed. Hereafter, we used TA in this study. To eliminate the effects of dilution by precipitation or concentration by sea ice formation, we used normalized TA, NTA, applying salinity-normalization scheme represented by Friis et al. (2003) as follows, where TA 0 is a non-zero freshwater endmember and S is salinity. Here we assumed TA 0 = 589 \u00b5mol kg -1 based on the climatological riverine data, which were obtained in Amur River estuary and Sakhalin Bay (Andreev and Pavlova, 2010). We applied the isotopic ratio of stable isotopes, \u03b4 C of dissolved inorganic carbon (\u03b4 13 C DIC ) and \u03b4 O of seawater, as parameters to classify the water masses in the southern Okhotsk Sea. \u03b4 13 C DIC is affected not only by air-sea fractionation, but also by biological isotope separation during marine photosynthesis (Broecker and Maier-Reimer, 1992). The effect of air-sea CO 2 exchange on \u03b4 13 C DIC , denoted as \u03b4 13 C*, is calculated as follows (Broecker and Maier-Reimer, 1992;Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1995;Itou et al., 2003;Oguma et al., 2008), where \u03b4 13 C bio is biologically predicted \u03b4 13 C calculated from the phosphate concentration. \u03b4 13 C* of offshore water has a linear negative relationship with temperature of the region where the water mass was exposed to the atmosphere (Zhang et al., 1995;Itou et al., 2003), and conserves the temperature information of the source area of the water mass after subduction (Itou et al., 2003;Oguma et al., 2008). However, \u03b4 13 C* of coastal water may additionally be influenced by river water with 13 C-depleted calcite (e.g. Mook and Tan, 1991). \u03b4 18 O of seawater reflects the hydrological cycle at the sea surface. Precipitation and river water introduce 18 O-depleted water, and sea ice melt water leads to fluxes of \u03b4 18 O-enriched water (e.g. Yamamoto et al., 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Water properties along the N-line", "text": "Temperature (T), salinity (S), NTA, \u03b4 13 C* and \u03b4 18 O data shallower than 200 m obtained in July and October 2004, February 2006, and May 2005, are summarized in Figure 3, which are shown seasonally from summer to spring. The characteristic values of temperature, salinity, and isotopic ratio of stable isotopes of water masses in the southern Okhotsk Sea derived from former studies (Takizawa, 1982;Biebow et al, 2001aBiebow et al, , 2001bYamamoto et al., 2001;Bauch et al., 2002;Itou et al., 2003) are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, and they are shown in Figure 3 as the boundaries of water mass classification in the Okhotsk Sea on T-S and \u03b4 C*-\u03b4 18 O diagrams. In the \u03b4 C*-\u03b4 O diagrams, if freshwater is supplied from precipitation, only \u03b4 18 O is depleted. However, if river water is mixed, then both \u03b4 13 C* and \u03b4 18 O are depleted. The shift in directions of plots caused by freshwater mixing is schematically shown as arrows in the \u03b4 13 C*-\u03b4 18 O diagrams. To eliminate the effect of sea ice formation on the salinity data obtained in February 2006, we back-calculate the original salinity, S org , from the \u03b4 18 O value using the linear relationship (S org = (\u03b4 18 O + 13.561) / 0.3915) obtained for the western subarctic Pacific region (Yamamoto et al., 2001).  Figure 4, may be affected by dense shelf water from the northern Okhotsk Sea (Yamamoto et al., 2002). It is suggested that salinity values obtained at Sts. 5 and 13 are lowered by sea ice melting water, and those obtained at Sts. 6, 10, and 19 are enhanced by brine formation. Here we estimate S org for these stations related with sea ice, and then we recalculate original NTA, NTA org . S org and NTA org values are shown in Figure 3c. Following the water mass classifications on T-S diagrams by Takizawa (1982), surface water shallower than 26.0 \u03c3 \u03b8 were roughly divided into SWCW at the most coastal St. N01 and OSW at offshore Sts. N02-N04 in summer and autumn (Figure 3a and 3b). Under OSW, ICW distributes around 26.5 \u03c3 \u03b8 . Since SWC is weakened and ESC is forced in winter (Watanabe, 1963;Itoh and Ohshima, 2000), low salinity water classified as OSW occurs instead of SWCW at coastal Sts. 5, 6, 17, and 19 ( Figure 3c). Forerunner of SWCW (f-SWCW) (Takizawa, 1982) occurs only at St.1 near the Soya Strait. In spring, subsurface layer water at St. N01 seems to be mixed with f-SWCW but mostly classified as ICW, as well as offshore Sts. N02-N04 (Figure 3d).  NTA org values in winter, which are recalculated using S org , seem to be in the middle of (3) and (4). NTA-S plots of subtropical SWCW at St. N01 in summer and autumn shift lower from line 4estimated for subarctic water. NTA-S regression lines (3) and 4 is notable that \u03b4 13 C* in the upper 30 m depths at St. N02 is not depleted. This result suggests that the surface water at St. N02 is not affected by river water discharge. As Takizawa (1982) suggested, salinity of OSW would be lowered due to precipitation in summer. \u03b4 13 C*-depletion and slight \u03b4 18 O-enrichment under the temperature minimum layer within ICW would be occurred by intrusion of the f-SWCW (Takizawa, 1982;Watanabe and Wakatsuchi, 1998;Oguma et al., 2008). In autumn (Figure 3b), \u03b4 13 C* in the upper 30 m depth at Sts. N02-N04 is depleted, while \u03b4 18 O is more depleted at St. N02 but is less depleted at Sts. N03 and N04 from summer. This result may be caused by mixing with river waters from different sources. Since ESCW which is affected by the Amur River discharge still distributes far north from Hokkaido in October (Mizuta et al., 2003), the surface water at offshore Sts. N03 and N04 can mix with ESCW. However, it is difficult at relatively near shore St. N02. In winter (Figure 3c), sea surface water at most stations off northeastern Hokkaido, except for St. 1 near the Soya Strait and offshore-most St. 13, indicate an influence of ESCW. In spring (Figure 3d), \u03b4 13 C* and \u03b4 18 O values of Sts. N02-N04 are mostly in c-OW area, but those of St. N01 shift to values approximating the SWCW area suggesting the occurrence of f-SWCW. Hokkaido in winter starts to strengthen in summer (Mizuta et al., 2003). Consequently, we can suggest that the low salinity and high NTA water in the upper 30 m depth layer obtained at St. N02"}, {"section_title": "Source region of low salinity and high NTA water", "text": "originates from Aniva Bay. Hereafter, we call this water as the Aniva Surface Water (ASW). For convenience, the range of salinity and NTA of ASW are defined as S<32.0 and NTA>2450 \u00b5mol kg -1 , respectively. Although the cause of the high NTA in Aniva Bay is not clear, NTA-S diagram can be a convenient tool for detailed water mass classification of OSW, even in the case when salinity values in surface layer show only minimal differences as shown in Figure 3a."}, {"section_title": "Formation process of ASW", "text": "Using historical data of WOD05, temperature, salinity and NTA distributions in Aniva Bay in August 1970 and October 1968 are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively. In both cases, a warm and low salinity eddy is formed at the center of the mouth of Aniva Bay. Drifter trajectories or satellite altimeter also suggested an anticyclonic flow in this area (Ohshima et al., 2002;Ebuchi, 2006). Hereafter we call this anticyclonic eddy as Aniva Bay Eddy (ABE). In August 1970 ( Figure 6), meridional distributions indicate that cold saline water (S>34) appears on the shelf of Aniva Bay. Following the water mass classifications of Takizawa (1982), this cold saline water is much colder than SWCW or f-SWCW. However, NTA value is lower than 2360 \u00b5mol kg -1 the same as SWCW obtained at St. N01 (Figure 3a or 3b). It is suggested that cooled SWCW may intrude eastward from the Soya Strait and then cause the anticyclonic flow. Longitudinal sections show that low salinity water less than 32 at the sea surface shifts to the eastern side of ABE, and the maximum core of high NTA water over \u00b5mol kg -1 distributes on the bottom slope of eastern Aniva Bay. It is plausible that SWCW intruding along the coastline may cause perturbations on the shelf south of Cape Aniva. Convergence of the surface water of ABE causes an upwelling of high NTA water to be freshened at the sea surface by precipitation and/or river water. In October 1968 (Figure 7), on the other hand, horizontal temperature minimum region, which is considered as CWB, appears between SWC and ABE. Instead of SWCW, a cold water which can be classified as ICW (Takizawa, 1982) distributes on the shelf along the coastline of Aniva Bay. Horizontal distribution suggests that CWB prevents intrusion of SWCW into Aniva Bay. ICW may be entrained by weak northeastward baroclinic flow in lower layer off SWC (Ishizu et al., 2008). It is notable that high NTA water over 2450 \u00b5mol kg -1 mostly accounts for the water mass in Aniva Bay. In this case, ABE seems to contact directly with the shelf and to involve high NTA water on the shelf by upwelling processes as well as in August 1970. As a result, whole ABE contains very high NTA water. In this case, it is also notable that ASW spreads out southeastward from the ABE region."}, {"section_title": "Transport process of ASW", "text": "Comparing with Figures 6 and 7, CWB seems to be related to the distribution of ASW. CWB is considered that its water mass is formed by an upwelling around Cape Krillion, the western side of Aniva Bay, and is maintained by the convergence of bottom Ekman transport off the SWC region (Ishizu et al., 2006). We hypothesize as follows; ASW is entrained southeastward when CWB appears at the tip of Cape Krillion as shown in Figure 7, whereas ASW is trapped in the ABE region when SWCW intrudes into Aniva Bay and upwelling of CWB water does not occur as shown in Figure 6. In 2004, CWB was observed off SWC (Shimada et al., 2009). Satellite imagery of sea surface temperature (e.g. MODIS Near Real Time Data in JAXA/EORC website, http://kuroshio.eorc.jaxa.jp/ADEOS/mod_nrt_new/index.html, not shown here) also shows that CWB appeared in May and disappeared in November. Namely, ASW obtained in July and October is entrained by CWB water from the ABE region. After ASW entrained by CWB water flows out from the ABE region, it is expected to advect southeastward as shown in Figure 2. As ASW distributes in the surface layer shallower than 30 m, Ekman transport by wind stress at the sea surface may be effective. Ekman transport occurs perpendicular to the right of the wind in the Northern Hemisphere, therefore, northeastward wind stress is preferable. Figure 8 shows the daily mean momentum flux distribution in June 22-July 21 and September 1-30, 2004, provided by J-OFURO. Each period is one month before the observations in July and October 2004. In September 2004, wind stress over the southern Okhotsk Sea frequently directs northeastward. Such conditions can cause southeastward flow at the sea surface. On the other hand, in June-July, wind stress direction does not bias to constant direction. This result suggests that Ekman transport is not the main process to maintain the southeastward advection of ASW off SWC. Figure 3a and 3b show that the density of ASW at St. N02 is less than that of OSW at offshore Sts. N03-N04. It is surmised that ASW seems to flow geostrophically southeastward adjacent to heavier OSW after the entrainment by upwelling of CWB water. ADCP data of Ishizu et al. (2008) showed a very weak southeastward flow off SWC which corresponds to horizontal salinity minimum water supposed ASW. To discuss the transport process of ASW sufficiently, further observations and theoretical explanation of the advection system of ASW are necessary."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study, we classified the low salinity waters in the southern Okhotsk Sea using NTA, \u03b4 13 C* and \u03b4 18 O as chemical tracers.
