[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Adiponectin and leptin are implicated in the initiation and pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The serum concentrations of these adipokines has been extensively studied in AD, however little is known about their receptors in this disease.\nObjective: We developed a novel approach to examine whether the receptors of adiponectin (AdipoR1 and -R2) and/or leptin (LepR) can contribute to AD pathomechanism. To achieve this, we investigated the effect of both genetic and environmental factors associated with AD on the expression of these receptors.\nWe used C57BL/6J (WT) and APP(swe)/Presen(e9d)1 (AD) mice. Both strains were exposed to restraint stress (RS) daily for 6h over different time periods. Then, we measured the mRNA expression of AdipoR1, AdipoR2 and LepR and the level of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 proteins in the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical areas of each mouse.\nResults: We detected brain region specific transcriptomic changes of adiponectin receptors induced by APP and PS1 transgenes. Both acute and chronic RS caused significant elevations in AdipoR1 mRNA expression in the hippocampus of WT mice. In the prefrontal cortex, the mRNA expression of AdipoR1 followed a biphasic course. In AD mice, RS did not promote any changes in the expression of AdipoR1 mRNA and AdipoR1 protein levels. AdipoR2 mRNA in AD animals, however, showed a significant increase in the prefrontal cortex during RS. Regarding AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA and protein expression, relevant changes could be measured during stress exposure in both brain areas. Furthermore, stress exposed groups exhibited little change in LepR mRNA expression.\nOur findings indicate that carrying the transgenes associated with AD induces modification in the expression of both adiponectin receptors. In the case of a normal genetic background, these receptors also appear to be sensitive to environmental factors, while in a genetically determined AD model less response to stress stimuli could be observed. The results suggest that modification of adipokine receptors could also be considered in the therapeutic approach to AD."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative dementia, being responsible for 60-80% of all recorded dementia cases (Alzheimer's Association, 2015) . The pathogenesis of AD appears to be multifactorial in nature, with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to the development and progression of the disease. For example, obesity and one of its comorbidities, metabolic syndrome, are also associated with AD pathogenesis. Studies hint at the fact that members of the adipokine molecular group may be involved in the link between obesity and AD. Adiponectin and leptin are the most well characterized adipokines regarding their role in AD. These small peptides have two common traits: (1) They can be synthesized by the adipose tissue; (2) they have a specific cytokine and/or hormone function (Alzheimer's Association, 2015) . Recently a model was proposed suggesting that decreased plasma adiponectin and increased plasma leptin concentrations, due to obesity in mid-life, can make the brain more susceptible to dementia, whereas weight loss in late-life and during the early periods of dementia leads to lower leptin and higher adiponectin levels and may have the same results, also contributing to the progression of neurodegeneration (Ishii and Iadecola, 2016) .\nThe level of the 30 kDa adipocyte-derived polypeptide, adiponectin, is inversely associated with metabolic syndrome. Not only individual investigations (Une et al., 2011; Khemka et al., 2014) , but also a meta-analysis, demonstrated the higher serum levels of adiponectin in AD patients (Ma et al., 2016) . It has been found that an upregulation in adiponectin expression may be associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (Une et al., 2011) . In addition, higher adiponectin levels were associated with smaller hippocampal volume, poorer performance in language, memory and global cognitive domains, and higher odds of MCI among women (Wennberg et al., 2016) . Adiponectin has been proposed as a therapeutic target in certain cognitive deficiencies (Chan et al., 2012; Diniz et al., 2012) . Adiponectin exerts its effects by binding to its two transmembrane receptors, adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2), which are widely expressed in various areas of the brain, including the hippocampus (Qiu et al., 2011) . Adiponectin enhances AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity via AdipoR1 to stimulate food intake and decrease energy consumption (Kadowaki et al., 2008) . Also, AMPK activation represses amyloidogenesis, decreases mTOR signaling and enhances autophagy and lysosomal degradation of A\u03b2 (Godoy et al., 2014) . Adiponectin secretion is also upregulated by PPAR-\u03b3 induced activation of AdipoR2 (Kadowaki et al., 2008) . The mechanistic link between PPAR-\u03b3 and amyloid clearance has been demonstrated to ameliorate the pathological and behavioral deficits in an AD mouse model (MandrekarColucci et al., 2012) . This is in contrast with the fact that both adiponectin receptors are involved in the regulation processes of amyloidogenesis. However, these receptors have not been studied in AD patients or in any animal models of the disease.\nLeptin is a small, 16 kDa adipose-derived hormone which was found to be in lower concentrations in the blood of AD patients (Power et al., 2001) . At the same time, the level of leptin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a small cohort of patients with AD was significantly elevated (Bonda et al., 2014) . Recently, another research group observed no difference in the CSF leptin levels of patients with AD or MCI (Maioli et al., 2015) . One possible explanation for the paradoxical findings may lie in the signaling pathway of leptin in the central nervous system. Leptin receptor (LepR) activation in hippocampal neurons may play an important role in the memory of mice in relation to food intake and learning (Kanoski et al., 2011) . By binding to LepR, leptin activates several intracellular signaling pathways, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways to reduce the risk of AD (Li et al., 2016) .\nIn addition to obesity, another possible environmental component in AD induction is psychological stress. Epidemiological studies indicate that stress is associated with increased risk of dementia and AD (Wilson et al., 2006) . Repeated exposure of rats to mild stressors resulted in enhanced expression of adiponectin mRNA, suggesting that adipose tissue is sensitive to environmental stress (Sato et al., 2011) . However, the effect of stress on the expression of adiponectin receptors has not yet been published in a scientific paper. Different types of acute stress, such as immobilization, forced swimming or noise increased the circulating levels of leptin (Haleem, 2014) . Unlike acute stress, chronic unpredictable mild stress induced a decrease in serum leptin levels and in hypothalamic leptin receptor mRNA expression (Ge et al., 2013) .\nThe primary aim of this study was to investigate the mRNA and protein expression of AdipoR1, AdipoR2 and leptin receptor (LepR) in an amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mouse model. Since obesity and stressful life events frequently co-occur, we also wanted to examine the effect of restraint stress (RS) on these adipokine receptors' expression in a quantifiable manner to find out whether stress, as a possible factor in the development of AD, may be able to influence AD pathology through these receptors. As AD affects the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex most prominently, we selected these brain areas as the focal points of our experiment."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Animals", "text": "Two separate mouse strains were used: a wild type C57BL/6J mouse strain (WT mice, n = 30) and an APP(swe)/PS1(e9d)1 transgenic mouse strain (AD mice, n = 30). Transgenic mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The double transgenic mice express a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a DeltaE9 mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9), both directed to CNS neurons. Both mutations are associated with the early onset of AD. The two transgenes were inserted at a single locus in Chromosome 9 between Arpp21 and Pdcd6ip. The \"humanized\" Mo/HuAPP695swe transgene allows the mice to secrete a human A-beta peptide. The included Swedish mutations (K595N/M596L) also elevate the amount of A-beta produced from the transgene by favoring processing through the betasecretase pathway. Mice carrying this double transgene develop beta-amyloid deposits in the brain by 6-7 months of age. Hemizygous mice on the C57BL/6 background (N9B6) exhibit a high incidence of seizures (by 4.5 months of age, seizure incidence increases to 55%). Furthermore, these animals may display a slight alteration in their tail phenotype (e.g., kinked tail) that is believed to be due to the mixed genetic background of the strain and is not related to transgene expression.

Regarding the two examined brain regions, significantly higher AdipoR1 mRNA levels have been found in the prefrontal cortex compared to the hippocampus in both WT and APP/PS1 transgenic mice ( Figure 1A) . Additionally, AdipoR1 mRNA expression is significantly higher in the hippocampus of AD mice than in WT, while in the prefrontal cortex AdipoR1 mRNA did not differ between the two strains ( Figure 1A) . AdipoR2 hippocampal mRNA levels were equal in the WT and AD models, but in WT mice its expression (similarly to AdipoR1) was lower in the hippocampus compared to the prefrontal cortex ( Figure 1B) . Furthermore, AdipoR2 mRNA expression was much lower in the prefrontal cortex of AD animals compared to their WT counterparts ( Figure 1B) . Interestingly, mRNA expression of AdipoR1 was 8.3 and10 times higher compared to the expression of AdipoR2 in both the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex, respectively (Figure 1) .

It has been shown, that adiponectin expression is sensitive to environmental stress. To gain further information related to stress-induced changes, we wanted to investigate whether acute or chronic stresses can influence the expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA levels. Figure 3 , both acute (day 3) and chronic (day 7, 14, and 21) RS caused significant, almost twofold, elevations in AdipoR1 mRNA expression in the hippocampus of WT mice, while in APP/PS1 mice only a smaller decrease could be observed after 7 days of stress treatment ( Figure 3A) . In the prefrontal cortex, the mRNA expression of AdipoR1 followed a biphasic course, it increased in the cases of the shorter RS (3 day and day 7), while a sharp drop could be observed after a longer period of RS (day 14 and day 21) (Figure 3B ). These data demonstrate that even really short term (3 day) stress can induce an elevation in AdipoR1 mRNA production in both examined brain areas of WT mice. This is consistent with a previous report, stating that repeated exposure to stresses causes enhanced gene expression of adiponectin in gonadal white adipose tissue. In AD mice, RS did not induce any change in the expression of AdipoR1 mRNA either in the hippocampus (Figure 3A) or the prefrontal cortex (Figure 3B) , except a transient decrease in hippocampal AdipoR1 mRNA in the 7th day ( Figure 3A) . AdipoR2 mRNA reacted to stress in the hippocampus largely in a similar manner to what was observed for AdipoR1 in WT mice: The expression of AdipoR2 mRNA increased significantly only on days 3 and 7 ( Figure 4A) . In AD mice, hippocampal AdipoR2 mRNA levels remained unchanged at every time point during RS. In the prefrontal cortex of WT mice, the AdipoR2 mRNA expression showed a steady decrease during RS, which reached its lowest levels by day 7 and 14 ( Figure 4B) . In contrast, AdipoR2 mRNA localized in the prefrontal cortex of AD animals was found to be strongly elevated by days 3, 7, and 14 and moderately by day 21 (Figure 4B) .

Hippocampal AdipoR1 expression in AD mice showed an elevation on day 7 (Figure 5A) , in contrast to mRNA expression, which was lower in the 7-day group compared to the control. In the prefrontal cortex, RS did not cause any significant changes in AdipoR1 protein levels in either WT or AD mice (Figure 5B) , meaning that the biphasic change we observed in the WT AdipoR1 mRNA concentration did not translate to the protein level.\nFIGURE 3 | Effects of restraint stress on the expression of AdipoR1 mRNA in the hippocampus (A) and prefrontal cortex (B) of the wild type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice.

However, the exact role of these molecules in the disease is still very elusive, thanks to their complex interactions with the CNS. Adiponectin and leptin may not only be associated with AD via their changed serum concentrations, but also through other means. The possible target points regarding the CNS may be the signaling pathways, more precisely the receptors of these adipokines (Waragai et al., 2016) . Taking this into consideration, the current study shows that bearing the APP/PS1 transgenes associated with AD induces altered expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. The present paper also demonstrates that chronic stress, a potential AD inducer, may influence the levels of both adiponectin receptors in the aforementioned brain areas of wild type mice. Furthermore, the same receptors responded less or not at all to identical chronic RS in the APP(swe)/PS1(e9d)1 transgene murine model of AD. The differences in stress response were stronger at the protein level. Considering LepR mRNA in the same strains and brain areas, we only detected slight modifications compared to the adiponectin receptors.\nThe presence of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in several brain areas, including the frontal cortex and the hippocampus, has been shown previously (Qiu et al., 2011) . However, information on FIGURE 5 | Effects of restraint stress on the expression of AdipoR1 protein in the hippocampus (A) and prefrontal cortex (B) of the wild type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Stress-exposed groups were compared to their respective controls (per protein, per brain area, and per mouse strain) by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni and Tukey post hoc tests. Data are expressed as means + SEM (n = 3), *p < 0.05.\nthe AD-related changes of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 is still very limited. Therefore, in this study, the expression of adiponectin receptors mRNA and proteins were quantified for the first time in WT and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. In contrast with the increased transcription of the hippocampal AdipoR1, the presence of the two AD-related transgenes decreased the AdipoR1 protein levels. These results assume a downregulated signalization of adiponectin in AD and support earlier findings (Waragai et al., 2016) . In this cross-sectional study, pathologically changed adiponectin-adiponectin receptor signaling was suggested based on the higher serum and lower CSF adiponectin levels in AD patients.\nBased on the fact that chronic stress has considerable effects on cognitive decline and memory loss, a possible link between psychological stress and AD development has been suggested (Khalsa, 2015) . Our results show that stress stimuli can downregulate AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 transcription and translation in the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical areas of wild type mice. The question arises as to what this stressinduced modification of adipokine receptors really means for the pathomechanism of AD. Adiponectin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, anti-diabetogenic and neuroprotective effects (Berg et al., 2002; Qiu et al., 2011; Ohashi et al., 2012) . According to our observations, because of the decreased availability of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, the beneficial properties of adiponectin may diminish during stress; thus adiponectin may fail to exert its protective effects against neuronal cell death in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex. It can be concluded that chronic stress, due to the decreased availability of adiponectin receptors, may contribute to the loss of the favorable effects of adiponectin and, consequently, may accelerate the progression of AD. Additionally, we could not demonstrate similar modulating effects of stress in the transgenic murine model of AD, since the mRNA and protein levels of adiponectin receptors were not reduced. These unexpected results suggest that the availability of adiponectin receptors can FIGURE 6 | Effects of restraint stress on the expression of AdipoR2 protein in the hippocampus (A) and prefrontal cortex (B) of the wild type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice.

(2016) demonstrated that insulin receptor levels are decreased in the hippocampus of AD mice and can further decline after stress exposure, concluding that people with harmful genetic mutations are more likely to be vulnerable to stress. Further investigation is necessary to explore the mechanism to explain the difference between the stress-induced changes of adiponectin and insulin receptors.\nRS affected adiponectin receptor protein levels less remarkably than their mRNA, which is not an unexpected finding since the proteome is much more stable than the mRNA levels. It is well known, that expression of a given mRNA and protein do not always match completely, mainly due to posttransciptional and post-translational control mechanisms. As post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, microRNAs may be partly responsible for the disparate expression of adiponectin receptors at the protein and RNA levels. A recent bioinformatics analysis showed that adiponectin signaling is regulated by microRNAs: miR-221 inhibits AdipoR1 expression, which suggests that miR-221 regulates AdipoR1 signaling in different pathological processes (Chen et al., 2015) . On the other hand, AdipoR2 has been identified as a direct target of miR-218 (Du et al., 2015) . In our experiments, the expression of AdipoR2 in the prefrontal cortex of AD mice increased significantly at all time-points of RS, however these changes could not be measured at the protein level. One potential explanation of our observations may be the role of miR-218 in this signaling process, which nevertheless needs further clarification.\nThe most well characterized adipokine for its role in AD is leptin (Folch et al., 2012) . Population-based studies indicate that decreased leptin levels are associated with cognitive impairment (Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2011; Furiya et al., 2013) , while higher leptin levels were associated with a lower risk of dementia (Lieb et al., 2009; Warren et al., 2012) . However, leptin is also involved in the stress response and stress-related disorders, including depression and anxiety (Haleem, 2014) . Both acute and chronic stress modify the circulating levels of leptin depending on the duration of the stress and the stress type itself (Haleem, 2014) . Investigation of the effect of RS on LepR's mRNA expression in both WT and AD mice showed that LepR is less sensitive to RS than the adiponectin receptors, since only long-term, chronic RS decreased the transcription of LepR in the hippocampus of transgenic mice. This is consistent with previous data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort study, which showed decreased LepR immunoreactivity in brains from individuals suffering severe AD, and similarly the LepR mRNA was also reduced only in the old AD transgenic mice (Maioli et al., 2015) . Thus, we propose that APP/PS1 transgenes and RS do not affect LepR's transcription as much as they affect the adiponectin receptors' transcription. The mechanism of leptin resistance also seems to be independent from LepR regulation, which also coincides with our results (Balland and Cowley, 2015) .\nOur experiment had several limitations which must be considered during the evaluation of results. ELISA assays were performed only for AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 and we only used three randomly selected protein samples from the six available for each group to represent one group from the viewpoint of stress exposure. Thus, a major limitation in the interpretation of our results is the low number of samples. A study with a higher sample size may strengthen some of the observations made in this paper. Furthermore, we did not measure changes in serum cortisol throughout the experiment, which is one of the best indicators of psychological stress. The reason behind this decision was twofold; on the one hand, the stress paradigm we used is well-documented in the scientific literature to trigger molecular stress responses in murine models, including the increase in corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion (Buynitsky and Mostofsky, 2009 ). On the other hand, we wanted to monitor the effect of stress less invasively with weight measurements to avoid potential alterations in the resulting data due to the stress of blood sampling."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In summary, we were the first to quantitatively investigate adiponectin receptors concentrations in AD-associated areas of the brain, namely the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Based on our results, the expression of adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are affected by genes APP and PS1 in a region-specific manner in the brain. These receptor molecules of adipokine frequently associated with AD are also influenced by chronic stress in a possibly neurodegenerationpromoting manner in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of C57BL/6J WT mice. We also demonstrated that in a model of fully developed AD, an APP(swe)/PSEN(e9d)1 transgene mouse strain, these receptors respond less plastically or not at all to the same chronic stress treatment. Furthermore, based on our observations, LepR plays an essential role only in the late phases of AD. These results also imply that variation in LepR expression is not an element of leptin resistance mechanisms. "}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": ""}]
