CR was quantified using standardized residuals (W scores) from a (covariate-adjusted) linear regression with global cognition (13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale) as an independent variable of interest, and either gray matter volumes or white matter hyperintensity volume as dependent variables. These W scores, reflecting whether an individual's degree of cerebral damage is lower or higher than clinically expected, were tested as predictors of diagnostic conversion (i.e., NC to MCI/ AD dementia, or MCI to AD dementia) and longitudinal changes in memory (ADNI-MEM) and executive functions (ADNI-EF).\nThe median follow-up period was 24 months (interquartile range 6-42). Corrected for age, sex, APOE4 status, and baseline cerebral damage, higher gray matter volume-based W scores (i.e., greater CR) were associated with a lower diagnostic conversion risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.22, p < 0.001) and slower decline in memory (\u03b2 = 0.48, p < 0.001) and executive function (\u03b2 = 0.67, p < 0.001).

First, various studies used lifestyle proxies to operationalize CR (e.g., education, occupation, or physical activity), 20 but there is no consensus about the validity of these indirect measures. 3, 21, 22 Second, presence of AD was often established through clinical evaluation without consideration of AD biomarkers, likely resulting in samples confounded with non-AD participants. Third, few studies comprehensively investigated the relationship between CR and clinical progression across the entire AD spectrum, thus hampering a direct comparison between disease stages.\nWe optimized the examination of CR in relation to ADrelated clinical progression by (1) using a (more direct) neuroimaging measure of CR, based on cognitive and structural brain measures, 23 (2) selecting \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2)-positive individuals only, and (3) including participants across the entire AD spectrum (i.e., normal cognition [NC] , mild cognitive impairment [MCI] , and AD dementia).

Analysis of variance (ANOVA), \u03c7 2 , and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare disease stages by demographic variables, follow-up time, cognitive performance, ICV, and W scores. We used a multiple imputation procedure for the 0.3% of cognitive measures missing at baseline. This procedure was performed using the fully conditional specification method in SPSS, which is an iterative Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach suitable for arbitrary patterns of missing data. We imputed 15 data sets and included demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological variables and ICV as predictors in the model.\nRelationships among W scores, structural brain measures, and education First, we correlated W scores with the (ICV-adjusted) structural brain measures from which they were calculated (i.e., GM or WMH volume). We expected that these variables were interrelated because the higher the degree of cerebral damage, the greater the potential manifestation of CR. Moreover, as mathematically explained elsewhere, 38 residuals from linear regressions are inherently correlated with their dependent variables. Such a correlation would suggest that the relationship between W scores and clinical progression cannot be correctly interpreted without taking into account in the presence of cerebral damage, and thus we evaluated whether these structural measures could be included as covariates in subsequent statistical models, without violating the assumptions of multicollinearity. We considered a correlation r <0.8 between W scores and their related structural brain measure 39 and a variance inflation factor (VIF) <5 for these variables in combination with other covariates (age, sex, APOE4 status) 40 an acceptable level of multicollinearity. Furthermore, we determined the relationship of W scores and structural brain measures with education. As education is a well-known lifestyle proxy of CR, W scores should show a (positive) relationship with education, while this is not necessarily the case for the structural brain measures. We therefore grouped participants with lower (\u226414 years, n = 264), intermediate (15-17 years, n = 286), and higher education (>18 years, n = 289) and performed ANOVAs to examine differences among these groups in W scores (ICV-adjusted) and GM and WMH volumes.\nRelationships among W scores, structural brain measures, and education As expected, each W score showed a significant correlation with the structural brain measure from which it was derived (table e-1, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.cb0qk1g). Assumptions of multicollinearity were not violated (i.e., r < 0.8 and VIF <5 in all cases), thus we included the structural brain measures as covariates in the statistical models assessing the effect of W scores on clinical progression. ANOVA revealed significant differences between education groups for GM-based wholebrain (p = 0.043) and temporoparietal W scores (p = 0.047), such that highly educated participants showed higher W scores (i.e., greater CR) than those with lower education. The other 2 W scores and all structural brain measures did not show relationships with education (table 2). Since the association with education is an important validation step for the use of W scores as an operational measure of CR, we will only discuss results from the GM-based whole-brain and temporoparietal W scores here. However, all main statistical analyses were also performed in the GM-based hippocampal and WMH-based W scores (tables e-2-e-4, doi.org/10.5061/ dryad.cb0qk1g). For simplicity, we will refer to \"whole-brain/ temporoparietal W scores\" in the remaining Results sections, thus omitting the term \"GM-based.\" W scores and cognitive decline Linear mixed models in the total sample (n = 839) showed that higher whole-brain W scores were related to better baseline performance on ADNI-MEM (\u03b2 = 121.19, p < 0.001) and ADNI-EF (\u03b2 = 86.78, p < 0.001). Furthermore, these scores declined over time (ADNI-MEM: \u03b2 = \u22121.35, p < 0.001; ADNI-EF: \u03b2 = \u22121.28, p < 0.001). Importantly, this relationship was moderated by CR, such that participants with higher W scores (i.e., greater CR) showed an attenuated decline in ADNI-MEM (\u03b2 = 0.48, p < 0.001) and ADNI-EF (\u03b2 = 0.67, p < 0.001). When stratifying by disease stage, these interaction effects for ADNI-MEM remained similar among NC (\u03b2 = 0.52, p = 0.028) and MCI participants (\u03b2 = 0.43, p = 0.003), but were inverted in the AD dementia group (\u03b2 = \u22120.91, p = 0.002). A similar pattern was observed for ADNI-EF (NC: \u03b2 = 0.42, p = 0.077; MCI: \u03b2 = 0.59, p < 0.001; AD dementia: \u03b2 = \u22120.77, p = 0.081), although these effects were slightly weaker and mostly nonsignificant. The results for AD dementia participants were significantly different from the other 2 groups (figure 2). Results for temporoparietal W scores were highly comparable (table 3 ). An overview of all W score models and the effect of each individual predictor on cognitive decline is available (tables e-3 and e-4, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.cb0qk1g). Finally, repeating our main analyses using only within-disease stage time points yielded results in the same direction for both whole-brain and temporoparietal W scores. The effects for NC participants were no longer significant (table e-5, doi.org/10.5061/dryad. cb0qk1g). "}, {"section_title": "W scores and diagnostic conversion", "text": "We performed Cox regressions among predementia participants (NC, n = 175; MCI, n = 437) to study relationships between (continuous) W scores and diagnostic conversion (i.e., change in baseline diagnosis from NC to MCI/AD dementia, or from MCI to AD dementia). Diagnostic changes to a less advanced disease stage (e.g., MCI to NC, which sporadically occurred in the sample) was not considered a conversion. We ran 4 models for each W score, and included the related structural measure (i.e., ICV-adjusted whole-brain, temporoparietal, or hippocampal GM volume or WMH volume), age, sex, and APOE4 status as covariates. These analyses were also stratified for MCI and NC. We used 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare W score effects between disease stages; differences were considered significant when the effect size for one group fell outside of the CI of the other group. 41 W scores and cognitive decline To examine clinical progression in more psychometric detail, we performed linear mixed models with memory (ADNI-MEM) and executive functioning (ADNI-EF) as outcome variables and (continuous) W score, time (i.e., months), and W score \u00d7 time as predictors. The interaction term was the effect of interest, as it reflected whether CR moderated the relationship between time and cognitive performance. Our models contained random intercepts and slopes. Note that, in contrast to the Cox regressions, the AD dementia group (n = 227) was now also included for analysis. Again, we ran separate models for each W score in the total group and stratified by disease stage, while correcting for structural measures (ICV-adjusted GM or WMH volume, and their interaction with time) as well as age, sex, and APOE4 status.\nIn secondary analyses, we repeated the main linear mixed models, but only included time points that were collected until the (first) date of diagnostic conversion. To illustrate the relevance of this analysis, consider a participant with MCI at baseline, a diagnostic conversion to AD dementia at 48 months, and a total follow-up of 108 months. In stratified analyses, this participant would be classified into the MCI group, although 56% of the data actually concern clinical progression during the AD dementia stage. Constraining the linear mixed models to exclusively consider data from the initial diagnosis leads to results that are completely nonoverlapping with respect to disease stage (and thus more easily interpretable).\nComparison with other models of clinical progression If our W scores were related to clinical progression, we would assume that this is an effect of CR. However, an alternative explanation would be that W scores are a derivative measure of cerebral damage, which presumably also relates to clinical progression. Although we partly accounted for this by including structural brain measures as covariates in the statistical models, we explicitly aimed to investigate whether W scores added explanatory value to the prediction of clinical progression. We therefore compared our main models of clinical progression (which included both structural brain measures and W scores) to models in which W scores were not included. We used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) 42 to evaluate which of the 2 models showed a better fit to the data. AIC assesses the model fit while also penalizing the number of predictors, thus favoring models with the optimal trade-off between parsimony and goodness-of-fit. A lower AIC value indicates a better model. We also assessed whether including W scores in models with a cognitive measure (ADAS-Cog 13) resulted in significant AIC improvements."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity analyses", "text": "We performed additional analyses to ensure that our main findings were robust to different methodologic decisions. We recalculated the W scores in 2 ways: (1) we allowed a nonlinear relationship between cognition and cerebral damage by adding a quadratic term (i.e., ADAS-Cog 13 2 ), as the CR theory describes a curve that reflects a relationship between cerebral damage and clinical symptoms that is initially flat and changes exponentially; (2) we created W scores based on ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF as cognitive measures and instead used ADASCog 13 as an outcome measure of cognitive decline. These recalculated W scores were replaced with the original W scores in the Cox regressions and linear mixed models, and we assessed whether this replacement led to relevant changes. Table 1 provides an overview of our A\u03b2-positive sample (mean age 73.9 years; median education 16 years). Demographic characteristics were similar across disease stages, except that the proportion of APOE4 positivity was higher among more advanced disease stages (NC: 45.7%, MCI: 63.2%, AD dementia: 73.6%), 43 and the NC group included more female participants (58.3%) relative to MCI and AD dementia groups (42.3% and 43.6%, respectively). NC participants also had a lower ICV (1,482.1 \u00b1 145.1 cm 3 ) compared to MCI participants (1,519.3 \u00b1 157.6 cm 3 ), and their GM-based hippocampal W scores (\u22120.27 \u00b1 0.91) were lower than in MCI and AD dementia participants (0.07 \u00b1 1.01, 06 \u00b1 1.00, respectively). The other W scores were comparable across disease stages. On all cognitive measures, there were significant baseline differences between disease stages in the expected direction (i.e., AD dementia < MCI < NC). Similarly, CSF biomarkers were more abnormal with increasing clinical severity (i.e., lower CSF A\u03b2 and higher CSF p-tau and t-tau). The median follow-up was 24 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-42) in the total sample, with a shorter duration in the AD dementia group (median 12 months, IQR 6-18) compared to the other 2 groups (median 36 months, IQR .

This was also found for temporoparietal W scores (tables e-6-e-8, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.cb0qk1g). Likewise, the results from stratified analyses did not show relevant changes as a function of whole-brain and temporoparietal W score adjustments, except that we no longer found an exacerbating effect on clinical progression in AD dementia. The sensitivity analyses yielded largely similar results as observed in the primary analyses, although findings among the AD dementia group were not fully replicated."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the present study we investigated how CR, defined as the degree to which an individual's observed cerebral damage was higher or lower than predicted from cognitive performance, affected clinical progression in AD. In an A\u03b2-positive sample of participants in different stages across the entire disease spectrum (i.e., NC, MCI, and AD dementia), we found that CR influenced diagnostic conversion risk and the rate of cognitive decline. Importantly, these effects were not uniform across disease stages. While CR was associated with attenuated clinical progression in NC and MCI participants, it related to exacerbated cognitive decline among individuals with AD dementia. A possible explanation for these findings is that every individual-regardless of CR-reaches the end stage of AD at roughly the same time or level of cerebral damage, and thus a delayed symptom onset or slower initial decline is inherently counterbalanced by a faster progression towards this end point. 1 Understanding these complex longitudinal associations of CR with clinical progression may improve the accuracy of individualized prognoses for patients with AD.\nAlthough previous literature in the context of AD has not consistently shown a relationship between CR and clinical progression, [16] [17] [18] [19] there are several studies within early stages of AD that also reported CR-related attenuated decline or delay in symptom onset. These studies defined CR by educational level, 4, 5, 7 composite scores, 2, 6 or a \"residual approach\"-based measure (comparable to our W score method). 3 Likewise, multiple studies have previously demonstrated that after the (delayed) onset of clinical symptoms, patients with higher CR show a steeper functional decline. This was found for symptomatic individuals with higher education, 8 reading activity, 14 IQ, 9 or a combination of these CR measures. 13 However, while these studies generally focused on clinical progression from one particular stage of AD, we concurrently examined the longitudinal effect of CR in a broad sample of participants with NC, MCI, or AD dementia. This approach allowed us to demonstrate the paradoxical phenomenon of initial attenuation and subsequent exacerbation within a single dataset, using a uniform methodology. In addition, our study design allowed us to estimate where the CR-related inflection point in clinical progression is located on the trajectory of AD. Our results suggest that the protective role of CR continues into the MCI stage, and that its adverse relationship with clinical progression starts around the onset of AD dementia. To our knowledge, there is one other study demonstrating the paradoxical manifestation of CR within one sample. 10 This study was carried out in initially healthy participants who all progressed to (AD or non-AD) dementia. The authors were interested in the onset of accelerated cognitive decline, which preceded the diagnosis Figure 2 Trajectories of memory and executive functions by level of cognitive reserve The Y-axis represents estimated marginal means. Cognitive reserve groups were created (for visualization purposes) by calculating tertiles in each disease stage-(A) normal cognition, (B) mild cognitive impairment, and (C) Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia-based on mean gray matter (GM)-based W scores in the temporoparietal mask. The lines displayed correspond to APOE4-positive men with a (disease stage-specific) average age and intracranial volumeadjusted GM volume in the temporoparietal cortex. In the linear mixed models, W scores were included as a continuous variable, and memory and executive functions composite scores were multiplied by 100. Note that the maximum follow-up time for AD dementia participants is shorter (i.e., 24 months) compared to the other 2 groups (i.e., 120 months). ADNI = Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; ADNI-EF = standardized composite score based on a clock drawing task, animal and vegetable category fluency, the Trail-making task, Digit Span Backwards from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, and the digit-symbol substitution task from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test-Revised; ADNI-MEM = standardized composite score based on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale word list learning task, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Logical Memory from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, and the Mini-Mental State Examination recall task. of dementia in all participants. Results showed that higher CR, as defined by years of education, related to a shorter time period between the onset of accelerated decline and the dementia diagnosis. These results were interpreted as follows: individuals with higher CR remained in phases of gradual cognitive decline for longer (i.e., presumably reflecting NC and MCI), but the transition between (late) MCI and dementia was relatively steep. Similar to our findings, the authors thus demonstrated that the inflection from attenuation to exacerbation took place around (or just prior to) the onset of dementia.\nStrengths of this study include our neuroimaging method to capture CR. 23 W scores are not based on lifestyle proxies, but derived from more direct measures that constitute the core of the concept (i.e., cognition and cerebral damage). Moreover, although CR is often conceptualized as a brain quality that an individual has gradually developed and carried since adulthood, our W scores only reflect an individual's current degree of CR, based on how well cerebral damage is tolerated at the present level of cognitive function. This is important, as CR presumably changes over time either due to alterations in lifestyle (e.g., decreases/increases in physical activity) or as a direct consequence of disease progression. While W scores may capture these changes, they could be missed when less dynamic CR measures are used, such as education. That is, once education is completed, this lifestyle proxy remains the same, regardless of midlife and late life exposures. Another advantage of our study is the fact that AD was established through both clinical consensus and the evaluation of PET or CSF biomarkers.\nOur study has several limitations. First, there was a relatively short follow-up duration for participants with AD dementia (median 12 months), possibly because repeated cognitive testing is more challenging at clinically advanced stages. As cognitive changes may be harder to capture over shorter follow-up durations, this could have caused a bias towards the detection of CR effects in participants who were less affected. Second, the sample sizes in our stratified analyses were unequal, resulting in lower thresholds for significance in MCI (n = 437) vs AD dementia (n = 227) or NC (n = 175). In our interpretation of the results, we therefore also considered effect sizes, which are not affected by sample size. Third, although we ensured that our entire sample was A\u03b2-positive, this was based on PET imaging for some individuals, and on CSF measures for others. While high concordance between these 2 approaches has been demonstrated, 44 other data suggest that they cannot be used interchangeably. 45, 46 Fourth, as expected, our W scores were collinear with the structural brain measures from which they were derived. On a group level, individuals with higher W scores (i.e., greater CR) thus had more cerebral damage. To assess the unique association of CR with clinical progression, we therefore adjusted the statistical models for the level of cerebral damage at baseline. Although the assumptions for multicollinearity were not violated, interdependence of predictors generally affects the accuracy of the estimation of coefficients in multivariate models to at least some degree. 39 However, even despite the presumed inflation of CIs and standard errors, the effects for W scores still reached significance, which is likely related to our large sample size (i.e., >800 participants).\nA more general limitation inherent to the W score method is that its ability to capture CR is a direct consequence of the measures included in the underlying model. If the neuroimaging or cognitive measures do not adequately reflect AD-related changes, then the resulting W scores become less accurate. As an example, we used different GM and WMH volumes to quantify cerebral damage, but only 2 of them (i.e., whole brain and temporoparietal GM volume) yielded W scores that related to education. We argue that hippocampal GM-based and WMH-based W scores were less valid measures of CR, likely because the structural measures in these underlying models did not optimally reflect cerebral damage across the AD spectrum. In fact, adjusted for covariates, ADAS-Cog 13 showed no correlation with WMH volume (r = 0.00, p = 0.983) in our total sample, and while such a correlation did exist with hippocampal GM volume (r = \u22120.56, p < 0.001), it was considerably lower for participants with AD dementia (r = \u22120.33, p < 0.001). This suggests that hippocampal GM volume reaches a plateau in advanced clinical stages and thus has a more restricted dynamic range than whole-brain or temporoparietal GM volume. On a related note, the ADAS-Cog 13 (which was used as a cognitive measure to calculate W scores) covers multiple cognitive domains, but executive functions are underrepresented. 47 Participants with executive dysfunction may therefore have received ADAS-Cog 13 scores that underestimated their true level of cognitive impairment. This could have led to less accurate W scores, which could in turn explain why the results for ADNI-EF were generally weaker compared to ADNI-MEM. Although our neuroimaging measure thus contains some variance of no interest, the nature of our results and their compatibility with the theoretical model nevertheless suggest that the (GM-based whole-brain and temporoparietal) W scores truly reflected CR.\nGaining a better understanding of how trajectories of clinical progression differ as a function of CR has both scientific and clinical value. Our findings help to clarify inconsistencies in the existing literature, and may further contribute to the conceptualization of CR. 1 These scientific steps are ultimately important for the development of nonpharmacologic strategies to delay the onset of clinical AD by enhancing CR. Increased awareness of associations between CR and clinical progression also has implications for clinical trials. Matching patients based on their level of CR may improve the ability to identify intervention effects on clinical progression. Without adequately controlling for initial differences between treatment groups in CR, both false-positive and -negative results can arise (i.e., an apparent effect of treatment that is truly related to CR, or a true effect that is masked due to CR). Moreover, CR could act as a moderator between the intervention and clinical outcome, such that individuals with low CR benefit more (or less) than those with high CR. Finally, taking CR into account in a clinical setting may facilitate prognostic accuracy for individual patients. As evidenced by the increasing interest in biomarker-based prognostic tools for clinicians, 48 ,49 a neuroimaging approach such as the W score method-especially when CR is estimated from readily available markers (e.g., medial temporal lobe atrophy and MMSE scores)-could be instrumental in this process.
