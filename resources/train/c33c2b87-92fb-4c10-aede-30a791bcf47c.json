The most intense and severe class of these cyclones develop in the Caribbean seas and are termed hurricanes. Therefore, structures in coastal communities along the Atlantic and Gulf Coast region are subject to the most severe nature of the numerous hazards that accompany these storms. These hazards are not limited to the large wind gusts that are notorious to the event. Intense storm surge and flooding have been shown to be the most damaging aspect to human life and property. Despite these hazards the population has grown in many of these communities, driven by the moderate year round climate, theme park attractions and beautiful beaches. Due to the increase in population in these areas, civil infrastructure has been constructed to accommodate the public need. As a result, more structural systems have been exposed to these hazards such as buildings, bridges, floodwalls (levees), dams and other coastal structures. Devastating hurricanes such as Andrew or Katrina have shed light on the poor performance of the existing design methodologies and codes, with numerous coastal infrastructure failures. According to NIST report 1476, collaboration of over 26 experts from over 16 organizations including NIST, FHWA and USACE recommends the establishment of a risk-based design methodology for coastal structures, such as bridges. A performance based design methodology integrates risk analysis alongside the standard design objectives with a embedded goal of reducing loss to life and property. This shift requires a more realistic prediction of the structural behavior of the system under a more accurate description of the spectrum of loadings anticipated during the life-cycle. Therefore deterministic based design conventions are to be replaced with a more scientifically oriented design approach similar to the field of earthquake engineering. This approach is termed performance-based hurricane engineering (PBHE). However a distinct challenge is present in the implementation of such a methodology, because the wind and wave hazards are distinctly different from earthquake hazards. The spatial and temporal variation of the wind and wave loading is very drastic compared to earthquake motion. Site-specific seismic ground motion records are typically applied to a structure's foundation and spatial variation is not considered due to the rapid speed of seismic waves. On the other hand, hurricane hazards, such as wind and waves are drastically different as the structural configuration; orientations, and local site conditions all affect the loading distribution. This phenomenon creates the need for a wealth of simulated pressure/force records from an array of sensors placed all over the structure to take detailed readings during an extreme event. However, each record is site and structure specific and must be performed for a vast array of structures. Obviously, such an implementation is a drastic challenge to applying PBE. Currently this void in this data has prevented widespread forecasting and damage mitigation efforts . Only recently in 2010 with the formation Digital Hurricane Consortium (DHC) has widespread collaboration among field activities have initiated in developing such a database. Distinct challenges are present in instrumentation, regularity of multiple platforms, and field logistics. Additionally three main contributions of uncertainty in characterizing the wind field include: (i) inherent or aleatory uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of the wind velocity and magnitude, (ii) epistemic uncertainty due to incomplete or missing data or information, and (iii) modeling uncertainty from estimating wind load effects on structural response (Kiureghan and Ditlevesen, 2009). The current framework for modeling hurricane hazards can be shown in Figure 1. Hurricane hazards are quantified in a probabilistic sense to determine quantities such as an appropriate distribution. From this point two different design approaches are available, codified hazard quantification and linear structural analysis techniques can be performed or time history pressure/forces readings can be collected for finite element modeling (FEM). A bridge between the two philosophies has been approached through a database assisted design procedure (DAD).  At the same time, the recent rise in computational hardware and computing power has formed an efficient field of experimental research. Numerical simulations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have risen in both the wind and wave engineering field, allowing more cost effective multiple hazard research. The use of fluid structure interaction (FSI) software has been validated in the aerospace and mechanical engineering fields for airfoils, racecars, and ship design for 20 years. Only recently has the concept been extended in Civil Engineering FSI problems such as wind and wave phenomena. In this study, CFD simulations were to be carried out on several prototype structures to thoroughly quantify the fluid hazards posed by a hurricane. Dynamic loads were to be generated for comprehensive linear and non-linear structural evaluation. The Tampa Bay region was selected due to the wide range of coastal structures and its susceptibility to Hurricane damage. Before CFD simulations will be carried out on the prototype structures, verification of the accuracy of the numerical simulation results is vital. Therefore, several records of laboratory wind tunnel and wave tank basin experimental data were collected to verify the accuracy of this tool. These verifications are a significant contribution as thorough comparisons shall continue to enhance the confidence and warrant the practical use of CFD in structural design. Additionally the widespread application of PBHE requires a versatile tool such as CFD"}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Numerous structural hazards are associated with hurricanes that accompany the storm event. Identification and quantification of these extreme hazards are essential to application of a performance based structural design. Performance based engineering design has been historically applied to the field of earthquake engineering to assess hazards such as earthquake intensity or liquefaction. However, the hazards that are associated with a hurricane can range from wind, storm surge, waves and the potential for airborne or waterborne debris. Therefore in this study the concept of PBE was extended in the hurricane engineering field."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Hazards", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Maximum Wind Speed", "text": "The classification of a tropical storm/cyclone into a hurricane is quantified through the maximum wind speed. When the sustained maximum speed of the storm winds reach (33m/s, 74mph), the storm is officially classified as a hurricane according to the Saffir-Simpson scale. These intense warm low pressure systems have an organized structure as shown in   (1) To illustrate this effect, an anemometer reading 10m above the ground in a hurricane is plotted in Figure 3 (Holmes, 2001) The modeling and simulations of the natural wind flow phenomena around structures were first studied using wind tunnels. Both aeroelastic and rigid scaled models equipped with numerous transducers are commonly tested for fluctuating pressures induced by blowers or fans. This technique has been validated in studies from surface pressure measurements on several existing structures. One of these studies includes the Silsoe Structures building experiment started in November 1990 by the UK Building Research Establishment. A large steel portal frame building equipped with pressure taps and strain gauges to measure structural response (Robertson, 1988). Results indicated for transverse flow from (0-180\u00b0), that accurate pressure coefficients were obtained for both peak and time averaged values. Generally these measurements justified the use of wind tunnel simulations for low-rise buildings. However distinct challenges are still present in the use of wind tunnels in areas such as similitude scaling. An exact equality of the kinematic, geometric and dynamic similarity including Reynolds number and the Rossby Number for both prototype and model flows cannot be obtained (Cermak, 1975). Conversely Reynolds number independence can be achieved for these flow characteristics in a long wind tunnel composed of numerous roughness elements. Different modeling techniques are typically employed in wind tunnel modeling such as the high-frequency force balance technique which was first reported by Tschanz et al. (1983). The method involves using a very rigid, high-frequency balance model system where only the exterior surface of the structure is represented. Wind tunnel studies are then carried out on this system and the overall fluctuating pressures are combined with the structural properties to analytically determine the full-scale responses. Conversely, aero-elastc models involve simulating the interaction between the motion of the structure and the aerodynamic forces. Applications of this method typically include lightweight, deformable or lightly damped structural systems where stationary models cannot accurately capture the potential additional motion induced forces such as flutter. Although structural failure rarely occurs from extreme wind speeds, a vast majority of the structural wind damage occurs primarily to single family residential dwellings (Prevatt, 2009). Wind damage to low rise buildings is primarily attributed to loss of the building envelope and roof damage. Therefore researchers such as Simui et al. (2003) contend that the simplifications of the current ASCE 7-05 analytical procedure can produce vast differences when compared to experimental wind tunnel pressure fluctuation loads."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge", "text": "Storm surge can be simply defined as the rise of water toward the shore by the force of the wind swirling around an advancing storm (National Oceanic Atmospheric Adminstration-NOAA). The surge created from the winds combines with the mean sea level to create a hurricane storm tide. Storm surge caused by hurricanes is one of the most devastating natural phenomena as nine out of every ten hurricane related fatalities are attributed to storm surge (FEMA-456). Some of the deadliest natural disasters in United States history occurred from storm surge waves impacting coastal communities. The potential for this hazard is intensified today as much of the Atlantic and Gulf Coast communities are densely populated and lie less than (4.5m, 15ft) above the mean sea level. Storm surge heights are affected by several variables including the timing of astronomical tides, maximum wind speed and bathymetry of the ocean bottom. For example a steep drop from the shoreline creates a deep pocket of water that reduces the storm surge effect but produces a more powerful wave. Conversely, a long and gently sloping shoreline can produce higher storm surges with small waves. Figure 4 displays this effect as the deep water reduces the energy of the oncoming wave and allows that energy to dissipate. "}, {"section_title": "Waves", "text": "Waves are typically generated in the deep water by the wind blowing across the surface. Some of the key characteristics of waves are the height, wave length and wave period. In fluid dynamics, the wave height of a surface wave is the difference between the elevations of a crest and a neighboring trough. The wavelength is a measure of the horizontal distance between the crest and trough, and the wave period is the time it takes for two consecutive crests or troughs to pass a fixed point (Kinsmen, 1984). . The waves that are generated during a hurricane are composed of a series of random waves with various heights and periods. The height and period of these waves are affected by numerous factors, including wind speeds; wind duration, fetch length and water depth. Illustrations of the effect of some of these variables are shown in Figure 5. The fetch can be seen as the distance over which a wind profile will travel before reaching the structure. From the Figure, one can see that the increased duration of the wind has significantly increased the wave height over time until they reach a state of a fully developed wave.  (Sheppard, 2006) Wave damage from hurricanes is significant and is most common in the coastal bridge infrastructure. Recent Hurricanes including Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina, heavily damaged most of the existing low-lying Gulf Coast concrete bridges. These bridges were subjected to the wave forces of the hurricane as storm surge levels rose and inundated many of the bridges superstructures. Bridges are not the only structure affected by hurricanes as coastal buildings are also subjected to wave forces due to the rising storm surge and tidal conditions. During a survey of post-Katrina Hurricane damage, a number of failures of parking garages in flat slab, double-tee and prestressed concrete floor systems resulted from the hydrodynamic uplift induced by the surge and wave action (Robertson, 2007). These detrimental effects have initiated numerous studies into the quantification of -wavein-deck loads\u2016 which can be defined as hydraulic loads applied by waves to the deck or other protruding elements (Cuomo, 2007). Laboratory wave tank basin facilities are currently the accepted form of gathering wave-in-deck time dependent loads . Researchers such as Sheppard et al. (2009) and Cuomo et al. (2007) have concluded that wave-in-deck loads can be classified into two classes, Impact and Quasi-static. A specific frequency or time period is not specified to distinguish the two categories, as the structure properties affect the classification. Typically wave-in-deck loads can be classified as impact loads if the load rise time is less than twice the resonant period for the mode related to the applied load (Cuomo, 2007). Both characteristics are seen in a typical wave loading and thus the time history is idealized as shown in Figure 6. Wallingford, UK (Cuomo, 2007) Scour A secondary source of structural damage occurs to foundation systems during the recession of a passing hurricane. Receding water flowing around the structure at a high rate may led to erosion of the soils which support the foundation. The rate at which scour occurs depends primarily upon the soil type. In addition to any storm or flood-induced erosion that occurs in the general area, scour is generally limited to small, cone-shaped depressions. Localized scour reduces the resistance of the foundation system by reducing its embedment. This reduction in bearing capacity can readily cause the partial or total collapse of a coastal foundation. The soil scour phenomena can occur as a shear or liquefaction-induced failure. The liquefaction-induced scour is more ubiquitous during hurricane episodes (Robertson, 2008). The soil matrix undergoes pore pressure change as the periodic wave action induces flow of the soil particles below the foundation. This scour can then be intensified by the rapid drawdown of the water in an inundated area as pore pressure changes are occurring much more rapidly."}, {"section_title": "Flooding", "text": "Flooding can occur during a hurricane event, both inland and along the coastal communities. Inland flooding (typically termed flash flood) occurs from intense rainfall that in a very small region over a relatively small time interval. Coastal flooding is typically created from a combination of storm surge, oceanic tides, and rainfall. Flooding has a variety of impacts on coastal buildings and their foundations, including hydrostatic forces, hydrodynamic forces, flood borne debris forces, and erosion and scour. These forces can dislodge buildings from their foundation with poor connections. Flooding is also a major concern to emergency officials as it is the leading cause of fatalities during hurricanes."}, {"section_title": "Wind and Waterborne Debris", "text": "Wind Damage to structures is not limited only to the fluctuating surface pressures on the building envelope but flying debris that are generated in the wind field also. These airborne missiles have the possibility of striking the structure and penetrating the building envelope. The loss of the building enclosure can lead to undesirable consequences like high internal pressures, additional debris and water damage (Holmes, 2001). Waterborne debris can be produced during flood events and can include a variety of objects. The potential for waterborne debris has been mapped in specific regions as determined by the ASCE. The waterborne debris region is defined as areas within hurricane-prone regions within one mile of the coastal mean-high-water line where the basic wind speed is (49 m/s, 110mph). Wind and waterborne debris are not as widespread as other hazards that are associated with the hurricane event and are therefore not as thoroughly quantified. One empirical formula is provided by ASCE 7 for impact forces. In Equation 2, the impact force (F) is given by the weight of the object (w), impact velocity (v), acceleration of gravity (g) and the impact duration (\u2206t) (typically 0.03-0.3 sec). (2) t g wv \uf044 \uf03d 2 F \uf070 However, the location and time varying aspect of this loading phenomenon is not fully understood and is rarely accounted for in structural design. Additionally, according to a survey of post-Katrina coastal damage, very few structures were damaged by debris from the storm (Robertson, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Quantification of Hurricane Hazards", "text": "Some effort has been made to quantify the hazards that are associated with hurricane events. The Saffir-Simpson Scale was formulated in 1969 by Herbert Saffir, a consulting engineer, and Dr. Bob Simpson, Director of the National Hurricane Center. The need for the scale was founded on the principle of communicating the gradations of risk that are associated with hurricanes that may allow emergency officials to better manage these disasters. Although the scale is based on physical observations of wind damage and storm surge events seen in hurricanes, the rating of a storm is highly subjective and is not a definitive probabilistic quantity. Due to the non-uniform nature of the hurricane structure, a single category rating for the entire storm will yield inaccurate results. Thus, the application of the Saffir-Simpson scale in PBE is very limited but it is a useful tool in describing the potential hazards associated with the intensity of the storm. These codes contain minimum standards of care (and performance) and no information on how to achieve better performance or protection against manmade or natural hazards (Whittaker, 2005). The current codes in practice including ASCE 7 and International Building Code (IBC) are only reviewed following a disastrous event and are based on judgments by distinguished design professionals as to whether the losses were acceptable, given the severity of the event. This lack of quantitative evaluation of the performance of the structures gives very inaccurate conclusions on the state of the design community. Therefore it is believed that the development of performance-based engineering tools for extreme loadings on structures will improve out civil infrastructure. PBE was first applied to earthquake engineering but, it has been extended into other extreme hazards both manmade and natural including blast, fire, hurricanes, and tornadoes. An example framework of the PBE methodology has been outlined by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER). A typical PBE assessment approach is a four step procedure that first involves identifying all potential hazards in a more scientifically oriented procedure called Hazard Analysis. Next, the structure is analyzed under the given hazards in Structural Analysis to determine demand parameters, such as the story drift. According to the specific building type and arrangement, the structural response can be mapped to the damage potential in Damage Analysis. Once the damages of the structure have been determined, the Losses of the structure can be quantified in terms of loss of time, money and life in Loss Analysis."}, {"section_title": "Performance-Based Hurricane Engineering", "text": "Performance based hurricane engineering (PBHE) is a relatively active field of research. Currently, most of the work in PBHE has been focused on specific hazards that are associated with the hurricane event, and no current experimental research has been conducted on the combined effects of hurricanes including wind and hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces. Numerous studies are currently active in investigating these loads through both numerical and experimental measures. Numerous studies have been conducted on designing structures due to wind loads in a performance based manner. Some of these studies include Sibilio and Ciampoli et al. (2007) inwhich advanced Monte Carlo simulation was carried out on a footbridge subjected to turbulent wind. Norton et al. 2007presented an efficient method for analyzing structures under hurricanes loads for tall buildings. Ongoing research at the University of Florida has been focused on both full and 1/3 scale residential structures composed of wood subjected to the UF Hurricane Simulator (Prevatt, 2009). Another field of PBHE is in the field of wave and storm surge effects to structures termed as Performance Based Tsunami Engineering (PBTE). Waves are generated by both tsunamis and hurricanes, which have been shown to have devastating effects to life and property. Currently engineers have little to no guidance to when designing structures in wave prone areas (Yim, 2009). However numerous studies have been recently conducted on the wave effects on structures. Cuomo et al. (2007) in which guidance for hydraulic loads for bridge decks were given from wave flume tests at HR Wallingford in the UK. Shepperd et al. 2009developed a theoretical wave force models from a wide range of wave conditions from 1200 wave basin tests. Ongoing research at the Tsunami Wave Basin (TWB) is being performed to investigate the response of residential structures by subjecting scaled 1/6 models. Wave Induced forces are measured for different building configurations to see the change in the wave-induced loads (Yim, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Some of this research includes work from", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Database Assisted Design (DAD)", "text": "A Database Assisted Design methodology implements directional time history data of experimental pressure coefficients obtained from wind tunnel testing for use in the design and analysis of structures (Main and Fritz, 2006). The first step in building a DAD program is the collection of a plethora of wind tunnel data for various wind angles and surface terrain conditions. One such application of the DAD procedure was in the development of a MATLAB program named WINDPRESSURE (Main and Fritz, 2006). The program provides a graphical user interface that develops structural responses such as internal bending moment and deflection that can allow the performance of the structure to be assessed. The DAD program then utilizes an interpolation algorithm to allow for mapping of tested building models to any building dimensions. Therefore once developed any building of similar structural orientation and arrangement may be designed to achieve better performance."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Models", "text": "The ability to accurately predict the estimated levels of storm surge and waves anticipated from a given hurricane event is crucial for emergency officials and design engineers. Several computer generated surge and wave prediction models are currently available. Currently two commonly used packages are Sea, Lake Overland Surges from Hurricane (SLOSH) and ADvanced coastal CIRCulation and storm surge modeling (ADCIRC). ADCIRC is based on solving the time dependent, free surface circulation and transport problems in two and three dimensions. Typical ADCIRC applications have included everything from analysis of hurricane storm surge and flooding to dredging and material disposal studies. One study coupled the ADCIRC (ADvanced CIRCulation) surge model and the SWAN (Simulation of Waves in Near shore areas) wave models. The team simulated the storm surge and wind waves generated by Hurricane Katrina on the Mississippi and Alabama coasts for developing a theoretical wave equation for bridge decks (Douglass, 2006). A government created surge model commonly used by FEMA officials is named SLOSH, which was created by the National Weather Service (NWS). SLOSH is two-dimensional, numerical and dynamic storm surge modelers that can be used to develop real time estimates of storm surge levels generated from Hurricanes, by taking into account a storm's pressure, size, forward speed, forecast track, wind speeds, and topographical data. SLOSH is not considered a predictive tool as the track of the hurricane at landfall must be known for accurate simulation of the storm surge. The SLOSH program divides the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts into 41 basins, which are further subdivided into smaller polar coordinate grids that allow for more accurate refinement of each basin. Using these refined grid meshes the individual elements of the SLOSH grid are the basis for calculating the water surface elevations caused by storm surge in a specific SLOSH basin. The transport equations of motion are used for calculating the storm surge in the SLOSH models (Jelesnianski, 1992). "}, {"section_title": "Computational Wind Engineering (CWE)", "text": "The application of CFD in wind engineering is termed computational wind engineering. This field of research is still very limited in its widespread use, but it has seen a recent rise in interest. Hardware and software capabilities have increased tremendously since CWE's inception in the late 1980's. This has led to significant progress toward application of CWE to evaluate wind loads on buildings. Some countries such as Japan have established methods for assessing pedestrian wind levels using Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) (Dagnew, 2009). RANS and LES turbulence modeling approaches are typically performed in any CFD modeling application to reduce computational demand. Direct solution of the Navier-Stokes equations requires very fine grids to accurately capture all turbulence scales in the flows and is not applicable to typical Reynolds numbers encountered in wind engineering (Franke, 2004). LES involves solving the time-dependent fluid equations on a coarse grid which removes the small scale turbulence of the flow. The RANS modeling approach employs turbulence models to the averaged equations to directly yield the steady state solution of the flow variables (Franke, 2004). The RANS modeling approach is the most common approach used in CWE. As stated by Dr. Dagnew from Florida International University (FIU) that -at this stage in the CWE community, a systematic validation of CWE models through comparison with wind tunnel experiments will enhance the confidence and warrant its use for practical applications.\u2016 Thus, numerous researchers from around the nation are working on improving this technique and validating its precision. Ganeshan (2009) presented LES simulation coefficient of drag comparisons for stack interface applications. Numerical wind loading pressures developed on a basic cube were investigated in studies by (Stathopoulous, 2002) and (Lim, 2009). Some of the computational efforts that have devoted to tall buildings include Huang et al (2007) and Braun et al. (2009) in which flow patterns and both mean and RMS pressure coefficients were compared.  Figure 9. Also included in the plot are other researchers work on the same data collected including Braun (2009) and Huang (2007). Pressure coefficient comparisons deteriorate slightly at the sidewalls but improve at the leeward wall (Dagnew, 2009). The shapes of the plots are very similar to a horseshoe vortex shape contour generated along the windward face that agrees with the wind tunnel simulations.  (Dagnew, 2009) Figure 9: Mean Pressure Coefficient Comparison among numerous researchers along the perimeter of the CAARC test building at two thirds the height. (Dagnew, 2009) Mean pressure coefficients have shown to be relatively in good agreement with other CWE models as shown by similar researchers such as Palmer et al. 2003, however no current research is known into the time dependent pressure coefficient comparison has been made. This is a vital requirement for use of CFD data in performance based engineering as dynamic response is measured."}, {"section_title": "Computational Tsunami Engineering (CTE)", "text": "The application of CFD techniques are also currently being researched in the field of coastal engineering. The application of CFD to Tsunamis is termed Computational Tsunami Engineering. Similar to CWE research, CTE is a very innovative field and only a select few Universities are conducting such research. As discussed previously, the TWB at OSU was constructed to further understand the dynamic interactions of tsunamis and structures. Also computational efforts are being conducted on the use of CFD modeling for predicting the wave forces generated during tsunamis or hurricanes. One such study included single setup waves impacting a cylinder in the TWB. Impact forces were compared with CFD numerical model simulations, using the software LS-DYNA (Yim, 2009). This work was performed as a preliminary check to address the validity of the numerical simulation. Comparisons of the two methods are shown in Figure 10. Very good agreement is seen between the CFD models and the TWB experimental data. Additionally, wave surface pressures are also estimated for various depths using the LS-DYNA simulation. This study confirmed that the possibility of CFD modeling of extreme wave forces from tsunamis or hurricane-generated waves is feasible.  problems. This feature is accomplished through the use of two separate descriptions of motion. This step is an important consideration for simulating flow problems using numerical methods as the choice of an appropriate kinematical description of the flow field can affect the accuracy and stability of the results (Donea and Huerta, 2003). The algorithms of continuum mechanics make use of three distinct types of description of motion: the Lagrangian, the Eulerian and the ALE description. Dytran employs both Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions to model both fluid and structure motion. A short illustrative description of each technique is provided below. The Lagrangian formulation is utilized in Dytran for the motion of elements with a constant mass such as rigid structural materials. The motion of the material points, relate the material coordinates (X), to the spatial coordinates (x) by mapping \u03c5. Therefore during any time interval the link between X and x can be described by the law of motion. Due to the one to one mapping \u03c5 and since material points coincide with the same grid points during motion, the free surfaces and interfaces between materials is tracked easily through the inverse transformation (Donea and Huerta, 2003). Therefore the material is collected into a mesh, and as the body deforms each grid point moves with the material and the element distorts (Dytran, 2008). However, when large deformations occur such as vortices in fluids, Lagragian applications may be unable perform such calculations or even result in large errors (Donea and Huerta, 2003). Conversely, the Eulerian meshes are in a fixed reference frame in space and the continuum moves and deforms with respect to the computational grid. Conservation equations are formulated for variables and functions having an instantaneous significance in a specific fixed region (Donea and Huerta, 2003). This formulation therefore disassociates the mesh nodes  In this study, Dytran will be used for all CFD modeling applications for both wind and wave loadings. The goal of the study is to have the ability to generate both wind and wave load spectrums from Dytran simulations on two prototype structures. CFD has the ability to create a vast wealth of data on a variety of structural orientations, wind/wave velocities, and surface roughness conditions that a typical experimental setup is unable to reproduce. This computational power is one of the only solutions to full-scale application of PBHE."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLGY", "text": "In this study, a thorough investigation of hurricane hazards was performed using computational simulations. Numerous hazards associated with a hurricane event were reviewed including primary and secondary effects. However, due to wide scope and range of hurricane hazards, only the most probable effects that a typical structure experiences will be investigated. These hazards typically include extreme wind speeds, storm surge and the hydrodynamic forces from waves. The first step in applying CFD to modeling hazards such as wind was to verify the accuracy of the results obtained through these simulations. This was performed by collecting existing experimental data from full scale laboratory experiments and comparing the time dependent forces/pressures to those predicted from the CFD analysis. Once the models were verified, prototype simulations were performed on bridge and building structures. Once dynamic time history loads were generated structural FEM models were carried out to demonstrate demand analysis on prototype structures. This process is shown in Figure 13.

These wind tunnel time histories were presented in Ho et al. 2005 The building configuration chosen is a typical gabled structure. The model consisted of a 1:100 scale structure with dimensions (57 X 36.5 X 5.5 X 1.5 m, 187.5 X 120 X 18 X 5 ft (Length X Width X Eave Height X Rise). This building was placed in the UWO short wind tunnel equipped with approximately 4000 pressure taps sampled at 500 Hz for 100 seconds. Pictures of the building and experimental setup are shown in Figure 14. Consequently, the exact building was replicated using LES in Dytran. The same 1:100 scale model was made with 424 Lagragian shell elements made of an Elasto-Plastic steel material (DMATEP). However, the model was constructed to be effectively rigid by defining a thick shell for the structure. The boundary layer atmosphere was constructed with over 13,000 Eulerian quadrilateral solid elements (CHEXA).  One of the main benefits of the numerical simulation technique is the wealth of available data to be collected during the experiment. In this study, nodal force time histories for X, Y, Z and resultant components and Eulerian mesh parameters were recorded at a sampling rate of 500Hz. In the numerical models, a record of each nodes force time history can be recorded and converted to a pressure coefficient through the tributary area of each node. This will enable direct comparison with the wind tunnel pressure tap data. A typical CFD model was run for a 10 second duration at a sampling rate of 500Hz generating 1.5-2 GB of data. These models were run on a single core Pentium four processor, to generate the ten second duration worth of data and required 112 hours in simulation time. Due to these high computational costs, only two wind directions were used for validation with the wind tunnel. In the wind tunnel experiments, To ensure that all effects of the wind pressure distribution are captured throughout the building, CFD comparisons will be conducted for five separate locations of the building. The five locations used in the comparisons will be: windward wall, windward roof, leeward walls, leeward roof, and roof peak. On each face, a node from DYTRAN was selected and a corresponding pressure transducer from the wind tunnel experiment was sampled for direct comparison. For each node, a time varying force was captured in Dytran that could be converted to pressure through its tributary area. A list of the comparisons included: mean pressure coefficient, power spectral density (PSD), autocorrelation, integral length scale, and the turbulence intensity. An outline of each measure will be made in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Mean Pressure Coefficient", "text": "During wind tunnel testing experiments, measured external pressures are typically stored in a non-dimensional form known as pressure coefficients (Cp), as shown in Equation 3. The measured pressure, (P) is normalized by the air density, (\u03c1) and the mean wind velocity at roof height, (V) to obtain the pressure coefficient. From this parameter, wind pressures for any particular speed can be obtained by appropriate scaling. Data provided from the wind tunnel experiments at the UWO laboratory were given in the pressure coefficient form. However, in the CFD simulation Dytran generates force measurements that were converted to a pressure using each nodes tributary area. The velocity at the boundary was defined as (26.831m/s, 60mph) but this velocity is not the velocity seen at the mean roof height, when the air interacts with the structure. No measurements of wind velocity are taken during the simulations on the building however, the Eulerian mesh was inspected to observe the wind velocity. This value was found to be around (17.1m/s, 56.1ft/s) at the roofline and was used for all calculations. Another important characteristic for comparing mean pressure coefficients is to ensure that averaging time is consistent, as described by Main and Fritz (2006). ASCE 7-05 uses pressure coefficients derived from a 3 second gust at (10m, 33ft) above ground in current design standards. However, due to the model and prototype scaling, wind tunnel mean pressure coefficients are derived under a time window of approximately 1 hour (once converted to prototype scale) (Main and Fritz, 2006). During the verification studies as discussed previously Dytran mean pressure coefficients were derived from a ten second signal due to the high computational demands."}, {"section_title": "Power Spectral Density (PSD)", "text": "The power spectral density (PSD) of a random process describes the power distributions of the signal in the frequency domain. Thus it shows at which frequencies variations are strong and at which frequencies variations are weak. Mathematically, it is defined as twice the Fourier Transform of the autocorrelation sequence of the time series, or the squared value of the Fourier transform of the time series as shown in Equation 4. Simiu and Scanlan (1996) showed that the spectral density of the signal can be used to describe the energy spectrum of the turbulent motion (Yu, 2008). Turbulent energy fluctuations on the building can be seen as the superposition of numerous winds eddies that combines and contributes to the total kinetic energy. Each eddy is characterized by a periodic motion of circular frequency ( = 2 n) or wave number (\u03bb) (Yu, 2008). Thus, to ensure that Dytran has captured all turbulent eddy contributions of the wind, a PSD was then computed for both signals and compared. To smooth the PSD plot a Hamming window was applied to a Welch PSD (Yu, 2008). This method is based on the direct Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which was implemented in MATLAB. The plots were then normalized by the standard deviation of the longitudinal wind component (\u03c3 u ), Integral Length scale (Lu x ) and the mean wind speed (U). Due to both positive and negative deviations, the value is first squared and before averaging them, and finally the root is taken to given consistent wind speed units. Mathematically the formula for the standard deviation can be found in Equation 5.  (Holmes, 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Autocorrelation", "text": "Autocorrelation is a statistical tool used to measure the correlation of two values in the same data set at different time steps. The autocorrelation coefficient can detect non-randomness in data as it is closely related to the spectral density. The autocorrelation coefficient is also used in calculation of the integral length scale. The calculation of the autocorrelation function is shown in Equation 6 where T is defined as the length of time for the record and \u03c4 is defined as the time lag. According to Yu et al. (2008), the autocorrelation coefficient/function and integral length scale are affected by the length of record being analyzed (Yu, 2008). Therefore, for the autocorrelation comparison, only ten seconds of data from both the wind tunnel and CFD simulations will be used."}, {"section_title": ". (6)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Integral Length Scale", "text": "Another measure of the turbulence of the signal is the calculation of the integral length scale. The integral length scales of turbulence are measures of the average size of the turbulent eddies of flow. There are 9 scales corresponding to the three dimensions and three types of eddies (longitudinal, transverse and vertical). According to Simiu and Scanlan (1996), the integral length scale can be calculated according to Equation 7 where U is the mean wind speed, \u03c4 is the time lag, \u016b 2 is the longitudinal turbulence fluctuation and \u03c1 uu is the autocorrelation coefficient. The longitudinal turbulence fluctuation is based on an empirical constant \u03b2 and squared value of the friction velocity. Turbulence Intensity One of the most straightforward characteristics of the atmosphere's turbulence is described in a quantity termed the turbulence intensity. The turbulence intensity is defined mathematically as the ratio of the standard deviation of each fluctuating wind speed component to its mean value. Typically for wind observations, the time window used for the calculation is between 10 minutes and 1 hour (Simiu and Scanlan, 1996). For our DYTRAN simulations, the ten second record will be used for this calculation. The turbulence intensity is also compared against an approximate relationship given in Holmes (2001). Through measurements of surface wind gusts produced by large scale depression systems, the turbulence intensity can be approximated through Equation 8. Therefore, the turbulence intensity is entirely characterized by the surface roughness length of the terrain (z o ).

As stated in the literature review this is critical for the use of CFD in PBHE, as little research has been committed to this topic in the CWE field. Additionally Dytran is typically performed for sudden transient impulses and well developed turbulence models for LES simulations may not be employed. These applications typically include impact, ballistic or other short duration loading situations. These time durations typically are on the order of milliseconds or tenths of seconds. However, for wind tunnel comparisons the CFD simulations were ran for 10 seconds. In order to ensure that the dynamic response of a system is not lost in the numerical simulation the response of a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system was investigated. A program in MATHCAD was used to analyze a time dependent force input on a SDOF system with damping, according to the average acceleration method. The SDOF system was defined with a mass of (500kg, 1,100lb) which when scaled to model dimensions represents 110 kip and a natural frequency of 5Hz. The damping of the system was set to 5% of the critical damping. Due to the large wealth of collected data in 100 sec at 500 Hz (50,000 data points), only 10 seconds of the wind tunnel record was used and then the load was released for a total recording of 13 seconds. This was mimicked with the CFD simulation data, and comparisons were made of the displacement, velocity and acceleration of the SDOF system for all thirteen seconds. Finally, power spectral analysis of the response for each method was compared to verify the frequency content of the dynamic response.  (Sheppard, 2009) Bridge models were suspended from a steel bracing system in the wave tank and subjected to a series of monochromatic waves as shown in Figure 17. Measurements from the bridge model were taken by four multidirectional load cells placed on the steel support system and pressure transducers mounted across the bottom surface of models. The load cells and pressure transducers were sampled at a rate of 480 and 1000Hz, respectively.  (Sheppard, 2009). Thus, in this study, only one of the bridge deck models tested was replicated numerically using Dytran. The structure chosen was the flat slab model, and test number 47 and 50 was replicated (Sheppard, 2009). For this specific test, a train of waves with a period of 1.5 to 2 seconds, wave length of (3.04m, 9.97ft), and wave height of (228mm, 0.75ft) was created in the wave tank basin. Other parameters used in study were the still water depth of (533mm, 1.75ft) and the structure clearance was (52mm, 0.17ft). The exact bridge was replicated in DYTRAN simulations. The same 1:8 scale model was made with 492 Lagragian shell elements made of an elasto-plastic polypropylene material (DMATEP) for the slab model. However, the structure was constructed rigidly by defining a relatively thick shell, as performed in the CFD wind models. The wave tank basin was constructed with over 77,000 Eulerian Quadrilateral Solid Elements (CHEXA). Figure 18 shows both the Eulerian and Lagragian Mesh of the CFD model used for wave tank verification. In Dytran, all of the geometric quantities were modeled exactly and the wave was not created but rather initialized with the corresponding parameters discussed above. Therefore the only assumption required in the program was the velocity at which the water is translating forward. No information is provided about this from the report and therefore a reasonable assumption of (0.5-1 m/s, 1.64-3.28 fps) was assumed for the numerical models based on the wave period and estimated wave width. Additionally the load rise time t r was observed for each event which is a determining parameter for classification of the loading as quasi-static or slamming."}, {"section_title": "Prototype Structures and Location", "text": "Performance based engineering is typically performed for a specific structure in a specified location. In this study the region of interest will be the Tampa Bay/Sarasota area. This area of the State of Florida is host to numerous coastal structures, including the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, MacDill Air Force Base, and numerous shoreline hotel structures that are typically 8-15 stories tall. Tampa Bay, has been spared from a major hurricane since 1921 in which a 100+ mph Hurricane made landfall at Tarpon Springs, causing six deaths. However, during that time Tampa Bay had a population of 135,000 and today more than 2.5 million people reside in the area. Additionally the bathymetry of the Tampa Bay Area is very conducive to excessive storm surge, which makes it vulnerable to large hurricanes. All of these factors decrease the expected performance of the empirical design based structures in the region. Therefore, results from structures in this region may substantiate the need for refinement in the current structural engineering field."}, {"section_title": "Building Model", "text": "The prototype building used in this study was obtained from a Reinforced Concrete Design Handbook. The building consists of a three story one way joist and slab system with typical bay spacing of (9.1mX9.1m, 30'X30'). Each story is thirteen feet tall and the total plan dimensions of the structure are (27.5mX45.7m, 90'X150'). The building was designed with no shear walls and uses the beam and column framing as the lateral restraint system. The building was designed in a very high wind prone region, with 145mph as the design wind speed. This design wind speed is slightly higher than the base wind speed in the Tampa-Bay region, according to ASC 7-02 which is approximately (58-60m/s, 135-130 mph). The structure was designed for typical Dead Load (DL) and Live Load (LL) of (6.22kPa, 130psf) and (2.87kPa, 60psf), respectively, that is typically found in an office building or hotel. Using this load data, the structure was designed per American Concrete Institute (ACI) code and all reinforcing steel was sized for the columns and beams. The columns and beams were reinforced with a 5% and 3% steel percentage respectively. The concrete and steel reinforcing grades chosen were (27MPa, 4000psi) and (420MPa, 60,000psi) respectively due to their common use in the design industry.   (Mara & King, 2008) The wind tunnel testing carried out at the BLWT facility was conducted on two different bridge deck geometries. These bridge deck cross sections can be seen in Figure 21. For this study the smaller cross section was chosen, with 6 girders for modeling and analysis. Measurements from the BLWT from a hotwire anemometer provided information on the mean wind speed and turbulence intensity for various elevations for the bridge deck placement. Additionally, smoke flow visualizations were conducted to see the effect of the barrier placement on the wind vortices that developed. These results will be used a validation tool for the CFD models implemented in this study.  (Mara & King, 2008) Since the full design of the bridge has yet to be determined, a typical Florida Pre-stressed T-78\u2016 bulb beam was chosen for the main girders of the bridge deck. A Florida T-78\u2016 Beam was chosen due to its large span applicability (typically around (36.5m, 120ft)) and predominant use in Florida bridges. Additionally, the new bridge deck height has yet to be determined and therefore the existing deck height will be used for this analysis. To simplify the structure for use in the wind tunnel and wave tank for software reasons, the depth change between the slab and girder was not modeled and the flanges of the beams were connected continuously, to create a smooth undersurface to the deck. The bridge model was created out of 242 Shell elements and was comprised of over 8938 quadrilateral elements (CQUAD). The properties of the shells were defined from standard concrete values used in design. The model was constructed rigidly by defining the thickness of the shells to be large, in comparison to the dimensions. A picture of the bridge model is shown in Figure 22. Once a specific locations and structure of interest has been determined, the first step in hazard analysis in a Performance Based Design is to statistically define the magnitude and probability of occurrence of these hazards occurring both individually and simultaneously. Probability Distribution Analysis is a vital step in applying PBE. Since the performance of the structure is related the hazards associated with it, then full probabilistic quantities are required to map structural response/damage to category of hurricane. This step in PBHE is currently quite well understood and can be thoroughly explained in Simiu and Phan et al. (2007). However the existence of structure specific dynamic data from hurricane hazards is currently non-existent. Statistical information from the Tampa Bay region was collected from annual records and computer simulations through NOAA and NIST. The statistical data was not collected from actual hurricane conditions, and would only be used for identifying statistical quantities, such as the return period for damage assessment. Each hazard was then described by an appropriate probability distribution function for the given location. Once each hazard's marginal distribution has been defined, a joint probability distribution can be determined with additional knowledge of the correlation between the hazards. These results will then be combined with the dynamic time history data generated to allow for scaling of the record to any particular event."}, {"section_title": "Prototype Dynamic Time History Generation", "text": "Once the accuracy of CFD modeling were confirmed through the verification studies the generation of Dynamic Wind and Wave time history data was the main subject of this study.

A 10m corrected 3-second annual extreme wind gust was reported. This data was collected for insight into the historical wind records available. Next, dynamic data was created using CFD wind tunnel simulations of the building and bridge under consideration. Both structures were placed in the Dytran Fluid Solver to develop time history records of wind pressure on various sections of the models as shown in Figure 23 and Figure 24. From each time history record, the forces/pressures can be converted to pressure coefficient as typically done in wind tunnel testing. From this non-dimensional coefficient, a time history of pressure can be obtained for each storm category by scaling the pressures by the appropriate expected mean wind speed.  "}, {"section_title": "Surge Height", "text": "For the present study, SLOSH generated storm surge data was utilized for analysis. The Tampa Bay basin was used and the corresponding SLOSH grid for the basin is shown in Figure   25. The SLOSH program employs a telescoping polar grid coordinate system within each coastal basin. As a result, good resolution data is provided for areas of interest along the coast and inlet bays, while conserving computer resources.  Time dependent surge heights were generated not in this study and rather it is suggested that it should be treated as a static load. Storm surge is typically relatively constant for the study location, and the only fluctuation in the height is due to the astronomic tidal heights. Therefore the expected storm surge can be drastically different if the storm is expected to make landfall during high, low or normal tide conditions. Therefore, taking a look at the astronomic tidal variation in the Tampa Bay region was conducted using SLOSH and shown in Figure 26. As you can see from the Figure, the fluctuation in tidal height is relatively constant over a 1-2 hour window, which is the expected extreme loading duration of the hurricane event for a structure. The change in astronomic tides is very small and typically around (30-60mm, 0.1-0.2ft) during this window. "}, {"section_title": "Wave Simulations", "text": "Similar to the extreme wind speed hazard, both annual extreme wave data was collected and numerical modeling of wave loads was conducted. First significant wave heights were collected from NOAA buoy number 42099 located in the St. Petersburg area as shown in Figure   27 for a three year period. The significant wave height is calculated by averaging the top 1/3 of the entire wave heights recorded during a 20 minute interval. The wave height intensity data was appropriately described by the log-normal distribution. Next, dynamic data was created using CFD wave tank simulations of the building and bridge. A single wave height and period was modeled and measured forces were converted into a non-dimensional force coefficient. This was performed by scaling the load by the water density (\u03c1 w ), acceleration of gravity (g), significant wave height (Hs), and tributary area (A). Then estimates of the anticipated wave forces for each category of hurricane dynamic wave forces can be developed for each model by scaling the appropriate non-dimensional force coefficient. However, the full dimensions of the building were not modeled in a wave tank but, rather a square shape representing the column will be modeled This approach was taken due to the high likelihood of building envelope failure and loss of the curtain wall for the first story with the presence of wave action. Therefore, only the primary structural members, such as the columns, would be subjected to wave forces for the first story. This assumption was also used for all of the wind loading calculations for the building."}, {"section_title": "Finite Element Structural Models", "text": "Once Dynamic Loads were generated for both prototype structures, a detailed FEM was created for linear structural analysis. To simplify the structural analysis process due to time constraints, a 2-D model of a frame was constructed of the three story building and a single span of the Anna Marie Island replacement bridge was modeled. Each model was created in SAP to full scale, utilizing frame and shell elements. A short description of each model is given below followed by a figure of each model. The 2-D building model was constructed entirely of frame elements, which were given their respective cross section dimensions and reinforcement properties previously determined from ASCE 7-05 wind design procedures. Fixed support conditions were enforced along the base of the structure. Wind Loads were applied at floor locations where the building's facade or curtain wall would be attached to the main structural framing. Wave loads were applied at each node, from the base of the columns of the structure to their respective wave crest plus surge height. The Bridge Deck model was constructed of both frame and shell elements. Frame sections were modeled for each girder and were given AASHTO Beam Type VI properties (72\u2016). A (250mm, 10\u2016) reinforced concrete deck shell was then modeled (0.9m, 36\u2016) above the frame elements which were then rigidly linked together. The (30.5m, 10ft) long by (18.3m, 60 ft) wide bridge deck was coarsely meshed into (0.3m, 1 ft) lengths to enable easy application of nodal time histories. Pin support boundary conditions were enforced on the ends of the each frame element end where each span would rests on the pier caps. Additionally, the crash barrier was not modeled in the structural model, but its tributary was taken into account when applying the loads. Wind loads were placed on the structure on several nodes and wave loads were applied to the barrier and the bottom of the bridge deck. 110 130 150mph] and significant wave heights from [0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.8m, 2 3 4 5 6ft] were used for structural evaluation. The resulting storm surge from each storm category was then determined from SLOSH. Each hazard was applied to the structure in separate and combined cases to see their individual and collective effects. Structural demand parameters such internal bending moment and shear were plotted against the two dynamic hazards in this study."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Wind Tunnel Verification", "text": "A comparison of the four faces of the model is shown below in Table 1. Results are shown for both wind attack angles of 45 and 15 degrees from the longitudinal axis of the building. The Dytran signal and wind tunnel mean pressure coefficients agree well. All five faces of the structure have mean pressure coefficients in agreement on the order of 5%. This result agrees with other researchers such as Dagnew et al. (2009) and Holmes et al. (2001) in, that accurate static mean pressures can be achieved through numerical wind tunnel modeling techniques. However, a more scientifically precise description of the loading is required for PBE and therefore dynamic characteristics of the signal are vital. The frequency content of the signal was investigated next using the PSD. An example of a comparison of the PSD of the various methods described is shown in Figure 31, for the windward wall. PSD comparisons for all five locations are included in the Appendix. From the PSD comparisons, a very good agreement is seen between the wind tunnel and Dytran simulation. No difference is seen in the magnitude of the power of each signal, but a small horizontal shift is seen in the frequency axis occurs due to normalization of the PSD. If no normalization is used on the horizontal axis, these two curves align. Additionally, the established wind spectrum equations approximated the two methods accurately. Some minor differences are seen in the higher frequency range between the predicted spectrum and the two modeling techniques. This pattern was seen in all of the PSD comparisons, which can be found in the Appendix. This result may be attributed to high sampling frequency use for the experiment. A desirable upper limit is 200Hz (Holmes, 2001), which was used for downsampling.     Table 2. The agreement between the two is not as accurate as the previous parameters compared. This deviation give rise to the horizontal scale shift of the PSD plots discussed earlier. One reason for this discrepancy may be due to the fact that the longitudinal turbulence fluctuation is based on the frictional velocity (u*), which is further derived from the surface roughness of the wind record. The surface roughness is not a definitive quantity and was merely estimated from dimensions of roughness elements, using a primitive method that has been updated very little in the last 30 years. Additionally, the surface roughness in the wind tunnel models could not be replicated in the numerical simulations, due to the tremendous computational demands it would require. The values of the turbulence intensity for the two different models, as well as the predicted intensity given in Equation 5, are shown in Table 3. The comparison shows that Dytran is consistently measuring lower turbulence intensity values than the wind tunnel models. This finding suggests that fluctuating pressures are not being accurately captured in the Dytran simulation. A source of the discrepancy may be due to the fact that no randomness of the velocity profile is input into Dytran, and only a constant velocity profile is allowed. Therefore the lack of turbulence is attributed to the limited number of roughness elements use to develop vortices. Also, the turbulence intensity predicted by Equation 8 is appreciably different than both sets of collected data. Equation 8 was based on measurements produced by large scale depression systems (Holmes, 2001). Therefore it is not entirely applicable for BLWT modeling conditions. Next, comparisons of the SDOF oscillator are shown in Figure 33 (Holmes, 2001). Therefore, from these results the Eulerian mesh was inspected to give hints as to why the Dytran results reach such a steady state. Therefore, it is believed that these vortices that are created in the experimental wind tunnel are created due to the non-ideal creation of the wind flow. Typically, wind tunnels are constructed with a series of large fans or blower systems that create the flow striking the structure over a long roughness surface. The roughness elements used in the numerical simulation were limited and the true wind tunnel testing has a series of over 25-30 rows of these elements. These additional elements may help create the additional vortices that are lacking in the numerical simulations. However, the addition of more roughness elements is not feasible in this study due to the increased simulation runtime. To combat this issue, the idea of random pulse generation (RPG) was investigated. Random pulse generation is typically performed in seismic research to create synthetic time dependent ground motion and has been shown to be a very versatile tool for simulating a large class of physical phenomena (Lin and Cai, 1995). The signal is considered to be composed of a series of pulse trains, which are a repetitive series of random magnitude pulses (Y j ) that are separated in time by a random arrival time (\u03c4j). If a linear assumption is valid for the combination of the pulses and each random pulse magnitude (Y j ) is independent of the arrival time, then a series of (N) pulses can be combined to obtain the signals evolutionary spectral representation (X). This result allows for synthetic generation of a random seismic signal in the frequency domain from a series of single pulses as shown in Equation 9. Where w(t-\u03c4) is a deterministic pulse shape function satisfying the condition w(t,\u03c4)=0 for t>\u03c4 (Lin and Cai, 1995). However, the Navier Stokes equations are a set of non-linear second order differential equations and therefore the direction superposition of signals arriving at each timeframe will not recreate a signal with 100% accuracy. However, it will allow for turbulence to be introduced into the signals. Therefore, it was conceivable that the combination of several simulations of the same structure under different obstacle placements would allow random pulse generation to be applied to the signals. Numerous simulations would be required to produce enough data to generate a full 10 second record. To accomplish this, ten computers were simultaneously programmed to run various placements of barriers on the barn structure. Random pulse generation was then applied to the various data sets to create a suitable final signal. For random pulse generation, the most important quantity needed for a synthetic signal generation is the time/source relationship. Through this relationship, the time/delay between successive arrivals of signals is used to create the final signal. For this study, the time/delay of the arrival of wind vortices was calculated from the speed of the wind and the upwind distance. This time was found to be about 0.25 seconds and corresponds to approximately 50-100 samples depending, on the velocity of the wind. Additionally, due to the fact that the measured pressures oscillate about a mean instead of zero, the mean value of the entire signal was subtracted when two signals were added together. Using this idea, a synthetic signal was constructed with a varying arrival rate of successive signals. Comparisons were then recomputed for the mean pressure coefficient, autocorrelation and PSD to ensure that the signal was not significantly altered using this technique and only the turbulence component is affected. All of these results are shown in the Appendix with the subtitle RPG. The dynamic response does not reach a steady state and the numerical values are very comparable to the wind tunnel response for the entire length of the record. The frequency content of the displacement response was compared with a FFT based PSD.  Figure 35 shows that the RPG addition to the Dytran signal shifted the shape of the PSD plot in line with the wind tunnel response. The original raw dytran signal had a significant amount of higher frequency response. From these results, it was concluded that the CFD technique could be combined with RPG to create a suitable dynamic signal without adverse affects on the frequency content of the signal as shown in the PSD plots. In all three signals a distinct peak is seen around 0.2Hz which is less than the natural frequency of the barn of 5Hz."}, {"section_title": "Wave Tank Verification", "text": "To ensure that the wave loading phenomenon is accurately captured, both the time and frequency domain content were examined. First, the signal was passed through a Chebyshev low-pass filter which was used to remove the excessive high frequency content obtained in the raw signal. Chebyshev Filters have a steep roll-off but, have more passband ripples than Butterworth filters (Daniels, 1974). A cutoff frequency of 25Hz was used as to not induce excessive extension of the loading time history. Once completed, the maximum and minimum loads recorded from the experiment and numerical simulations were compared for both the horizontal and vertical directions. A typical comparison of the two methods is shown in Figure   36 and Figure 37. Dytran captures additional high frequency slamming forces that are associated with waves. The quasi-static varying load is also not as apparent in the numerical simulations, but is quite similar to slamming force shown in the experimental study. The recorded peak load is approximately (325N, 73lbf). This value is quite comparable to the records from Sheppard, in which a maximum slamming force of (333N, 75lbf) was recorded for Test #50 (Sheppard, 2009). This was also representative of the horizontal load comparison as a (8N, 0.48lbf) difference (approximately 10%) was measured. A summary of the vertical and horizontal load comparisons can be found in Table 4. The variation was not of a great concern, due to the large deviations in both magnitude and shape of wave time histories reported for similar test conditions by numerous laboratory basin studies (Cuomo, 2007). Once the maximum and minimum peak loads were compared, each force time history was converted into a non-dimensional time history. Each time history was normalized by the density of water, acceleration of gravity, tributary area, and significant wave height. This process will enable the recreation of simulated peak pressures for any wave height, and further comparison against other researchers such as Cuomo et al. 2007. These plots are shown in the appendix under Bridge Wave tank verification. For the two test simulations, the vertical peak pressure was found to follow the empirical relationship given in Equation 10. This result is quite comparable to other peak vertical forces in which the range of (1.8-7.6) is given. However, more simulations are required to give a definite empirical relationship. For the frequency domain comparison the power spectral density computed using two methods is compared, as shown in Figure 38 and Figure 39, the numerical simulation shows a much higher frequency loading distribution than the wave basin studies. This high frequency loading is not typically found in natural wave phenomena, as shown from a PSD plot from the wave buoy data collected (Figure 40). Wave buoy data doesn't suggest any wave frequencies above the 0.5 Hz range. However, this data was not collected from impact studies, and is a measure of the natural wave cyclic frequency. Figure 36: Vertical Time History from Flat Slab Structure Test (Sheppard, 2009) Figure 37: Vertical Time History From Dytran Simulation Figure 38: PSD Plot From Wave Basin Study on Vertical Load Cell (Sheppard, 2009) . After a thorough examination of these verification studies, it was concluded that an accurate quantification of the wind and wave hazard can be performed with CFD numerical simulations. Although slight differences are seen in the time and frequency content of the signal provided by the numerical approach, the margin of error of 5-10% is considered acceptable. The CFD simulation approach is then extended to study the hurricane hazards for two structural systems typically found in the State of Florida."}, {"section_title": "Probability Distribution Analysis", "text": "Probability Distribution Analysis was carried out for all of the hazards included in this study. First, an appropriate distribution fit to a measure describing the intensity of each hazard and then joint probability analysis was carried out. The correlation between the various hazards was assumed in this study and the Nataf method for joining correlated multivariate distributions was utilized, as described in Der Kiureghian et al. (1986). For the extreme wind speed records gathered the Gumbel/Type I Largest Distribution was found to fit the data accurately. Gumbel (1954) introduced the methodology for fitting recorded annual maxmima events, which has been typically applied to flood prediction and extreme wind speeds (Holmes, 2001). The parameters of the distribution, along with a plot of the fit is shown in Figure 41  Once the data was extracted, the generalized extreme value distribution accurately fit the Tampa Bay surge data, as shown in Figure 43. However, this approximate distribution is only valid for the specific location of the structures, as surge heights in the the next grid basin may be drastically different. Significant wave heights in the Tampa Bay region were accurately described by the lognormal distribution, as shown in Figure 44. However, this data was collected from an offshore buoy and the expected wave height that may reach the inland structures, such as the building under consideration, is significantly reduced. According to Wu et al. (2006) due to wave decay once reaching shore, the typical wave height that reaches an inland structure is only 10-20%.  [2007][2008][2009] Once each hazard has described by an appropriate density function, a joint probability analysis was carried out. For this analysis, the correlation coefficient between wind and wave hazards and wind and storm surge was assumed to be 0.5. This is a relatively strong correlation between the hazards, as one would expect that the influence of wind has a drastic effect on storm surge and waves generated in a hurricane. The results of the joint density distributions are shown in Figure 45. Dynamic wind loads were generated for both prototype structures considered in this study. Therefore, no experimental or full scale pressure coefficients were available for comparison. The sampling frequency and the input velocity were the only parameters changed from verification models. Each parameter was set as 200Hz. and (12m/s, 39fps), respectively. Only one angle of attack was used to create the time history data, due to high computational demands of each simulation. The data was then assembled through RPG into a suitable 25 second signal which was then analyzed in both the time and frequency domain. Nodal time histories were converted into a non-dimensional pressure coefficient for application to each FEM. An example result is shown in Figure 46 and Figure 47 for the second floor windward wall of the building model. Results correlated well with previous verification studies as the pressure coefficient varies around 0.50. The wind PSD plot aligns with the established design code spectrum and only a slight shift is seen in the frequency domain due to the normalizing terms. These findings were typical for all locations recorded for the building and several more results are provided in the Appendix. Dynamic wave loads were also generated for both the bridge and building in this study. Scaled models were placed in the numerical wave tank, and a particular wave height and period impacted each structure. Horizontal and vertical forces were then sampled at 200Hz and passed through the Chebyshev Type I lowpass filter. Similar to the wind loads, a non-dimensional force coefficient was created and sample results are shown in the appendix. Additionally the wave time histories were visually inspected for the number of the slamming pulses. Various studies such as Sheppard et al. (2009) indicate that the number of slamming pulses is directly related to the number of air chambers. Figure 48 and Figure 49 show that Dytran is accurately reproducing 5 distinct slamming pulses for the six girder bridge.   (Sheppard, 2009) Dimensional Scaling Before application of the dynamic loads to each FEM, scaling effects due to Froude and Reynolds number modeling were considered for the wave and wind hazards respectively. Due to prototype and model scaling ratios both the time and magnitude of the loading signal must be performed. For wind tunnel modeling a total of sixteen dimensional quantities such as the mean wind speed (u), roughness length (z o ), and density of air (\u03c1 a ) must can be described in thirteen dimensionless quantities such as the Jensen number and Reynolds number (Holmes, 2001). For accurate modeling of the wind effects between model and prototype structures these dimensionless quantities should be equivalent. Due to these effects, results from the wind tunnel must be modified in the frequency domain due to the reduced frequencies at model scale and at prototype scale as shown in Equation 11 (Main and Fritz, 2006). Where the model-scale frequency (f m ), model wind speed (V m ) and length scale (\u03bb L ) are fixed due to wind tunnel modeling conditions, and the prototype sampling frequency (f p ) is proportional to the desired prototype wind speed (V p ). Historically the Froude number has been used exclusively for scaling ratio used for offshore structures and ship testing (Cuomo, 2010). Therefore using this similitude law scaling factors for the measured pressures and forces are shown in Table 5. However from a comparison of laboratory and full scale pressures by Allsop et al. (1996) suggested that Froude scaling overestimates measured wave loads by 92-99%. Froude scaling laws don't consider the air effects that have been shown to influence the magnitude and duration of impulsive loads. Therefore Bagnold et al. (1939) suggested modeling the compression of air by water against a vertical surface, with a water hammer compressing air in a piston (Cuomo, 2010). Building on this idea, Takahasi et al. (1985) presented a method for scaling vertical pressures based on a parameter known as the Bagnold number. Both the model and prototype Bagnold number is computed and then using Figure 50, the appropriate scaling factor can be evaluated. Therefore for this study Bagnold scaling will be used to scale the vertical pressures obtained from simulations.  (Cuomo, 2010) Dynamic Analysis Using the loading cases described before response spectrum curves were created for both prototype structures. Before response curves were generated for each structure, the necessity to collect and conduct dynamic structural analysis was performed. Using the wind tunnel generated dynamic time history data the frequency was scaled and corrected according to the reduced sampling frequencies at model scale. This data was then transformed into the frequency domain to obtain the dominant forcing function frequency. This value was found to be approximately 0.5Hz. Then the reduced sampling frequency was reduced further to obtain dominant wind frequencies of 0.1Hz, 0.08Hz and 0.03Hz. All of these forcing functions were then applied at the same wind speed to the building model and third floor response was recorded. These plots were then simultaneously plotted in Figure 51. From the figure a clear dynamic amplification factor can be seen. The response is approximately 1.6 times the lowest dominant wind frequency which is approximately static. This result confirmed the need to consider the dynamic effects of the hurricane hazards Next, response curves for the building and bridge were created for all loading cases considered. Results for the building can be found in Figure 52 and Figure 53 and results for the bridge can be found in Figure 54 and Figure 55. From the building plots one can see the threat the wind and wave hazard have on structure. Here both the wind and wave pose and equally threatening risk on the structure. Figure 52 shows the drift index of the building is near exceeding acceptable design levels from the wind and wave hazard alone and is far exceeded if the all hazards are combined. This result is also confirmed with Figure 53 as the first floor column has reached its ultimate moment capacity and is near failure without considering dead or live load effects. The bridge response curves show hurricane induced response is dominated by the wave hazard. This result was expected due to the reduced amount of surface area compared to a typical building. The displacement of the bridge due to the maximum significant wave height"}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER FIVE: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this study, the primary focus was to establish a method for generating time varying dynamic, structure-specific hurricane hazard data, for use in PBE studies. Previous experimental laboratory study data from wind tunnel and wave tank basin facilities were collected. Comparisons were conducted on both the time and frequency content of the signals. Mean pressure coefficients/force coefficients were shown to be in relatively good agreement for wind tunnel testing and wave tank loads. Although some variation is seen between the two results, the error is on the order of 5-10%. Additionally, wind mean pressure coefficients were compared against ASCE 7-05 code and shown to be slightly lower, as expected. The frequency content of the wind and wave numerical simulations was found to be appreciable to their experimental counterparts. The normalized frequency of the wind was predominantly found to 0.1Hz. The wind spectra plots also agree with code generated spectra, such as EuroCode I and Von-Karmen and Harris (Holmes, 2001). On the other hand, the wave loading frequency content suggests that Dytran is only capturing the impact loading, as much higher frequency content in the 10-20Hz. is obtained when compared to experimental and historical records of waves. This issue is not very detrimental as the quasi-static wave load is quite well understood, and is simply related to the wave height, period and structure properties. Thus, this loading function could be added to the slamming force obtained from Dytran. These results demonstrate that CFD is a viable alternative to laboratory testing with much more simulation capability to reproduce experiments with multiple structures, locations, and configurations. This finding was extended into two typical structural systems found in Florida. Linear FEM models results for the individual and combined effects were constructed into response curves. These curves showed the most dominant hurricane hazard for each structural system. The building model is controlled by both the wind and wave hazard while the bridge is dominated by the wave hazard. The building model is pushed to the limits of its design as the wind and wave hazard approach a category 5 storm. The drift index for the top floor is exceeding the design limit for the wind hazard alone at 0.005 and up to 0.01 for all three hazards combined. The moment capacity of the first floor is nearly met at (339kN-m, 250ft-kips) when all three hazards are combined. The bridge model recorded a maximum displacement of over (450mm, 18in) and midspan moment of (13500kN-m, 10000kip-ft) for a six foot significant wave height. This finding suggests that the capacity of the girders have been reached without considering the significant horizontal reaction force. Significant horizontal forces would be subjected to any lateral restraint system. Therefore the response curves demonstrate the poor performance of the prototype structures designed through a deterministic approach and need to consider all hurricane hazards for structures located in coastal areas. In this study, a major issue in implementing CFD modeling for producing dynamic wind loads was experienced. Holmes et al. (2001) stated that fluctuating and peak pressures cannot be accurately reproduced using CFD techniques at this time. This statement was confirmed by the steady state solutions that were produced for the wind loading spectrum. The lack of evolving vortices in the flow over time causes this phenomenon to occur, as shown in numerous simulations. The lack of pressure fluctuation is primarily attributed to the over simplification of the turbulence in the discretization and solution of fluid flow equations (Holmes, 2001). Therefore, RPG was utilized to introduce additional vortices in the flow, which may prove to be useful in further applications. Once RPG was combined with the Dytran simulations, a suitable dynamic signal could be created for further structural analysis Upon verification of the program, the numerical modeling method was extended into two typical Florida structures. The Tampa Bay region was selected for this study and a prototype bridge and building were selected for detailed hurricane hazard identification. These structures were then modeled in numerical wind and wave simulations. Before generating dynamic time history data, historical annual extreme records of the wind, wave and storm simulations were collected for joint probability analysis. This information was used to identify the most likely combinations of wind, surge and wave heights anticipated for specific return periods. Additionally, this data would be coupled with the dynamic time history data, as pressures/forces could be scaled to any specific combination and applied to a structural model. Time history data produced from the two prototype structures displayed similar results to the verification studies. Slamming forces were mainly recorded from the wave tank simulations, and a steady state wind tunnel signal was generated. These results show that CFD modeling can be accurately applied to civil engineering structures for characterization of the wind and wave loading. This finding is a very important step in PBHE, as structure specific hurricane hazards can be generated without the high cost of experimental laboratory setup, equipment and personnel. This ability may help in the widespread application of PBE in the structural engineering design field. Additionally RPG generation was applied to CFD results to introduce turbulence due to the lack of an accurate sub-grid model. This finding may suggest an alternative method to introducing turbulence into CFD simulation."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER SIX: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES", "text": "In this study, the field of CFD was applied to two specific hurricane hazards, namely wind and waves. To verify this technique, a comparison was made with laboratory wind tunnel data. Only typical gabled structured buildings have been tested and compared against full-scale measurements. Therefore, to fully verify this technique requires comparisons to be made with full-scale real life wind measurements using different geometric configurations. This data is currently unavailable but, a new study known as FCMP is employing numerous wind measurement techniques to obtain full scale hurricane data . In the meantime, verification of Dytran with wind tunnel tests of a standard tall building model is required. Only low-rise structures and short span bridges were considered in this study, and it is suggested that the CAARC building model be investigated using Dytran. This building is suggested due to its widespread use in wind industry, which will allow results to be compared against other researchers such as Dagnew et al. (2009). In this study, several computational costs prevented the development of a fully accurate reproduction of a BLWT and Wave tank basin. Computational hardware was limited to individual computers with 2-4 Core Processors and limited RAM capability. This drawback prevented a true recreation of the BLWT, as its length and size would require element numbers on the order of 10 8 and thousands of surface roughness elements. This ability can only be accomplished with a cluster of CPU's and improved computer hardware, which is recommended for future studies. The lack of pressure fluctuation is primarily attributed to the over simplification of the turbulence in the discretization and solution of fluid flow equations (Holmes, 2001). Sub-grid models such as the k-\u03b5 model are introduced to capture the turbulent flow. These models have shown to be not stable enough and capable of capturing these effects. Therefore research into more accurate sub-grid models is a major concern and goal for CFD development. Also included in this study was extension of the CFD method to typical prototype bridges and buildings. Structure-specific hazard data were generated from Dytran for use in later structural analysis. Only linear time history analysis was performed on the two prototype structures. However, this data should be applied to a detailed FEM of each structure and nonlinear dynamic analysis be performed. Once completed the structural response quantities such as displacement, stress, and moment can be mapped to damage costs and quantities. These costs can then be statistically defined to allow for the overall performance of the structure to be assessed. These results shall show the possibility of CFD in PBHE and standards of care to improving the overall performance of our coastal infrastructure."}, {"section_title": "Explanation of Verification Plots", "text": "Pressure  "}]
