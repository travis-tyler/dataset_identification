[{"section_title": "", "text": "Biomedical innovation is complex, expensive, and risky, and emerging science and technology have created tantalizingly high expectations. Converting innovation into health value in a timely, cost-ef ective, and sustainable manner requires a capacity for collaboration across disciplines, organizations, and nations. As we move forward with plans for major new multistakeholder initiatives, these alliances need to be evaluated with-and informed by-the same degree of rigor as other critical enablers of translational science, creating a timely opportunity for the advent of a new discipline focused on the science of collaboration."}, {"section_title": "CONSORTIUM FANFARE AND FATIGUE", "text": "In the past decade, diverse stakeholders have launched numerous collaborations in the global pharmaceutical industry in an attempt to address challenges to biomedical innovation. Since its inception in 2008, the largest multistakeholder ef ort-the European Union's Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI; www.imi.europa.eu)-has established more than 40 consortia with f nancial and in-kind investments totaling \u20ac2 billion; IMI is now contemplating new collaborations and substantial scaling of investments to nearly \u20ac3.5 billion through the proposed Horizon 2020 innovation framework. Aligned with global trends, the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) recommended formation of a U.S. counterpart to IMI (www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/ f les/microsites/ostp/pcast-fda-f nal.pdf). T e prevalence of multistakeholder initiatives ref ects a continued optimism about the value of this collaboration approach for addressing biomedical innovation bottlenecks.\nAt the same time, concerns have arisen about how well these collaborations have been executed. Stakeholders suf ering from \"consortium fatigue\" express frustration with the perceived redundancy, lack of productiv-ity, and sense of chaos in the evolution of the collaboration landscape. Contributing to this frustration is the lack of an accurate and shared taxonomy, illustrated by the increasingly broad use of the term public-private partnership so that it now lacks utility for identifying a coherent collaboration subtype.\nT ere is a growing desire to channel resources toward a smaller number of strategically coordinated initiatives that address critical translational gaps in ways that increase the likelihood of achieving and quantifying success. For example, 10 major pharmaceutical companies launched TransCelerate BioPharma in 2012 in order to align their decision-making, monetary resources, and in-kind support of collaborative initiatives, f rst by developing clinical-trials standards and best practices (http://transceleratebiopharmainc.com). Despite the recent collaboration proliferation, little research has been conducted to assess the ef ectiveness of these alliances or to identify successful characteristics that can be applied to future ones (1) . Given that stakeholders are now considering whether to make substantial additional investments in existing and new initiatives, it is time to f gure out what works and what doesn't. We need an evidence-based approach-a science of collaboration-to evaluate and inform the evolving multistakeholder collaboration environment in biomedical innovation. Our approach to learning and continuous improvement should parallel the rigorous scientif c methodologies that are applied in biomedical research."}, {"section_title": "BIOMEDICAL BEDFELLOWS", "text": "One of the f rst and most compelling cases for multistakeholder collaboration unfolded in the human immunodef ciency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodef ciency syndrome (AIDS) f eld of research in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s (http:// aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/aidstimeline) (2) and stands out as an object lesson in the power of aligning patient advocates, regulators, and drug-makers to speed drug development and access to urgently needed treatments. Building on this initial success story of a reactive collaborative response to a global crisis, new initiatives prospectively designed for multistakeholder collaboration began to proliferate in the late 1990s. T e f rst ones focused mainly on therapeutic development for diseases of the developing world, such as the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (formed in 1996), the Malaria Vaccines Initiative (MMV; 1999), and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDI; 2003). T e focus of collaborations was later broadened to address other types of innovation challenges, beginning with the sharing of proprietary data at the earliest stages of development, which was perceived as lower risk in terms of potential intellectual-property conf icts. Examples include the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (www.adni-info.org) and the Biomarkers Consortium ( Table 1) , both of which focused on the development and validation of biomarkers for use across the global industry. More recently, multistakeholder collaborations are reaching beyond the early stages of the innovation life cycle to include laterstage challenges in product development, manufacturing, regulation, reimbursement, and postmarket use and monitoring for safety, ef cacy, and ef ectiveness."}, {"section_title": "EXPLORING THE COLLABORATION LANDSCAPE", "text": "Although there is currently no central repository for tracking collaborative initiatives globally, in Table 1 we list examples that illustrate the broad range of focus areas across the innovation value chain. T e modern trend to establish collaborations that target a broad range of innovation challenges is driven by a recognition that the growing complexity of science and the scale of associated data analysis and knowledge management can no longer ef ectively be addressed by a single organization or market sector. Collaboration is essential for reducing the cost and risk of innovation as well as enhancing its value for patients and society. Although the need for collaboration is no longer in question, it is worth noting the importance of this development. A willingness to share proprietary data among industry competitors represents a dramatic shif in the culture of the historically highly competitive pharmaceutical industry.\nHowever, multistakeholder consortia operate collectively as a cottage industry rather than as coordinated components of a strategy FOCUS appropriate for a global industry facing concerns about its sustainability (3) . Leaders in collaborative innovation recognize the need to evolve from the current chaotic state to one of order and insight. TransCelerate and IMI represent early attempts to address this need through strategic and f nancial alignment among industry participants. In addition, several research groups have undertaken descriptive studies of the diverse types of collaborations in the biomedical innovation ecosystem (4, 5), whereas others are considering how to address the pressing need for a way to track global initiatives. Such ef orts are important f rst steps in charting this vast and dynamic landscape, but we also must mind insights from our experiences in order to continuously improve how we design, manage, and evaluate collaborations. A science of collaboration can provide a shared taxonomy, a conceptual framework, and tools to build a knowledge base that informs strategies and tactics for funding, design, management, monitoring, and coordination of new initiatives. Research and education in the f eld should focus not only on success-enablers tied directly to the design and operational el-ements of consortia but also on those associated with other areas with more indirect but important impact on outcomes. Examples of these areas include collaboration strategy and implementation at the level of the macroindustry, participating organizations, and even human-capital management involving individual participants."}, {"section_title": "BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Curing Consortium Fatigue", "text": "Although there may be a strong temptation to try to extrapolate from our experiences to date in order to rapidly advance to normative guidance such as best-practice models, this approach would likely constrain evolution of the collaboration model. Rather, the task of the f rst wave of researchers is to ef ectively characterize the vast array of differentiating elements of past and existing initiatives in order to def ne our initial palette of design levers for future application. Understanding how and when various models of funding, intellectual property management, and leadership, for example, have proven useful can provide exemplars to inform how we design new collaborations to address emerging innovation challenges, or how we marry the ef orts of existing synergistic initiatives for greater ef ciency and global impact. A critical area for development is to enhance our ability to def ne qualitative and quantitative success metrics that are meaningful to all participating stakeholders. Last, the knowledge base we develop should be scalable so as to foster continuous learning and improvement, setting an expectation that emerging innovation challenges are likely to require an evolution in our practices over time.\nFortunately, there are rich sources of knowledge and experience that can help to inform the evolution of this f eld. Management and social sciences and systems engineering both within and outside of the health care and biomedicine sectors of er useful perspectives for strategic planning and tactical implementation. Ideas to enrich our thinking may also be drawn from a wide range of domains, such as distributed innovation (6) and leadership models, complex adaptive systems (7) , network mapping (8), collective intelligence (9) , and even network-centric warfare, among others ( Table 2) .
