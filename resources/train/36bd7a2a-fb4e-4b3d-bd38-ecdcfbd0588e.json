[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report presents findings on crime and violence in U.S. public schools, 1 using data from the 2007-08 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS:2008). First administered in school year 1999-2000 and repeated in school years 2003-04, 2005-06, and 2007-08, SSOCS provides information about school crime-related topics from the perspective of schools. Developed and managed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences and supported by the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S. Department of Education, SSOCS asks public school principals about the frequency of incidents, such as physical attacks, robberies, and thefts, in their schools. Portions of this survey also focus on school programs, disciplinary actions, and the policies implemented to prevent and reduce crime in schools. SSOCS:2008 is based on a nationally representative stratified random sample of 3,484 U.S. public schools. Data collection began on February 25, 2008, when questionnaires were mailed to principals, and continued through June 18, 2008. A total of 2,560 public primary, middle, high, and combined schools provided usable questionnaires, yielding an unweighted response rate of approximately 75 percent. When the responding schools were weighted to account for their original sampling probabilities, the response rate increased to approximately 77 percent. A nonresponse bias analysis was performed because the weighted response rate was less than 85 percent, and the results indicate that nonresponse bias is not an issue for SSOCS:2008. For more information about the methodology and design of SSOCS, including how response rates were calculated and the details of the nonresponse bias analysis, please see Appendix B: Methodology and Technical Notes in this report. Because the purpose of this report is to introduce new NCES data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information, only selected findings are presented below. These findings have been chosen to demonstrate the range of information available when using SSOCS:2008 data rather than to discuss all of the observed differences. The tables in this report contain totals and percentages generated from bivariate crosstabulation procedures. All of the results are weighted to represent the population of U.S. public schools. Comparisons drawn in the bulleted items below have been tested for statistical significance at the .05 level using Student's t statistic to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were not included. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Due to the large sample size, many differences (no matter how substantively minor) are statistically significant; thus, only differences of 5 percentage points or more between groups are mentioned in the findings."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "More information about the SSOCS survey and other SSOCS products can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ssocs.\nWeapon was defined for respondents as \"any instrument or object used with the intent to threaten, injure, or kill.

The initial goal of SSOCS:2008 was to collect data from at least 2,550 schools, taking nonresponse into account. One possible method of allocating schools to the different sampling strata would have been to allocate them proportionally to the U.S. public school population. However, while the majority of U.S. public schools are primary schools, the majority of school violence is reported in middle and high schools. Proportional allocation would, therefore, have yielded an inefficient sample design because the sample composition would have included more primary schools (where crime is an infrequent event) than middle or high schools (where crime is a relatively more frequent event). As a result, a larger proportion of the target sample of 2,550 schools was allocated to middle and high schools. The target sample was allocated to the four instructional levels as follows: 640 primary schools, 895 middle schools, 915 high schools, and 100 combined schools. Schools in the 1999-2000 SSOCS (SSOCS:2000), SSOCS:2004, and SSOCS:2006 were allocated to instructional levels in a similar manner. The same variables and categories used to create strata in SSOCS:2000, SSOCS:2004, and SSOCS:2006 were used to create strata in SSOCS:2008. The population of schools was stratified (grouped) into four instructional levels, 4 four types of locale settings, 5,6 and four enrollment size categories. 7 These variables were chosen because they have been shown to be associated with school crime (Miller 2004). The sample of schools in each instructional level was allocated to each of the 16 cells formed by the cross-classification of the four categories of enrollment size and four types of locale. In order to obtain a reasonable sample size of lower enrollment schools while giving a higher probability of selection to higher enrollment schools, the sample was allocated to each subgroup in proportion to the sum of the square roots of the total student enrollment in each school in that stratum. The effective sample size within each stratum was then inflated to account for nonresponse. Once the final sample sizes were determined for each of the 64 strata, the subgroups were sorted by region 8 and percent minority enrollment, and an initial sample of 3,484 schools was selected. Sorting by these variables before selection has the same effect as stratification with proportional allocation of schools to the strata. For more information on the sample design, see chapter 2 of the School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2007-08 Data File User's Manual (Ruddy et al. forthcoming). 3 Adopting the same basic design for all survey administrations increases the precision of the estimates of change. 4 The four instructional levels are primary, middle, high, and combined. 5 The four types of locales are city, suburb, town, and rural. 6 Starting with the 2007-08 SSOCS, a 12-cateogry urban-centric CCD locale variable was collapsed into the following 4 categories: city, suburb, town, and rural. Prior SSOCS collections used an 8-cateogry CCD variable, which was collapsed into the following 4 categories: city, urban fringe, town, and rural. 7 The four categories of enrollment size are less than 300 students, 300-499 students, 500-999 students, and 1,000 students or more. 8 The four regions are the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West."}, {"section_title": "B-5", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "SSOCS:2008 was conducted as a mail survey with telephone follow-up. Four months before the onset of data collection, NCES began working with the school districts of sampled schools that required prior approval to participate in the survey. On February 19, 2008, school administrators of sampled schools were sent advance letters that included the date of the first questionnaire mailing and a toll-free number to call with any questions. Upon distribution of the advance letters, letters were mailed to chief state school officers and superintendents to inform them that schools within their states and districts, respectively, had been selected for SSOCS:2008. The letters included information about the survey and were accompanied by a promotional SSOCS pen, an informational copy of the questionnaire, and the SSOCS brochure. The letters were not designed to request permission from these officials to participate in the survey, but rather as a vehicle to enhance participation. On February 25-26, 2008, questionnaires were sent via FedEx directly to the principals of the sampled schools, with a cover letter describing the importance of the survey, a promotional SSOCS pen, and a CD-ROM of the Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2008. See appendix D for a copy of the questionnaire. During the two weeks following the first questionnaire mailing, a screener telephone operation was conducted to verify that each sampled school had received the questionnaire and was, in fact, eligible to participate. Two weeks after the screener ended, a reminder telephone operation began, which was conducted in two 1-week phases. The primary objective of the reminder operation was to follow up with the principal or school contact to determine the status of the questionnaire; however, during the second week, the interviewer could complete the SSOCS interview over the phone at the respondent's request. Returned questionnaires were examined for quality and completeness using both manual and computerized edits. If a questionnaire did not meet predetermined levels of completeness, the respondent was contacted again to resolve issues related to the missing data, irrespective of whether the items missing data were considered \"critical.\" 9 The criteria used to determine completeness are detailed in section 3.1 of the School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2007-08 Data File User's Manual (Ruddy et al. forthcoming). Data collection ended on June 18, 2008. If a satisfactory resolution could not be reached, imputation was used to resolve data quality issues for questionnaires in which at least 60 percent of all items, 10 80 percent of critical items, 60 percent of item 16, and 60 percent of item 22 had been completed. Questionnaires that did not meet the imputation criteria were considered incomplete and are excluded from the analyses in this report."}, {"section_title": "B-6", "text": "Weighting Sample weights allow inferences to be made about the population from which the sample units were drawn. Because of the complex nature of the SSOCS:2008 sample design, weights are necessary to obtain population-based estimates, to minimize bias arising from differences between responding and nonresponding schools, and to calibrate the data to known population characteristics in a way that reduces sampling error. The procedures used to create the SSOCS sampling weights are described below. An initial (base) weight was first determined within each stratum by calculating the ratio of the number of schools available in the sampling frame to the number of schools selected. In order to reduce the potential of bias from nonresponse, weighting classes were determined by using a statistical algorithm similar to CHAID (chi-square automatic interaction detector) to partition the sample so that schools within a weighting class were homogenous with respect to the probability of responding. The predictor variables for the analysis were school instructional level, locale, region, enrollment size, percent minority enrollment, student-to-teacher ratio, percentage of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch, and number of full-time-equivalent teachers. When the number of responding schools in a class was small, that weighting class was combined with another class to avoid the possibility of large weights. After combining the necessary classes, the base weights were adjusted to produce nonresponse adjusted weights so that the weighted distribution of the responding schools resembled the initial distribution of the total sample. The nonresponse-adjusted weights were then calibrated to agree with known population counts obtained from the sampling frame to reduce bias in the estimates due to undercoverage. The calibration process, a form of poststratification, separates the sample into a number of classes (poststrata) defined by a cross-classification of variables. The known population counts may be available for the individual cells of the crossclassification or only for certain margins of it. In the latter situation, the calibration proceeds iteratively, one margin at a time, and is often called \"raking.\" Poststratification works well when the noncovered population is similar to the covered population in each poststratum. Thus, to be effective, the variables that define the poststrata must be correlated with the outcome of interest (school crime, in this report). They must also be well measured in the survey, and the control totals must be available for the population as a whole. As in SSOCS:2006, these requirements were satisfied in SSOCS:2008 by the two margins set up for the raking ratio adjustment of the weights: (1) instructional level and school enrollment size; and (2) instructional level and locale. All three variablesinstructional level, school enrollment size, and locale-have been shown to be correlated with school crime (Miller 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Imputation Procedures", "text": "Files containing missing data can be problematic because, depending on how the missing data are treated, analysis of incomplete datasets may cause different users to arrive at different conclusions. Another problem with missing data is that certain groups of respondents may be more likely than others to leave some survey items unanswered, creating bias in the survey estimates. Completed SSOCS:2008 surveys contained some level of item nonresponse after the conclusion of the data collection phase, and imputation procedures were used to create values for all questionnaire items with missing information. The imputation methods utilized in SSOCS:2008 were tailored to the nature of the survey item. Four methods were used: aggregate proportions, best match, logical, and clerical. These methods are described in detail in section 4.4 of the School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2007-08 Data File User's Manual (Ruddy et al. forthcoming)."}, {"section_title": "Unit Response Rates", "text": "A unit response rate is, at its most basic level, the ratio of surveys completed by eligible respondents to the total count of eligible respondents. In some surveys, this calculation can be rather complicated because it is difficult to distinguish between eligible and ineligible units. For school surveys, however, the Department of Education updates its list of known schools on a fairly regular basis, so estimating eligibility among nonrespondents is relatively straightforward. Unit response rates can be unweighted or weighted and are traditionally reported because they reflect the potential effects of nonsampling error and indicate whether portions of the population are underrepresented due to nonresponse. In order to calculate any of these measures, it is first necessary to know the disposition (outcome) of each sampled case.

This analysis was done because differences between the schools that did and did not respond to an item can lead to bias in estimates. 13 Base weights were used to calculate item response rates."}, {"section_title": "B-10", "text": "The magnitude of item nonresponse bias is determined by factors including the level of item response, the differences between item respondents and item nonrespondents on a survey item, and the distribution of item responses across categories of auxiliary variables. Because the values of the survey items are not known for item nonrespondents, the distributions of eight sampling frame variables 14 were compared between the nonrespondents and respondents for the 13 subitems with response rates of less than 85 percent. In addition, item medians were examined to determine if variation exists in responses between the categories of the eight sampling frame variables. The susceptibility to bias was also considered within each item by examining the effects of extreme outliers on the estimates. Among the items examined, 12 (C0234, C0236, C0238, C0240, C0242, C0326, C0408, C0542, C0546, C0550, C0554, C0558) were identified as having negligible nonresponse bias. The other item (C0330, total number of physical attacks or fights without a weapon) had statistically significant differences in its distributions across most of the key variables examined, and had statistically significant differences in its distributions of responses across categories of the eight sampling frame variables. The distributions between respondents and the sample for survey items associated with item C0330 were then examined. Based on these analyses, it was determined that the increased potential for bias in this item was not enough to warrant its exclusion from the data file.
