IIV has historically been neglected in favor of using scores based on central tendency, in order to attenuate the impact of single scores (e.g., trials within a task, tests within a battery) that deviate from an individual's mean performance. IIV is most typically operationalized in terms of response time inconsistency (RTI), with greater RTI having been linked to advanced age (Vasquez et al., 2016) , impaired cognitive status (Murtha et al., 2002; Halliday et al., 2017) , poorer cognitive function (Grand et al., 2016) and more rapid cognitive decline (Bielak et al., 2010) in older adults. Increased RTI has also been directly linked with reduced whole-brain white matter volume (Walhovd and Fjell, 2007) and to brain injury (Stuss et al., 2003) . Accordingly, IIV has been posited as a sensitive metric to central nervous system integrity, including structural, functional and neuromodulatory correlates (e.g., MacDonald et al., 2006) .\nDispersion is a related operationalization of IIV that reflects inconsistency in performance across a profile of multiple tasks (rather than within a single task). Greater dispersion reflects greater inconsistency across different tasks and has been understudied by comparison. Although such profiles are more likely to undergo scrupulous interpretation for etiologyspecific presentations in clinical practice (e.g., for differential diagnosis of vascular relative to Alzheimer's dementia), this level of analysis is less feasible in other contexts (e.g., brief neuropsychological screening). Instead, the initial identification of elevated dispersion that may be interpreted as irrelevant scatter (i.e., unusual patterns of responding), may instead assist clinicians in triaging clients for more comprehensive evaluation. Like RTI, dispersion has shown increases in late-life (Christensen et al., 1999) and has been associated with greater incidence of dementia in cross-sectional (Halliday et al., 2018) and population-based longitudinal studies of older adults (Holtzer et al., 2008) . In addition to processes associated with normative aging and neurodegeneration, greater dispersion has also been linked to acquired neurological insults in postconcussive college athletes (Rabinowitz and Arnett, 2013 ), suggesting that it may be sensitive to a wide range of neurological insults. In spite of the demonstrated utility of dispersion thus far, the underlying neural correlates have not been directly examined.\nNeuroimaging presents opportunities to understand potential neural correlates of cognitive function, without necessarily relying on patient populations and clinical phenomena to elucidate relationships of interest. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that measures the extracellular diffusion of water molecules and is used to infer properties of white matter microstructure. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is commonly used as an index of microstructural integrity of white matter, especially in white matter tracts (Feldman et al., 2010) ; higher values represent greater microstructural integrity. Mean diffusivity (MD) is sensitive to a microstructural loss due to cellularity, edema and necrosis (e.g., due to axonal loss; Alexander et al., 2011) ; higher values represent less overall integrity. Cognitive aging studies using whole-brain histograms have demonstrated an anterior-to-posterior and a superior-to-inferior gradient of decline in white matter integrity (Sullivan and Pfefferbaum, 2006; Davis et al., 2009; Madden et al., 2009; Zahr et al., 2009) , in addition to increases in MD as a function of increasing age . This suggests that white matter integrity changes in a predictable fashion in later life; however, associations with cognitive performance have been challenging to interpret, in general. Indeed, calls for additional understanding of structural-functional and anatomical-clinical relationships of important white matter tracts (e.g., superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus) have been raised to better understand their functional characterizations with regard to higher-order cognitive function (e.g., executive functioning-EF; Markis et al., 2004) . Emerging evidence supports the notion that tracts connecting frontal areas (e.g., genu, uncinate fasciculus) are heavily associated with EF (Davis et al., 2009; Ziegler et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011; Voineskos et al., 2012) and tracts connecting temporal areas are heavily associated with memory (Ziegler et al., 2010) .\nIn a review of 18 studies examining associations between white matter integrity and cognitive performance in healthy older adults, Madden et al. (2009) found that composite scores for different cognitive domains demonstrated correlations of similar magnitude and across a similar range of white matter tracts, relative to individual tasks within a given cognitive domain. Although in theory, white matter should correlate strongly with measures of information processing speed (Nilsson et al., 2014; Kuznetsova et al., 2016) , task impurity remains an important consideration . As a single and representative score for a given cognitive domain, composite scores have historically been advantageous in that they reduce the total number of degrees of freedom required for downstream analytic purposes, while also reducing measurement error and minimizing the contribution of any one particular score. In theory, composite indices attenuate the impact of scores that deviate from an individual's mean performance across similar tasks, in service of a more robust, representative index. In doing so, however, they may also obfuscate variance that is otherwise meaningful (e.g., dispersion), given that the magnitude and consistency of deviate scores have shown sensitivity to CNS insults.\nAs a purported marker of neurological insult, the neural underpinnings of dispersion in cognitive performance have yet to be examined, in spite of mounting indirect evidence from clinical populations that dispersion is sensitive to neural integrity. The present investigation sought to examine the associations between white matter integrity with both composite and dispersion scores based on neuropsychological test performance in healthy older adults. A priori hypotheses included that both dispersion and composite scores would be sensitive to white matter integrity. It was further anticipated that memory scores (dispersion and composite) would be associated with memory-specific white matter tracts (e.g., fornix, temporal lobe white matter) and that EF scores would be more heavily associated with frontal-parietal white matter tracts (e.g., superior longitudinal fasciculus). Memory and EF domains were of particular interest, given the relevance of these domains in day-to-day functioning (Lezak, 1982; Jurado and Rosselli, 2007; Baggetta and Alexander, 2016) , as well as in cognitive aging and cognitive decline (Grady, 2008; Vaughan and Giovanello, 2010) . Given robust findings of age-related decline in white matter, we further anticipated that age would attenuate linkages between white matter integrity and neuropsychological performance."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 1 .

All participants that were included in the current study were from the cognitively normal (healthy control) group. Specifically, all participants in the current study did not report memory concerns and did not show any impairments in cognitive function or performance of activities of daily living. According to the ADNI protocol, participants in this group must have normal memory function, as evidenced by a Logical Memory II subscale score of \u22659 with 16+ years of education on the revised Wechsler Memory Scale, a Mini-Mental State Examination score from 24 to 30 and a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.

Individual FA data were non-linearly aligned to a common space (FMRIB58_FA) and a mean FA image was created and thresholded (FA > 0.2), in order to produce the mean FA skeleton.

Dispersion profiles were derived using a regression technique, which computes ISD scores from standardized test scores (Christensen et al., 1999; Hultsch et al., 2002) . Test scores of interest were initially regressed on linear and quadratic age trends to control for age differences in mean performance, given that greater variance tends to be associated with greater means (Hale et al., 1998; Stawski et al., 2019) and that mean-level performance is likely to differ across the age range present in the current sample. Raw test scores were chosen and where necessary, were re-ordered so that high scores were uniformly indicative of better performance. We included tests that overlapped as much as possible with previously established composite scores described in the following section. These tests were selected from the time point corresponding most closely to the DTI measurements and are listed in Table 1 , along with an indication of the lowest and highest recorded scores. The resulting residuals from these models were standardized as T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10), with ISDs subsequently computed across these residualized test scores. The resulting dispersion estimate, indexed on a common metric, reflects the amount of variability across an individual's neuropsychological profile relative to the group average level of performance; higher values reflect greater IIV in cognitive function. Dispersion scores were computed across all test scores in the battery (broad profile dispersion: ISD-BP M = 9.12, SD = 2.57), as well as within memory (ISD-Mem M = 7.07, SD = 3.78) and EF (ISD-EF M = 8.80, SD = 7.75) domains. One case was excluded pairwise on the basis of having only five of the available fifteen test scores, resulting in a dispersion score greater than 3 SD above the group mean.

In validating the composite scores, each score was subsequently examined in terms of sensitivity to conversion to demented cognitive status, and in association to structural (e.g., white matter) and functional (e.g., CSF) biomarkers. Thus, the ADNI-Mem and ADNI-EF composite scores (referred to as COM-Mem and COM-EF hereafter) represent a suitable avenue to compare dispersion scores against in the present investigation.

In contrast to the more typically employed operationalization of IIV (RTI), dispersion has been comparatively understudied and the neural underpinnings have yet to be directly examined. The primary aims of the present study were to examine associations between white matter integrity using DTI with dispersion in performance across a broad battery of neuropsychological tests in older adults.\nWe also sought to replicate previous findings examining white matter associations with age and cognitive performance based on composite scores. The reported results replicate a number of these previous findings in older adulthood. Strong associations were observed between increased age with reduced microstructural integrity, across all major white matter tracts (Sullivan and Pfefferbaum, FIGURE 2 | Positive associations between COM-EF and white matter, based on fractional anisotropy (FA) at 90% threshold, depicted in radiological view. Mean FA skeleton shown in green. Areas of significant association shown in red. 2006; Davis et al., 2009; Madden et al., 2009; Zahr et al., 2009) . Using the ADNI-Mem and ADNI-EF composite scores to index aggregate memory and EF performance, respectively, we also replicated previous findings demonstrating that greater microstructural integrity was associated with better performance in both cognitive domains (Crane et al., 2012; Gibbons et al., 2012) . Dispersion within memory and EF areas was not reliably associated with white matter, contrary to anticipation; however, increased broad profile dispersion, reflecting larger amounts of intraindividual variability across participants' neuropsychological test battery, was associated with lower white matter integrity. Interestingly, although most effects were observed bilaterally, greater dispersion was associated with reduced integrity in left longitudinal fasciculus, but not right. This may stem from processes that are typically left-hemisphere dominant and common across neuropsychological tests (e.g., language, right motor function for graphomotor output in right handed individuals) and therefore the relative importance of left longitudinal fasciculus for successful performance. That reliable white matter associations were only observed with dispersion across the entire battery (and not with the domain-specific dispersion indices) may result from the fact that meaningful inconsistency in cognitive performance requires a sufficient number of indicators that was otherwise not afforded in the more circumscribed indices.\nAmongst the cognitive scores, results in general suggest that the composite and dispersion indices are associated with one another in general, but that there is little association across the two different operationalizations. The memory composite and dispersion scores were moderately correlated with one another, such that greater aggregate memory performance was associated with greater consistency of performance across memory tasks. The same pattern was not observed between the EF composite and dispersion scores. Composite scores correlated strongly with age, whereas dispersion scores did not, and this was the case even when age was not regressed from the dispersion scores initially. With age-regressed, the dispersion approach yields a score that is theoretically more purely associated with CNS function from the outset, given that age-related artifact (i.e., mean-level performance) is directly accounted for. In contrast, researchers employing the composite scores have typically accounted for age at later stages of analysis (Crane et al., 2012; Gibbons et al., 2012) .\nAs is the case with composite scores, in utilizing multiple samples within and across cognitive domains, dispersion scores also afford greater reliability than any one test in isolation, while providing an overall snapshot of neurological status that confers information which may be orthogonal to that of composite scores. Unlike related operationalizations of IIV (e.g., RTI), dispersion can be computed based on both speed and accuracy-based measures with sufficient range, rendering the approach more ecologically feasible in applied settings. Importantly, dispersion does not capture where an individual's mean level of performance across tests falls in relation to the group mean; that is, an individual may show the same magnitude of dispersion, with mean performance above or below the group mean. Thus, although dispersion may increase the overall sensitivity in identifying individuals with mild neurological impairment (e.g., early MCI, mild TBI), it is not suitable as an alternative to metrics that inform the directionality of performance (e.g., mean). Nevertheless, individuals who are consistently high-or low-performing across cognitive domains are likely closer to their own baseline state, relative to individuals who demonstrate elevated dispersion. Individuals with elevated dispersion may, therefore, be less capable of compensating in areas that are beginning to decline, relative to their otherwise typical levels of performance."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "Replication of the reported findings will be essential to solidify the utility of composite and dispersion scores for indexing white matter integrity. Additional protocols available in future waves of the ADNI study (e.g., the brain health registry questionnaire 4 ) may further contribute to a more in-depth understanding of these relationships. Although the sample was rigorously screened (e.g., for medical complications and cognitive impairment) and evenly represented the older adulthood age range, the effects reported here may nevertheless differ in the general population. The dispersion computation accounts for age-related artifact, where test scores are regressed on both linear and quadratic age trends and are then converted to T-scores; however, these scores are nevertheless derived within-sample. Future studies employing dispersion may consider employing appropriate population-based norms (e.g., Canadian Study of Health and Aging, Mayo's Older Americans Normative Studies) to derive T-scores to examine the congruence of effects using both approaches (i.e., the more controlled withinsample approach relative to the more generalizable populationbased approach). Future studies may also consider examining dispersion in different populations (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis), and within complex multidimensional domains such as executive functioning (e.g., Karr et al., 2018) to better understand the utility of the approach with respect to different neuropsychological phenomena."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Dispersion is easily computed across speeded and accuracybased measures and shows promise in detecting white matter damage, beyond that seen in the typical aging process. This investigation is the first to demonstrate that inconsistency across neuropsychological test performance is associated with white matter integrity in multiple brain regions. Although some clinicians may be inclined to interpret such inconsistency as merely scatter, a reliably quantified index of inconsistency helps remove this subjective bias, leaving open the possibility for detection of at-risk individuals who may benefit from continued monitoring. This may be especially important for individuals who do not present with marked deficits on any one particular task, but instead present with multiple, mild deficits that may otherwise go unnoticed."}]
