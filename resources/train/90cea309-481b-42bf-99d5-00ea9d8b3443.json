This study assessed the impact of gender on cognition, amyloid accumulation, the volumes of hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (EC), fusiform and medial temporal lobe (MTA) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathology biomarkers in patients reporting SMC.\nMethods: Twenty-nine males (mean age \u00b1 SD: 72.3 \u00b1 5.7 years) and 40 females (mean age \u00b1 SD: 71.0 \u00b1 5.1 years) with SMC from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included in the study. We explored the gender discrepancies in cognition, Results: Compared with females, males showed significantly worse performance in Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 (ADAS-13; P = 0.004) and lower amyloid deposition (P < 0.001). However, females showed greater advantage on the task of Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test-5 (RAVLT-5) sum (P = 0.021), RAVLT-immediate recall (P = 0.010) and reduced volumes of the hippocampus, EC, fusiform and MTA (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.007) than males.

Recent mounting evidences indicated that SMC is a risk factor for future accelerated cognitive decline and progression to preclinical or clinical state of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with AD-type changes in amyloid deposition, neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Petersen, 2000; Visser et al., 2009; Reisberg et al., 2010; Perrotin et al., 2012; Scheef et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2014) . Taken together, these results suggested that SMC might be an initial symptomatic indicator of preclinical AD (Jessen et al., 2014) .\nGender-specific discrepancies in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD have been observed (Roberts et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2015) . Thus, sex-specific research in SMC is crucial to ensure early correct detection and pre-clinical intervention. However, to date, few studies have focused on the role of gender in SMC across a comprehensive profile of the cognitive assessment, neuroimaging and CSF AD biomarkers.\nTherefore, the purpose of the current study was to go further to analyze whether the gender discrepancies are related to neuropsychological performance, CSF and positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers of AD pathology in older adults reporting SMC."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI Study Design", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 1 during January 2018. The data collectors were blind to participant information during the experiments. The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco. ADNI is a global research effort that actively supports the investigation and development of treatments that slow or stop the progression of AD and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the US and Canada. The overall goal of ADNI is to determine biomarkers for use in AD clinical treatment trials. To date, it has three phases: ADNI1, ADNI GO and ADNI2, consisting of cognitively normal (CN) individuals, early MCI (EMCI), to late MCI (LMCI), and dementia or AD.

The results confirmed that women with SMC outperformed men with SMC on the tasks of RAVLT-5 sum and RAVLT-immediate recall, while the advantage was eliminated on the task of RAVLT-delayed recall and a floor effect might limit interpretation. However, we found that men with SMC were associated with worse performance on ADAS-13. No significant differences were observed between males and females on other cognitive domains. Our results are in concordance with previous studies showing that the female advantage in verbal memory task was more apparent than men (Herlitz et al., 1997; Sundermann et al., 2016a,b) . These observations suggest that gender discrepancies among SMC subjects might be appropriate to a specific cognitive domain. If so, then implementing sex-adjusted norms in clinical memory tests might ameliorate the diagnostic accuracy in women. Females with SMC participants showed increased A\u03b2 deposition relative to males. Elevated risk of AD was in women compared to men, although the underlying mechanism remains elusive as previously reported (Seshadri et al., 2006) . However, we did not discover differences in CSF A\u03b242, Tau and P-tau between males and females with subjective cognitive impairment. It is noteworthy that we observed significant reduction in volumetric measurements of hippocampus, EC, fusiform gyrus and MTA in females with SMC subjects. Consistent with the cognitive reserve theory (Klonoff and Landrine, 1992; Stern et al., 1994 Stern et al., , 2003 Stern, 2002) , better premorbid performance of women on verbal episodic memory tests might confer an advantage in the ability to maintain normal verbal memory performance despite reduced volumes of hippocampal, EC, fusiform gyrus, MTA and accumulating AD pathology (Sundermann et al., 2016a (Sundermann et al., ,b, 2017 . However, women may have more accelerated decline once neuropathology reached a threshold level (Klonoff and Landrine, 1992; Stern et al., 1994) . Several limitations should be mentioned in the current study. First, a simple cross-sectional design used in the study does not definitively permit the theory that female advantage in verbal memory may act as a specific form of cognitive reserve, further longitudinal researches would be more necessary to closely confirm the conclusions. Second, The ADNI cohort included a potential selection bias based on the fact that ADNI participants had a high education level (Petersen et al., 2010; Grill et al., 2013) , which may affect the generalizability to a greater population sections. Third, the relatively small group size could limit the interpretation of our results, larger sample of numbers need to be collected in future studies."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In summary, the present results highlighted the urgent need to consider the sex differences in cognition evaluation, which contributes to clinical diagnosis even in preclinical stages, such as SMC."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "LW: conceived and designed the studies; wrote the article; is the corresponding author.
