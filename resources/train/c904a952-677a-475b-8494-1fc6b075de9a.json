[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Foundation species are species that create habitat, modulate ecosystem dynamics, and facilitate the development of entire ecological communities (Dayton, 1972;Ellison et al., 2005). Although foundation species are typically resilient organisms that play an important role in physically stressful environments (e.g., tidal wetlands, kelp forests, coral reefs, semiarid grasslands, and alpine forests) (Bertness & Callaway, 1994;Angelini et al., 2011), we live in an era of unprecedented ecological change (Vitousek, 1994;Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) in which foundation species are increasingly exposed to novel and potentially adverse conditions. Natural resource managers are increasingly challenged to anticipate and prepare for the ecological effects of rapid global change (Glick, 2011). From a functional perspective, the response of foundation species to global change is especially important due to the critical influence they have on ecosystem structure, functions, and services (Dayton, 1972;Ellison et al., 2005). In tidal saline wetlands located near tropical-temperate climate transition zones, winter climate change has the potential to cause relatively dramatic landscapescale foundation species replacement. Salt marsh graminoids and mangrove trees (see photos in Fig. 1) are considered foundation species because they control tidal wetland ecosystem dynamics and facilitate the development of tidal saline wetland ecological communities (Teal, 1962;Bertness & Leonard, 1997;Alongi, 2009). In addition to supporting important fish and wildlife habitat, tidal saline wetland marsh and forest ecosystems improve water quality, store carbon, subsidize coastal fisheries, protect coastlines, and provide recreational opportunities (Viosca, 1928;Davis, 1940;Zedler & Kercher, 2005;Barbier et al., 2011). Salt marsh and mangrove forest foundation species occupy similar tidal saline wetland geomorphic settings (Friess et al., 2011), but have divergent winter climate tolerances. In tropical climates, mangrove trees often outcompete salt marsh graminoids (Davis, 1940;Chapman, 1976;Tomlinson, 1986;Duke et al., 1998). Salt marshes are more dominant along colder coastlines (i.e., temperate, boreal, and arctic) (Adam, 1990;Pennings & Bertness, 2001) where mangrove forests are not able to survive extreme freezing temperatures (Stuart et al., 2007). The latitudinal location of salt marsh to mangrove forest transition areas is region dependent, but generally falls somewhere between 25\u00b0and 40\u00b0North or South (see discussion in Morrisey et al., 2010). Near these tropicaltemperate transition zones, winter climate change in the form of warmer winter temperatures and less extreme freezing events has the potential to lead to poleward mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement (Ross et al., 2009;Saintilan et al., 2009;McKee et al., 2012). The ecosystem goods and services provided by tidal wetlands are tightly linked to and dependent on the functional ecology and structural environment provided by tidal wetland plant foundation species. Salt marshes and mangrove forests are both highly valued ecosystems; however, salt marshes and mangrove forests support divergent ecological communities and a different suite of goods and services (Barbier et al., 2011). As a result, the potential ecological implications of graminoid-to-tree conversions (i.e., salt marsh-tomangrove forest) that are induced by winter climate change could be substantial in positive and negative ways (e.g., effects upon fish and wildlife populations, ecosystem resilience, nutrient cycling). The southeastern United States (i.e., the US Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic coasts) is a region of the world where the effect of mangrove forest range expansion could be substantial. Tidal saline wetlands in this region are very abundant (Field et al., 1991), and this area spans a winter climate gradient that contains both salt marsh graminoid-and mangrove forest-dominated tidal saline wetlands. Despite relatively widespread awareness that winter climate extremes limit the northern distribution of mangrove forests in the southeastern United States (Davis, 1940;Lugo & Patterson-Zucca, 1977;Sherrod & McMillan, 1981;Stevens et al., 2006;Ross et al., 2009;Pickens & Hester, 2011;McKee et al., 2012), the vulnerability of salt marshes in the region to winter climate change-induced mangrove forest migration has not been examined, and, to our knowledge, the relationship between extreme winter events and mangrove forest presence or relative abundance has not been quantified at the regional scale. In this study, we investigated the potential for winter climate change-induced mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement in the southeastern United States via a 30-year observed climate record , mangrove forest and salt marsh presence and relative abundance data, and several alternative future winter climate scenarios. Our research addresses the following three questions: (1) What is the relationship between winter climate and the presence and abundance of mangrove forests relative to salt marshes; (2) How vulnerable are salt marshes in the region to winter climate change-induced mangrove forest range expansion; and (3) What is the potential future distribution and relative abundance of mangrove forests under alternative future winter climate change scenarios?"}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study area and sample grid", "text": "Our study area included coastal reaches of the southeastern United States that contain tidal saline wetlands (i.e., the Gulf of Mexico coast from Texas to Florida and the southern Atlantic coast from Florida to North Carolina; Fig. 2; this is an area of approximately 172,024 km 2 ). Mangrove species in this ecoregion include Avicennia germinans, Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, and Conocarpus erectus. Of these species, A. germinans is the most tolerant of winter extremes and has the most northern range limit. Common salt marsh species in the region include, among others, Spartina alterniflora, Juncus roemerianus, Spartina patens, Salicornia virginica, Batis maritima, and Distichlis spicata. The study area was determined using the extent of tidal saline wetlands as determined from the US Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). We established a grid of cells within the study area for obtaining climate and coastal wetland data. Both the cell size (1/8\u00b0) and the spatial registration of the study grid match that of the gridded climate data used in the study. However, climate data from this dataset were not available for cells with open water; therefore, in some areas, 1/8\u00b0cells were merged (i.e., combined to form a larger cell). Merged cells were attributed with the data from the closest 1/8\u00b0cell for which climate data were available (Fig. 2). The resultant grid contained a total of 590 individual cells with the following size distribution (mean AE SE area in parentheses): 352 cells that contained a single 1/8\u00b0cell (166.7 AE 0.2 km 2 ); 148 cells that contained two 1/8\u00b0cells (334.3 AE 0.7 km 2 ); 59 cells that contained three 1/8\u00b0cells (499.1 AE 1.6 km 2 ); 27 cells that contained four to seven 1/8\u00b0c ells (819.1 AE 35.2 km 2 ); and four cells that contained more than nine 1/8\u00b0cells (3081.3 AE 1261.8 km 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Coastal wetland data", "text": "We determined the salt marsh area within each cell using the estuarine emergent land cover class contained within the 2006 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) dataset. We chose to use C-CAP instead of NWI to determine salt marsh area because C-CAP data are often more recent than NWI data.   Sherrod & McMillan (1981) and Finkbeiner et al. (2009) for Texas. We determined mangrove forest presence within each cell for each of the three southeastern US states where mangrove forests are currently present (i.e., Florida, Louisiana, and Texas; Fig. 2). After evaluating the mangrove forest spatial data available for the region, we concluded that a single mangrove forest dataset for the entire study area containing the level of accuracy desired was not available; thus, we used state-level data sources for determining mangrove forest presence. A binary approach was used to quantify mangrove forest presence/absence within each cell. Whereas cells that contained mangrove forests were given a code to indicate that mangrove forests were present, cells that contained just salt marsh or areas of salt marsh with sparse mangrove individuals were given a code to indicate that mangrove forests were absent. For example, although mangrove individuals are currently present in parts of St. Joseph Bay (Florida) and on Horn Island (Mississippi), these areas were not designated as mangrove forest as mangrove individuals in those areas are scattered within a matrix that is primarily salt marsh; we reserved the designation of mangrove forest for cells where at least a portion of the cell (e.g., a 900 m 2 pixel) was covered completely by mangrove trees and not salt marsh graminoids. Our mangrove forest category includes mangrove forests of all heights (e.g., the stunted 1-2 m forests found in parts of Texas and Louisiana and the taller mangrove forests found in southern Florida). For Florida, we determined mangrove forest presence using data from the 2004 Florida Land Use and Cover Classification System (FLUCCS; Florida Department of Transportation, 1999). For Louisiana, we determined mangrove forest presence using data collected via aerial surveys from a fixed-wing aircraft by Michot et al. (2010). For Texas, we determined mangrove forest presence via a combination of the following two data sources and our own current knowledge of the Texas coast: (1) mangrove forest distribution maps produced by Sherrod & McMillan (1981); and (2) a benthic habitat atlas of the southern and central coast of Texas produced by Finkbeiner et al. (2009). For Florida, in addition to mangrove forest presence, we determined relative abundance (i.e., the percentage of tidal saline wetlands dominated by mangrove forest) by dividing the mangrove forest area (determined from 2004 FLUCCS data) by the sum of the salt marsh area and mangrove forest area contained within each cell ( Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information). Relative abundance was used to determine mangrove forest or salt marsh dominance of tidal saline wetlands within a cell. Statewide mangrove forest area and relative abundance data were not available for Louisiana or Texas. Whereas the pixel resolution of the C-CAP and FLUC-CS data used in this study is 30 m, the pixel resolution of the southern and central Texas NOAA benthic habitat data used in this study is variable, but generally between 0.25 and 4 m."}, {"section_title": "Winter climate data", "text": "As extreme winter temperature events are best quantified at the multidecadal scale, we chose the following two 30-year time intervals to evaluate modern and projected future winter severity: (1) 1970-2000 (the modern climate) and (2) 2070-2100 (the projected future climate). For the modern climate, we obtained daily minimum observed temperature data for each cell from a dataset produced by Maurer et al. (2002). For the projected future climate, we obtained output from eight downscaled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) that were part of the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multimodel dataset (Meehl et al., 2007). The output from these downscaled AOGCMs is part of a new climate dataset in development for North America for the US Geological Survey that uses a statistical asynchronous regression approach to better reflect the distribution of daily temperature extremes (Stoner et al., 2012; see application and discussion of this dataset in Terando et al., 2012). We obtained daily minimum temperature projections for the following eight downscaled AOGCMs for two different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios [B1 and A2; IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (Nakicenovic et al., 2000)]: NCAR-CCSM3, CCMA-CGCM3.1(T47), CCMA-CGCM3.1(T63), CNRM-CM3, MPIM-ECHAM5, GFDL-CM2.0, NCAR-PCM, and BCCR-BCM2. Whereas the B1 projections represent a low greenhouse gas emissions scenario with a more convergent world, lower population growth, reduced fossil fuel use, and the adoption of less energy and material-intensive activities, the A2 projections represent a medium-high greenhouse gas emissions scenario where the world is heterogenous, economic growth is uneven, population growth is high, and fossil fuels continue to be the dominant energy source (Nakicenovic et al., 2000). The pixel resolution of the climate data used in this study is 1/8\u00b0."}, {"section_title": "Linkages between winter climate and mangrove forest presence and relative abundance", "text": "Prior to developing mangrove forest distribution and relative abundance models, we calculated various measures of winter severity for the modern climate (Table 1). To minimize the influence of unmeasured abiotic factors in the coastal wetland presence and relative abundance data, we removed all cells that were located in sections of the coast without expansive wetland areas (defined as cells containing less than two percent tidal saline wetlands). This process resulted in a modern climate-coastal wetland data matrix that contained 391 cells (i.e., 199 cells were removed from the dataset because tidal saline wetlands were less abundant in those areas). To quantify the relationship between mangrove forest presence and modern climate winter severity, we developed logistic regression models for the winter severity variables in Table 1. As Spearman rank correlation tests indicated a high degree of collinearity between these variables (the mean and minimum of the bivariate Spearman rank correlation coefficients were 0.92 and 0.76, respectively), we developed single-predictor models and selected the model that best predicted mangrove forest presence using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). To quantify the relationship between mangrove forest relative abundance and winter severity, a data matrix from Florida that contained 101 cells was used to develop sigmoidal or exponential decay regression models for the winter severity variables in Table 1. To identify temperature thresholds for mangrove replacement of salt marsh, we used two approaches: (1) a sigmoidal regression approach where the inflection point of a sigmoidal model was determined as a threshold; and (2) a recursive partitioning approach where the first node of a regression tree was determined as a threshold. To identify temperature thresholds for mangrove forest presence, we used a recursive partitioning approach where the first node of a classification tree was determined as a threshold. Recursive partitioning was conducted in R (http://cran.r-project.org) using the Rpart package (Therneau & Atkinson, 1997), sigmoidal and exponential decay regression analyses were conducted in Sigma Plot Version 12.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA), and logistic regression analyses were conducted in SAS Version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) using the LOGISTIC procedure (i.e., PROC LOGISTIC). Maps were created using ArcGIS 10.0 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., Redlands, CA, USA).\nThere was a strong relationship between all eight winter severity variables and mangrove forest presence and relative abundance (Table 1; Fig. 3). In addition to presenting mangrove forest distribution and relative abundance models for each of the variables (Table 1), we identified threshold levels for predicting mangrove forest presence and relative abundance (Table 2; Fig. 3). For example, the 30-year minimum temperature thresholds for mangrove forest presence and dominance were identified as \u00c08.9\u00b0C and \u00c07.0\u00b0C, respectively (Table 2; Fig. 3a).

We used the resultant data to illustrate salt marsh vulnerability to mangrove forest migration and determine the amount of salt marsh area within each state that would potentially be affected by region-wide single-value temperature warming scenarios ranging from 0\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. For the AOGCM-based future climate scenarios (i.e., eight AOGCM projections for 2070-2100 for two emissions scenarios), we determined the projected MAMT for each cell. Then, we derived an ensemble of MAMT projections for each of the two emissions scenarios (A2 and B1) by calculating the mean and standard error of the eight AOGCMs for each emissions scenario. We used these ensemble temperature projections and the mangrove forest distribution and relative abundance models to evaluate future mangrove forest presence and future mangrove forest relative abundance in each cell for each of the two emissions scenarios (A2 and B1)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Salt marsh vulnerability to mangrove forest migration", "text": "Using the modern climate MAMT-based mangrove forest distribution and relative abundance models (Table 1; Fig. 3b), we evaluated salt marsh vulnerability to mangrove forest migration under alternative winter climate change scenarios (Figs 4-6).

Our results indicate that, within the region, salt marshes in Louisiana, Texas, and Florida are most vulnerable to winter climate change-induced mangrove forest range expansion; for example, with a 2\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C increase in MAMT, 6820 (95% of LA state total), 1970 (100% of TX state total), and 830 (60% of FL state total) km 2 of salt marsh could become vulnerable to mangrove forest replacement (Figs 4 and 5a). Within the Gulf of Mexico, salt marshes in Mississippi, Alabama, and parts of the northwest Florida coast (i.e., much of the area north and west of Cedar Key, FL) are the least sensitive to winter climate change-induced mangrove forest migration as a 4\u00b0C to 6\u00b0C increase in MAMT relative to the modern climate would be required for salt marsh-tomangrove forest conversions to occur (Figs 4 and 5). Along the Atlantic coast, all of the salt marshes in Georgia (1480 km 2 ; 100% of state total) and many of the salt marshes in South Carolina (890 km 2 ; 63% of state total) could become vulnerable to mangrove forest replacement with a 4\u00b0C to 6\u00b0C increase in MAMT relative to the modern climate (Figs 4 and 5a). In North Carolina, the coldest state within our study area, our results indicate that mangrove forest replacement of salt marsh would require MAMT increases greater than 6\u00b0C (Figs 4 and 5b). In addition to the region-wide warming scenarios (Figs 4 and 5), we also assessed the future probability of mangrove forest presence and relative abundance under ensemble B1 and A2 future climate projections  (Fig. 6). The ensemble projected MAMT increases across the study area ranged from a 0\u00b0C to 1\u00b0C increase for some cells under the B1 scenario up to a 6\u00b0C increase for some cells under the A2 scenario (Fig.  S2 in the Supporting Information). Whereas the ensemble B1 projection suggests a mean AE SE MAMT increase of 2.3\u00b0C AE 0.4\u00b0C, the ensemble A2 projection suggests a mean AE SE MAMT increase of 4.3\u00b0C AE 0.5\u00b0C across all cells and AOGCM projections (Fig. S2 in the Supporting Information). Although both scenarios predict an expansion of mangrove forests and displacement of salt marsh, the total salt marsh area affected by mangrove forest expansion is greater in the A2 scenario than in the B1 scenario ( Fig. 6) due to the higher temperature projections accompanying the higher emissions scenario (Fig. S2 in the Supporting Information)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Ecologists have long noted that extreme winter events influence the distribution and abundance of salt marshes and mangrove forests (Storey & Gudger, 1936;Davis, 1940;Lugo & Patterson-Zucca, 1977;McKee et al., 2012). However, due to the limited availability of winter climate and coastal wetland occurrence and abundance data, most investigations of winter climate controls upon mangrove-salt marsh interactions have been based on: (1) local-scale observations of mangrove forest structural effects or mortality during extreme winter events (Davis, 1940;Lugo & Patterson-Zucca, 1977;Kangas & Lugo, 1990;Stevens et al., 2006;Ross et al., 2009;Pickens & Hester, 2011); or (2) global-scale evaluations of the distribution of mangrove forests relative to mean monthly or mean annual air or sea surface temperature data (Chapman, 1976;Tomlinson, 1986;Duke et al., 1998). In this study, we used extreme winter temperature data (i.e., extremes of the daily minima) to develop regional-scale mangrove forest distribution and relative abundance models for the southeastern United States. These simple models (Tables 1 and 2; Fig. 3) can be used to predict mangrove forest presence or relative abundance using global climate model projections of future winter temperatures (e.g., Figs 4-6). Of the winter severity variables examined, MAMT and the 30-year minimum temperature are among the most useful and relevant from a physiological and logistical perspective. MAMT is frequently used at regional scales to illustrate plant tolerance of winter climate extremes (e.g., the US Department of Agriculture Plant Hardiness Zone Maps); the freeze tolerance of many plant species matches the MAMT at their poleward range limit (Sakai & Weiser, 1973;Woodward, 1987;Kreyling, 2010). Our 30-year minimum temperature threshold analyses indicate that mangrove forests in the southeastern United States are not likely to be present in areas where minimum temperatures fall below approximately \u00c08.9\u00b0C, and mangrove forests are not likely to be dominant in areas where minimum temperatures fall below approximately \u00c07.0\u00b0C (Table 2; Fig. 3a). In his seminal treatise on South Florida mangroves, John Henry Davis identified a minimum temperature threshold level for mangrove forests that is close to but slightly warmer than the mangrove forest presence threshold we identified; based on historical observations, Davis (1940) speculated that temperatures below \u00c04\u00b0C would be required for mangrove mortality to occur. More recently, Stevens et al. (2006) observed that due to a freeze event of \u00c08\u00b0C near Cedar Key (Florida) in 1996, A. germinans trees lost some or all of their leaves, but recovered within the year. In Texas, severe freeze events with minimum temperatures of \u00c08.8\u00b0C and \u00c08.9\u00b0C in 1983 and 1989, respectively, caused widespread A. germinans damage (Lonard & Judd, 1991) and mortality; these two freeze events reduced mangrove aerial coverage by 95% and 98%, respectively (Everitt et al., 1996). Extreme winter events that affect mangrove forests also typically affect citrus trees and many other warm-temperate/subtropical plant species (Lonard & Judd, 1991;Rogers & Rohli, 1991;Stevens et al., 2006;Saintilan et al., 2009). The minimum temperature thresholds we identified for mangrove forest presence and dominance fall within the range of values reported for citrus species; minimum temperature thresholds for many citrus tree species in Florida are between \u00c04.5\u00b0C and \u00c09\u00b0C (Wiltbank & Oswalt, 1987). Our model results for the modern climate indicate that many northern Gulf of Mexico sites where mangrove expansion into salt marsh has been investigated [e.g., Cedar Key (Stevens et al., 2006); Port Fourchon (Louisiana) (Penfound & Hathaway, 1938;Patterson, 1991;Patterson & Mendelssohn, 1991;Patterson et al., 1993Patterson et al., , 1997Perry, 2007;Perry & Mendelssohn, 2009;Alleman & Hester, 2011a,b;Pickens & Hester, 2011;Krauss et al., 2012), Galveston (TX) (Comeaux et al., 2012), and Port Aransas (TX) (McMillan, 1971;Sherrod Fig. 4 This map shows the increase in mean annual minimum temperatures (\u00b0C) relative to the modern climate  that is expected to lead to mangrove forest dominance of tidal saline wetland habitats relative to salt marshes. The modern climate category reflects areas where mangrove forests are currently expected to be dominant relative to salt marshes. Note that these analyses apply just to the tidal saline wetland habitat within each cell and not the entire cell. & McMillan, 1981;Everitt et al., 1996;Chavez-Ramirez & Wehtje, 2012;Comeaux et al., 2012)] are in or proximate to areas where mangrove forests are currently predicted to be present but not dominant relative to salt marshes (i.e., where small A. germinans forests and individuals are present within a matrix that is primarily dominated by salt marsh graminoids). One of our primary study objectives was to evaluate the vulnerability of salt marshes in the southeastern United States to mangrove forest range expansion under alternative future winter climate scenarios. Climate change vulnerability assessments can be conceptually divided into three elements: sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity (Glick, 2011). We determined the sensitivity of mangrove forests to extreme winter climate events that lead to mortality and/or affect forest structural development. We also determined the sensitivity of salt marshes to winter climate change that could enable mangrove forest range expansion and salt marsh displacement. Our analyses indicate that salt marshes in the states of Louisiana, Texas, and parts of Florida are especially sensitive to winter climate change due to their proximity to the winter climate threshold that differentiates between mangrove forest and salt marsh dominance. For example, with a 0\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C increase in MAMT relative to the modern climate, approximately 740 km 2 (7%) of salt marsh in these three states would likely become susceptible to mangrove expansion, and with a 2\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C increase in MAMT relative to the modern climate, approximately 9860 km 2 (93%) of salt marsh in these three states would likely become susceptible to mangrove expansion (Figs 4 and 5a; values in parentheses represent the percentage of the total salt marsh area in these three states). We used alternative winter climate scenarios to evaluate the potential exposure of coastal wetlands in the region to winter climate change. Our analyses of statistically downscaled future climate projections for 2070-2100 indicate that the potential for mangrove forest range expansion would be moderate under a lower greenhouse gas emissions scenario (B1), but relatively high under a medium-high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (A2) (Fig. 6). Implicit in our evaluations of potential mangrove expansion under alternative future winter climate scenarios are several assumptions regarding the adaptive capacity of mangrove forests. We assume that mangrove forests will be able to migrate relatively rapidly in response to winter climate change. For many terrestrial plant species, observed migration in response to climate change can be slow and/or unpredictable due to multiple factors including limited dispersal capacity, negative interactions with species already present in newly available habitat, and unsuitable nonclimatic abiotic conditions (Pitelka, 1997;Clark et al., 2003;Ib a\u00f1ez et al., 2009;Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012;Zhu et al., 2012). However, we expect that range migration for some mangrove species would occur more rapidly than for most terrestrial plant species. Water-dispersed plants are often capable of traveling longer distances than plants that are wind or animal dispersed (Ridley, 1930), and many mangrove species produce water-dispersed salt-tolerant propagules which float and are viable for extended periods (Rabinowitz, 1978;Tomlinson, 1986;Alleman & Hester, 2011b). As a result, tropical storms and/or oceanic currents can transport viable mangrove propagules of some species across relatively large distances (Davis, 1940;Gunn & Dennis, 1973;Clarke, 1993;Nettel & Dodd, 2007;Sousa et al., 2007). With regards to biotic interactions in newly suitable habitats, we assume that competition between mangroves and salt marshes will be most intense in areas near the poleward range limit of mangrove forests where extreme winter climate limits mangrove forest growth and development (i.e., areas where our models indicate that mangrove forests are likely to be present (a) (b) Fig. 5 The winter climate-dependent vulnerability of salt marshes to displacement by mangrove forests in: (a) the states of Louisiana, Texas, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina; and (b) the states of Mississippi, Alabama, and North Carolina. This figure reflects the amount of salt marsh area that could be converted into mangrove forest within each state in response to increases in mean annual minimum temperature (\u00b0C) relative to the modern climate . See text for additional description. but not dominant), but that mangrove forests will be competitively dominant in areas with warmer winters (Kangas & Lugo, 1990;Fig. 3). Although salt marsh graminoids have been shown to compete with mangrove trees in certain situations (e.g., Patterson et al., 1993;McKee & Rooth, 2008;Smith et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2012), several studies have indicated that, in climatically suitable areas (e.g., areas warm enough to support mature and dominant mangrove forests), salt marsh species can facilitate mangrove forest establishment and development via propagule entrapment and improved soil physicochemical conditions (Lewis & Dunstan, 1975;Lewis et al., 2005;Milbrandt & Tinsley, 2006;McKee et al., 2007;Smith et al., 2009;Osland et al., 2012;Peterson & Bell, 2012). In terms of the suitability of abiotic conditions in newly available habitat, we make the assumption that the abiotic conditions that determine the relative abundance of mangrove forests in Florida will be similar in other parts of the southeastern United States. For most of the region, this assumption is probably appropriate; however, in areas with very low precipitation (e.g., arid parts of southwest Texas) or continuous freshwater flow (e.g., parts of Louisiana), the abundance of mangrove forests relative to unvegetated tidal flats and/or salt marshes will likely be different (Dunton et al., 2001;Montagna et al., 2007). The effect of winter climate change could also be influenced by the frequency and timing of drought events; a recent study conducted in Louisiana indicates that decreased water use by Avicenia-dominated mangrove forests relative to Spartinadominated salt marshes may provide mangrove forests with greater stress tolerance and/or a competitive advantage in some situations (Krauss et al., 2012). The simple distribution and relative abundance models we developed are intended to provide an initial Predictions of mangrove forest presence and relative abundance (i.e., percentage of tidal saline wetlands dominated by mangrove forests) under alternative future (2070-2100) winter climate projections: (a) probability of mangrove forest presence with an ensemble B1 scenario climate; (b) probability of mangrove forest presence with an ensemble A2 scenario climate; (c) mangrove forest relative abundance with an ensemble B1 scenario climate; and (d) mangrove forest relative abundance with an ensemble A2 scenario climate. Note that these predictions apply just to the tidal saline wetland habitat within each cell and not the entire cell. assessment of the potential for winter climate changeinduced mangrove forest poleward range expansion and salt marsh displacement in the southeastern United States. There are many assumptions and uncertainties inherent to species distribution models (Wiens et al., 2009), and our analyses were constrained by various factors including the availability of mangrove forest presence and abundance data, the resolution of coastal wetland data (i.e., 30 m for much of the study area), and the resolution and extent of coastal winter climate data (i.e., 1/8\u00b0resolution and no data over cells with open water, respectively). Our analyses of future projected climate data are also constrained by limitations associated with statistical downscaling (e.g., the assumption of stationarity, an unchanging envelope of variability) (Wilby & Wigley, 1997;Milly et al., 2008;Wilby & Fowler, 2010). As better data become available, we expect that these models will be refined and additional complexity will be added including species-specific responses (e.g., differential winter climate responses between A. germinans, R. mangle, and L. racemosa) (Markley et al., 1982;Ross et al., 2009), biotic interactions, temperature exposure assessments (e.g., Pickens & Hester, 2011), interactions with other aspects of climate change (e.g., precipitation change, sea level rise, increasing CO 2 , saltwater intrusion, hydrologic alterations) (McKee & Rooth, 2008;McKee et al., 2012), and mechanistic ecosystem development simulations (Doyle et al., 2003(Doyle et al., , 2010Berger et al., 2008). Interactions between sea level rise and winter climate change are particularly important; whereas warming is expected to enable poleward mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement, sea level rise is expected to result in landward mangrove forest migration and tidal freshwater forested wetland displacement (Doyle et al., 2010;Krauss et al., 2011). In this study, our analyses focused exclusively on the southeastern United States; however, given the availability of global mangrove distributional data (e.g., Giri et al., 2011), a global evaluation of winter climate controls upon salt marsh-mangrove forest interactions is likely feasible and would enable interregional comparisons. Collectively, our analyses quantify the relationship between extreme winter climate events and the distribution and relative abundance of mangrove forests relative to salt marshes in the southeastern United States. The simple distribution and relative abundance models we developed can be used to gauge the potential effect of alternative future winter climate scenarios upon coastal wetlands. Our results indicate that salt marshes in Louisiana, Texas, and parts of Florida are particularly vulnerable to winter climate change-induced mangrove forest range expansion (Fig. 4). The transition from salt marsh to mangrove forest is relatively dramatic to even the casual observer (i.e., an ecosystem that has been historically grass or herbaceous plantdominated transitions to a forest). From an ecological perspective, the replacement of coastal wetland foundation species would likely have substantial functional and structural repercussions (Dayton, 1972;Ellison et al., 2005;Osland et al., 2012). The potential ecological effects of mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement are likely diverse, ranging from important biota effects (e.g., changing habitat for fish and birds) to ecosystem stability (e.g., habitat loss; response to sea level rise and drought; coastal protection from storms) to biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon and nitrogen cycling; water quality improvement). Many of the important questions regarding the potential effects of mangrove forest replacement of salt marsh have not yet been fully investigated."}]
