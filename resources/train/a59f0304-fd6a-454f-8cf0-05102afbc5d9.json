[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "American higher education has experienced massive expansion since World War II. In 2000 there were approximately 4,200 institutions of higher education in the United States and its territories, enrolling about 15.3 million students (National Center for Education Statistics, 2003) . In 2001, over 60% of the nation's high school graduates attended colleges. On the other hand, American higher education has been increasingly stratified. Caroline Hoxby (1997) showed that during the period between 1940 and 1991, the between-college variation in student quality has increased while the withincollege variation in student quality has decreased. The expansion and strati-fication of American higher education system encouraged finer differentiation among college graduates instead of the dichotomy of college graduates versus noncollege graduates. As a result, institutional quality has been brought into the discussion of educational attainment.\nDuring the same period, knowledge growth and technological innovation have made college education increasingly inadequate for many occupations. Indeed, Paul Kingston and James Clawson (1986) suggested that graduate education provided a fast track to the most powerful and prestigious positions in the occupational distribution. According to the General Social Survey conducted in 1989, the vast majority of the top-ranked occupations require graduate or professional degrees (Bowen & Bok, 1998) . There might also be a credentialing aspect to this increasing importance of graduate education. As college education became quite a universal phenomenon, many individuals sought to distinguish themselves from others through graduate education.\nThis study focuses on the nexus between these two dimensions of stratification and differentiation. Specifically, I examine the effect of college quality, among other academic and nonacademic factors, on educational continuation for college graduates. Results of this study add two important points to the ongoing debate of the role of high-quality college education. First, by examining the effect of college quality on graduate education, I extend the study of the effect of college quality beyond the area of earnings differences, adding considerably to the overall effect of college quality on students' outcomes. Second, by explicating the relationship among socioeconomic factors, college quality, and graduate education, I am able to examine the role of college quality and graduate education in the broad context of social stratification."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Whereas college quality appeared to have profound effects on some student outcomes, graduates' earnings have long been the particular interest of the research community in the financing of higher education and in labor economics. Many researchers, in one way or another, have made the case that college quality was an element in the formation of human capital and thus had an important effect on earnings. In the simplest Mincerian frame (1962, 1974) , the return of education is estimated by lnW = \u00df 0 + \u00df 1 X + \u00df 2 EDUC + e, where lnW is the logarithm of earnings or hourly wage rate, X is a set of individual characteristics typically including race, gender, and family background variables, and EDUC is the quantity of education, usually measured in years of schooling. In this framework, \u00df 2 is the return of one additional year of education. More recent research has suggested that quantity alone is not sufficient to capture the return of education (e.g., Behrman & Birdsall, 1983) ; other dimensions of education such as quality of education have been incorporated into the equation.\nBurton Weisbrod and Peter Karpoff (1968) , Ritchie Reed and Herman Miller (1970) , Lewis Solmon (1973 , and David Wise (1975) were among the first to explore the effect of college quality on graduates' earnings. Recent studies by Dominic Brewer and his colleagues (Brewer & Ehrenberg, 1996; Brewer, Eide, & Ehrenberg, 1999; Eide, Brewer, & Ehrenberg, 1998) and Scott Thomas and his colleagues (Thomas, 2000 (Thomas, , 2003 Thomas & Zhang, 2001 have significantly improved our understanding of the economic effect of college quality. The bulk of this line of research has shown that college quality has a positive and significant effect on graduates' earnings, on average (e.g., Solman & Wachtel, 1975; Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991; Mueller, 1988; Thomas, 2000 Thomas, , 2003 . The strength of such a focus is partially due to the popular (mis)perception that greater economic rewards are the single most important outcome of college education and partially due to the fact that employment and wage data are readily available in many national databases of college graduates. Exclusive focus on the economic outcomes of college education neglects a host of other outcomes, however. In this paper, I extend the study of the effects of college quality beyond the area of earnings differences. Specifically, I consider the effects of college quality on graduate education.\nGraduate education is valuable both individually and socially. From the individual viewpoint, graduate education is an integral stage of human capital accumulation. Usually it is a prerequisite to many desirable and prestigious professions with great economic rewards and high social status (e.g., physician, professor, lawyer, and scientist). And especially since the 1970s, the earnings of highly successful professionals have increased sharply, attracting more and more college graduates into graduate and professional schools (Bok, 1993) . Certainly, many individuals pursue graduate education yet for another reason: These individuals have deep interest in a particular subject matter and consider graduate education as a consumption good. Thus, they may consider obtaining an advanced degree to be a personal triumph. Furthermore, society also has a large stake in graduate and professional education. Graduate and professional schools are critical links in the chain of institutions that transmit and codify the most complex information in modern societies (Bourdieu, 1977 (Bourdieu, , 1984 . As the amount of knowledge increases, each individual can know only a decreasing fraction of what is available to be known (Metzger, 1987) . As a result, society becomes more and more dependent upon professionals.\nGiven the increasing importance of graduate education, I would speculate that students would consider the enhanced opportunity represented by graduate education, in addition to direct monetary concerns, as a major element in choosing a college to attend or a major field of study. For example, previous research suggests that many students choose their major fields never intending to terminate their education with an undergraduate degree, but rather intending to enroll in professional or academic graduate programs (Eide & Waehrer, 1998) . Similarly, because further education is an option with great value, students may choose to attend colleges that provide greater possibilities for advancing to the graduate level. In fact, Thomas (2000) suggests that terminal baccalaureate graduates of more prestigious colleges may be viewed as \"damaged goods\" and hence may not receive the economic returns one might expect. These results suggest the importance of including the effect of college quality and various factors on graduate education in analyzing the effect of college quality on students.\nA few studies have examined the effect of college quality on graduate education. Vincent Tinto (1980 ), John Smart (1986 , and Corinna Ethington and John Smart (1986) have shown that college quality has a small though statistically significant effect on graduate school enrollment. Further, James Henson (1980) and Dwight Lang (1987) suggest that graduating from highquality undergraduate colleges increases the probability of attending highquality graduate schools. Recently, Eric Eide, Dominic Brewer, and Ronald Ehrenberg (1998) , using National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) and High School and Beyond (HSB) databases, found that attendance at an elite private college significantly increased the probability of attending graduate school and, more specifically, graduate school at a major research institution.\nThis study differs from earlier ones in a number of ways. First, I used a national representative sample of recent college graduates; thus, results from this analysis are more generalizable and current. Second, I examine not only graduate program enrollment but also graduate degree attainment whenever the data permit such an analysis. Most importantly, I explore the relationship among socioeconomic factors, college quality, and graduate education, thus enabling me to put the current analysis in the broad context of social stratification and, in the process, understand the role of highquality college education in society.\nIn this analysis, I first examine the extent to which college quality affects college graduates' enrollment in graduate programs within four to five years after college graduation.\n2 Second, by differentiating between master's and doctoral programs, I study the effect of college quality on the levels of graduate programs in which students enrolled. Third, I consider the extent to which college quality may have affected the quality of graduate schools in which students enrolled. I also examine the same questions for the graduate degree attainment. For example, what is the effect of college quality on graduate degree attainment within four to five years after receiving the bac-2 Admittedly, because some professional degrees such as the MBA, typically require three to five years of working experience, four to five years after receipt of the baccalaureate may not be long enough to observe the complete enrollment pattern.\ncalaureate? Does college quality affect the level of the graduate program in which the student enrolls and the quality of the graduate school? Finally, I describe how to integrate the results of this analysis into the conventional research on the effect of college quality on earnings."}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Data Set", "text": "My analysis draws data from two levels: the individual level and the institutional level. The individual-level data come from the 1997 second follow-up of the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) study. The B&B is a national longitudinal study designed to provide information concerning education and work experiences after completion of the bachelor's degree. It provides cross-sectional information one year after completion of the bachelor's degree and longitudinal data concerning entry into and progress through graduate-level education and the workforce. I use the restricted B&B: 93/97 data set to allow identification of the connection of students and institutions. 3 The second follow-up survey includes more than 10,000 baccalaureate recipients who completed their degrees between July 1992 and June 1993. Because the B&B data set oversampled students intending careers in public service occupations and particularly those intending careers in teaching, I used sampling weights to obtain unbiased estimates. As a result, all analyses reported in this paper have been weighted appropriately and are normalized on the final sample. Because I used a multistage cluster sample, there may exist homogeneity within clusters (colleges in this case) that results in underestimating the standard errors if this multistage clustering were ignored. Scott Thomas and Ronald Heck (2001) suggested using the design effect to adjust the estimated standard errors or multilevel modeling to capture the multistage clustering.\nSchool-level data come from two sources. I extracted the first variable (types of institutional control-whether public or private) from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System 1992-93 (IPEDS). To derive data about college selectivity, I used various editions of Barron's Profiles of American Colleges. Barron's rating categorizes institutions into six selectivity groups (with ratings from 0 to 5) on the basis of entering students' class rank, high school grade point average, average SAT scores, and the percentage of applicants admitted (Fox, 1993) ."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The restricted B&B: 93/97 data is obtained through the restricted data license at the University of Arizona authorized by the National Center for Education Statistics. For more information about the B&B study, see http://www.nces.ed.gov."}, {"section_title": "Sample and Variables", "text": "The sample of students for this analysis is limited to those who (a) were in BB: 93/97 (N = 11,192) , (b) did not receive a bachelor's degree before 1992 or 1993 (N = 9,438), (c) had valid data on graduate enrollment and degree attainment (N = 9,410), and (d) had school-level data available (N = 8,610) . A detailed distribution of their graduate enrollment and degree attainment is presented in Table 1 Several dependent variables are of interest in this analysis. The first is graduate enrollment, indicating whether one has been involved in any type of graduate enrollment, including master's and doctoral programs: GRDENR = 1 if ever enrolled in a graduate program, GRDENR = 0 otherwise. A second outcome variable used in this analysis identifies those baccalaureate graduates who have enrolled in a doctoral program: PHDENR = 1 if enrolled in a doctoral program, PHDENR = 0 if enrolled in a master's program. A third variable captures the Carnegie Classification of the institution in which a student enrolled for graduate study: CCENR = 0 if enrolled in comprehensive universities, CCENR = 1 if enrolled in doctoral universities, and CCENR = 2 if enrolled in research universities. In this analysis, I do not differentiate between Type I and Type II institutions in each Carnegie category.\nTwo other variables describe students' completion of graduate degrees in 1997. One variable indicates whether a student has obtained a graduate degree by 1997 (GRDDGR = 1 if attained graduate degree, GRDDGR = 0 otherwise). Unlike in the analysis of graduate enrollment, I do not attempt to differentiate between master's degrees and doctoral degrees because of the small number of doctorates awarded. The final outcome variable used in this analysis captures the Carnegie Classification of the institution conferring the advanced degree: CCDGR = 0 if received degree from comprehensive universities, CCDGR = 1 if received degree from doctoral universities, and CCDGR = 2 if received degree from research universities.\nIndependent variables include college quality, demographic characteristics, family backgrounds, and academic variables. In this analysis, I follow the conventional approach by collapsing six selectivity categories into three based on a rating of most competitive or highly competitive (institutions with a Barron's rating of 5 or 4), very competitive or competitive (with a Barron's rating of 3 or 2), and less competitive or noncompetitive (with a Barron's rating of 1 or 0).\nBecause public perceptions of public and private institutions are quite different, I further distinguish between privately and publicly controlled institutions in each group, yielding six college types: high-quality privates, high-quality publics, middle-quality privates, middle-quality publics, lowquality privates, and low-quality publics. Besides this set of college quality variables, I also include a dummy to indicate historically black colleges and universities (HBCU).\nDemographic variables capture aspects of gender (a category dummy indicating whether the student is female), race/ethnicity (category dummies indicating Native American, Asian, Black, and Hispanic with the omitted group being White), and age (in years . In all subsequent analyses, education majors are treated as the reference group. The rationale for including these variables is discussed in Thomas (2000 Thomas ( , 2003 and Zhang (2001, 2002) . A detailed description of these variables is provided in Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "The method employed in this analysis is straightforward binomial logit and multinomial logit (three discrete outcomes) models. Specifically, for binomial choices (graduate enrollment or not, master's program or doctoral program, and graduate degree or not), I used binomial logit models; and for multinomial outcomes (comprehensive, doctoral, or research institutions), I employed multinomial logit models. I do not attempt to model the potential nested structure among these choices. For example, it could be the case that students first decide to enroll in a graduate program and then decide which program or which school to attend, resulting in nested discrete choice structures. Although statistical tools dealing with these nested choice structures are readily available, I do not intend to use them because these nested structures are not all that clear. Similarly, one may argue that some of the choices could be inherently ordered; I likewise ignore the potential ordered structure of these choices due to the same ambiguity. Finally, these models suffer from potential selection bias. As a partial remedy, I control for the selection bias by including various demographic and family background variables in these discrete choice models.\nThe estimated logit coefficients show how graduating from undergraduate colleges of varying quality affect the log odds of various choice variables. For the convenience of interpretation, I report only the marginal effects."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Graduate Program Enrollment", "text": "I first estimate a logit model of the impact of college quality on the probability of graduate program enrollment with the dependent variable GRDENR. The marginal effects from this analysis are reported in from low-quality public colleges, baccalaureate recipients from high-quality colleges are about 16% (private) and 18% (public) more likely to enroll in some kind of graduate program within four to five years after receiving the baccalaureate. Students from middle-quality institutions also enjoy about 10% advantage in their attendance at graduate school over low-quality institutions. In terms of graduate school attendance, institutional control (whether private or public) apparently has little effect. This pattern is very much like the pattern for the effect of college quality on earnings as reported as previous studies (Thomas, 2000 (Thomas, , 2003 Thomas and Zhang, 2001 ). The probability of attending graduate school also varies by undergraduate major. Business graduates are least likely to attend graduate school among all major areas. Compared with education graduates, business graduates are 22% less likely to attend graduate schools, perhaps because of the high opportunity costs associated with graduate school for business majors. Another possibility is that substantial work experience is usually required to enter business graduate programs. In contrast, students from the relatively low-paid majors (education, bio-science, math science, social science, history, and psychology) are most likely to attend graduate school, perhaps because of low opportunity costs compared to business majors. This finding is consistent with the notion of option value in college major choice (Eide & Waehrer, 1998) . Majoring in relatively low-paid fields is associated with a greater opportunity to obtain further education and the rewards accompanying a higher level of education.\nResults of the effect of other variables are consistent with findings from previous research in this area. For example, academic performance is a strong predictor of graduate school attendance. On average, one unit increase in undergraduate GPA is associated with almost a 22% increase in the likelihood of enrolling in a graduate program. On average, women graduates are less likely to attend graduate school. It seems that although women have closed the gender gap in terms of college education (for example, women account for 54.67% of the final sample in this study), they still lag behind their male counterparts in terms of graduate education. This study also disguises another dimension of the gender gap, which may be exacerbated by gender segregation in graduate education, with women being increasingly concentrated in \"female\" fields such as education, English, psychology, and anthropology. However, Maria Charles and Karen Bradley (2002) show that the educational level achieved by women students has little correlation with the gender segregation of fields.\nFurther, the analysis shows that the probability of graduate school attendance is a convex function of age. Considering that salary is a concave function of age, this result is understandable because higher opportunity cost is associated with lower probability of graduate school attendance.\nAnd finally, higher family income is associated with a higher probability of graduate school attendance; and being a first-generation college gradu- ate is associated with a lower probability of graduate school attendance, although the estimated effect is rather small. For example, a $10,000 increase of family income is associated only with a 0.37% increase in the likelihood of enrolling in a graduate program, and being a first-generation college graduate is associated with a 2.8% decrease in the likelihood of enrolling in a graduate program. Previous research (e.g., Mare, 1980) indicates that, although the probability of enrolling in a graduate school is affected by socioeconomic factors, its conditional probability (given that one has completed college) is not substantially affected by one's socioeconomic status. This effect could be due to the decreased financial dependence of college graduates on their parents (Berenson, 1990) and/or the attenuation of the link between parental socioeconomic status and educational continuation aspiration through college education (Stolzenberg, 1994) ."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment in a Master's or Doctoral Program", "text": "In the next step, I sampled those students who actually enrolled in graduate programs within four to five years after college graduation and estimated the effect of college quality on their choice of degree program. In effect, I estimate the impact of college quality on the probability of enrolling in a doctoral program relative to enrolling in a master's program. Table 4 reports the marginal effects from the binomial logit model with the dependent variable PHDENR. The prediction of this binomial model is quite good; overall, it correctly predicts 89% of the binomial choice classifications. College quality, except for those graduating from high-quality public institutions, does not seem to have a significant effect on the probability of enrolling in doctoral programs. Students from high-quality public colleges are more likely to enroll in doctoral programs relative to students from low-quality publics; nonetheless, the effect is small. Undergraduate majors, on the other hand, have a strong effect on the probability of enrolling in a doctoral program. In the final sample, none of the students from public affairs majors attended doctoral programs, so I dropped this dummy from the regression. Not only are business majors less likely to attend graduate school, but they are also less likely to enroll in doctoral programs. Bioscience, math/science, social science, humanities, and psychology majors are among those who are most likely to enroll in doctoral programs. Opportunity costs could serve as a reasonable explanation for different probabilities of attending doctoral programs among these fields of major. Another possible explanation is that master's degrees are often regarded as the terminal degree for some fields such as business while in other fields, such as social sciences, a large proportion of students enroll in doctoral programs. In fact, certain social programs such as economics rarely accept applicants who intend only to get a master's degree. Admittedly, the variation in the Other variables also impact enrollment in doctoral programs. Better academic performance increases the probability of attending doctoral programs. Surprisingly, family income has a negative impact on the probability of attending doctoral programs. It could be the case that students from highincome families are more likely to enroll in professional degrees, such as business and law. It could also be the case that doctoral programs are relatively inexpensive because of various financial aids such as fellowships, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships. Being a first-generation college graduate not only lowers the probability of enrolling in graduate programs, as Table 3 shows, but also lowers the probability of enrolling in doctoral programs for those going on to graduate school. The effect of age on enrollment in doctoral programs is similar to its effect on enrollment in graduate programs generally; that is, the probability of enrolling in a doctoral program is a convex function of age. Again, opportunity costs could be the explanation."}, {"section_title": "Quality of the Chosen Graduate School", "text": "In dealing with the sample of students who actually enrolled in graduate programs, I also analyze the effect of undergraduate college quality on the probability of attending different types of graduate institutions. In effect, I examine the extent to which undergraduate college quality affects the quality of graduate schools. As is true for the quality of undergraduate colleges, the quality of graduate schools is also difficult to measure. I use the Carnegie Classification, which emphasizes graduate programs (doctoral programs and federal research funds) more than undergraduate programs, to characterize the quality of graduate schools.\nI estimate a multinomial logit model with three outcomes: attendance at comprehensive, doctoral, and research institutions. The marginal effects are reported in Table 5 . Undergraduate college quality appears to have dominating effects in determining graduate school destination. For example, on average, students from high-quality undergraduate institutions, relative to those from low-quality undergraduate colleges, are about 40% less likely to enroll in comprehensive universities and more than 50% more likely to enroll in research universities. Students from middle-quality colleges are more than (Table 5 Continued) 10% less likely to enroll in comprehensive universities and about 20% more likely to enroll in research universities compared to those from low-quality undergraduate colleges. Again, institutional control of undergraduate colleges does not seem to affect the destination of graduates pursuing advanced degrees. Graduate school destinations also vary across academic majors. Compared with education majors, students from the fields of engineering, bioscience, and math/science are more likely to enroll in research universities. Given that some of those programs are the most expensive graduate programs and thus are disproportionately hosted in research universities, this finding is not a surprise. Academic performance is positively associated with the probability of attending research universities. This finding could be a result of higher admission standards in research universities.\nFamily income does not seem to impact graduate school destination, while being a first-generation college graduate significantly decreases the probability of attending research universities. Compared with their counterparts, first-generation college graduates are less well paid in the labor market (Thomas & Zhang, 2001 ) and less likely to enroll in graduate programs. Even when they actually attend graduate programs, they are less likely to enroll in doctoral programs and to attend research universities. Being female and/or Black also reduces the probability of attending a research university. It seems that women graduates are not only less likely to enroll in a graduate program but also lag behind their male counterparts in attending good quality programs."}, {"section_title": "Graduate Degree Attainment", "text": "Having examined the effect of college quality on graduate enrollment, I further examine the effect of college quality on graduate-degree completion within four to five years after college graduation. However, in my sample, fewer than half of college graduates who ever enrolled in graduate programs completed their study within that time period. Obviously, the information on graduate-degree attainment is right censored. To avoid complicating the model overmuch, I examine only the effect of college quality on the probability of obtaining a graduate degree within four or five years after graduation. My analysis shows that, for those who enrolled in doctoral programs, fewer than one in 10 obtained a doctorate. I estimate a logit model of the impact of college quality on the probability of graduate degree completion with the dependent variable GRDDGR. The marginal effects are reported in Table 6 . Because the dependent variable is not conditioned on graduate school enrollment, the estimated effect represents the overall effect of college quality on graduate degree attainment. Table 6 is analogous to Table 3 ; the only difference is that the dependent variables in Table 6 are graduate-degree attainment instead of graduate enrollment. The qualitative results are also very similar. For example, college quality has a significant effect on graduate-degree attainment. Relative to graduates from low-quality public colleges, graduates from high-quality private and public colleges are about 7% more likely to receive graduate degrees within four to five years after graduation. Business majors are the least likely to attend graduate school (Table 3 ) and therefore least likely receive graduate degrees, probably because workforce experience is usually required for graduate-level business-related programs.\nResults of the effect of other variables are also similar to those in Table 3 . For example, academic performance is a strong predictor of earning a graduate degree within four or five years after college graduation. On average, one unit increase in GPA is associated with a 10% increase in the probability of receiving a graduate degree. On average, women graduates are less likely and graduates of minority groups are more likely to complete graduate study within four to five years of college graduation. Higher family income increases the probability of completing graduate study and being a first-generation college graduate lowers it. Once more, the effect of these socioeconomic factors on degree attainment is not substantial."}, {"section_title": "Quality of the Graduate School Conferring the Degree", "text": "Finally, for those students who actually received a graduate degree, I analyze the effect of college quality on the probability of receiving graduate degrees from different types of institutions. I again estimate a multinomial logit model with three outcomes: attendance at comprehensive, doctoral, and research institutions. The marginal effects are reported in Table 7 . The model predicts 59% of the trinomial choices correctly. Table 7 is analogous  to Table 5 , the only difference being that in Table 7 the dependent variable is the Carnegie Classification of the graduate school conferring the degree while in Table 5 the dependent variable is the Carnegie Classification of the graduate school in which a graduate enrolled. The results in Table 7 are also very similar to those found in Table 5 . For example, undergraduate college quality has a large effect on the type of institution conferring the degree. On average, students from high-quality undergraduate institutions, relative to those from low-quality public colleges, are about 40% more likely to earn graduate degrees from research universities. The effects of other variables such as demographic characteristics, family background, and major fields of study are also similar to those in Table 5 ."}, {"section_title": "Economic Effect of Graduate Education", "text": "The above analysis shows that graduating from high-quality undergraduate institutions increases the probability of attending graduate school and, more specifically, increases the probability of enrolling in doctoral programs and at research universities. These positive effects add substantially to the economic effect of undergraduate college quality when graduate education is viewed as an integral part of human capital accumulation. A very natural extension of the above analysis is to examine the subsequent economic effect of graduate education, taking into account the effect of college education on graduate education. If graduate education has a positive effect on earnings, then comparing the earnings differences among terminal baccalaureate holders would most likely understate the economic effect of college quality because part of the economic effect of college quality is realized through graduate education. From the human capital perspective, graduate education further enhances one's human capital, thus leading to additional economic benefits.\nPrevious studies have not examined this issue adequately. Some studies have limited the sample of students only to those with a baccalaureate degree (e.g., Thomas, 2000 Thomas, , 2003 . These studies have failed to consider the extent to which institutional quality affects graduate education, which in turn may affect subsequent earnings. Other studies have included the effects of graduate education on earnings (e.g., Brewer & Ehrenberg, 1996; Brewer, Eide, & Ehrenberg, 1999) ; however, they have treated final undergraduate and graduate degree status as independent of college quality. We need to consider the effects of attending a high-quality undergraduate col- (Table 7 Continued) lege on graduate education and the effect of graduate education on subsequent labor market outcomes simultaneously to better understand the full impact of education on earnings and labor market outcomes. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, I am not able to address this issue in this analysis. Because most individuals with graduate education have been in the workforce for a very short time before the second follow-up of B&B, comparing their earnings with those of terminal baccalaureate recipients, who have four to five years of working experience, probably underestimates the effect of graduate education. I explored this issue in a separate analysis. Basically, I used a sample of terminal baccalaureate recipients who were working full time in April 1997 and added another sample of individuals who had completed their graduate education and were in the labor market in April 1997. I then set up a structural model to estimate both the effect of college quality on graduate education and the effect of graduate education on earnings. As expected, the analysis did not reveal a positive effect of graduate education on earnings. If anything, the effect was negative. Because most students who enrolled in graduate program had not graduated before the second follow-up of the B&B survey and for those who had completed their graduate education, the time was not long enough to expose the effect of graduate education fully, it will be more meaningful to address this issue when more waves of B&B data are available.\nAs another limitation, if individuals with baccalaureate degrees and advanced degrees have different earnings trajectories over their career, focusing on the very early stage of career could be misleading. A related but unexplored possibility is that graduate education might not have positive effect on earnings but have a positive effect on occupational status."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION", "text": "In this paper, I extended studies on the effect of college quality to include its effect on graduate education. Generally speaking, graduates from highquality colleges were more likely to enroll in graduate programs; among those who actually enrolled in graduate programs, graduates from highquality colleges were more likely to enroll in doctoral programs and in research universities. Similarly, graduates from high-quality colleges were more likely to finish their graduate degree within four to five years of college graduation; among the graduates who had actually obtained their graduate degree within four to five years, those from high-quality colleges were more likely to have received their degrees from research universities. It seems, then, that undergraduate college quality increased the probability of enrolling in graduate programs and helped determine the quality of graduate schools selected.\nIn a recent study, William Bowen and Derek Bok (1998) studied graduate-degree attainment for college graduates from a group of 28 selective institutions in the College and Beyond data set. 4 Interestingly, even within this set of selective institutions, institutional selectivity plays a significant role in predicting graduate degree attainment. Further, in examining graduate degree attainment at top-rated professional schools, they found that 26% of the Black law school graduates and 18% of the White law school graduates from these 28 institutions received graduate degrees from one of the eight most highly ranked law schools. Similarly, a very large proportion of college graduates from these institutions received degrees from the most highly ranked medicine and business schools (p. 102). It appears that the empirical result from my study-i.e., the significant and positive effect of college quality on graduate education-still holds when different measures of quality of undergraduate colleges and graduate schools are used.\nHigher education researchers have noticed this \"chain\" effect in educational outcomes. For example, in studying college graduation rates, Cliff Adelman (1999) discovered that the most significant predictor of the probability of college graduation was not college quality but the \"academic resources\" (this measure was dominated by the intensity and quality of secondary school curriculum) which the student brought forward from secondary school into higher education. Bringing all these results together, the pattern becomes clear: Students are not randomly rearranged after graduating from each educational level. The quality of institutions at the previous level helps determine the quality of institutions chosen at the following levels and also influences the educational outcomes of the following levels. I also examined different patterns of graduate enrollment and degree attainment among different majors. Quite contrary to the findings in the earnings equation, students from low-paid majors were more likely to attend graduate schools and attain graduate degrees. In studying college major choice, Eric Eide and Geetha Warhrer (1998) operationalized the idea of the \"financial option return\" to education. They argued that the benefit from college education was separate from the standard income gain expected from investing in a college education; it also involved the opportunity to obtain further education and, hence, the rewards accompanying such further education. The extra utility gained from such opportunity was operationalized as the option value of a college education. This framework provided motivation for students to choose undergraduate majors that yielded relatively low economic return in the labor market.\nThe concept of option value is also applicable to college choice. Highquality colleges not only yield immediate economic benefits but also provide the option value of continuing one's education and attending a better graduate school. Although the reason college quality affects graduate school quality so strongly is not entirely clear, families and students who are serious about their academic career need to ponder this evidence when making college choices.\nAnalyses in this study extended those in the previous research on the economic effect of college quality. First, graduating from high-quality undergraduate colleges was shown to increase the probability of graduate school enrollment and degree attainment; and more importantly, it had a large and significant impact on the quality of graduate school attended. Considered as a nonmonetary outcome, graduate education added significantly to the total effect of college quality. Second, graduate education was an integral part of human capital accumulation and a necessary step toward some desirable professions. In this sense, option values accrued to college quality by increasing the probability of graduate education; this latter factor yielded a further earnings premium. Thus, considered as an economic outcome, graduate education enhanced the effect of college quality on earnings.\nThe results regarding the effect of socioeconomic factors generally support the critical view of American education system. Socioeconomic factors such as family income and parental education continue to influence enrollment in graduate school and also to influence the type of graduate school selected. Even though the effect of family income is small, with other factors being equal, it usually has a positive effect on graduate education. Perhaps family income is not a good measure of family wealth. Or perhaps because graduate studies usually provide various financial support, college graduates are less financially dependent upon their parents. And finally, the smallness of this effect could be due to the attenuation of the link between parental socioeconomic status and educational continuation aspiration through college education. Being a first-generation college graduate lowers the probability of attending graduate school; more importantly, it lowers the probability of enrolling in doctoral programs and/or research universities.\nCertainly, the above effect represents only the direct effect of socioeconomic factors on graduate education. Ceteris paribus, students from wealthier and better-educated families have advantages in obtaining graduate education. Nonetheless, other factors are not equal. Previous research has shown that students from wealthier and better-educated families generally have higher test scores and are more likely to obtain degrees from highquality colleges (e.g., Cabrera & La Nasa, 2001; Zhang, 2003) . In other words, some socioeconomic factors have been crystallized in the student's intellec-tual ability and educational credentials. This indirect effect, through the tight connection between socioeconomic factors and educational attainment, is also substantial. Indeed, Pedro Carneiro and James Heckman (2002) found that ability, instead of family income per se, was the major determinant of the relationship between family income and degree attainment. It appears that socioeconomic factors such as family income and parental education exert great indirect effects on graduate education through their impact on individuals' intellectual ability and educational credentials.\nIn conclusion, this analysis explored the nexus between college quality and graduate education within the broad context of postsecondary access and opportunities. In particular, I looked at the interactions between socioeconomic and academic factors. The findings suggest that socioeconomic factors and academic factors are not separate; they work in tandem. The academically and socioeconomically \"rich\" become richer while the academically and socioeconomically \"poor\" become poorer despite the massive expansion of higher education in the United States. As more longitudinal data resources become available, future longitudinal studies will be able to examine these interactions over the span of life."}]
