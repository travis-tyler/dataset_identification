In 1991 it was \u00aerst demonstrated that the PSA molecule exists in different measurable isoforms in the systemic circulation. 1, 2 Following this discovery, it was revealed that the freeatotal PSA ratio was signi\u00ae-cantly lower among men with prostate cancer compared to men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 2, 3 Indeed, measuring the freeatotal PSA ratio (usually expressed as a percent) can be used to help discriminate between cancer or BPH in patients with total PSA levels in the 4.0\u00b110.0 ngamL range. 4, 5 The focus of attention is now directed at trying to characterize the clinical usefulness and laboratory analysis of this re\u00aenement in PSA testing.\nDespite the enhancement in speci\u00aecity gained from this new method, one factor that is not clearly de\u00aened relates to the amount of biological variation, or\u00afuctuations due to natural physiological mechanisms, of the free PSA analyte on a day-to-day basis. In a recent study in which serial PSA samples were obtained among nine urological patients, Nixon et al 6 reported that the biological variation of free, total, and percent freeatotal PSA levels was 13.0% CV, 5.6% CV, and 8.0% CV, respectively. This group concluded that random biological changes of free PSA and total PSA levels could lead to signi\u00aecant day-to-day\u00afuctuations in the percent freeatotal PSA calculation.\nIn addition, using the same specimens from the current study, we also reported that the average within-individual biological variation of total PSA was log-normally distributed with a median percent coef\u00aecient of variation (% CV) of 7.3% and a 95th percentile value of 19.2%. 7 Both of these studies provide insight that the concentration of PSA molecules in the systemic circulation have a tendency to\u00afuctuate among certain individuals due to natural physiological mechanisms.\nIn this study we sought to characterize how such biological changes in the numerator andaor denominator would affect the clinical utility of the percent freeatotal PSA ratio. Furthermore, Pearson et al 8 recently examined the utility of long-term serial measurement of free and total PSA levels among men followed on a yearly basis in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. This group demonstrated that the percent freeatotal PSA was signi\u00ae-cantly different between men with and without prostate cancer several years prior to clinical diagnosis. In this regard, we were also interested in quantifying the shortterm stability of PSA levels to gauge how such changes might bias long-term longitudinal analysis."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patient selection", "text": "Twenty four men from the Urology Clinic at the Seattle V.A.

According to accepted diagnostic algorithms, patients were biopsied if serum PSA levels were greater than or equal to 4.0 ngamL or if an abnormality on digital rectal examination (DRE) was found.

We eliminated the between-run analytical variation by running assays in the same run at the end of the study once all blood samples were collected. To minimize the within-run analytical variation we tested all samples in duplicate, and the mean of the two measurements was utilized in all subsequent calculations. The within-individual biological variation, expressed in terms of the percent coef\u00aecient of variation (% CV), was calculated from the ten averaged measurements for each of the 24 men using the formula: % CV (standard deviation \u00c4 mean)\u00c2100.\nTests for Gaussian normal distribution were performed using the w 2 tests and the Lilliefors adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Statistica for the Macintosh, StatSoft, Tulsa, OK).

The analytical variation for the percent freeatotal PSA ratio was determined by utilizing a Monte Carlo Simulation (Statistical Analysis Software, Cary, NC). In this simulation 1000 random combinations were run in which the numerator and denominator had a 5% CV.

In this equation 1.96 was the two-tailed Z-statistic for a 95% probability, and \u00c2 p 2 was a constant indicating that two serial measurements will be used for comparison. 13 Since the CV t values followed a log-normal distribution, the critical difference values also followed a log-normal distribution. To display this, we listed the results for the upper percentiles from the estimated distribution of the patients studied (see Table 3 )."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of variance", "text": "The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for statistically signi\u00aecant difference in biological variation between the three diagnostic groups (cancer, BPH, and normal).\nResults Table 1 provides a pro\u00aele of the patients entered in this study. This cohort of patients ranged in age from 67\u00b183 y of age, and there was no signi\u00aecant difference between the ages of the three clinical groups (P b 0.05). The total PSA range was 1.2 ngamL\u00b122.8 ngamL, yet the majority of patients (n 21) had PSA levels in the 2.0\u00b110.0 ngamL range. As can be seen in the table, the patients with cancer had a higher mean total PSA and lower mean percent freeatotal PSA, as would be expected.\nThere was no signi\u00aecant change in free, total, or percent freeatotal PSA levels observed among patients who reported ejaculation or vigorous exercise with the exception of one patient. This man was an 81 y old normal patient and had a mean total PSA of 11.40 ngamL following days with exercise and 10.08 ngamL following days without (P 0.046). There was no statistically signi\u00aecant difference in the free or percent freeatotal PSA related to exercise in this patient (P 0.151 for free PSA, P 0.709 for % FaT PSA). Three men exercised 9 of the 12 d, and 7 men exercised 5 d or less with no statistically signi\u00aecant changes in serum free or total PSA levels. Five subjects reported ejaculating two times over the 12 d, and again, there was no associated change in daily PSA levels. Procedures or activities that could lead to perturbation of the prostate were discouraged and closely monitored per patient report. The average time between biopsy and the initiation of this study was approximately 22 months. There was no signi\u00aecant difference between the mean biological variation for total PSA, free PSA, and percent freeatotal PSA among patients who underwent biopsy compared to those patients who did not. The in\u00afuence of disease state was also not statistically different (P 0.4) for the % CV of the biological variation between the three diagnostic categories (cancer, BPH, and normal). Twotailed t-tests with an alpha level of 0.05 were used for tests of statistical signi\u00aecance.\nThe individual results and distribution for free PSA, total PSA, and percent freeatotal PSA among all 24 patients are shown in Figure 1 . These results indicated that the distribution of % CV of biological variation were skewed to the right. The distributions of the results for free PSA and percent freeatotal PSA were not inconsistent with a normal distribution, however, both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Q 2 analysis indicated a slightly better \u00aet to a log-normal distribution. The distribution of % CV of biological variation of total PSA was not Gaussian (P`0.01 by Q 2 and Lilliefors tests) but followed a lognormal distribution as has previously been shown. 7 Therefore, all the following data analyses are calculated based on log-normal distribution of all three PSA parameters. Table 2 lists the mean results for biological, analytical, and total variation for each of the three PSA parameters. The mean biological variation of free PSA was signi\u00ae-cantly greater than that of total PSA (12.0% compared to 7.3%, P 0.02). By de\u00aenition the two measurements are dependent variables in that the free PSA is a measurable component of the total PSA. Fluctuations in free PSA should lead to directly associated changes in the amount of the total PSA. By plotting the change in the percent freeatotal PSA we were able to observe how the two forms of PSA correlated. Figure 2 shows the\u00afuctuations of the percent freeatotal PSA measurements over the ten consecutive weekdays for patients from each of the three diagnostic groups. The mean % CV of biological variation for the percent freeatotal PSA was 8.8%, and was not signi\u00aecantly different than the biological variation of total PSA (P 0.65).\nConsidering the log-normal distribution among this sample population, we also calculated the 90th, 95th, 99th percentile distribution values for % CV of biological variation. For the percent freeatotal PSA the 90th percentile value was 19.3% CV, the 95th percentile value was 22.3% CV, and the 99th percentile value was 29.8% CV. Table 3 lists the percentile values derived from the distribution of within-individual biological variation.\nThe critical difference in PSA measurements was de\u00aened as the minimum percent increase between two successive PSA measurements that would indicate that the change was greater than what might be expected of non-pathological biological and analytical variation. 13 The distribution of the critical differences are also shown in Table 3 . Note that the table shows that an increase or decrease of 31.0% between two percent freeatotal PSA measurements would be a signi\u00aecant change for 50% of patients. It would take a change of 64.8% to be con\u00aedent that the increase was statistically signi\u00aecant for 95% of the patients."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Prostate-speci\u00aec antigen (PSA) is a useful tumor marker for the early diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Although not a perfect marker, the antigen is essentially speci\u00aec to the gland and can be used to detect signi\u00aecant disease. One problem with PSA testing relates to the low speci\u00aecity of cancer detection among men in the 4.0\u00b1 10.0 ngamL range with normal digital rectal examinations. Reports indicate that nearly 60\u00b175% of such men who undergo needle biopsy will not have cancer. 14\u00b116 This has led to a search for a method to improve the diagnostic accuracy of PSA testing in order to reduce the number of negative biopsies while ensuring that early disease is still effectively detected.\nSeveral clinical studies have shown that the fraction of free PSA to total PSA is decreased in patients with prostate cancer compared to those with no histological evidence of malignancy. 2\u00b15 Luderer et al 4 evaluated this new method among patients with total PSA values between 4.0\u00b110.0 ngamL. Utilizing a percent freeatotal PSA cutoff of 25% or less, these investigators determined that 31% of negative prostate biopsies could have been prevented while correctly identifying all of the patients with cancer. Likewise, in a study of 113 men who had a PSA ranging from 4.1\u00b110.0 ngamL with enlarged, nonsuspicious prostate glands, Catalona et al determined that utilizing a percent freeatotal PSA cutoff of 23% or lower would have prevented 31% of negative biopsies while still detecting 90% of all cancers. 5 Indeed, a number of subsequent studies have supported these \u00aendings and report that the percent freeatotal PSA will be able to prevent approximately 20\u00b130% of negative biopsies (improved speci\u00aecity) while maintaining a 90\u00b195% sensitivity of cancer detection."}, {"section_title": "17\u00b119", "text": "There are several questions to be answered concerning how clinicians will be able to use the measurement of free and total PSA levels. Recent investigations have focused on determining the most appropriate cutoff points, and ultimately, determining the number of cancers clinicians are willing to miss to reduce the large number of benign biopsies. Suf\u00aece to say, before the true clinical usefulness of any investigational test can be realized, the factors that can lead to change in free and total PSA levels in vivo and in laboratory measurement need to be clari\u00aeed. One element that can lead to variability in free an total PSA levels relates to the physiological variation of the PSA molecules in patients. The goals of this study were to isolate and measure the biological variation of free PSA, total PSA, and percent freeatotal PSA on a day-to-day basis. We believe this information can be used to help establish objective laboratory guidelines, to indicate whether an isolated measurement is reliable, and to determine if the different forms of the PSA molecule are suf\u00aeciently stable over a short-time period to prevent bias during long-term serial analysis. We went on to make an application of the`critical difference' to determine what constitutes a signi\u00aecant change between consecutive measurements.\nOur data showed that the biological variation of free PSA was log-normally distributed with a geometric mean of 12.0% CV. The biological variation of total PSA was signi\u00aecantly less with a geometric mean of 7.3% CV. Results were signi\u00aecantly heterogeneous between men, and variation was not distinct among individuals with cancer, benign hyperplasia, and normal for each of the three PSA parameters. We anticipated that the changes in free and total PSA would be directly related. The two measurements\u00afuctuated in the same direction approximately 75% of the time between daily measurements. Ultimately, the individual results of biological variation for percent freeatotal PSA were also skewed to the right with the majority of patients with levels around the geometric mean of 8.8% CV. For unknown reasons a number of the patients had signi\u00aecantly more biological variation. Although the 24 patients in this cohort represent the type of urological patients that would bene\u00aet from free and total PSA measurement, it is unclear how broad the range of biological variation would be among a larger sample population.\nThe question of whether a single blood collection will provide an adequate measurement for a given patient's free and total PSA levels is unresolved. When we plotted the daily\u00afuctuations of the percent freeatotal PSA, sev- Figure 2 Daily PSA results for all 24 patients. There were 6 patients with cancer, 11 patients with BPH, and 7 normal patients. Samples were measured using the Tandem-R free PSA and the Tandem-E PSA assay (Hybritech, Inc.).\neral patients in each of the clinical groups had percent freeatotal PSA levels that ranged over a 5% span (see Figure 2 ). If we assumed that these physiologic changes are independent around a central homeostatic set point, it is conceivable that a single measurement could lead to clinical misinterpretation (namely a cancer patient with \u00e0 true' percent freeatotal PSA below a designated cutoff could\u00afuctuate up into the normal zone on the day of specimen collection). In previous studies we calculated the number of measurements needed to be collected, based on the % CV of total variation, to gain an accurate estimate of the central tendency with 95% con\u00aedence. 6, 7 Obviously, a greater degree of con\u00aedence can be achieved with more measurements, but we are not convinced that taking multiple measurements on consecutive days will improve the speci\u00aecity or sensitivity of PSA testing.\nIt has been suggested that long-term longitudinal analysis of PSA levels may be useful in the early detection of carcinoma. 8, 20 The physiological stability of PSA levels unrelated to changes in pathological processes is an important factor that could bias the usefulness of yearly PSA determination. This study showed that short-term biological variation was substantial in the majority of men, and that interpretation of the change in total or percent freeatotal PSA levels should take into account the change due to biological and analytical variation. As an alternative method of detecting when a change between two consecutive measurements was statistically signi\u00ae-cant, we calculated the critical difference. According to our \u00aendings a percent change of 24.4% between two total PSA determinations would be the critical difference for 50% of men. For free PSA and the percent freeatotal PSA the median critical difference was 36.0% and 31.0%, respectively. This is substantial considering that a patient with a total PSA of 4.0 ngamL would need to have an absolute change in PSA up to 5.0 ngamL to be signi\u00ae-cantly elevated. Likewise, a patient with a percent freea total PSA of 25% could vary from 17.3\u00b132.8% before a change would reach the critical difference. Although de\u00aenitive conclusions might not be clear at this time, knowing the daily variation of serum PSA levels will help us to examine long term trends.\nNixon et al 6 recently conducted a similar study in which the total variation of free and total PSA levels were measured. This group performed the laboratory analysis in a manner similar to what would be expected in a clinical setting in that samples were analyzed immediately after collection. From measurements of the total variation, the biological variation was calculated as 13.0% CV for free PSA, 5.6% CV for total PSA, and 8.0% CV for percent freeatotal PSA. This study was done on nine urological patients with \u00aeve blood samples over two weeks, and the Immulite 1 free and total PSA assays were used. Data on the distribution were inconclusive. The current study is valuable because it carefully isolated the biological variation by controlling specimen handling and laboratory processing, and monitoring patient variables. In addition, the size of this cohort and number of measurements per patient enabled us to evaluate the distribution of biological variation among individuals. The similarity of the results in these studies helps validate the \u00aendings, and supports the conclusion that the results from this study can be applied in the clinical setting.\nThere are many factors that can lead to changes in serum PSA levels. These can be classi\u00aeed as related to specimen handling and laboratory processing (analytical variation), as related to prostatic disease (pathological variation), and as related to natural physiological mechanisms (biological variation). In brief, analytical variation exists within the same run of an assay, between runs, between lots of reagents, and between different manufacturers' assays. 11Y21Y22 Pathological changes in PSA levels within the patient can be due to the histological changes associated with cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, and aging. The last category of variation and focus of this paper, the within-individual biological variation, has not been adequately characterized. Physiological changes related to the escape of the PSA molecule into the systemic circulation, protein metabolism, molecular binding, renal clearance and reabsorption are currently unclear. There have also been reports that variation in PSA may be caused by prostate manipulation, ejaculation, and exercise. In order to clarify the magnitude of changes in PSA or PSA isoforms that indicate changes in pathology or disease, it is imperative that the etiology and magnitude of other contributors to variation be known."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This short-term longitudinal analysis showed that free and total PSA levels have substantial day-to-day biological variability. We determined that percent freeatotal PSA had a mean biological coef\u00aecient of variation of 8.8% (range 3.6\u00b122.6%) unrelated to pathological, analytical, or patient factors. Biological variability of free and total PSA levels must be considered for the patient with initial values near the cut-offs of a speci\u00aec diagnostic algorithm or when serial measurements are being followed to evaluate changes over time. A critical difference of 31.0% for the percent freeatotal PSA indicates that a change between two measurements is signi\u00aecant. Ultimately, this added information will help improve the clinical usefulness of percent freeatotal PSA measurement."}]
