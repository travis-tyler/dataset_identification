[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "United States dairy farmers face significant challenges as they deal with changing consumer preferences (organic, pasture-based, non-rBST), urbanization of agricultural land, economies of size, and environmental restrictions (See Hoppe 2014 and Gillespie and Nehring 2014). While it has been argued that one way these concerns can be partially addressed is through the use of small-scale pasture-based dairy operations, where animals are allowed to graze, reducing the quantity of manure accumulated in confined areas and potentially reducing odor problems, Nehring et al. (2009) found that larger-scale conventional dairy farms economically outperformed smaller farms for most system categories. Furthermore, recent work by Nehring et al. (2017) suggests that the potential for the exploitation of significant scale and scope economies as well as greater technical efficiency are driving the industry toward increased farm size and lower competitiveness of the small family farm. Thus, the purpose of this study, using more recent data, is to determine whether small and medium-scale U.S. dairies can compete in an industry that is increasingly characterized by largescale firms. The alternative hypothesis is that they can compete, but their competitiveness will depend upon choice of the type of production system. Following Nehring et al. (2009), we compare dairy farm efficiency and profitability among seven categories based upon size and system: Pasture-based <50 Cows, Conventional <50 Cows, Pasture-based 50-99 Cows, Conventional 50-99 Cows, Pasture-based \u2265100 Cows, Conventional 100-499 Cows, Conventional 500-999 Cows, and Conventional \u22651,000 cows. Consideration of production system is of importance when conducting an analysis of the impact of dairy farm size on farm competitiveness. \"Conventional\" dairies are defined in this analysis as more capital-intensive confinement dairies that do not rely on grazing for animal nutrition. Forage needs for pasture-based production, on the other hand, rely more heavily on grazing. Pasture-based operations have generally been lower users of technological innovations such as computerized technologies, recombinant bovine somatotropin, etc. Few studies have examined how system choice impacts dairy farm competitiveness. MacDonald et al. (2007), Mosheim and Lovell (2006), and Tauer and Mishra (2006) used USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data to show significant economies of size in the sector. These studies do not, however, fully consider the impact of system choice on competitiveness. Some studies that have considered system choice in competitiveness have included Nehring et al. (2009) for U.S. dairy farms and Nehring et al. (2016) for U.S. and European Union dairy farms. Using ARMS data for 2010-2016, we compare performance measures (efficiency and profitability) of U.S. dairy farms by size and system (pasture-based versus conventional). We use the 2010-2016 Phase III ARMS data, sorting pasture-based versus conventional farms on the basis of the number of acres that are available for grazing on a per-cow basis."}, {"section_title": "Pasture-based Versus Conventional Dairy Farms", "text": "Researchers have used a number of designations to indicate whether a dairy farm is \"pasturebased,\" as varying degrees of dependence on pasture can be used from extensive to none at all (Taylor and Foltz 2006;Hanson et al. 2004;Dartt et al. 1999). The extent of pasture use may vary by region, with forage availability from pasture depending partially upon climate. Pasturebased dairying continues to command a significant portion of U.S. milk production. Environmental, animal welfare, lifestyle, and competitiveness with conventional production are reasons sometimes cited for farmers considering pasture-based dairy production. Studies addressing the economics of pasture-based versus conventional dairy production have included those based upon experiment station trials (Rust et al.; Tucker, Rude, and Wittayakun; White et al.; and Tozer, Bargo and Muller), those using simulation or spreadsheet analyses (Parker, Muller, and Buckmaster; Elbehri and Ford; and Soder and Rotz), those based upon farm survey results in specific states or regions of the U.S. (Hanson et al. and Dartt et al.), and those based upon ARMS survey results (Nehring et al. and Gillespie and Nehring). Most of these studies have found favorable economic performance of pasture-based relative to conventional farms under certain conditions, such as similar farm size."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": "We use data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), conducted by USDA's Economic Research Service and National Agricultural Statistics Service. Phase III ARMS data for the years 2010-2016 are used. The ARMS collects information on farm size and structure, costs and returns, farmer demographics and household characteristics, and production practices. The survey is design-based, using stratified sampling, and the resulting dataset includes expansion factors for each observation. These factors can be used to extend the results to the U.S. farm population."}, {"section_title": "Assessing Technical and Scale Efficiency", "text": "A parametric input distance function approach is used to estimate the production technology of U.S. dairy farms. The input distance function is denoted as D I (X,Y,R), with X referring to inputs, Y to outputs, and R to other farm efficiency determinants. Two outputs are included in our model for dairy farms: Y CROP = value of crop production and Y LIVE = value of livestock production. Inputs include: X LAB = labor, X CAP = capital, X MISC = miscellaneous including fuel, fertilizer, and feed, and X OLND = land. Estimation of D I (X,Y,R) requires the imposition of linear homogeneity in input levels (F\u00e4re and Primont), accomplished through normalization (Lovell et al.): 1 Approximation using a translog functional form results in the following specification: where i denotes farm; t the time period; k,l the outputs; m,n the inputs; and q,r the R variables. In our analysis, X 1 is land, so the function is specified on a per-acre basis. Structural R variables include soil texture (TEXT), water-holding capacity of the soil (WATHCA), whether the farm is close to an urban area (URBAN), and whether the operator or spouse work off-farm (SPLABOR, OPLABOR). The technical inefficiency error -u it (distributed as half-normal) is the distance from the frontier, -ln D I it . Maximum likelihood methods are used to estimate (1b) as an error components model (Battese and Coelli). The one-sided error term u it is a nonnegative random variable independently distributed with truncation at zero of the N(m it ,\uf073 u 2 ) distribution, where m it =R it \uf064, R it is a vector of farm efficiency determinants (assumed here to be the factors in the R vector), and \uf064 is a vector of estimable parameters. The random error component v it is assumed to be independently and identically distributed, N(0,\uf073 v 2 ). We estimate a household model using stochastic production frontier (SPF) techniques. The marginal productive contributions (MPC) of outputs and inputs are estimated by the first order elasticities, MPC m = -\uf065 DI,Ym = -\uf0b6ln D I (X,Y,R)/\uf0b6ln Y m = \uf065 X1,Ym and MPC k = -\uf065 DI,X*m = -\uf0b6ln D I (X,Y,R)/\uf0b6ln X* k = \uf065 X1,X*k . The increase in overall input use when output expands is represented by MPC m , and is expected to be positive, such as an output elasticity or marginal cost measure. The shadow value of the k th input relative to X 1 is represented by MPC k (Fare and Primont) and, like the slope of an isoquant, is expected to negative. The MPCs of structural factors are measured through elasticities MPC Rq = -\uf065 DI,Rq = -\uf0b6ln D I (X,Y,R)/\uf0b6R q = \uf065 X1,Rq . The total contribution of the M outputs Y m , or the scale elasticity SE = -\uf065 DI,Y = -\uf053 m \uf0b6ln D I (X,Y,R)/\uf0b6ln Y m = \uf065 X1,Y provide a measure of scale economies (SE). Increasing returns to scale are found if SE<1. We estimate technical efficiency (TE) \"scores\" as TE = exp(-u it ). Operator or spousal off-farm labor may impact the productivity of inputs. We use instrumental variables to predict operator and spousal off-farm labor. For operator off-farm hours, we use crop inventory, operator education, household assets and acres cultivated. For spouse off-farm hours, we use crop inventory, operator education, total debt, and household assets. The predicted values of these two variables are included in the inefficiency effects. We use results of the SPF to examine productivity measures of eight categories of dairy farm size / production system. We approximated the dairy pasture rate for pasture operations and conventional operations based on the 2003-2007 analysis in Nehring et al. (2009). This is, dairy pasture based operations are assumed to have greater than 0.5 acres of pasture per cow, while conventional operations are assumed to have less than 0.5 dairy pasture acres. These system sorts are close to those used in Nehring et al. (2016)-the inverse of the stocking rates used in that study. Both system categories can then be further sorted into the size categories. Table 1 presents the SPF results. Most of the estimated coefficients from the input distance function are significant. All of the MPCs for outputs and inputs have the expected signs, positive for outputs and negative for inputs (Table 2). Table 3 presents sorts by system and size category. Note the percentages of farms and percentages of value of production in each category."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "A number of financial measures can be examined for farm size and system choice. As with Nehring et al. (2009), gross return on assets and net return on assets are highest for the largest conventional dairy farms. Variable costs per cow are lowest for the size categories in both systems. As found by Nehring et al. (2009), labor costs and machinery costs per cow decline along with farm size. Also consistent with Nehring et al. (2009), larger conventional farms are located on much higher-priced land. Technical efficiency scores range from 0.84 to 0.86, with some significant differences by category, but the absolute differences were not great. As expected, returns to scale increased significantly with farm size. Finally, we find that if we use predicted values for operator labor and spousal labor off farm, both operator and spouse labor off farm reduce technical efficiency. Figure 1 presents the percentages of farms with positive household net returns and net worth by category. For both pasture-based and conventional dairy farms, as size increased, percentages of farms with positive net returns and net worth exceeding $1.2 million increased. It is noted, however, that some farms in all size categories are competitive."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In order to examine small-farm competitiveness, one needs to compare by system. Therefore, we follow the 2003-2007Nehring et al. (2009 study to sort by pasture-based and conventional type dairy operations, forming eight categories for comparison-Pasture-based <50 Cows, Conventional <50 Cows, Pasture-based 50-99 Cows, Conventional 50-99 Cows, Pasture-based \u2265100 Cows, Conventional 100-499 Cows, Conventional 500-999 Cows, and Conventional \u22651,000 cows. We conclude that size of operation continues to be a strong determinant of economic viability. The largest conventional farms outperformed smaller farms by most of the economic measures we examined. We do note, however, that some farms in both systems and all size categories realized positive net returns, and were, thus, competitive.
