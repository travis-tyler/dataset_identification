[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronaviruses are found to infect a large variety of animals and humans. Besides enteric diseases, they mainly cause severe respiratory defects sometimes leading to death [1] . The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genome, subgenus Sarbecovirus [2] . Its genome is a positive single-stranded RNA molecule (+)ssRNA (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020). The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was determined at the end of 2019 [3] . The RNA genome is capped at the 5\u02b9 end and polyadenylated at the 3\u02b9 end. The genome encodes two long open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) at the 5\u02b9 end and several ORFs that are expressed in the late phase of infection from subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) [4] . After cell entry, the translation of ORF1a and ORF1b from the whole ss(+) RNA are the first events of the infectious process. The translation of ORF1b requires a \u2212 1 frameshifting event [5, 6] . The polyprotein synthesized from ORF1a is processed into eleven non-structural proteins (NSP1-NSP11). The first one, NSP1 binds to the host small ribosomal subunit 40S and recruits a yet unidentified cellular nuclease that triggers the degradation of the host mRNAs, while viral RNA is being translated [7, 8] . Thus, the virus specifically degrades the cellular mRNAs that are translated by the canonical cap-dependent translation mechanism. Other studies have shown that NSP1 is also able to prevent 48S ribosomal complex formation by another so far uncharacterized mechanism [8, 9] . Interestingly, it has been shown that IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site)-mediated translation initiation of class III-and IV-IRES (e.g., in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV)) respectively, is immune to the NSP1 inhibition. Instead, the translation initiation driven by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) class II-IRES is efficiently inhibited by NSP1 [8] . The NSP1 binding site to the ribosomal 40S subunit has not yet been determined.\nSince the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is capped at the 5\u02b9 end, it is generally believed that its translation initiation is canonical and cap-dependent. However, two major observations provide hints that the translation mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is in fact mediated by an unconventional translation initiation mechanism rather than a canonical one. First, the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 5\u02b9-UTR is likely to be complex in the proximity of the 5\u02b9 cap, based on the experimental SHAPE structure of the 5\u02b9-UTR of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a Coronavirus belonging to the Embecovirus subgroup, and on related structural predictions of the 5\u02b9-UTR of the SARS-CoV Sarbecovirus [10] . RNA structures proximal to the cap are known to inhibit the recruitment of cap-binding translation factors (eIF4E and consequently eIF4F), thus indicating canonical cap-dependent translation improbable [11, 12] . Second, after the translation of ORF1a, the rapidly produced NSP1 protein would shut down the canonical cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs. Yet, the translation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is not inhibited by NSP1. Indeed, class III-and class IV-IRES are immune to this NSP1-mediated inhibitory mechanism [8, 13] . This suggests that translation initiation of SARS-CoV-2 may be less dependent on eIF4F. Previous structural studies from other coronavirus 5\u02b9-UTRs have shown that stable hairpin structures are found in the proximity of the cap structure. When these structures are present in the vicinity of the cap, translation initiation efficiency is significantly modulated by these secondary structures [11] . In both cap-dependent and cap-independent mechanisms, the secondary structure of the 5\u02b9-UTR is critical for translation initiation efficiency.\nIn order to better understand the translation initiation mechanism of viral translation during SARS-CoV-2 infection, the first step is to determine the secondary structure of the 5\u02b9-UTR. Here, we report the first experimental determination of SARS-CoV-2 5\u02b9-UTR structure using inline probing and RNAse V1 enzymatic probing."}, {"section_title": "Coronavirus complete genome sequence", "text": "The complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was downloaded from NCBI nucleotide database Genbank [14] MN908947.3."}, {"section_title": "Secondary structure probing", "text": "The RNA transcripts have been synthesized by in vitro transcription. The RNA transcripts were then separated on PAGE containing 8 M urea and purified by electroelution using Bio Trap apparatus and Schleicher & Schuell membranes. The purified transcript was then 32 P-labelled by 5\u02b9 capping using the ScriptCap m 7 G Capping System kit from CELLSCRIPT \u2122 . The RNA transcripts were probed directly after purification without any denaturationrenaturation step. Briefly, for inline probing, 50 000 cpm of radiolabelled RNA was incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 100 mM KCl without MgCl 2 or with 1 or 10 mM MgCl 2 for 72 h at room temperature. The cuts in the RNA backbone were analysed on denaturating PAGE containing 8 M urea. For V1 probing, the RNA was incubated with serial dilutions of RNase V1 in order to have statistically one digestion cut per molecule for 10 min at room temperature as previously described [15] . The cuts were mapped by an RNase T1 ladder performed in a denaturing buffer according to previously established protocol [16] . Each segment of the 5\u02b9-UTR has been probed at least twice and representative gels for all the parts of the 5\u02b9-UTR are shown in the figures and supplemental figures. The inline reactivities have been classified as 'accessible' or 'not accessible' for inline probing. For V1 probing, the reactivities are shown as 'weak' or 'strong' according to the band intensities."}, {"section_title": "Sequence alignments", "text": "Homologous sequences, most of which were from SARS-CoV -2, were retrieved by BLAST [17] search. Sequences were aligned with ClustalW [18] before the alignment-based prediction of RNAalifold [19] .

It contains the whole 5\u02b9-UTR and the sequence coding for the 12 N-terminal codons of NSP1 Fig. 1 . Since the viral genomic RNA is capped at the 5\u02b9 end, we labelled the transcript at the 5\u02b9 end with a radioactive m 7 G cap. In order to determine the secondary structure of this transcript, we first performed inline probing in the absence and presence of 1 or 10 mM Mg 2+ . We then analysed the cuts in the RNA backbone by migration on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cuts were mapped using an RNase T1 ladder performed in denaturing conditions. We analysed regions from nt 1 to 128 and 94 to 295 Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively.\nInterestingly, RNase T1 digestion of G residues from 188 to 219 was inefficient even though digestion was performed in denaturing conditions (Fig. 3, right panel) . This indicates that these residues are embedded in a highly stable structural region that is still efficiently folded in denaturing conditions thereby preventing the access of RNase T1. Inline probing with and without Mg 2+ allowed us to map the structurally accessible regions of the RNA that generally correspond to single-stranded regions. Using this method, we could also detect inaccessible areas that are potentially forming base pairs.\nIn order to confirm these putative stems, we performed RNase V1 probing. The V1 enzyme specifically cuts in stem regions Figs. 4 and 5. We confirmed that most of the inaccessible regions by inline probing do actually correspond to areas containing base pairs. Altogether, these data allowed us to establish a solid model of the 2D structure of the whole SARS-CoV-2 5\u02b9-UTR Fig. 6 . The 5\u02b9-UTR is highly structured with a few accessible bulges and loops. It contains five simple hairpin structures that were named SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4 and SL5 in good agreement with bioinformatic secondary structure predictions for the SARS-CoV-2 [22] and also from other coronaviruses [23] . Our model is also highly similar to the models obtained by probing of the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome in vitro [24] and in vivo [25, 26] . However, we found an additional hairpin located between SL4 and SL5 that we named SL4.5. As predicted, SL1 is located close to the 5\u02b9 extremity. It has been proposed that the low overall stability of SL1, due to a high proportion of A-U and U-A base pairs, is important for replication in Mouse Hepatitis Virus MHV [27] . The loop of SL1 is not conserved in SARS-CoV-2 variants and the two bulged nucleotides in the middle of SL1 can be involved in base pairs as observed in some variants suggesting that the loop and the bulge of SL1 are not required for efficient viral propagation Fig. 7 . The SL2 hairpin domain is comparable to the SL3 domain in Bovine coronavirus (BCoV), which is known to form a hairpin structure according to NMR spectroscopy [28] as well as enzymatic probing [29, 30] . This domain is expected to be involved in the replication complex formation Fig. 8 . The loop (CUUGY) of SL2 is important for Mouse Hepatitis Virus replication [28] . It contains a U-turn like motif. In contrast, the SARS-CoV SL2 rather adopts a typical tetraloop structure [31] . This is in good agreement with our inline reactivity profile of the SL2 loop since C50 and G53 are not accessible in the loop but the U54 is highly accessible, a well-characterized feature of a tetraloop structure [31] . Hairpin SL3 is known to encompass the leader TRS (TRS-L) sequence as previously observed for group IIb coronavirus [23] Fig. 8 . The SL4 structure is a relatively stable and long hairpin and three base pairs in the stem region have been described to contain covariations (R 90 -Y 121 , R 97 -U 115 and G 101 -Y 111 ), indicating structural conservation. SL4 contains the start codon of a uORF that is present in all coronaviruses although there is no evidence of translation of this uORF so far [23] . The integrity of the upper part of SL4 is important for replication of BCoV [29] Fig. 9 . It has also been proposed that SL4 is involved in the synthesis of subgenomic RNA fragments [23] . In the 3\u02b9 part, the 5\u02b9-UTR contains a more complex structure named SL5 that comprises a four-way junction formed by SL5a, SL5b and SL5c. This four-way junction is found in all the coronavirus 5\u02b9-UTRs that have been probed so far [23, [32] [33] [34] [35] Fig. 9 . Importantly, in the SARS-CoV-2, the NSP1 AUG start codon is part of the SL5. We observed the same reactivity pattern in the identical loops from SL5a and SL5b, the inline reactivities are in good agreement with classical U-turns [36] . In contrast, SL5c contains a typical GNRA loop as previously observed in group IIb coronaviruses [23] . The loops of SL5 are most likely involved in RNA packaging as previously suggested [37] . These stems are separated by short single-stranded regions that are generally accessible except for two short regions (A 34 -C 40 ) and (C 75 -A 80 ) that are accessible in our inline experiments but also contain V1 cuts indicating the potential forming of base pairs. These apparently contradictory results can be explained as follows: these regions are dynamic and can be considered as single-stranded regions in a so-called 'open' state or double-stranded in a 'closed' state. Interestingly, the sequences can fold into putative pseudoknots structures with loop of SL2 and SL3 that we named, respectively, PK1 and PK2. The position of SL1 close to the m 7 G cap might interfere with the binding of eIF4F complex thereby preventing canonical cap-dependent translation [12] . This observation is important for some SARS-CoV-2 variants that are shorter in which the 5\u02b9 extremity is located just one nucleotide upstream of SL1 Fig. 7 . We also probed a truncated version lacking the 5\u02b9 proximal half of the 5-UTR (\u2206105). Interestingly, the folding of SL4 and SL5 in this shorter version is identical to the folding found in the full-length 5\u02b9-UTR (Supplemental Figure 1 ). This also allowed us to confirm the highly stable structure of SL5abc three-way junction. Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that SL5 can fold without nt 1-105 which suggests the existence of independent motifs in the 5\u02b9-UTR that do not interact with each other. Importantly, sequence alignments of recently sequenced SARS-CoV-2 variants also enabled the discovery of co-variations in SL1, SL4 SL5 and SL5a thereby validating our secondary structure model for these structural regions Fig. 7 . SL5a is a structurally stable region that is not cut by RNase T1 in denaturing conditions. This hairpin contains 10 G-C base pairs and its minimal free energy is predicted to be \u221217.30 kcal.mol \u22121 , probably explaining its resistance to RNase T1 digestion even in denaturing conditions. The 5\u02b9-UTR also contains an upstream opened reading frame (uORF) that is overlapping with SL4 and SL4.5. The location and the sequence of uAUG are absolutely conserved. On the contrary, the UAA stop codon is mutated in a few variants but another in-frame UAA stop is present immediately downstream, implying that the uORF is present and conserved in all variants Fig. 7 . The NSP1 AUG start codon is embedded in the four-way junction structure. For an efficient translation initiation, the sequences surrounding the AUG start codon have to be unfolded. The mechanism used by the virus is still unknown and an important issue to investigate is the role and the putative function of the stable SL5 structure (SL5a, SL5b, SL5c) in the translation of the SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein. Although the viral genome is capped at its 5\u02b9 end, the translation initiation mechanism used to locate the AUG start codon in SL5 remains elusive. The presence of the 5\u02b9 m 7 G cap and hairpins SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4 and SL5 suggest that a canonical cap-dependent scanning mechanism would require the eIF4A helicase [38, 39] . On the other hand, the fact that the AUG start codon is located in the vicinity and downstream of a four-way junction structure is reminiscent of similar structures found in the HCV IRES [40] (and references therein). Indeed, IRES elements are typically highly structured RNA motifs [40] .\nIn addition, the 5\u02b9-UTR contains a uORF that is conserved in SARS-CoV-2 variants, which indicates that it can be translated by the host ribosome. The use of uORF is another way of translation regulation [41, 42] . It is possible that the viral translation may use all these mechanisms at distinct stages of the infectious process. We hope that our investigations of the 5\u02b9-UTR structure in SARS-CoV-2 translation will pave the way to further studies in understanding its functions in the viral infection life cycle."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.
