This is a weighted rate that takes into account the various vintages into which the participant's premiums have been pooled \uf071 Contrast this with making the same regular contributions into a stock mutual fund, where the full balance earns a single rate of return over a given year, independently of when the contributions have been made \uf071 In order to compare the performance of the TIAA RA with that of asset classes like stock or bond mutual funds, we then focus on investment cohorts, where a single investment is made at a point in time for a given cohort. This is the analysis we conduct in this paper \uf071 This approach is the familiar one behind questions like \"How much would $1 be worth today if invested in Berkshire Hathaway on March 1, 1970? And how risky would that be?\" \uf071 Alternatively, and perhaps more interestingly, the analysis could be: \"How would a series of regular contributions in the TIAA RA have done, compared to the same series invested in an alternative asset? We do not conduct this analysis in this paper  1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005 \uf071 We follow these eight cohorts through December 31, 2013 \uf071 And compare their separate performance with that of: \uf071 Large and small US stocks (\"LS\" and \"SS,\" respectively) \uf071 Long-term US corporate and government bonds (\"LTCB\" and \"LTGB,\" respectively) \uf071 Intermediate-term US government bonds (\"ITGB\") \uf071 3-month U.S. Treasury Bills, a proxy for money market instruments (\"MM\") Note the potentially large scope for improvement that inclusion of TIAA RA investments brings to an optimal mean-variance portfolio for more than two-thirds of the expected return range.  1980,1985,1990, and 2000 cohorts. The absence of large stocks in any significant level across all cohorts is also quite remarkable \uf071 When TIAA RA is included: the ability of the TIAA RA to replace asset classes other than small stocks in optimal portfolios is reduced by the significant presence of long-term government bonds in every cohort. In addition, we observe the appearance of long-term corporate bonds in the 2000 cohort, and of money market investments for low volatility levels in the 1985 cohort These patterns are illustrated with the 1985 cohort: \uf071 The Sharpe ratio is used as a measure of how well an investor is compensated per unit of risk taken. Higher ratios denote greater return for the same level of risk. In this analysis we take the risk-free rate to be the money market monthly return \uf071 The Sortino ratio is based on the Sharpe ratio, but penalizes for only those returns that fall below the target return, which in our case will be the average riskless rate of return over the period of analysis \uf071 The TIAA RA portfolio has higher Sharpe and Sortino ratios across all the cohorts we study \uf071 For the 1985 through the 2005 cohorts the Sortino ratio is not defined. The reason for this unusual result is that not a single TIAA RA excess return in these cohorts happens to be below the corresponding money market return \uf071 What we can say from this ratio analysis is that the structure of TIAA RA returns appears to be very different from that of other asset classes, and that this structure does not lend itself well to traditional mean-variance metrics for comparison \uf071 Moreover, these mean-variance findings are derived from return distributions that, for most investment classes, are decidedly not normal \uf071 Accordingly, we now turn to present alternative and more powerful analyses that buttress the implications our mean-variance analyses"}, {"section_title": "Sharpe and Sortino Ratios Conclusions", "text": "\uf071 In addition, second degree dominance (SSD) requires investors to be risk averse.

Annuitants and non-annuitants share the same top financial priorities for their personal finances in retirement, each of which is consistent with annuitization. Furthermore, the most important reasons for retirees deciding to annuitize are consistent with these top financial priorities. So why do some retirees annuitize, while others do not? It is possible that nonannuitants do not understand that annuitization would address their top financial priorities. \u2022 80% of non-annuitants were advised to not annuitize or did not receive advice regarding annuitization; 60% of annuitants were advised to do so. \u2022 In-plan deferred annuities present an opportunity for participants to become socialized to annuities and annuitization. For 75% of nonannuitants, either their plan(s) did not have a deferred annuity or they did not realize it, the latter likely being the case for many."}]
