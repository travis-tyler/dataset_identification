[{"section_title": "List of Tables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the 1992-93 academic year, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) embarked on its first long-term study of bachelor's degree recipients, the 1993/03 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/03). The B&B:93/03 sample was obtained by identifying eligible respondents from the 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93), a nationally representative cross section of students in all sectors of postsecondary education in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 1 For NPSAS:93, information was obtained from more than 1,000 postsecondary institutions on approximately 50,000 undergraduate students and more than 13,000 graduate students. Those members of the NPSAS:93 sample who completed a bachelor's degree between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1993, were identified and contacted for a 1-year follow-up interview in 1994 and a 4-year follow-up in 1997. In 2003, 10 years after they had completed a bachelor's degree, the final follow-up of this cohort took place. This E.D. TAB provides some selected results on the opinions about education expressed by this cohort of college graduates at the time of their interviews in 2003. Specifically, this E.D. TAB presents the percentages of bachelor's degree recipients who reported important relationships between their undergraduate education and their lives in 2003; further education since completion of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree; and, for those who completed graduate programs, important relationships between their graduate education and their lives. 2 These tabulations are presented by baccalaureate major, undergraduate grade point average (GPA), control of institution, highest degree completed, and field of advanced degree. More information about the variables used in this E.D. TAB can be found in the glossary in appendix A. The estimates in this E.D. TAB are based on the results of surveys with almost 9,000 bachelor's degree recipients, representing about 1.2 million students who completed a bachelor's degree in 1992-93. The Internet-based survey could be self-administered by the respondent or completed over the telephone with a trained interviewer. The weighted overall response rate for the B&B:93/03 interview was 74 percent, reflecting an institution response rate of 88 percent and a student response rate of 83 percent. All comparisons made in the text were tested using Student's t statistic for comparing two numbers or F tests for overall significance and linear trends for comparisons across ordered categories. All differences cited were statistically significant at the .05 level. The analysis conducted for this E.D. TAB does not include longitudinal analysis of change over time and does not control for interrelationships among the variables. To avoid confounding influences of previous undergraduate experience, all analyses in this E.D. TAB are restricted to those for whom the 1992-93 bachelor's degree was the first bachelor's degree received (about 93 percent of the sample). More information about the sample, data files, and analysis is provided in appendix B."}, {"section_title": "Selected Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Importance of Undergraduate Education", "text": "The 2003 follow-up concludes the study of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, and as the final installment of information about their postbaccalaureate paths, represents an appropriate time to ask graduates to reflect on their college years. Respondents were asked about both the importance of specific aspects of their college education to them now and the usefulness of their undergraduate education as a whole to some broad areas of their lives. For each item, the graduates were asked whether or not the item was \"very important.\" \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, about three-fifths reported that the quality of instruction they received as undergraduates (61 percent) and their undergraduate major field (58 percent) remained very important to their lives 10 years later (table 1). \u2022 The relative importance of various characteristics of undergraduate education varied by control of the institution from which students graduated. That is, graduates of public institutions were more likely than graduates of private not-for-profit institutions to report that their major field, the professional classes they had taken, and their internship or other work opportunities as undergraduates were very important in 2003. On the other hand, graduates of private not-for-profit institutions were more likely than graduates of public institutions to report that liberal arts courses and the quality of instruction they received were very important. \u2022 Nearly four out of five graduates (78 percent) reported that their undergraduate education as a whole was very important in preparing them for work and career; a majority also indicated that their college years were very important preparation for their further education (56 percent) and financial security (57 percent; table 2). \u2022 Graduates with an undergraduate major in health, science, mathematics, or engineering, or business were more likely than those who majored in arts and humanities, social and behavioral sciences, or \"other\" fields to feel that their undergraduate education was very important preparation for their work and career (80-86 percent vs. 70-77 percent; table 2). \u2022 Graduates with higher undergraduate GPAs were more likely than those with lower GPAs to report that their undergraduate education was very important preparation for work and career and for further education. For example, 84 percent of graduates with cumulative undergraduate GPAs of 3.75 or higher reported that their undergraduate education was very important for work and career, compared with 80 percent whose GPAs were 2.75-3.74 and 76 percent whose GPAs were less than 2.75."}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate Education and Occupational Training", "text": "Although students in this study had completed a bachelor's degree in 1992-93, a number of them pursued additional undergraduate education. In addition, some completed an occupational license or professional certification. Finally, others had taken either work-related or personal enrichment classes without pursuing a particular degree or credential. \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, 9 percent had subsequently enrolled in at least one undergraduate program within 10 years of completing a bachelor's degree: 2 percent enrolled in a diploma/certificate program, 2 percent in an associate's degree program, and 6 percent in an additional bachelor's degree program (table 3). Of those who enrolled in an undergraduate program, 59 percent completed a certificate or degree. \u2022 After completing a bachelor's degree, one-fourth of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients obtained an occupational license and 30 percent obtained a professional certification (table  4). Also, as of 2003, 45 percent had participated in work-related training and 18 percent had taken personal enrichment classes in the past year. \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, those who majored in health as undergraduates were more likely than those with all other majors to enroll in an occupational license program (36 vs. 21-28 percent; table 4). Those who majored in education or health were more likely than those with all other majors to enroll in a professional certification program (46 and 39 vs. 25-29, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment and Completion of Graduate Education", "text": "Graduates were also asked about any graduate degree or certificate programs that they pursued since completing their bachelor's degree.

Of those, 63 percent had completed such a program, and 24 percent had left without completing (table 5). As of 2003, 10 years after bachelor's degree completion, 17 percent of those who had ever enrolled were currently pursuing a graduate program of some type. \u2022 As of 2003, the highest degree of about three-fourths of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients was a bachelor's degree or postbaccalaureate certificate (table 6). Twenty percent of students earned a master's degree, 4 percent earned a first-professional degree, and 2 percent earned a doctoral degree. \u2022 College graduates with a bachelor's degree in science, mathematics, or engineering were more likely than those who majored in all other subjects to earn a doctoral degree (7 vs. 0-4 percent; table 6). Graduates with majors in science, mathematics, or engineering or in social and behavioral sciences were also generally more likely than those with all other majors to earn a first-professional degree (8 and 6 percent vs. 2-4 percent, respectively), although no difference could be detected between social and behavioral sciences and arts and humanities. On the other hand, graduates who earned a bachelor's degree in education were more likely than those in all other subjects (except arts and humanities) to earn a master's degree by 2003 (26 vs. 15-21 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Satisfaction and Importance of Graduate Education", "text": "Finally, bachelor's degree recipients with any enrollment at the graduate level since the previous interview in 1997 were asked how satisfied they were with various aspects of their graduate experience. They were also asked whether areas of their graduate education were very important to their lives overall, and whether their graduate education as a whole was important to specific areas of their lives. For graduates who had completed an advanced degree (a master's, first-professional, or doctoral degree) by 2003, this section describes their responses. 4 \u2022 Overall, bachelor's degree recipients who had completed an advanced degree were very satisfied with their graduate education (table 7). Seventy-one percent were very satisfied with the faculty and the teaching, 70 percent were very satisfied with the course offerings, 64 percent were very satisfied with the availability of courses, and 58 percent were very satisfied with the career preparation they received. \u2022 Bachelor's degree recipients with graduate or professional degrees in the health field were more likely than those with degrees in all other fields to report being very satisfied with the career preparation aspect of their graduate education (77 vs. 49-59 percent; table 7). \u2022 Most bachelor's degree holders who had completed a graduate or professional degree considered their course of study, instructional quality, interaction with faculty, internship and work opportunities, and social contacts while enrolled in their graduate program to be very important to their lives now (table 8). About four out of five (79 percent) said their course of study was very important to their lives now, and two-thirds (68 percent) reported that the quality of instruction was very important. \u2022 Bachelor's degree recipients who had completed an advanced degree generally felt that their graduate education was very important preparation for many aspects of their lives now (table  9). For example, 89 percent felt their graduate education was very important preparation for their work and career, 77 percent felt it was very important for taking on new challenges, 70 percent felt it was very important for establishing financial security, and 60 percent reported that it was very important preparation for helping them make informed choices.

Of 12,500 NPSAS:93 respondents who were identified as potentially eligible for the first follow-up survey, about 1,500 were determined to be ineligible. A total of about 10,000 eligible individuals completed the 1994 interview. The B&B:93/97 survey was the second follow-up interview of the B&B cohort. Data collection for B&B:93/97 took place between April and December 1997. A total of over 11,000 individuals in the B&B cohort were determined eligible for follow-up in 1997. For the second follow-up, over 10,000 individuals completed the interview, yielding a response rate of 90 percent. For more information on procedures for the first and second follow-ups, consult their respective methodology reports (Green et al. 1996 for the first follow-up and Green et al. 1999 for the second follow-up). In spring 2003, the third and final follow-up of the 1992-93 cohort of bachelor's degree recipients was conducted. For the first time, students were offered the opportunity to conduct their own B&B interview via the Internet. A single, web-based interview was designed and programmed for use as a self-administered interview, a telephone interview, and an in-person interview. All B&B:93/97 respondents were included for participation in B&B:93/03. A subsample of about one-third of the B&B:93/97 nonrespondents was also included, for a final sample of about 10,400. Almost 9,000 individuals responded, yielding a weighted overall response rate of 74 percent, reflecting an institution response rate (in 1992) of 88 percent and a student response rate (in 2003) of 83 percent. For more details about these and other methodological procedures, consult the methodology report (Wine et al. forthcoming). The B&B:93/03 data provide a current profile of the 1992-93 cohort of college graduates, including degree recipients who have been enrolled sporadically over time as well as those who went to college right after completing high school. The dataset contains comprehensive data on graduate enrollment, attendance, attainment, and student demographic characteristics. It provides a unique opportunity to understand variations in labor force participation, career stability, and financial worth over the past 10 years. There are data limitations, however. This follow-up was the conclusion of a 10-year study, and some attrition from the study is to be anticipated, although bachelor's degree recipients are likely to be relatively easier to locate than other populations and considerable efforts were undertaken both to minimize the extent of this problem and to adjust for its effects in the data (see Wine et al. forthcoming). Second, the previous waves of data collection for B&B:93/03 collected detailed information about complete education and employment histories for periods of 1 and 3 years, respectively; the final follow-up collected information for a period of 6 years, from the second follow-up in 1997 to the third in 2003. To ease respondent burden, summary information about employment histories were collected rather than complete, detailed information about each job held in the interim.

TAB are weighted to compensate for unequal probability of selection into the B&B sample and to adjust for nonresponse. Two weights were developed. Cross-sectional weights were constructed for analyzing respondents to B&B:93/03. In addition, a panel (longitudinal) weight was constructed for analyzing those students who responded to all four surveys: B&B:93/03, B&B:93/97, B&B:93/94, and NPSAS:93 (computer-assisted telephone interview component). The weights for the B&B:93/03 respondents were constructed by applying a series of adjustments to the B&B:93/94 base weight. Specifically, adjustments were made to account for subsampling of the B&B:93/97 nonrespondents, for those not located, for refusals among those who were located, and for types of nonresponse other than refusals among those who were located and did not refuse. Construction of the panel (or longitudinal) weight to be used for analyzing those who responded to all three surveys consisted of an additional adjustment for nonresponse for the B&B:93/03 respondents who did not respond to all three of the previous surveys. The weight variable used in this E.D. TAB is WTC00.

The effects of any potential bias due to nonresponse can influence overall data quality with greater proportions of missing information. Consequently, nonresponse bias analyses were conducted at B-4 the student and item levels when the corresponding weighted response rates were below 85 percent. The bias in an estimated mean based on respondents, R y , is the difference between this estimate and the target parameter, \u00b5, which is the mean that would result if a complete census of the target population was conducted and all units responded. This bias can be expressed as follows: However, for variables that are available from the frame and base year (NPSAS:93) respondents, \u00b5 can be estimated by \u03bc without sampling error, in which case the bias in R y can then be estimated by: Moreover, an estimate of the population mean based on respondents and nonrespondents can be obtained by: where\u03b7 is the weighted unit nonresponse rate, based on weights prior to nonresponse adjustment.

These variables included the following: \u2022 Age in the base year (NPSAS:93), \u2022 Race/ethnicity, B-6 answer that item. The number asked to answer an item is the number of unit level respondents (I) minus the number of respondents with a valid skip item for item x ( As indicated above, nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for the variables with item response rates below 85 percent. This analysis was further restricted to items with at least 50 students who were either eligible to answer the item based on their response to the gate question, or did not respond to the gate question for an item. This bias analysis compared the distributions of respondents and nonrespondents to the item for the variables age, race/ethnicity, gender, control of the base year institution, and OBE region of the base year institution. Overall, item nonresponse analysis was conducted for 117 items, but 106 of these had response rates below 85 percent because the respondent did not respond to the gate question. The nonresponse bias analysis indicated that some items do have statistically significant bias due to item nonresponse, but the magnitude of the bias is generally small.

In the final step, the derived variables were imputed again, using the procedures described below. Table  B-1 lists the 11 interview variables and the three derived variables used in the E.D. TAB that were imputed, with the percentage of cases imputed. Sequential hot deck imputation, a common procedure for managing item nonresponse, uses respondent data as donors to provide surrogate values for records with missing data. In sequential hot deck imputation, imputation classes are defined, generally consisting of a crossclassification of covariates, and then missing values are replaced sequentially from a single pass through the data within the imputation classes. A related procedure, weighted sequential hot deck imputation, takes into account the unequal probabilities of selection into the original sample by using the sampling weights to specify the expected number of times a particular respondent's answer will be used to replace a missing item.

Within the unconditional group, variables were sorted by percentage missing and then imputed in order, from lowest percentage missing to highest. Within the conditional group, the variables were first sorted by conditionality and percentage missing, then imputed in the appropriate sequence. A constant set of predictor variables was used in a CHAID analysis to determine imputation classes for each imputation variable. The analysis used the following set of predictor variables: age, gender, race/ethnicity, U.S. citizenship, dependency status, prior respondent, receipt of federal aid, and institutional region, institutional type, and institutional level.

Imputing sequentially allowed these derived variables (or further derived variables resulting from them) to be used as class variables for imputing variables in subsequent batches. The process helped to ensure consistency across derived variables. Most of the derived variables had several constraints defined by different combinations of data collected in prior rounds of the study. Therefore, a procedure for finding appropriate donor cases was developed before the imputation was performed. The procedure involved defining mutually exclusive groups or classes of respondents that met the constraints. The groups were used as the imputation classes for the weighted sequential hot deck imputation procedure. For the derived variables that did not have any constraints, a CHAID analysis was performed. The predictor variables included any prior imputed variables, including interview variables."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Imputations", "text": "Comparing imputation distributions within imputation classes is a key measure for determining whether or not the weighted sequential hot deck imputation procedure produced acceptable results. The more similar the distributions, the more successful the imputation process. For evaluation of the B&B:93/03 imputation results, distributions were considered to be B-9 similar when absolute differences were less than 5 percent. Absolute difference was calculated by subtracting the before-imputation weighted percentage from the after-imputation weighted percentage. If absolute differences greater than 5 percent were found, then the unweighted distributions were examined to see if the large differences were due to small sample sizes. No absolute differences greater than 5 percent were found for any comparison. After imputation, weighted item response rates were calculated for all the variables used in this E.D.

First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of respondents in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a \"false positive\" or Type I error. In the case of a t statistic, this false positive would result when a difference measured with a particular sample showed a statistically significant difference when there is no difference in the underlying population. Statistical tests are designed to control this type of error, denoted by alpha. The alpha level of .05 selected for findings in this E.D. TAB indicates that a difference of a certain magnitude or larger would be produced no more than one time out of 20 when there was no actual difference in the quantities in the underlying population. When we test hypotheses that show t values at the .05 level or smaller, we treat this finding as rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two quantities.

To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable.
