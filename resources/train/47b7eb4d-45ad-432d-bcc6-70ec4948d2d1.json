[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The present study describes science expectancy-value motivation classes within a nationally representative sample of students who were U. S. ninth-graders in 2009. An expectancy-value model was the basis for science-specific profile indicators (self-efficacy, attainment value, utility value, interest-enjoyment value). Using exploratory latent class analysis, a four-class model was identified as the best model, based on model fit and interpretability. Although the Low and Typical profiles had uniform levels of indicators, the two high motivation profiles (High SelfEfficacy and High Utility Value) had mixed levels. The profile characterized by very high selfefficacy had lower values, while the profile characterized by high utility value had lower selfefficacy. The differences in math achievement between profiles were small. High-ability students disidentified with science; only 29% of high-ability students had high science expectancy-value profiles. The implications for science talent development are discussed."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "High-ability high school students form a talent pool from which future scientists and engineers should come. However, relatively few members of this large talent pool develop their abilities in the STEM disciplines (National Science Board, 2010) . The question of why this might be happening is important to consider as the United States is engaged in a national effort to strengthen the science and engineering workforce by actively recruiting all Americans, especially students who have been identified as having high ability in math. One factor that has been neglected for the most part in efforts to understand students' participation in STEM disciplines is knowing what motivates these students. Exploration of students' STEM motivation is the focus of the present study.\nBecause the construct of motivation is quite broad and multidimensional, we begin by outlining the theory that undergirds our study, with a specific focus on how motivation plays out in science. Although there are numerous models of motivation, we focus on Expectancy-Value Theory because we view beliefs about competence (i.e., the expectancy component of the model) and beliefs about the value of a subject to be especially salient in science-a subject in which students typically struggle (Drew, 2011 ; National Academies of Science, 2011) and find irrelevant for what they want to do in the future (Basu & Barton, 2007; Hannover & Kessels, 2004) .\nWe posit that a students' expectancy-value profile in the ninth grade has a relationship with his or her plans to pursue later STEM occupations. In the present study, we identify four about students' motivations that has not previously been studied. In the present study, some basic assumptions about students and STEM were scrutinized. For example, it is widely accepted that mathematics ability is a good indicator of who should pursue STEM occupations. However, prior research with small samples of gifted students suggests that the students with the highest academic ability are not the most highly motivated in an academic domain. Thus, we investigated the possibility that motivation profile may have a stronger relationship with occupational plans than ability. Our evidence supports the idea that motivation has a stronger relationship with STEM occupational plans than mathematics ability."}, {"section_title": "Expectancy-Value", "text": "In the expectancy-value model, students choose among viable options with their perception of viability being affected by cultural stereotypes and parental, familial, or peer influences (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . The considerations that drive decisions include one's expectations for success and the alignment of the choice with three components: personal goals, identity, and interests. Each of these considerations is influenced by cultural role schemas based on race, gender, or ethnicity. (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . The first of these considerations is expectancy and the remaining three components collectively comprise subjective task value.\nThrough this model, choice, persistence, and performance are causally linked to the individual's expectation for success and the subjective task value of the activity. Sociocultural contexts shape beliefs and directly affect expectancies and values, which in turn affect the choices, how much effort is exerted, and performance. Decades of research have shown that expectancies and values SCIENCE MOTIVATION PROFILES p. 5 are good predictors of future course taking and career choice (Eccles, 1985; Eccles, Adler, & Meece, 1984; Simpkins & Davis-Kean, 2005; Simpkins, Davis-Kean, & Eccles, 2006; Watt, Eccles, & Durik, 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Science Expectancy", "text": "Generally, expectancy is the belief that one can succeed in future tasks (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . Science expectancy is positively related to prior achievement and to interest in science (Denissen, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2007; Navarro, Flores, & Worthington, 2007; Rottinghaus, Larson, & Borgen, 2003) . However, expectancy can also be influenced by sociocultural factors.\nGender differences in expectancy beliefs often favor males in gender-role stereotyped domains, such as science (Riegle-Crumb, Moore, & Ramos-Wada, 2011; Simpkins & Davis-Kean, 2005 ).\nExpectancy may not align well with actual ability or achievement. For example, if high-ability students have internalized negative stereotypes about their science abilities or adopted negative views about their potentials to be successful in science, they are likely to hold relatively lower expectancies for success. For example, gifted girls are more responsive to social-evaluative feedback and stereotype threat than gifted boys (Dai, 2002) and therefore may have lower expectancies. Most studies of science-related choices have used math self-efficacy as a proxy for science self-efficacy (e.g., Mau, 2003; Moakler, 2011; Zarrett & Malanchuk, 2005) , while a few have used latent variables that combined math and science expectancy (e.g., Navarro et al., 2007) . The alignment of the expectancy domain with the choice domain may have affected prior findings; Andersen and Ward (2014) found that science expectancy was a predictor of STEMrelated plans, while math expectancy was not. Overall, the effect of expectancy was smaller than the effect of subjective task value on choice (Andersen & Ward, 2014; Watt et al., 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Science Subjective Task Value", "text": "Subjective task value (STV) can be defined as students' beliefs about how interesting science activities are, how enjoyable they are, and how personally important or useful the science activities are (Wigfield, Tonks, & Klauda, 2009) . Individuals make these value judgments based on their memberships in multiple cultural or social groups, therefore cultural expectations and peer expectations influence the value of science. In the next section, each of the four constructs that comprise STV will be described.\nScience attainment value. Science attainment value is how important science is to self, or how well aligned one's own identity is with a science identity (Wigfield et al., 2009 amoral, insensitive, obsessive, unemotional, unsocial, unkempt, and uncaring (Barba, 1998; Finson, 2002; Seymour & Hewitt, 1997) . Scientist is a stigmatized identity because scientists are often stereotyped as geniuses, which is also a stigmatized identity in an anti-intellectual culture such as the U.S. (Coleman & Cross, 1988; Howley, Howley, & Pendarvis, 1995) . Recent research using the framework of identity-based motivation supports the positive relationship of attainment value to STEM-related choices and the importance of the compatibility of science identities and personal identities for persistence (Carlone & Johnson, 2007; Hannover & Kessels, 2004; Kao, 2000; Oyserman & Destin, 2010; Taconis & Kessels, 2009 (Andersen & Ward, 2013 Maltese & Tai, 2011 ).\nScience interest-enjoyment value. Interest-enjoyment value is the degree to which students like science or find it fun (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . Interest-enjoyment value is positively related to decisions about taking STEM-related courses and pursuing STEM careers (Jacobs, Finken, Griffin, & Wright, 1998; Lent, Lopez, Lopez, & Sheu, 2008; Lent, Paix\u00e3o, Silva, & Leit\u00e3o, 2010; Miller, Lietz, & Kotte, 2002; Watt et al., 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Prior Research on STV.", "text": "Although subjective task value has been shown to predict choice after controlling for prior achievement (Eccles et al., 1984; Simpkins & Davis-Kean, 2005; Watt et al., 2006) , these studies operationalized STV as a single score that represented interest-enjoyment, attainment, and utility values. This is problematic because motivation is a multidimensional construct such that students can certainly view a subject as being very useful to their lives yet derive very little enjoyment from it. There are numerous configurations in which the different constructs contained within expectancy-value theory can be arranged. In most expectancy-value based studies, external validity was limited by the use of samples that lacked adequate racial or ethnic diversity. Thus, it is not known if the expectancyvalue theory functions in the same way for minority students as it does for other students.\nAlthough studies have been conducted using national datasets (e.g., Maltese & Tai, 2011; Mau, 2003; Riegle-Crumb et al., 2011) , problems exist with these secondary data analyses, such as: (1) studies that are not grounded in strong theoretical frameworks (e.g., Maltese & Tai, 2011; Maple & Stage, 1991; Miller et al., 2002) ; (2) constructs that are only weakly supported by individual survey items (e.g., Maltese & Tai, 2011; Riegle-Crumb et al., 2011; Shaw & Barbuti, 2010) ; (3) overcapitalization on chance through the testing of many variables and retaining only significant predictors in models (e.g., Maltese & Tai, 2011) ; (4) conflation of constructs, particularly selfefficacy and self-concept (e.g., Mau, 2003; Riegle-Crumb et al., 2011) ; and (5) the use of poorly defined constructs, such as science attitude (Blalock et al., 2008) . This study addresses each of these concerns."}, {"section_title": "Motivation and Talent Development in the Sciences", "text": "Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, and Worrell (2011) emphasized the importance of motivation to the talent development process. \"General ability is necessary but not sufficient to explain optimal performance or creative productivity. It remains a component of talent development along with \u2026 motivation\" (p. 14). Thus to successfully navigate the talent development process requires both a nominal level of ability as well as substantial motivation.\nTalent development has also been conceptualized as the demonstration of gifted behavior. Renzulli's (1978) Three Ring Conception of Giftedness (TRCG) defines giftedness as creative SCIENCE MOTIVATION PROFILES p. 9 productive behavior arising from the interaction between above-average ability, task commitment, and creativity. Above-average ability is used instead of high ability because research has shown that for IQ scores above 120, other variables become more important to creative production. In other words, creative productivity is not predicted by intelligence for individuals who are at least one standard deviation above the mean in intelligence (Renzulli, 2005) .\nMotivation as task commitment. The task commitment component of the TRCG (Renzulli, 1978) incorporated motivation into the concept of giftedness. Renzulli defined task commitment as \"a refined or focused form of motivation\" (Renzulli, 2005, p . 263) that is described by terms such as perseverance and endurance and enhanced by \"the synergistic effects of extrinsic motivators on intrinsic motivation\" (Renzulli, 2005, p. 263) . Gifted individuals are intensely interested in, or passionate about their talent areas and willing to spend large amounts of time engaged in talent development activities. Bloom (1985) cites identification with the talent domain as the cause of this intense engagement. In STV terminology, task commitment is represented by a combination of high interest-enjoyment value and high attainment value.\nEvidence of this intense engagement is seen in the deliberate practice of the talent development process, which describes activities specifically designed to improve skills (Ericsson et al., 1993) .\nUnlike play, which has an intrinsic reward, and work, which has extrinsic rewards, deliberate practice has no reward other than skill development and is undertaken because it holds utility value for the individual. Individuals who are gifted in science would be expected to have higher STV (attainment, utility, and interest-enjoyment values) for science than students who are not gifted in science. On the other hand, school subjects may not be valued as much as more authentic learning contexts, such as scientific investigations or self-directed learning activities.\nFor example, a recent study of academically gifted students showed that none of these students were passionate about schoolwork in academic subjects (Fredricks, Alfeld, & Eccles, 2010) .\nMore research needs to be done regarding task commitment and the self-regulatory mechanisms that sustain engagement such as the relative influences of attainment, utility, and interestenjoyment values.\nDisidentification. The findings of Fredericks, Alfeld, and Eccles (2010) raise the question of why none of the academically talented students were passionate about academics.\nThis may indicate some level of intentional disidentification with academics by these students.\nThe Information Management Model (Coleman & Cross, 1988) states that high-ability students may disidentify with academics because they encounter mixed messages in different contexts and often must decide between achievement and social acceptance (Cross & Coleman, 1995; Cross, Coleman, & Stewart, 1993; Swiatek, 2001 ). In the typical American high school, passion about academics is viewed as socially unacceptable or stigmatizing, but high-ability students desire popularity and social acceptance just as other children do (Coleman & Cross, 1988) . Most high-ability children feel different from their non-high-ability peers, and some of those who feel different engage in social-coping strategies to manage their identities at school and feel less different (Cross & Coleman, 1995; Swiatek, 1998) . Some of the most common strategies are to hide their abilities or to disidentify (Cross, 1997; Swiatek, 2001) . In terms of the EV model, students who have disidentified with science are likely to report lower levels of attainment, utility, and interest-enjoyment value, while reporting relatively high levels of self-efficacy. Most research has focused on disidentification associated with general academic ability and academics (e.g. Cross & Coleman, 1995; Cross et al., 1993; Swiatek, 2001) . One study has focused on high-ability students' disidentification with science specifically (Andersen & Cross, 2014) .\nAbility and STV. Students with high expectancy are more likely to have high interest in those domains (Denissen et al., 2007) . On the other hand, Gottfried, Cook, Gottfried, and Morris (2005) compared academic ability and intrinsic motivation and found that when students were grouped by high academic ability and by high academic intrinsic motivation, a minority of students were members of both groups, and the high intrinsic motivation group had higher levels of achievement than the high-ability group. However, the sample for this study was a small, nondiverse, convenience sample, which limits the generalizability of this finding and general academic ability and motivation were the outcome measures. Studies are needed that include diverse populations and that focus on science. In the present study, a diverse sample was used to examine the relationship between ability and science-specific motivation."}, {"section_title": "SCIENCE MOTIVATION PROFILES p. 12", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Adolescents' decisions to study science depend on their science expectancies and values (Eccles, 2011; Maltese & Tai, 2011) . Students with above-average ability in science are thought to be good candidates for talent development in science. However, science values (attainment, utility, and interest-enjoyment values) may matter more than ability in the development of talent.\nStudents with above-average ability and high motivation are likely to be the best candidates for talent development. In order for students to be motivated to pursue talent development in science, they must value science.\nEach student feels a different degree of dissonance between his or her cultural norms and the norms of science culture. For females, gender-role expectations may conflict with STEM career expectations and negative STEM-related gender stereotypes are abundant (Arnold, 1993; Jacobs, 2005; Weisgram, Bigler, & Liben, 2010) . For African Americans and Hispanic students, negative STEM-related racial or ethnic stereotypes may discourage participation (Kao, 2000; Oyserman & Destin, 2010; Steele, 1997) . In addition to these cultural considerations, aboveaverage ability students may also feel stigmatized to some degree due to their differentness from other students (Cross & Coleman, 1995; Coleman et al., 1993; Swiatek, 2001 ). Science identities are stigmatizing due to negative stereotypes that directly oppose the characteristics and traits that adolescents desire and threaten their potential for popularity and peer acceptance (Hannover & Kessels, 2004; Kessels, 2005) . It is hypothesized that these sociocultural phenomena affect students' expectancies and values as well as their plans for future occupations. Little is known about the science-specific expectancy value patterns of high school students. This large-scale study of students' expectancies and value will provide some baseline data to guide further research into why some students choose science and others do not.

This implies a person-centered SCIENCE MOTIVATION PROFILES p. 14 approach should be taken in which the level of a variable for that person is compared to the levels of the other variables for that person. In this study, such an approach was used to identify profiles of expectancy-value variable configurations. Person-centered approaches are a holisticinteractionist perspective to model building that considers the person and his or her context as a system and the unit of study (Bergman, Magnusson, & El-Khouri, 2003) . In this study, a personcentered approach was used because: (1) EV variables function in constellations instead of singly, (2) relationships between variables within the EV model are different for each individual, and (3) methodological constraints of the general linear model are removed."}, {"section_title": "Focus on constellations of variables.

Classes of people will be identified by the patterns of variables that exist within the population.\nA variable-centered analysis uses group means to predicting outcomes for individuals in the group. The relationships that are found are used to make inferences about individuals. In such an approach, an observed statistical relationship may appear to be small because a small group within the sample has little influence on the group mean. This is a concern for this study because a relatively small percentage of students choose STEM careers. Previous variable-centered models may have not detected effects that were important for subgroups of individuals within the sample. The use of a person-centered approach permits the identification of such classes within the larger sample.\nConstraints of the general linear model.

The HSE profile was characterized by relatively low science value. The development of science expertise depends on processes such as deliberate practice, which are motivated by strong utility and interest-enjoyment value. Therefore, the observation that the class with the highest self-efficacy had lower levels of these values implies that these individuals lack the internal drive to engage in talent development. Furthermore, the HUV class had the highest utility and interest-enjoyment value combined with lower self-efficacy. Individuals in the HUV class may be more likely to engage in deliberate practice and talent development despite having SCIENCE MOTIVATION PROFILES p. 23 lower self-efficacy because science is more interesting to them and holds more value for their future college and career. This situation represents a potential loss of science talent of those with the highest expectancies, while supporting the notion that individuals with above-average abilities and high motivation should be provided talent development opportunities.\nThe person-centered approach, taken in the present study, examined expectancy-value profiles, rather than the mean levels of profile indicators. These findings provide a different perspective on expectancy-value and provide information that complements typical variablecentered methods. Previous research has shown that the STV variables are highly correlated.\nPrevious researchers have also combined the multiple STV constructs into a composite variable (e. g. Eccles et al., 1984; Simpkins & Davis-Kean, 2005; Watt et al., 2006) . In the present study, the value variables were somewhat related but did not always occur at the same levels. The two high profiles had mixed levels of indicators. For example, students who had high science expectancy tended to have lower interest in science and lower science utility value. The differences between these profiles support the use of a person-centered approach because these differences would not be observed if the value variables were combined into a composite. The person-centered approach complements prior variable-centered studies. Andersen and Ward (2014) found science attainment value to be a strong predictor of occupational plans for all students, while STEM utility value was a strong predictor only for Hispanic students. In the present study, utility value distinguishes the two high motivation classes, but attainment value is not distinguishable. The different methods use the same data, but allow different relationships to be identified. In the logistic regression models presented in Andersen and Ward (2014) , attainment value was a strong predictor of occupational plans, along with utility value. In the present study, utility value distinguishes the two high motivation classes, but attainment value is SCIENCE MOTIVATION PROFILES p. 24 not distinguishable. Furthermore, the rates of STEM occupational plans were substantially different in the two high motivation classes, even though the attainment values were not.\ntherefore, utility value has more discriminant power than attainment value.\nThe present study addressed problems in the literature with external validity because a large, nationally representative sample was used. Previous studies lacked sufficient representation of minority students. The only previous study that separated value components was Conley (2012). However, her sample consisted of predominantly Vietnamese and Latino children of working class parents. Conley (2012) found that math utility value was uniformly high across the seven-cluster solution. In this sample that had proportional representation to the U. S. population of ninth-grade students in 2009, classes with high and low utility value were\nidentified. An explanation for this difference may be that the subpopulations that had high utility value were relatively small portions of this sample or that students' patterns of science utility value differ from their patterns of math utility value."}, {"section_title": "Research Question #2: Evidence of Disidentification", "text": "One important finding was that the math achievement levels of each profile group were statistically different from each other. Students were assigned to profile groups based on patterns of science expectancies and values, which ensures that each group has the largest differences in science expectancies and values. It seemed logical that students who had the highest science expectancies and values would have also had the highest math achievement levels. However, this was not the case. Differences in math achievement between profile groups were small and did not have practical importance. Considering the wide range of math achievement scores in this sample (ranging from 16 to 70) it is remarkable that the difference in mean ability between the highest and lowest profiles is only 6 points. This relatively small p. 25 difference, combined with the low correlation between math achievement and science selfefficacy show that differences in ability between profiles were smaller than differences in expectancies and values. In other words, the groups of students did not differ much by ability, but differed much more in their profiles of expectancies and values.\nOnly a minority of above-average ability students were members of the high science expectancy-value profiles. This implies that, in this sample, above-average students have disidentified with science. In other words, students who had high potential in science had low expectancy and value for science. The finding that a minority of high-ability students exhibited high motivation is supported by previous research (e. g. Gottfried et al. 2005; Gottfried & Gottfried, 2004) . Importantly, this finding has serious implications for talent development in the science disciplines. Students who have lower motivation are less likely to persist in the study of science. This implies that factors other than ability are influencing expectancies and values.\nFuture research should attempt to identify such factors. An alternative explanation may be that that math achievement is not a good indicator of potential science ability and the group of students who have high science potential is substantially different than the group of students who are high achievers in math. It is recommended that science achievement be assessed directly in future NCES surveys.\nAbove-average ability students had low science expectancy-value profiles. The low science class represented 25.6% of above-average ability students. This low-motivation, aboveaverage ability group was only slightly smaller than the high-motivation, high-ability group (29%). The large number of above-average ability students in low motivation profiles should be investigated further, as this condition is likely to hamper the development of potential. This group is less likely to develop science-specific talents than the group of above-average ability SCIENCE MOTIVATION PROFILES p. 26 students who had high motivation. Perhaps, talent development outcomes of science education could be improved if motivation was addressed through intervention strategies. Schools could strategically address motivation to engage these above-average ability students in learning and encourage talent development in science."}, {"section_title": "Research Question #3: Profiles and STEM Occupational Plans", "text": "Another important finding was that the percentage of profile group members who planned STEM-related occupations was different in each profile group, which demonstrates a connection between students' science expectancy-value profile and STEM-related occupational\nplans. At face value, the finding that 26% of the overall student sample indicated a plan for a STEM-related occupation seems promising. However, it is important to remember that these students were in the ninth grade and must successfully navigate multiple transitions before entering the STEM workforce. For example, 34% of U. S. 25 to 29 year olds have attained a bachelor's degree (U. S. Census Bureau, 2014) and 31% of these bachelor's degrees were in the science and engineering fields (NSF, 2013 Another possible explanation for students' low expectancies and values could be that these students hold a performance orientation for schoolwork. Particularly in the contemporary high-stakes test culture that exists in K-12 education in the U. S., students have been trained that educational success is measured by how well you perform on multiple-choice tests. This promotes a performance orientation, in which effort is valued only for the immediate reward (the grade), compared to a mastery orientation in which effort is valued because of the knowledge that is gained in the process of learning. Students who hold a performance orientation would be more likely to have low utility value than those who hold a mastery orientation. Unfortunately, the HSLS: 09 questionnaires did not contain items that assessed performance or mastery orientations. Future questionnaires should include such items.\nYet another possible explanation for above-average ability students' low science expectancies and values could be that expectancy is highly domain specific (Marsh & Hau, 2004) . It may be that students' expectancies in science are not related to math achievement, but are more related to science achievement. Furthermore, a student with high math achievement may not view him or herself as a \"science person\". In other words, the relationship between math achievement and how much the student identifies with science is small. This explanation is supported by a lower correlation between math achievement and science attainment value of than between math achievement and math attainment value in a prior study that used HSLS: 09 (Andersen, 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "First, a limitation of this study was that multiple measures of ability and achievement were not available within the HSLS: 09 data. Therefore, the math achievement score was used as a proxy for above-average ability. Above-average ability was operationalized as a score greater than or equal to +1z on the math achievement test. This operationalization may differ from other definitions because it is based solely on math achievement. It may be that some of these students have higher abilities in non-STEM domains than in mathematics and this could explain low were not included in the present study."}, {"section_title": "Future Research", "text": "The demographics of the expectancy-value profiles have not yet been explored. The sociocultural aspects of the expectancy-value model and the cultural differences between minority and majority high-ability students raise many questions that could be answered with further analysis of these data. In particular, these data could also be used to answer questions about the stigma of a science identity and how it is perceived by students of different race/ethnicity, gender, and SES. "}]
