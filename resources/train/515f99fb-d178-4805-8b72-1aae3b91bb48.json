[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Impact of Pre-school on Adolescents' Outcomes:\nEvidence from a Recent English Cohort * This paper investigates the relationship between attendance at nursery school and children's outcomes in adolescence. In particular, we are interested in child cognitive development at ages 11, 14 and 16, intentions towards tertiary education, economic activity in early adulthood, and in a group of non-cognitive outcomes, such as risky health behaviours (smoking, early pregnancy, use of cannabis) and personality traits (feelings and commitments about school; psychological well-being). Using matching methods to control for a very rich set of child's and family's characteristics, we find that pre-school childcare largely improves results in cognitive tests at age 11 and 14 and 16, and has a positive effect on intentions towards further education and economic activity at age 19-20. Positive effects are especially noticeable for children coming from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds.\nResults on non-cognitive outcomes are more mixed: we do not find any evidence of improvement in psychological well-being, but we do find some positive effects on health behaviours.\nJEL Classification: J13, I21"}, {"section_title": "1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The objective of this paper is to analyse the role of pre-school education on child outcomes in later life. This research question has received increasing attention among economists, especially in the United States, and is motivated by the focus on childcare policy in many Western countries. Governments have devoted a significant amount of resources towards developing early-childhood policies, with the objective of improving the well-being of children, either through the direct effects of early education on children, or through the impact of childcare on maternal employment and income, or both. This paper sheds some light on the effect of formal childcare, provided prior to compulsory education, on various outcomes, both cognitive and non-cognitive. We add to the existing literature, by providing an analysis of a recent and very rich data-set of English adolescents, and by providing evidence of long-lasting effects in various areas of the child's life.\nThe effect of parental time and home inputs on child development has been widely analysed by psychologists and sociologists (see for example McCartney, 1984 and Lamb, 1996) . A substantial body of literature has focused on maternal time vs. alternative care time and on the effect of household goods and income on children's outcomes. Economists are also interested in these topics, especially because some recent literature has showed that long term labour market outcomes, such as wages and employment, that determine lifecycle incomes, largely depend on factors and skills that are already in place by adolescence (see, for example, Cunha et al., 2006 and Keane and Wolpin, 2001 . Extensive research has showed that early cognitive achievements are strong predictors of later educational and labour market outcomes. For example, Bernal and Keane (2008) show that test scores at ages 4 and 6 are strongly correlated with the completed education for children of US single mothers. Indeed, Heckman and Masterov (2007) make a compelling case for government subsidies for intervention at an early age, for example with high quality childcare, because of the social benefits from lower crime etc. Thus, it is particularly important to analyse the role that childcare may have in later life.\nMost of the economics literature on the effect of childcare is based on UK and US cohort data, much of it quite dated. It is hard to justify extrapolating from estimates of the effect of pre-compulsory education based on data from the early Sixties or Seventies, especially given the changes over the recent decades in early educational practices and policies. Some recent UK research has relied on the Early Provision of Pre-School Education (EPPE) study of three thousand children who attended childcare institutions in the late 2 1990's. This research has been important in underpinning the extension of free part-time childcare in the UK to age 4, and now to age 3, and to support the implementation of the more general SureStart 1 policy. To date results from the official SureStart evaluation are only available for outcomes up to age 7 (NESS, 2010) . EPPE research is available up to the age of 14 (see Sylva et al 2012) . Our research, is for a cohort only a few years earlier than the EPPE children, but we adopt a matching methodology and we extend their work for outcomes at 14\nto include outcomes at 16 and beyond.\nOur analysis here is based on the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, a very rich study of a cohort of English children, mostly born in 1990, selected through their schools and interviewed for the first time in 2004. A great deal of information is collected about the child and her/his family and seven waves of data are now available. Important cognitive outcomes are merged into the data from national administrative records. A major problem with much of the existing literature is that it measures the effect on short term outcomes and there is a fear that such effects might \"fade\". The contribution of the paper derives from its ability to investigate long term outcomes. In particular, we investigate the effect of childcare on adolescent outcomes that are effectively permanent (like educational achievement) rather than on test scores per se. Moreover, such outcomes are known to have important effects on lifecycle income.\nIn this paper, we consider the effect of attending nursery school (before the child entered primary school) on a variety of outcomes in adolescence and early adulthood, controlling for a very rich set of child's and family's characteristics. We begin our analysis by looking at cognitive achievements and test scores at age 11, 14 and 16 and we exploit the richness of our data-set, analyzing the test results in various subjects. Then, we examine children's intentions to apply for university at age 17 and children's economic activity at age 19-20. We look into school outcomes more carefully, by exploiting information available on children's attitudes and efforts in school work, and general happiness of the child at school.\nWe also look at some health behaviours between 14 and 20, such as smoking, use of cannabis, teenage pregnancy and psychological well-being. Ruhm, 2008; Berger et al., 2005; and Goodman and Sianesi, 2005) .\nFollowing the most recent literature on the effect of childcare, we analyse the different impact of early education on children from various socio-economic backgrounds. In particular, we look at disadvantaged families, where disadvantage is defined in a variety of ways, and we analyse the effect of attending nursery school for them, compared to their advantaged peers. The results broadly support the idea that childcare prior to compulsory education is particularly beneficial for children who come from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds while the effect on advantaged children is less clear over the various specifications of our model.\nOur paper contributes to the existing literature in two principal ways. First, we produce new evidence, based on a large and recent dataset, consisting of a cohort of children born in 1990 and followed for seven years, starting in 2004. Second, we take into consideration a variety of outcomes, including cognitive and non-cognitive development, and we are able to follow the children in our sample until the age of 21.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the existing literature, Section 3 analyses the data and briefly presents well-being indicators.\nSection 4 discusses the estimation methods and Section 5 presents the main results. Section 6 concludes. Melhuish (2003) provides an excellent survey of a wide variety of literature for the UK and elsewhere. He focusses, in particular, on experimental and quasi-experimental work."}, {"section_title": "Overview of existing literature", "text": "He finds that the existing evidence on childcare (aged 0-2) is equivocal, while the evidence 4 on pre-school nursery education (age 3-4) points to a beneficial effect across the population with notable effects of both months of use and the quality of provision and a larger than average effect for disadvantaged groups.\nThese conclusions have largely been substantiated in more recent literature. A substantial amount of this research has looked at the effects of early childhood education on children's outcome in the United States: this literature is particularly focused on the evaluation of specific programs, targeting children from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, such as single-parent families, ethnic minorities, low income groups etc. These programs include small scale high quality models (such as the Perry Pre-School Program) as well as more general large scale programs, such as Headstart. It has generally been found that intensive, high-quality targeted interventions are generally beneficial in producing short and long term positive outcomes for disadvantaged children, in terms of educational and labour market outcomes (see for example Carneiro and Heckman, 2003; Blau and Currie, 2006 and Currie, 2001) . A few papers also examine the effect of typical preschool or kindergarten programs on school readiness and behavioural problems using specific data sets, such as the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 and generally showing positive effects on short run outcomes, such as reading and maths skills, especially for disadvantaged children (see Loeb et al., 2007 and Magnuson et al., 2007) . Table 1 summarises the main findings in the relevant literature on the effect of child care on children outcomes.\nRecent literature (see Bernal and Keane, 2010 and 2011) has used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and exploited welfare reforms around the mid 90's to provide instruments for childcare use to analyse the effect of childcare on cognitive development and to show that formal centre-based early education has positive effects on children of US single mothers.\nThe literature on the effect of early education on children more generally has produced more controversial results, especially because of the difficulty in estimating these effects using non-experimental data where only a few regressors are available to attempt to control for selection issues. Bernal and Keane (2010) provide a thoughtful discussion of the most problematic issues in the estimation of childcare effects on children's outcome and present the different approaches that have been taken by previous literature using American data, including family fixed-effects (see for example Blau, 1999) and instrumental variable estimation (see Bernal and Keane, 2011) . Recently, Berlinski et al. (2009) The first strand of literature is based on some ad hoc studies, where pre-school children were recruited and followed for a number of years. In the US, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care was initiated in 1991 and included 1,300 children followed up to their seventh year of school. Children in higher quality childcare centres were found to have better results on test scores than children in lower quality childcare arrangements but children who spent more time in childcare were also found to have more behavioural problems (see Waldfogel, 1999) . More recent research by Vandell et al (2010) looks at outcomes at age 15 from the NICHD study and find significant positive effects on educational attainment of high quality care, but not childcare per se -although these outcomes were not national tests where one might be able to claim that there would then be an established causal effect on lifecycle income. The British EPPE study was launched in 1997 and included a sample of 3,000 children from various socio-economic backgrounds, who attended a range of different preschools. The study also included around 300 'home' children with no pre-school experience at all. Children were followed until age 7 and pre-school was found to have a positive impact on cognitive and social development with a particularly positive effect on children from disadvantaged backgrounds and a stronger effect for nursery schools with a strong educational focus (see Sylva et al., 2004 by constructing a model of child care choice and using the price of child care as an instrument for the amount of hours of childcare. The authors showed that pre-school has a positive effect on cognitive abilities up to the age of 11, using the 1958 cohort. On the other hand, this analysis of the 1970 cohort suggested that pre-school has a negative effect on vocabulary when the children were 5, and reading skills when the children were 11. A recent paper by Goodman and Sianesi (2005) analyses the 1958 NCDS looking at the effect of any early education (specifically, early entry into primary school, as well as attendance of nursery schools and playgroups) on a wide range of outcomes, including cognitive achievements at age 7 through to 16, socialisation and outcomes such as wage and employment at age 33.\nThis paper aims at estimating the total policy effect of early education, using Ordinary Least Squares, Fully Interacted Model and Propensity Score Matching. The authors show a positive effect of pre-school education on test scores, diminishing in size as the children grow, while the effect on socialisation was more mixed. In adulthood, pre-compulsory education was found to increase the probabilities of obtaining qualifications and of being employed at age 33. However, most of the effects found in this paper were attributed to any pre-compulsory education, including early school entry, nursery and playgroup (or any combination of these).\nThe effects of pre-school were more mixed and not clearly identifiable.

The early childhood industry has rapidly evolved over the last three decades and many changes have taken place, in terms of pedagogy, teachers' qualifications, and focus on cognitive development. These changes make it difficult to rely on conclusions on the effects of child care based on these data, so the policy implications of these studies are limited. Therefore, our analysis fills a gap between papers based on 1958 NCDS and 1970 BCS, such as Goodman and Sianesi (2005) , that consider long lasting outcomes based on old data, and more recent studies, such as the\\ EPPE study, that use recent data but only look at the impact of pre-compulsory education on primary school results. Our outcomes span a reasonably long period of time (15 years after the end of pre-school education) while still looking at relatively recent child-care provision (1993-94 births). Our results are consistent with those presented by Goodman and Sianesi (2005) , but are focused on pre-school childcare only, rather than both pre-school and early entry into primary school."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This paper uses data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE), which is a large scale panel survey of English adolescents, interviewed for the first time when they were in school year 9 in 2004 at the age of 14 2 . The study is managed by the Department of Education and covers wide range of social policy issues. The questionnaires cover a variety of topics, including academic achievements, family relationships, attitudes toward school, family and labour market, and some sensitive or challenging issues, such as risky health behaviours (smoking, alcohol drinking, drug taking), personal relationships, etc.\nIn the first wave, selected to be representative of the young people in England, around 15,500 young people were interviewed. In the first four waves, parents/guardians were also interviewed. In addition, LSYPE can be linked to the National Pupil Database (NPD), a pupil level administrative database which matches pupil and school characteristics data to pupil level attainment and contains detailed information on test scores (Key Stage 2, Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4 or GCSE) for all pupils in England and Wales. It also contains limited data about the pupil -such as free school meal eligibility and Special Education Needs status.\nRetrospective information about the LSYPE child and the family was asked of the parent at 2 Note that grade repetition is very rare in the British school system. waves 2 and 3 and we use this to determine whether the child attended nursery school, and to provide information on the child's and family's situation at birth.

The LSYPE includes information on various outcomes, measured from adolescence to early adulthood. This allows us to attain a very complete picture of the skills and behaviours that are affected by early education. Heckman, 2012) . Therefore, we extended our analysis and take into consideration some additional outcomes such as: the intensity of effort at school; whether the child likes her/his school and teachers; the number of close friends the child has; and the psychological well-being of the child (measured through the General Health Questionnaire score 3 ).\nEconomic activity and education at age 20-21.\nHealth risky behaviours such as smoking, use of cannabis, and early pregnancy.\nProblematic behaviours such as being involved in fighting, being suspended from school, vandalism, shoplifting, being in contact with the police."}, {"section_title": "Pre-school", "text": "We are interested in investigating the effect of pre-school on various children outcomes, including cognitive development. In order to address these research questions, we use the information recorded in the LSYPE history data file where the parents are asked whether the child went to nursery school. Unfortunately, we don't have any information on how many days/hours the child spent in nursery school. Around 80% of the children in the estimation sample went to nursery school 4 . This is a very high proportion and it is likely to include children who received part-time, as well as full-time pre-school. The percentage of children attending nursery school in LSYPE is much higher than the proportion of children receiving pre-compulsory education in the NCDS (83% vs. 15%) and, as a consequence, our sample of children attending nursery school is much bigger than the one utilised by Goodman and Sianesi (2005) .\nThere is no a clear definition of nursery school in LSYPE data, but we believe that the self-reported \"nursery school\" is likely to include various forms of care in centre-based institutions, such as day care centres, local authority and independent nurseries, and even play-groups. Some will provide a formal curriculum, most will focus on play. Some will provide full time care, most will be for just for three hours most weekdays, and most will be run by professionally trained staff with little reliance on parental help.\n3 The GHQ Caseness score is constructed from the responses to 12 questions covering feelings of strain, depression, inability to cope, anxiety-based insomnia and lack of confidence. The twelve answers are combined into a total GHQ score that indicates the level of mental distress, giving a scale running from 0 (the least distressed) to 12 (the most distressed) 4 We checked this proportion with data from the Family Resource Survey. The FRS 9394 only includes 750 observations for children aged 3-5 with valid childcare answers. In this sample, around 50% of the children attend some form of structured child care and the rest is looked after by a relative or friend. We believe that this percentage is smaller than what we find in LSYPE because it does not include children who are looked after by a family member (stay at home mother, grandparent, etc.) and attend a pre-school (or nursery school) for a couple of hours per day (as the parents are likely to record the first source of child care). was left to each individual Local Authority, leading to substantial variation in provision.\nAccording to Brewer et al. (2005) provision across the country ranged from zero free precompulsory education places provided, to a high of 27.5 places per 100 children and this variation in access to nursery education persisted into the 1990s (see Dickson, 2008 for a discussion of changes to the provision of nursery places in the late 1990s)."}, {"section_title": "Other explanatory variables", "text": "This analysis exploits the extensive information available in LSYPE. We estimate three versions of our model, progressively increasing the set of independent variables. As we will discuss in greater detail in section 4, we try to capture all factors that determine early education attendance and child outcomes. All of the variables we control for are, arguably, pre-determined variables -that is, not themselves influenced by pre-school education. Inputs in children's outcomes include individual mental and physical endowments, parental and family inputs (such as income, time, size of the family and number of siblings), and local area characteristics.\nOur first, most parsimonious, model only includes at-birth characteristics such as:\nbirth-weight; whether the child was premature; ethnic background; sex of the child; month of birth; and family characteristics such as marital status and age of the mother at birth. In the second model we include other family's characteristics (measured at wave 1, which are unlikely to have changed since the child's birth) such as: main language of the family, maternal education; child's and mother's disability; grandparents' education and older siblings. In the last model we include some characteristics at wave 1 such as: younger siblings; maternal working and marital status; household income; family size; local authority binary variables and whether the child has ever been in care. Table 4 presents the distribution of pre-school and all the independent variables included in our model, by socio-economic status. Not surprisingly, disadvantaged children are less likely to have attended nursery school. Their mothers are more likely to be poorly educated, out of the labour market, and single. Table 5 presents the distribution of outcomes, split by nursery school attendance. On average, children who went to pre-school perform better than those who didn't receive early education in all test-scores and they are more likely to be happy with their school and teachers and put lots of effort into school work. They also have an average higher number of friends, more likely to have applied for university at 17\nand less likely to have ever tried smoking. However, no significance difference is found in terms of university attendance. Children who went to nursery seem less likely to be out of education or employment when they reach the age of 20-21 and less likely to be engaging in problematic behaviours. "}, {"section_title": "Estimation", "text": "We begin our analysis by estimating a linear regression to examine the effect of preschool education on children outcomes. The linear model can be written as:\n, where C it represents a particular outcome, N i is a binary variable equal to 1 if the child attended nursery school and X i is a vector of child's and family's characteristics. We use linear probability models rather than nonlinear probit or similar.\nThe major challenge in this analysis is establishing causal connections between pre-school education and child outcomes, given that children did not receive early education through random assignment and the children who went to nursery school may have unobserved characteristics which also affect their cognitive development or other outcomes. Furthermore,"}, {"section_title": "16", "text": "mothers who worked and decided to send their child to nursery school may be systematically different from those who did not, and their child's cognitive ability can itself influence mothers' decisions. However, a significant percentage of children in our sample went to nursery school (around 85%) so this group is likely to include children with working mothers (both part-time and full-time), as well some children with stay-at-home mothers. For these reasons, we think of OLS as providing an upper bound to the causal effects.\nThe effect of nursery school on children's outcomes may be estimated correctly through OLS if several assumptions are true. First, the \"selection on observables\" assumption must be satisfied (see Heckman, 1979) . This means that all variables that predict both preschool attendance and children's outcomes should be included in our model. These variables are sometimes called \"confounding variables\" because if they are not appropriately controlled for, their effect on the outcomes is confounded with the effect of the causing variable of interest (see Angrist and Krueger, 1999) . Second, the model must be correctly specified: this is very problematic, as assumptions like linearity and additivity are really hard to verify when we include several independent variables. Further, if there is a lack of overlap in covariate distributions across children who went and did not go to nursery school -that is, if there are children who went to pre-school for whom there are no comparable children who did not go to nursery school-linear regression models extrapolate results over portions of the distribution where there is no support (comparing incomparable children).\nWe cannot, in this data, address the selection on unobservables problem. There is simply no quasi-experimental variation across our sample to exploit. However, we can go some way towards addressing the other problems. Firstly, we try to lower the upper bound provided by OLS estimation, through the inclusion of a progressively more detailed set of independent variables. Second, we exploit propensity score matching, that does not strongly rely on functional form assumptions and restricts inference to samples where we can find overlap in the distribution of covariates across the treatment (i.e. going to nursery school).\nIn order to estimate the effect of pre-school education on children's outcomes, we would ideally need to compare the average outcomes for children who went to nursery with the average outcomes for the same children had they not received pre-school education.\nHowever, the latter is an unobserved counterfactual and the evaluation problem is to provide unbiased estimates of this average counterfactual using appropriate methods and assumptions. The idea of propensity score matching is to find a group of children who did not go to nursery school that looks as similar as possible to our treatment group (children who went to nursery school). More specifically, firstly we estimate the conditional probability of going to nursery school (being in the treatment group) for each child, given our covariates. This is called the propensity score. Then, estimated propensity scores are used to create a matched control group and for each treated child we find the comparison member with the closest propensity score. Non matched individuals are dropped from the analysis. Our analysis is performed using psmatch2 5 and appropriate tests have been run, in order to compare covariate distribution across our matched groups to ensure that adequate has been obtained. Results from the balancing tests are shown in the Appendix.\nMatching is more robust than OLS because it does not restrict the way in which nursery school may affect child outcomes to be linear, and inference is limited to samples that are effectively comparable, based on the covariates distribution. Matching attaches appropriate weights to the observations in the control group, so that the distribution of their observable characteristics is realigned to the treatment group."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Results from the estimation of the effect of pre-school education on child outcomes are presented in Tables 6 to 9. Appendix Table A2 presents the results in terms of percentage of standard deviations. Table 6 presents results on the effect of pre-school education on cognitive development and test scores for the whole sample. Results are then split by sex of the child and by various indicators of socio-economic disadvantage in Tables 7 and 8 . Pre-school education generally has a positive effect on test scores at age 11, 14 and 16 and the sizes of the effects are notable. The positive effects are found both for average test scores and separately for maths and language skills. In model 2 and model 3, nursery school attendance generally increases average Key Stage 2, Key Stage 3 and GCSE scores by about 6-7 per cent of a standard deviation. The size of these effects is comparable with some other important characteristics, such as birth-weight, sex of the child, number of older siblings or parental disability.\nThe estimation with propensity score matching yields similar results, with the exception of the effect on Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 scores, which become insignificantly different from zero. Interestingly, the magnitude of the effect is higher for language skills (between 8 and 10 per cent of a standard deviation) rather than mathematics or science skills Table 6 Effect of pre-school on cognitive development (Whole sample) "}, {"section_title": "NA", "text": "Notes: Standard errors are in brackets + indicates that the underlying coefficient is significant at 10% level, * at 5% and **at 1%. Model 3 was not estimated for KS2 as KS2 is achieved at age 11 and Model 3 includes variables measured at wave 1 (age 14). Nursery attendance also increases the number of GCSE subjects with A*-C scores (around 8 per cent of a standard deviation) , as well as probability of getting A*-C in English (by around 5 percentage points) and Maths (by around 4 percentage points) in GCSE exams.\nOur results are consistent with Goodman and Sianesi (2005) , who find that obtaining education before age 5 is associated with an increase of 7 per cent of a standard deviation in average test scores at age 11. Positive effect of nursery school can be mediated through a variety of factors, including early exposure to literacy and numeracy and socialisation. Also, the children may build up independence and self-confidence and get used to school routines and this is an advantage and enhance their learning when they are in formal education.\nInterestingly, our results do not show any fading effect when the children grow up and nursery attendance seems to be beneficial in increasing the probability of applying to university at age 17-18 and being actually attending university at 19-20.\nResults are then split by sex of the child in table 7. Nursery attendance seems to be particularly beneficial for girls, while the effects on boys' test scores are not significantly different from zero. In Table 8 , we analyse the effect of nursery education by socio-economic status. Pre-school education is highly beneficial for children coming from disadvantaged On the other hand, the effect on children from advantaged backgrounds is significantly different from zero only when we estimate model 1 and when we look at the probability of being in university at age 19-20. These results are consistent with other findings in the literature looking at the impact of child care on children's development. Preschool education seems to be particularly positive for children experiencing a poor and disadvantaged environment at home, as they get significant benefits from the exposure to a positive learning environment. Also, they are more likely to get intellectual stimulation and early exposure to numeracy and literacy during their time at nursery. The size of these effects is considerable and does not vanish as these children get older.\nWe also find considerable evidence showing that pre-school education is particularly useful for children having siblings rather than only children (results are not presented for parsimony, but are available on request). This result might be driven by the fact that only children receive more attention within the family and do not derive as much advantage from pre-school. Table 9 presents results from the estimation of the effect of pre-school education on non-cognitive outcomes. Results are estimated with OLS and PSM and independent variables from Model 2. The evidence on non-cognitive outcomes is more mixed than we found for test scores. Nursery attendance generally increases the number of friends and children's satisfaction and effort at school at age 14. It also decreases the risk of not being in education or employment at 20-21 by around 1 p.p. Children who went to nursery school also seem less likely to have engaged in health risky behaviours such smoking or cannabis use when they are 14. On the other hand, we do not find any significant effect on psychological well-being, problematic behaviours, or the risk of being suspended from school.\nAppendix Table A1 presents results for the effect of other independent variables in Model 2 on Key Stage 2, Key Stage 3 and Number of GCSE subjects with grade A*-C. As expected, there is a strong education gradient so that children with more educated mothers (or with grandparents who went to university) are more likely to have higher test scores.

We make extensive use of the amount of information contained in LSYPE and gradually increase our set of independent variables, in order to control for all factors affecting both school outcomes and nursery attendance. Our results are stable over different specifications of our model. Propensity Score Matching allow us to find a group of children who did not go to nursery school that looks as similar as possible to our treatment group (children who went to nursery school), given our independent variables. We can then compare outcomes between these two groups and check whether there are any significant differences.\nThis analysis has some important policy implications and fills the gap in the existing Table A3 shows results from balance tests of the estimation performed with Model 2 (Outcome: Number of GCSE with A*-C). The output shows two rows for each variableunmatched and matched. In each row, it shows the mean of the variable for the treatment group and the mean for the control group. It also shows the \"%bias,\" which is the standardized bias. This \"bias\" is defined as the difference of the mean values of the treatment group and the (not matched / matched) non treatment group, divided by the square root of the average sample variance in the treatment group and the not matched non treatment group.\nThe table also shows the % reduction in bias, which is how much of this bias was eliminated by matching. In our example, we have very few variables exhibiting negative values for this column (meaning that the bias increased as a result of matching) and these are mostly cases in which the bias was already very low before matching.\nTo assess balance, one should look at both the bias and the mean differences between treatment and control in the matched sample. In our example, the bias is significantly reduced after matching (the mean goes from 5.38 to 1.65)\nThe last two columns presents results from a t-test on the hypothesis that the mean value of each variable is the same in the treatment group and the non-treatment group. It is done before and after matching. If p>0.1, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected on the 10% significance level. The null hypothesis that the mean values of the two groups do not differ after matching cannot be rejected for most of the variables included in our analysis. By matching, the differences between treatment group and non-treatment group are reduced considerably.
