Education must be developed continuously in accordance with the times. Quality education is education that can bring students to achieve educational functions and goals. Efforts to improve the quality of education are things that cannot be negotiated in order to improve the quality of Indonesia's human resources.\nIn addition to realizing quality human beings, education is also an integral part of development. Quality human beings can be the driving force for achieving development progress. Based on this, it is clear that education has a purpose to form advanced people. Along with the goal of improving human quality, schools as formal institutions have functions and responsibilities in realizing a good and quality education process. Therefore, various components of education in schools must function optimally.\nThe quality of Indonesian education is still far compared with neighbor countries. Based on the results of studies of international institutions shows that Indonesian students' mathematics literacy is still low compared to other countries. It was based on the study of Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) which put Indonesia at the bottom position, which was ranked on 45 from 50 participating countries in TIMSS [1] and in the rank of 63 from 70 countries in PISA.\nThe low achievements in mathematics based on the TIMSS and PISA related to the Indonesian students are not able to do the TIMSS and PISA tests well. The results of the analysis indicate that the cause of it is most of the tested questions are included in the category of non-routine questions. That is, to solve it needed further thought because the procedure is not as clear or unlike the procedures studied in the class [2] . Indonesian students were not trained to do non-routine questions. Learning was still dominated by simple problems, in terms of problems with a clear solution, namely the problem with a single solution.\nIt was not open-ended. It could be said as a routine question, which the exercise question could be solved by the procedures learned in the classroom [2] . As a result, Indonesian students are weak to think critically in identifying new problems, to seek and develop materials or ideas, and to solve them uses settlement procedures. The various abilities of high-level thinking, are significant difficulties in thinking critically.\nCritical thinking was a way of thinking, and a set of skills, to encourage an informed, conscious, systemic, considered and logical approach to decide what to be believed or done. Critical thinking led to valid arguments and conclusions. It reinforced to criticism [3] . Critical thinking was also defined as a process of active intellectual discipline, and skilled conceptualization in applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating collected or generated information through observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a set of guides to have a belief and some [4] .\nCritical thinking is a learned skill that requires instruction and practice [5] . Because critical thinking is a mental habit that requires students to think about their thinking and about improving the process, it requires students to use higher order thinking skills not memorize data or accept what they read or are told without critically thinking about it [6] . Therefore, critical thinking is a product of education, training, and practice [5] .\nAccording to Facione [7] , the most basic concept of critical thinking is the ability of interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, explanation, and self-regulation. While critical thinking skills by Onosko and Newmann [8] may challenge the students to interpret, analyze or manipulate information. Therefore, the critical thinking skills needed when we try to understand something of information that will be used for the triggering of ideas [8] . Similarly, critical thinking requires a student to use new information or manipulate existing knowledge and information so as to obtain reasonable responses to new situations [9] [10]. Ennis [8] opined that critical thinking is reflective thinking that focused on patterns of decision making about what must be believed and what must be done. In the context of mathematical problem solving, Krulik and Rudnick [11] stated that critical thinking is analytical thinking and reflection that involving testing activities, questioning, connecting and evaluating all aspects of a situation or problem. Critical thinking skills are very important in mathematics learning because these skills can improve the quality of mathematics learning in better and meaningful, so, therefore, should be a systematic way to develop such skills through mathematics learning in school [12] .\nBased on some previous definitions, it can be concluded that critical thinking is a process of applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating collected or generated information through observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, to have a result in valid and strong arguments and conclusions resistant to be criticism.\nCritical thinking skill was important because it enabled students to deal effectively with social, scientific, and practical problems [13] . Simply it puts, students, to be able to think critically and to the solve problems effectively. Having knowledge or information is not enough. To be effective in the workplace (and in their personal lives), is needed. Students must be able to solve problems to make effective decisions, and they must be able to think critically.\nThe concept of mathematics is obtained because the thinking process, so that the skills of deep thinking (critical thinking) need to be developed in the learning of mathematics. This is in accordance with the objectives of school mathematics education which emphasizes the arrangement of children's reasoning and the formation of children. Therefore in the process of learning mathematics, it is influenced by the ability to think. Where mathematics material and critical thinking skills are two things that cannot be separated because the mathematical material is understood through critical thinking and critical thinking trained through learning mathematics. The mathematical material is composed of interrelated concepts. To solve a mathematical problem, one or more concepts are needed. To be able to understand mathematical concepts and solve a problem, it is necessary to have the ability to think critically, without the ability to think critically students will not be able to solve problems and understand mathematical concepts maximally. Conversely, to be able to have critical thinking skills, one of them can be trained through learning mathematics, by solving open-ended problems. Thus it is clearly seen that there is a relationship between the mathematics learning process and critical thinking.\nCritical thinking is so important. So, it needs to know the level of critical thinking of students. By knowing the level of critical thinking students can be used as guidelines by educators to formulate an action related to the learning process that will be implemented. The measurement of critical thinking skills can be carried out using a test instrument that includes completion steps and indicators of critical thinking.\nThe main critical thinking theory used in the preparation of this test instrument is the critical thinking indicator developed by Ennis. Ennis [8] describes that critical thinking as a process that the aims were to make reasonable decisions so that the thinking was to be best about the truth that is done rightly. There were six basic elements to be considered in critical thinking are synchronized with FRISCO, namely Focus, Reason, Inference, Situation, Clarify, and Overview. Ennis also mentioned that critical thinking skills related to mathematics learning in the classroom. It was divided into two indicators, namely the general indicator and indicators that related to the content [8] . But in a line of indicators, these indicators could be grouped into five major activities, namely: elementary clarification, basic support, interference, advanced clarification, and strategy and tactics.\nAnother applied theory was Bloom's Taxonomy [14] which had been revised by Anderson & Krathwohl [15] which contained six stages of thinking: a) a) remembering, b) understanding, c) applying, (d) analyzing, e) evaluating, and f) creating. [11] .\nFrom the description above, the authors intend to conduct research on the development of mathematical test instruments to measure critical thinking skills. The research problems are: 1) How to develop the mathematics test instruments to measure critical thinking skills? and 2) How is the valid, practical, and effective mathematics test instrument to measure critical thinking skills? Whereas the aim to be achieved in this study is to describe the stages of developing a mathematical test instrument to measure critical thinking skills and produce a valid, practical and effective mathematical test instrument to measure critical thinking skills.\nThis research is a research or development (R & D) research. The development model used in this study is a model developed by Borg & Gall [16] a major development model, which is modified with several other models such as Dick & Carey's model [17] and Kemp's model [18] . Further modification of the development model resulted in a new development model called RRD (Real Research and Development). The study was conducted in OctoberDecember 2016. The research locations were in six schools in Pacitan, They were SMA N 2 Pacitan, SMA N Punung, SMA N, SMA N 1 Ngadirojo, SMA N 2 Ngadirojo, and SMA N Tegalombo.
