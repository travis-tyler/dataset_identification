[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Vitamin B12 is an important cofactor in one-carbon metabolism whose dysregulation is associated with various clinical conditions. Indians have a high prevalence of B12 deficiency but little is known about the genetic determinants of circulating B12 concentrations in Indians.

It acts as a cofactor for the ubiquitous reaction in OCM catalysed by methionine synthase which converts homocysteine to methionine using methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and thus plays an important role in regulating homocysteine concentrations (2, 4) . Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for neural tube defects, fetal growth restriction, and cardiovascular diseases (1, 2) . Vitamin B12 cannot be synthesized in humans and is available only through food and the intestinal microbiota (1, 5, 6) . Low dietary intake, defective absorption, changes in microbiota and genetic factors predispose to B12 deficiency (1, 7) . In the western world, pernicious anaemia is the commonest cause of B12 deficiency and leads to a severe clinical condition (8) . On the other hand, a large number of apparently healthy Indians, both vegetarians and non-vegetarians show B12 deficiency due to low intake of animal origin foods (9) (10) (11) . We have shown an association between low maternal B12 status and increased risk of neural tube defects, fetal growth restriction, neurocognitive developmental deficits, and increased insulin resistance in the offspring (12) (13) (14) .\nSeveral studies have demonstrated strong heritability of plasma B12 concentrations suggesting a significant genetic contribution (15) . Consistent with these observations, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Europeans and Chinese have identified several loci associated with plasma B12 concentrations (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Indians have a unique dietary, socio-cultural and genetic diversity that may influence B12 concentrations but the genetic contribution to plasma B12 concentrations has hardly been investigated. We conducted a GWAS of plasma B12 concentrations in 1001 healthy individuals of Indo-European origin from Western India and replicated top hits as well as previously reported loci in 3418 individuals of different ages and of both Indo-European and Dravidian ethnicity. The overall aim was to identify new signals, carry out fine mapping by defining a credible set of variants to prioritize possible causal variants and understand the molecular mechanism through which the variants influence B12 concentrations."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Clinical and demographic details of the stage I study samples, parents of children in Pune Maternal Nutrition Study (PMNS) (21) , are shown in Table 1 .

Conditional analysis of rs602662 and rs601338 confirmed that the association of rs281379 is explained by its strong LD with them (Table 3) .

In-silico transcription factor binding analysis using JASPAR database demonstrated differential binding affinity of HNF4a and HNF4c in the alternate allelic background of rs78060698. The binding score of HNF4a (15.554) for the B12 raising 'A' allele of rs78060698 was 1.18 fold higher against that of the 'G' allele (score \u00bc 13.20). We noted complete abolition of HNF4c binding to the 'G' allele while the binding score for the 'A' allele was 13.973. But no allelic differences on transcription binding prediction was noted for rs3760775. Of the two previously reported SNPs, rs3760776 was positioned at the promoter region of FUT6, with strong enrichment of DNase I hypersensitive and transcription factor binding sites, but rs708686 was intergenic between 5'-FUT6 and 3'-FUT3 and not marked with DNase I hypersensitive or transcription factor binding sites (Fig. 3) . No allele-specific differential binding of transcription factors were noted for either rs3760776 or rs780686 variants.\nObservations from the bioinformatics prediction were further validated through pGL4 luciferase reporter assay in HepG2 cell line. The region encompassing both new variants, rs3760775 and rs78060698 showed enhancer activity compared to the basic enhancer vector pGL4.23, but allele-specific differences were noticed only for rs78060698 (Fig. 4) . Compared to the basal promoter construct pGL4.23, the 'A' and 'G' alleles at rs78060698 showed 20.1 times and 5.7 times enhancer activity respectively, indicating a 3.5 fold higher enhancer activity for the B12 raising 'A' allele (P \u00bc 1.1\u00c210 \u00c03 ) (Fig. 4) . The rs78060698 region also showed strong promoter activity with the B12 raising 'A' allele having $3.0 times higher promoter activity than the 'G' allele (P \u00bc 1.6\u00c210 \u00c04 ). The 'A' allele had 19.4 times and 'G' allele had 6.4 times higher promoter activity compared to the basal pGL4.10 vector (Fig. 4) . Further investigation by EMSA revealed relatively higher protein binding (shift) to the 'A' allele than the 'G' allele and shift pattern was comparable to the HNF4a consensus binding (Fig. 5A ). Using HNF4a antibody super-shift assay, we identified a strong super-shift band for the 'A' allele compared to the 'G' allele, confirming that the allelic differential activity of enhancer and promoter was due to differential binding of HNF4a at alternate alleles of the FUT6 variant, rs78060698 (Fig. 5B) . The region bearing the other new variant, rs3760775 demonstrated enhancer activity ($ 6 times) compared to basic pGL4.23, but no significant allele-specific differences were noted (P \u00bc 0.39) (Fig. 4) . Although, a significant promoter activity compared to the basic pGL4.10 ($2.7 times) was noted for the previously reported SNP rs3760776, allele specific differences were absent (P \u00bc 0.40) (Fig. 4) . However, the region showed weak enhancer activity with significant allelic differences; the vitamin B12 raising 'T' allele had 2.2 times and 'C' allele had 1.3 times higher enhancer activity compared to basal pGL4.23 thus, the B12-raising 'T' allele had 1.7 times the enhancer activity of the other allele (P \u00bc 0.007) (Fig. 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the first two-stage genome-wide association study of circulating vitamin B12 concentrations in the Indian population, we have made two significant observations. First, we identified GWAS-significant new variants, rs78060698 and rs3760775 in FUT6 gene and rs281379 in FUT2 gene and secondly, demonstrated a functional mechanism through which one of the new variant, rs78060698 in FUT6 may influence plasma B12 concentrations. These variants had similar effect size across ethnicity, age and gender, indicating that they are likely to play a causal role in determining B12 concentrations. This is in addition to replicating associations of many of the variants in 13 established plasma B12-associated loci.\nGenome-wide association studies in Europeans and Chinese have made significant contributions towards understanding genetic determinants of B12 concentrations (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . However, the new FUT6 variants, rs3760775 and rs78060698 identified as independent signals through conditional analysis in this study were not reported by either of them, although we replicated the association of previously reported FUT6 variants, rs3760776 in Chinese and rs708686 in Europeans. While the new variants were replicated in-silico with a suggestive association in Icelandic subjects (Grarup, 2013) , the association was not replicated in the Europeans from InCHIANTI and BLSA cohorts (Tanaka 2009 ) (17, 20) . We can only speculate the possible reasons. Both variants have significantly lower frequency of the effect allele and effect size compared to the present study, hence, they were not identified as primary GWAS signals in small sample size in the InCHIANTI and BLSA cohorts but reached significance in a study on a large number of Icelandic subjects. The allele frequencies of these four SNPs were highest in Indians, possibly providing adequate power to detect the association at GWAS significance. In addition, the LD structure of the credible set variants with the previously reported Chinese and European SNPs are different in South Asian, East Asian and European populations with the strongest overall correlation in South Asians. We speculate that the population specificity of these variants might be due to differences in effect allele frequency and the LD structure in the three populations (25) (26) (27) . Replication of these SNPs in three different populations suggests that there might be shared common causal variants, either coding or regulatory variants in this region with unique lead variants and variable LD structure (28) . In addition to these two SNPs, credible set and fine mapping analysis of the region identified 6 other variants, of which rs17855739, a missense FUT6 variant that shows strongest association in Europeans is known to cause FUT6 deficiency (24) . We also replicated associations of previously reported loci, especially those involved in B12 absorption and transport such as TCN1, TCN2, CUBN and MMAA, with similar direction of effect (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Some of the reported variants could not be replicated, possibly due to the modest effect size or low power of the study samples and variability in LD structure. It is noteworthy that effect of genetic factors on B12 concentration was consistent despite the differences in age, gender and the presence or absence of physiological state like pregnancy and persisted despite a progressive fall in concentration with increasing age in two independent cohorts which have different ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics (21, 22) . These observations support a strong contribution of genetic factors in the determination of circulating B12 levels. Overall, the study provides evidence that there are common genetic determinants of vitamin B12 concentrations in different ethnic groups, although population-specific variants also exist and should be investigated for their causal role.\nWe investigated the possible molecular mechanism by which rs78060698 and rs3760775, and the earlier reported SNP rs3760776 might influence B12 concentrations. True to the bioinformatic prediction, all three FUT6 SNPs showed promoter and/or enhancer activity but significant allele-specific differences were noted only for rs78060698. This variant, in alternate Arrows indicate the shift and supershift bands. NE, nuclear extract from HepG2 cells; HNF4a con; HNF4a consensus sequence; Ab, Antibody.\nallelic states, also differentially influences the binding affinity of HNF4a and HNF4c. HNF4a is a key regulator of FUT6 expression and its knockdown represses the expression of FUT6, and nearby genes FUT3 and FUT5 in HepG2 cell line (29, 30) . This cluster of FUT genes encodes the a1,3/4 fucosyltransferase family of proteins which add fucose to the GlcNAc moiety in the glycan chain (31) . Fucose moiety in the intestinal tract has an important role in maintaining host-microbial interaction, microbial abundance and diversity (32) (33) (34) . Thus, the rs78060698 variant might play a crucial role in maintaining the glycan structure and their metabolism thereby mediating intestinal host-microbial interaction leading to alteration of plasma B12 concentrations (35, 36) . The other possibility, of an influence of fucosyltransferases on B12 concentrations, may be mediated through the glycosylation of B12 binding proteins and their receptors including TCN1, GIF, CUBN and CD320 etc. (37-39) . However, the mechanism through which the fucosyltransferases act upon these B12 binding proteins and their receptors is unclear and needs to be investigated further. Our observations add to the growing evidence of the existence of multiple functional regulatory variants in an association signal (40) (41) (42) .\nThe three new variants in FUT6 and FUT2 together explained 3.85% and the eight independently associated SNPs explained 8.36% of the variability in plasma B12 concentrations, indicating a large undetermined proportion of the heritability of total vitamin B12 concentrations. Although we identified three new variants and replicated many previously reported variants, the study had some limitations. Our discovery stage sample size is relatively small and hence we may have failed to discover novel genetic regions in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency. Secondly, a large proportion of low vitamin B12 concentrations in Indians might be contributed by various factors including undernutrition and strict vegetarian habits that might mask the effect of genetic factors on vitamin B12 concentrations.\nIn summary, this study reports new variants in a previously reported genomic region of FUT6 and stresses the importance of population-specific genetic variants in the background of common genetic determinants of vitamin B12 concentrations. We also demonstrate their possible functional mechanism through differential binding with HNF4a and thus regulation of expressions of FUT6 and other fucosyltransferases. Further functional analysis of other reported variants and their interaction with environmental factors will help elucidate the complex interplay between fucosyltransferases, glycan metabolism, host-microbe interaction and determination of B12 concentrations."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Participants", "text": "We followed a two-stage study design to conduct a GWAS of plasma B12 concentrations.

Samples and SNPs with a call rate <95% and SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) <5% and HWE P < 0.001 were excluded and a total of 6,23,209 SNPs were used for further analysis. Genome-wide imputation was carried out by IMPUTE2 (v2.2; https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/im pute/impute_v2.html) using all the individuals across 26 populations in the 1000 Genomes phase 3 (November 2015 release) as the reference panel (46) . For imputation quality control, we applied impute2 info score ! 0.3, genotype probability threshold of 90%, call rate of 95% and 99% for SNPs with MAF > 5% and MAF < 5%, respectively. Finally, 8.9 million QC passed SNPs having MAF > 0.001were used for association analysis. Association analysis of genotyped and imputed SNPs was performed using PLINK (v1.07) and SNPTEST (v2.5.2), respectively (47, 48) . We applied Frequentist association test with score method to account for probable uncertainty in the imputed genotypes. To account for ancestry and population structure, we further adjusted the association analysis for first ten principal components and finally, compared the results with mixed linear model association analysis using mlma-loco in GCTA software (49) ."}, {"section_title": "SNP Selection and Replication Analysis", "text": "We used various criteria for choosing SNPs from stage I data for replication analysis. SNPs with P < 10 \u00c04 were considered, and in a region harboring multiple SNPs in strong LD (r 2 >0.8), the most significant ones were selected. We further performed gene based association analysis using Versatile Gene-based Association Studies (VEGAS) (50) and genes with P < 0.01 and/or their proxy SNPs with P < 10 \u00c04 were included for replication genotyping. A more stringent P < 10 \u00c05 was used for selecting SNPs from the gene-desert regions. A total of 41 SNPs including 24 SNPs from stage I, and 17 previously reported variants, were selected for replication (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1 ).\nGenotyping was performed on Fluidigm SNP 96.96 genotyping system and both samples and SNPs with <90% call rate, and SNPs with HWE P < 0.001 were removed from the association analysis. We carried out independent association analysis on replication genotype data for each cohort and final results were combined by meta-analysis using fixed effects models."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "PCA on LD-pruned SNPs (r 2 <0.2) was performed by SVS Golden Helix and extreme outliers (with 64 standard deviation (SD) of the first two principal components were excluded from the association analysis (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1 ). Plasma B12 concentrations were adjusted for age and sex, and the residual standardized B12 was inverse normal transformed using STATA. Associations between inverse normal transformed B12 concentrations with SNPs were performed by linear regression using an additive model of minor allele by PLINK (v.1.07) (47) . Meta-analysis of summary statistics from stage I and replication data was performed using an inverse variance-weighted approach implemented in STATA using command 'metan'. Conditional analysis was performed in the regions where multiple SNPs showed an association by adjusting the top SNP or the previously established variant in the regression model. The results after the conditional analysis from each of the replication cohorts were combined by meta-analysis. The variants showing meta-analysis P 0.01 were considered independent signals. A genetic score (GS), weighted for the respective effect size (beta coefficient from the meta-analysis stage) of each SNP, was calculated using 8 independently associated SNPs identified from the conditional analysis. The SNPs used were rs12780845 in CUBN, rs602662 in FUT2, rs708686 and rs3760775 in FUT6, rs2270655 in MMAA, rs34324219 and rs34528912 in TCN1 & rs1131603 in TCN2 and the genotypes were coded according to the additive effect of the B12-raising alleles. The weighted GS was calculated as follows:\nSum of weights of all the SNPs\nSum of weighted score of all SNPs\nWeighted genetic score\u00bc Sum of weighted score of all SNPs \u00c2 total number of SNPs \u00c0 total missing SNPs \u00f0 \u00de Sum of weights of all the SNPs The GS was further grouped into quartiles and the B12 concentrations were compared between these quartiles in PMNS and PS children at different ages. HaploView (v.4.2) (51) was used to perform LD analysis for our data and the LD structure of other populations was taken from the 1000 Genomes phase 3 data for comparison.

For each SNP, we measured the Bayes factor which is the ratio between the probabilities of SNP under the alternative hypothesis that the SNP is associated with the phenotype and under the null hypothesis that it is not associated with the phenotype (53) . The value of the Bayes factor is directly correlated with the strength of SNP-phenotype association. To identify the most probable causal SNP or set of SNPs in a genomic region, we calculated the posterior probability of each SNP as mentioned (54) . The 95% credible set for a genomic region was constructed by ranking all the SNPs according to their Bayes factor value and accumulating the posterior probabilities of rank variants to attain 0.95 or more (55) ."}, {"section_title": "Tracking analysis", "text": "PMNS and PS are prospective cohort studies in which parents and children have been followed up at different stages, and demographic, anthropometric and biochemical data have been collected as described above (21, 22) .

Comparison of plasma B12 concentrations at different time points was performed using paired ttests. Analysis of genetic associations of identified SNPs and GS (calculated from 8 independently associated SNPs) with B12 concentrations at different follow-up stages was performed using linear regression, adjusted for age and sex. Quantile based association analysis was also performed to compare between the lowest and highest GS."}, {"section_title": "Bioinformatics and Functional Analysis", "text": "We investigated the LD relationship between the SNPs in different populations using the 1000 Genomes phase 3 data. LD plots were generated using LDlink and regional association plots were drawn using LocusZoom (46, 56, 57) . Bioinformatic analysis of transcription factor binding and functional prediction of regulatory elements was conducted using the UCSC genome browser, the JASPAR database and HaploReg (v4.1) (58-60). Based on bioinformatic predictions, we performed luciferase reporter assays in HepG2 cell line for promoter and enhancer activity by cloning the genomic region encompassing the new variants, rs3760775 and rs78060698 as well as the previously reported variant, rs3760776 in pGL4.10 and pGL4.23 vector respectively (Promega, USA). Primers were designed using Primer Blast and Primer3 to amplify specific regions and site-directed mutagenesis was performed if the amplified genomic region contained any other SNP (Supplementary Material, Table S5 ). The amplified genomic regions were cloned by digestion with Kpn1, Xho1 or Sac1 as required and ligated to the multiple cloning site of respective luciferase vectors. The clones were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and transfected with internal control vector pRL-TK in the molar ratio of 15:1 and cell lysate was collected 24 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured using PerkinElmer EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader.\nElectrophoretic-mobility shift assay (EMSA) for rs78060698 alleles was conducted using nuclear extract (NE) from HepG2 cell line. Harvested HepG2 cells ($10 8 cells) were incubated with 5 ml cell lysis buffer and buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.8; 1.5 mM MgCl 2 ; 10 mM KCl; 0.5 mM DTT; and 1X Protease inhibitor) for 30 min on ice. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm after 10 strokes of Dounce homogenizer. The resulting nuclei were resuspended in 500 ll of buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8; 25% (v/v) glycerol; 0.42 M NaCl; 1.5 mM MgCl 2 ; 0.2 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM DTT; and 1X Protease inhibitor) and incubated for 1 h on ice. NE was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 C. Primers for EMSA were designed such that the SNP was positioned at the centre with a 15/16-base overhang on either side (Supplementary Material, Table S5 ). Double stranded (ds) oligonucleotides were obtained by incubating the forward and reverse oligonucleotides (50 ll of 50 pmol/ll each) at 95 C for 2 min and gradually cooling to 37 C. The oligo probes were radiolabeled by incubating 25 pmoles of ds oligo with 2.5 ul of c 32 P-ATP and 10 units of T4 polynucleotidekinase (PNK) in 1X PNK buffer for 1 h at 37 C and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a sephadex G-25 column. A binding reaction was set up with 5 lg of NE, 1 ll of labeled oligo, 1X Binding buffer (20mM HEPES, pH 7.9; 15% (v/v) ficol; 150 mM KCl; 1 mM EDTA; and 0.5 mM DTT), 0.5 ll of poly-dIdC (1 mg/ml) and 0.5 ll of yeast tRNA (1 mg/ml) in a total volume of 20 ll, on ice, for 1 h. For the super-shift assay, 1 lg of different antibodies (HNF1a (C19: sc6547x), HNF4a (S20: sc-6557x) and HNF3b (H150: sc-20692); Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added after 30 min incubation, followed by additional incubation for 90 min. The reaction mixtures were finally run on 6% TBE polyacraylamide gel with 0.5X TBE running buffer (pH 7.5) for about 8 h at 100V at 4 C. The resulting shift and super-shift bands were visualized by autoradiography using PMI Bio-Rad phosphoimager."}]
