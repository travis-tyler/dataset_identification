Understanding the biological basis for this heterogeneity is key for developing personalized medicine. We identified atrophy subtypes in Alzheimer's disease dementia and tested whether these subtypes are already present in prodromal Alzheimer's disease and could explain interindividual differences in cognitive decline. First we retrospectively identified atrophy subtypes from structural MRI with a data-driven cluster analysis in three datasets of patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia: discovery data (dataset 1: n = 299, age = 67 AE 8, 50% female), and two independent external validation datasets (dataset 2: n = 181, age = 66 AE 7, 52% female; dataset 3: n = 227, age = 74 AE 8, 44% female). Subtypes were compared on clinical, cognitive and biological characteristics. Next, we classified prodromal Alzheimer's disease participants (n = 603, age = 72 AE 8, 43% female) according to the best matching subtype to their atrophy pattern, and we tested whether subtypes showed cognitive decline in specific domains. In all Alzheimer's disease dementia datasets we consistently identified four atrophy subtypes: (i) medial-temporal predominant atrophy with worst memory and language function, older age, lowest CSF tau levels and highest amount of vascular lesions; (ii) parieto-occipital atrophy with poor executive/attention and visuospatial functioning and high CSF tau; (iii) mild atrophy with best cognitive performance, young age, but highest CSF tau levels; and (iv) diffuse cortical atrophy with intermediate clinical, cognitive and biological features. Prodromal Alzheimer's disease participants classified into one of these subtypes showed similar subtype characteristics at baseline as Alzheimer's disease dementia subtypes. Compared across subtypes in prodromal Alzheimer's disease, the medial-temporal subtype showed fastest decline in memory and language over time; the parieto-occipital subtype declined fastest on executive/attention domain; the diffuse subtype in visuospatial functioning; and the mild subtype showed intermediate decline in all domains. Robust atrophy subtypes exist in Alzheimer's disease with distinct clinical and biological disease expression. Here we observe that these subtypes can already be detected in prodromal Alzheimer's disease, and that these may inform on expected trajectories of cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder: patients differ in age of dementia onset, genetic risk factors, clinical presentation, and rate and type of cognitive decline (Lam et al., 2013) . Heterogeneity in clinical presentation and trajectories of cognitive decline already manifests in the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (Vos et al., 2015) , i.e. patients with mild cognitive impairment and biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's pathology (Dubois et al., 2014) . Understanding the biological mechanisms that underlie heterogeneity in cognitive symptoms and trajectories of decline is crucial to help clinicians determine prognosis and an important step towards precision medicine in Alzheimer's disease.\nCognitive subtypes of Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) have been observed in several independent patient cohorts and also in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, which suggests that clinical heterogeneity has a biological basis (Tang et al., 2016; Scheltens et al., 2017) . Post-mortem studies also point towards the existence of biological heterogeneity by showing neuropathological subtypes consisting of typical Alzheimer's disease, limbic predominant, and hippocampal sparing, which were associated with differences in ante-mortem clinical presentation (Murray et al., 2011) . Studying brain atrophy patterns provides an opportunity to examine biological heterogeneity in vivo (Whitwell et al., 2012) . Imaging studies classifying patients with ADD based on a priori definitions of heterogeneity have shown that atrophy subtypes can explain part of the variability in clinical and cognitive characteristics, including a medial-temporal atrophy variant with predominant memory dysfunction and a subtype with relative hippocampal sparing with young age of onset and more pronounced non-memory presentation (M\u00f6 ller et al., 2013; Byun et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2017; Persson et al., 2017; Risacher et al., 2017) . Datadriven methods provide an unbiased approach to detect atrophy subtypes that do not depend on predefined choices, and so may yield a more refined description of heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease. A few data-driven (Noh et al., 2014; Hwang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Park et al., 2017; Poulakis et al., 2018) or semi-supervised (Dong et al., 2017; Varol et al., 2017) imaging studies have detected atrophy subtypes in patients with probable ADD. However, those studies used clinical criteria without biomarker confirmation to select ADD patients, and therefore the possibility cannot be excluded that subgroups reflect non-Alzheimer pathology. In addition, most previous studies employed clustering methods that rely on determining the global similarity of atrophy patterns amongst individuals, which may not capture particular atrophy patterns that are present in only a subset of individuals. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a statistical approach that decomposes data into non-negative parts, and allows us to simultaneously cluster features (e.g. cortical atrophy) and individuals into subgroups (Lee and Seung, 1999) . A particularly strong aspect of the partsbased approach of NMF is that it enables identifying subsets of atrophy features that are correlated in a subset of individuals, but not in other subgroups: such non-linear associations cannot be detected by methods that depend on global similarity values. As such, this technique is particularly suitable for atrophy subtype discovery.\nFurthermore, it remains unclear when heterogeneity in atrophy patterns arises during the disease. We hypothesize that if heterogeneity in atrophy patterns reflects true pathophysiological subtypes of Alzheimer's disease, then such atrophy subtypes should be detectable in prodromal stages of the disease, and might predict the type of symptoms that a patient will develop (Schuff et al., 2012; Leung et al., 2013) . To our knowledge, only one previous study investigated this question, of which the results supported the hypothesis that data-driven derived subtypes may already be present in predementia stages of Alzheimer's disease (Zhang et al., 2016) . But, as the previous study had no replication data available, the robustness of these subtypes remains unclear. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether such subtypes in prodromal Alzheimer's disease show differences in their rates of clinical and cognitive decline, and whether subtypes show decline in specific cognitive domains.\nIn the present study, we used a data-driven clustering approach to identify and replicate in two external independent datasets atrophy subtypes in patients with ADD and biomarker evidence of amyloid pathology. We compared patients of the different atrophy subtypes on clinical, biological and cognitive characteristics that are known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease [i.e. CSF total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on MRI, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 genotype (Van Der Flier et al., 2011; Jack et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2016) ]. Next, we validated our results further and studied the potential practical use of data-driven derived subtypes, by classifying participants with prodromal Alzheimer's disease into the atrophy subtypes that best matched with their regional grey matter volumes. We examined whether the atrophy subtypes in this earlier disease stage showed similar clinical and biomarker profiles compared to subjects with dementia, and whether atrophy subtypes would show decline in specific cognitive domains."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Datasets", "text": "We included participants with a good quality 3D T 1 -weighted structural MRI based on research criteria for ADD, i.e. having a clinical diagnosis of ADD and evidence for amyloid pathology in CSF or on amyloid PET (Supplementary material); or prodromal Alzheimer's disease, i.e. clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and evidence of amyloid pathology (Dubois et al., 2014) . Participants were included from two large cohorts: the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC) (van der Flier et al., 2014) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (www.adniinfo.org). We first identified atrophy subtypes in a discovery dataset consisting of ADD patients from the ADC who were scanned on the same 3 T scanner (ADCd; n = 299). We then assessed whether we could identify the same clusters in an independent validation set consisting of ADD patients from the ADC scanned on either of two different 3 T scanners (ADCv; n = 181). Finally, we identified clusters in another external validation set consisting of ADD patients from ADNI (n = 227). Participants with prodromal Alzheimer's disease from ADC (n = 160) and ADNI (n = 443) were grouped into one dataset. As per inclusion criteria for this study, all participants had CSF amyloid-b 1-42 or PET amyloid available, and the majority additionally had CSF t-tau and p-tau, as well as WMH, and APOE genotype (Table 1 and Supplementary material). APOE e4 genotype was dichotomized by the presence of at least one APOE e4 allele.\nThe ADC consists of participants attending the memory clinic of the VU University Medical Centre Amsterdam. The VU University Medical Centre institutional review board approved the ADC study protocol. All participants gave written informed consent for their clinical data to be used for research purposes.

Details of the neuropsychological tests in each domain are presented in the Supplementary material. Before grouping tests in domains, missing values were estimated using multiple imputation (Supplementary material). All test scores were z-transformed within each cohort to remove measuring scale, and inverted when necessary such that lower values represent worse performance.

The quality of all segmentations was visually inspected and five were excluded because of erroneous segmentation. Next, we defined 1024 cortical and subcortical anatomical areas in the native space grey matter segmentation of each participant using a brain parcellation that was generated by randomly subdividing the automated anatomical labelling atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) into equal-sized regions (Zalesky et al., 2010) . This atlas was warped from standard space to subject space using inverted parameters that were calculated by non-linear normalization of subject images to standard MNI space.

Most prodromal Alzheimer's disease participants were classified into the mild atrophy subtype (55%; Table 3), followed by the parietal-occipital cortical atrophy (26%), medial-temporal predominant atrophy (11%) and diffuse cortical (8%). In the prodromal stage, subtypes largely showed similar characteristics as observed in the dementia stage (Table 3 , Fig. 4C and D) , apart from CSF tau levels, which were highest for the parieto-occipital subtype (instead of second highest in the dementia datasets). Some prodromal Alzheimer's disease subjects (n = 124, 21%) showed a similar match to multiple subtypes. When repeating analyses taking these subjects as an additional 'less well matching' group, we observed similar clinical and biological characteristics for the four subtypes. Subjects with prodromal Alzheimer's disease who were less well-matching had intermediate clinical and biomarker profiles (data not shown).\nAtrophy subtypes and cognitive decline in prodromal Alzheimer's disease Prodromal Alzheimer's disease participants of the diffuse cortical subtype had a higher probability of progressing to dementia compared to prodromal participants of the mild atrophy subtype (hazard ratio: 1.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-2.2, P = 0.046) within a mean follow-up period of 2.6 AE 1.6 years (range 0.4-10.0) (Fig. 5A) . The other two subtypes had intermediate hazard ratios, which did not statistically differ from the former subtypes. Linear mixed models showed that the medial-temporal and diffuse subtypes had lower baseline scores in the language domain, compared to the mild atrophy subtype (Figs 4C and 5B). Prodromal Alzheimer's disease participants of the parieto-occipital subtype had worse baseline scores in the executive/attention and visuospatial domains compared to participants in the mild atrophy subtype. No baseline group differences in global cognition (MMSE) or in the memory domain were observed (Supplementary Table 8 and Fig. 5B ).

Effect size remained largely similar after additionally correcting for age, gender and education (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9 ).

First, time to dementia (dependent variable) was compared between subtypes (predictor variable) with a Cox proportional hazard model with the 'survival' package (version 2.41-3) in R. Second, linear mixed models were used to evaluate baseline cognition and decline over time in the cognitive domains of prodromal Alzheimer's disease participants classified in the subtypes using the 'lme4' package (version 1.1-12) in R. Time from baseline (years), subtype, and their interaction were included as fixed effects. Subject intercepts and slopes were modelled as random effects.

Atrophy subtypes showed distinct clinical, neuropsychological, and biomarker characteristics. Moreover, atrophy subtypes were already apparent in the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease, and were associated with decline in subtype-specific cognitive domains. In line with previous studies, we found a medial-temporal dominant subtype with the worst memory and language performance, a parieto-occipital subtype in which patients had poor visuospatial and executive functioning, and a diffuse cortical atrophy subtype, with intermediate cognitive scores (Van Der Flier et al., 2011; Noh et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2017; Hwang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Park et al., 2017; Scheltens et al., 2017; Varol et al., 2017; Poulakis et al., 2018) . We extend the literature further by showing that atrophy subtypes can be robustly detected across three independent patient datasets, suggesting that these reflect true pathophysiological subtypes of Alzheimer's disease. In line with this, the atrophy subtypes showed distinct clinical and biomarker profiles. The medial-temporal subtype was the oldest and had the highest amount of WMH, suggesting concomitant small vessel disease. This subtype might be similar to the limbic-predominant subtype identified in a previous neuropathological study that was also older and showed more vascular pathology on autopsy (Murray et al., 2011) . The parieto-occipital cluster might reflect the hippocampal sparing subtype defined with neuropathology, as participants of this subtype were also younger and more often showed an atypical presentation (Murray et al., 2011) . In addition to these three subtypes, we found a fourth subtype that was characterized by medial temporal and cortical atrophy compared to control participants, but this atrophy was relatively mild compared to the other Alzheimer's disease subtypes. Two other studies previously identified a mild atrophy subtype (Dong et al., 2017; Poulakis et al., 2018) , but because those studies did not include evidence of amyloid pathology in their clustering analyses, it could not be excluded whether mild atrophy may have reflected a non-Alzheimer pathology. In addition, Dong et al. (2017) included participants with mild cognitive impairment without evidence of amyloid pathology in their clustering analyses, and so it remained unclear whether that mild atrophy may have reflected an earlier disease stage. Since we only included ADD participants with biomarker evidence of underlying amyloid pathology, we minimized the possibility that subtypes reflect non-ADD, and we are able to show that this mild atrophy cluster is a true subtype of ADD. Furthermore, the mild atrophy cluster showed the highest CSF p-tau and t-tau levels. This finding is unexpected, since CSF tau has been hypothesized to increase prior to brain atrophy (Jack et al., 2013) , and both tau and atrophy are associated with disease progression. Current classification schemes for disease staging allow us to use CSF tau proteins and atrophy on MRI interchangeably as markers for neuronal injury (Vos et al., 2015) . Our results suggest, however, that CSF tau and atrophy may reflect different pathological processes. Future research in which both in vivo MRI and post-mortem data are available is needed to examine how our atrophy subtypes relate to neuropathological characteristics.\nWe observed atrophy subtypes further in participants with prodromal Alzheimer's disease. This finding supports the idea that different aetiologies may cause disease heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease and that this is already apparent in the predementia stage. One other study could also detect atrophy subtypes in the predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease (Zhang et al., 2016) ; however, although that study observed differences in rate of decline, it did not find a clear early distinction in the development of specific symptoms, which may have been due to the number of subtypes studied (three versus four, the latter providing a separation of a posterior and frontal atrophy pattern). In the current study, all prodromal Alzheimer's disease individuals showed decline in cognitive functioning, which is in line with the notion that individuals with mild cognitive impairment and abnormal amyloid are at considerable increased risk to show clinical progression to dementia (Vos et al., 2015) We observed differences in the rate of decline amongst subtypes, as well as the type of cognitive domain that showed more pronounced decline. Although the 18 (29) 45 (38) 142 (48) 20 ( 38 (56) 101 (65) 218 (66) 29 (57) 0.14\nData are presented as n (%) or mean AE SD. P-values are based on chi-square, ANOVA or Kruskall-Wallis tests when appropriate. ST1 = subtype 1 (medial-temporal dominant atrophy); ST2 = subtype 2 (parieto-occipital atrophy); ST3 = subtype differences in cognitive decline are subtle, recognizing this phenotypic variation in atrophy subtypes in participants with prodromal Alzheimer's disease might aid clinicians in providing a more accurate prognosis for individual patients. Our results might in the future also have an implication for clinical trial design in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. The existence of atrophy subtypes that show specific trajectories of cognitive decline may require subtype-specific outcome measures tailored to the expected rate of decline in different cognitive domains.\nIn the prodromal Alzheimer's disease group, relatively more participants were classified in the third, mild atrophy subtype compared to the ADD group. Various explanations can be postulated for this finding. First, prodromal Alzheimer's disease subjects have generally less atrophy than ADD patients, and although within the ADD datasets it can be argued that the 'mild atrophy' reflects a true subtype of ADD, this is more difficult for prodromal subjects for whom mild atrophy may also reflect their earlier disease stage. Second, the prodromal Alzheimer's disease participants studied here may potentially be (in part) a different population than the ADD subjects examined. For example, the prodromal participants are the same age or slightly older than the ADD patient datasets. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether and how atrophy patterns of these subtypes will change during the course of Alzheimer's disease.\nThis study has several potential limitations. First, we did not have pathological data available and so the possibility of misdiagnosis cannot be excluded. However, we used biomarker evidence for amyloid aggregation, which provides strong in vivo support for the presence of underlying Alzheimer's pathology (Blennow et al., 2015) . Second, loss to follow-up may have resulted in an underestimation of cognitive trajectories in prodromal Alzheimer's disease, in that participants who were followed for more than 2 years were slightly younger, had higher MMSE scores and lower CSF tau levels compared to participants who were followed for a shorter period of time (Supplementary Table 11 ). Third, an alternative interpretation of our atrophy clusters might be that these represent differences in disease stage, as subtypes showed differences in MMSE scores. If that were the case then the subtype showing the lowest MMSE scores (parieto-occipital subtype) would be expected to show the most severe atrophy, as well as highest tau levels, and worse performance in all cognitive domains. In contrast, our subtypes showed distinct demographics, biomarker profiles, and cognitive symptoms, suggesting that these atrophy subtypes exist in parallel and do not merely reflect staging. Fourth, some ADD patients did not have a high cluster membership probability ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). It is plausible that some of these participants are a combination of more than one subtype, which is not captured by discretizing subtype membership. Future research should further investigate more refined subtype definitions based on continuous membership probability values. Finally, apart from WMHs, we were not able to examine the influence of other co-morbid disease, as this information is not readily available from the subjects of the ADC. This would be an interesting topic for future research.\nIn conclusion, we have robustly identified four different atrophy subtypes amongst patients with Alzheimer's disease using a data-driven clustering approach. The subtypes showed distinct demographic, cognitive, and biomarker profiles. Understanding the causes of this heterogeneity is an important step towards precision medicine for Alzheimer's disease."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "Research of the VUmc Alzheimer Centre is part of the neurodegeneration research program of Neuroscience Amsterdam."}]
