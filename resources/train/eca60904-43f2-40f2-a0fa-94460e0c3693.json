[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Globally the present dreaded pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 has resulted in the deaths of more than 445,000 humans (World Health Organization, 2019). The causative agent of the disease has been severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (World Health Organization, 2019). The family Coronaviridae consists of a large group of viruses known as coronaviruses (CoVs). The corona viruses were thought to be harmless respiratory human pathogens due to (i) harmless mild infections and (ii) the limited number of the circulating viruses in humans (Song et al., 2019) . However, the emergence of a series of three severe and fatal diseases caused by corona virus changed the concept. The first instance was severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in November 2002 -February 2003 in China and the second was Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia (De Wit et al., 2016) . The most recent cases of fatal disease outbreaks caused by corona virus occurred in December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China. These consecutive viral outbreaks also indicate the threat of cross-species transmission of these viruses leading to severe infectious outbreak in humans that should be considered seriously (Menachery et al., 2015) . Therefore, the threats of CoVs should not be undermined and the research on the life cycle and host-virus interactions should be advanced in order to develop treatments and vaccines against these viruses. The scientific and clinical investigations demonstrated that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV share remarkable features that lead to preferential viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and viral immunopathology. The recent investigations on the clinical, laboratory, radiological and epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of treatments in patients demonstrated that the severe respiratory illness similar to SARS-CoV was due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) . Although the early investigations patterns suggested that the COVID-19 virus could cause severe illness in some patients, with limited transmission among people, up-to-date epidemiological data strongly favors the statement that the new virus has evolved/adapted more efficiently for transmission among humans. The genome sequences of COVID-19 viruses obtained from patients indicated that they share 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2020) and a 96% identity to bat corona virus at the whole genome level. The phylogenetic studies of corona viruses obtained from different organisms indicated that COVID-19 could have originated from Chinese horseshoe bats; however, the vehicle which led to the transmission to host has not yet been identified (Dong et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 virus was bannered as a novel type of corona virus from bat due to a high degree of variation from the human SARS virus (Shereen et al., 2020; Andersen et al., 2020) . Altogether seven member of the family of CoVs infect humans, the COVID-19 is the newest of all. The SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63 utilizes human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for virus entry (Hofmann et al., 2005; Li et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2009) . Recently scientists have identified that both the SARS-corona virus and the COVID-19 virus enter host cells through an endosomal pathway involving the same entry receptor ACE2 (Zhou et al., 2020; Letko, Marzi & Munster, 2020) . The entry process of corona viruses is facilitated by the surface-located spike glycoprotein (Lu, Wang & Gao, 2015) . The spike protein can be divided into the S1 and S2 subunits, which are utilized as receptor recognition and membrane fusion molecules, respectively (Lai, Perlman & Anderson, 2007) . S1 Both the N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) of S1 unit can function as a receptor-binding entity or receptor binding domain (RBD) (Li et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2013; Taguchi & Hirai-Yuki, 2012) . Recently, the S1 CTD (SARS-CoV-2-CTD) has been identified as the prime region in SARS-CoV-2 that interacts with the ACE2 receptor . The crystal structure of SARS-CoV2-CTD in complex with human ACE2, exhibited bindings similar to that observed for the SARS-CoV-RBD. It has been further identified that SARS-CoV-2-CTD forms more atomic interactions with human ACE2 than SARS-RBD, resulting in higher affinity for receptor binding (Shang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) .\nOn the basis of the genetic properties, the Coronaviridae family can be divided in to four genera, including genus Alpha corona virus, genus Beta corona virus, genus Gamma corona virus, and genus Delta corona virus. Among the RNA viruses, the corona virus has the largest genome (ranging from 26 to 32 kb) with particle size of viruses being about 125 nm in diameter (Ji et al., 2020) . CoVs possess a composite genome expression strategy as numerous CoV proteins expressed in the infected cell contribute to the corona virus-host interactions. These strategies include (i) associations with the host cell to create a favorable environment for CoV replication, (ii) modification of the host gene expression and nullifying the antiviral defenses of host. The CoV-host interplay is thus key to pathogenesis of virus (De Wilde et al., 2018) . Two-thirds of the CoV genome belongs to genes for non-structural proteins. Amid the structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) can be considered important in terms of vaccine potential. The viral membrane has S, E and M proteins. The spike protein is a surface-located trimeric glycoprotein and actively plays a role in viral ingress into host cells, viral infection, and pathogenesis and was contemplated as a prime vaccine and therapeutic target against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The membrane and envelope proteins are required in viral assemblage, whereas the nucleocapsid protein is involved for assembly of RNA genome (Song et al., 2019) .\nAlthough CoVs share numerous resemblances, they also have genetically evolved significantly and finding the potential targets for vaccines and antiviral drugs against COVID-19 should exploit the structural similarities between SARS-CoV and the COVID-19 virus, and focus on proteins that are highly conserved across multiple CoVs. In this work, all the structural proteins were selected for finding the epitopes for designing the vaccine against CoVID-19 using validated in silico approaches."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "The overall procedures used in the present study for epitope-based vaccine design and physicochemical property prediction have been depicted in the form of flow chart (Fig. 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Retrieval of the protein sequence", "text": "The protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) (http://www.viprbrc.org/) in FASTA format.

The nonstructural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were removed from the complete proteome of SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "Similarity search and selection of protein for epitope prediction", "text": "The sequences of potential structural proteins (surface glycoprotein, orf3a protein, envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, orf6 protein) were searched for the similarity using the BLAST tool (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast. cgi?PAGE=Proteins). Only those hits were selected for comparison of identities which showed 100% query cover. The BLAST results of surface glycoprotein (Accession No. QHQ82464) exhibited more than 99.84% identity (100 hits) and those of orf3a (Accession No. QHQ82465) showed identities of more than 99.27% (74 hits). Next the envelope protein (Accession No. QHQ82466) resulted in 14 hits with the identity range between 100% and 94.67% while the BLAST using the membrane glyco-protein (Accession No. QHQ82467) resulted in about 50 hits with the range of identity between 100% and 93.24%. Similarly the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Accession No. QHQ82471) resulted in 100 hits with identity in the range from 100% to 99.28%. The last selected protein from SARS-CoV-2, orf6 (Accession No. QHQ82468) exhibited an identity range between 100% and 95% in more than 40 hits. Since all the BLAST searches performed using the above structural proteins demonstrated the identity between 93% and 100%, a conclusion was drawn that any one representative protein from the six structural proteins could be used for further study. Thus we selected all the six complete sequences of proteins with the above accession numbers for further studies."}, {"section_title": "Determination of antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 MHC I epitopes", "text": "The term antigenicity is the capacity of a molecule to be specifically recognized by the antibodies generated as a result of immune response to the given substance. Proteins generated by divergent or convergent evolution may lack apparent sequence similarity, although they may share structural similarity and biological characteristics (Petsko & Ringe, 2004) . Antigenicity may be encoded in a sequence in a fine and obscure manner not feasible to direct recognition by sequence alignment. Similarly, the search of novel antigens will be circumvented by their lack of similarity to antigens of known origin (Doytchinova & Figure 1 Schematic representation of epitope-based vaccine design from the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2.\nFull-size \ue90d DOI: 10.7717/peerj.9855/ fig-1 Flower , 2007) . A novel alignment-free approach for antigen prediction, VaxiJen, based on auto cross covariance (ACC) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties was developed to control the limitations of alignment based strategies (Doytchinova & Flower, 2007) . All the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were submitted to the VaxiJen v2.0 server (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/ VaxiJen.html) (Doytchinova & Flower, 2007) in FASTA format for the determination of antigenicity.

These are important for epitope-based peptide vaccine design (Patronov & Doytchinova, 2013) . The NetCTL 1.2 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/NetCTL/), can be utilized for the prediction of the T cell epitopes in any specified protein. The server can anticipate the epitope for 12 MHC-I super types A1, A2, A3, A24, A26, B7, B8, B27, B39, B44, B58, B62 present on CD8 + T Cells. The prediction of epitope of CD8 + T cell is on the basis of interpretations obtained from proteasomal C terminal cleavage, MHC class I binding, and TAP transport efficiency. The artificial neural network (ANN) is used for the prediction of MHC class I binding, proteasomal C terminal cleavage, while weight matrix is employed for the estimation of TAP transport efficiency (Larsen et al., 2005 (Larsen et al., , 2007 . In this study the server was used for the prediction of epitopes of all the 12 super types of MHC I and a higher threshold value of 1.25 for epitope prediction was fixed, which has a better sensitivity and specificity of 0.54 and 0.993, respectively. The default parameters set by server for the weight matrix determination for proteasomal C terminal cleavage (0.15) and TAP transport efficiency (0.05) were used."}, {"section_title": "Prediction of antigenicity", "text": "For the recognition of both frequently and non-frequently occurring MHC-I-binding alleles, the T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed by the stabilized matrix base method (SMM) of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) analysis tool (http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/) as described earlier Lundegaard et al., 2008) . The recognition of MHC-I binding alleles were performed on the parameters (i) the peptide length of epitope was restricted to 9 and (ii) the IC50 of less than 250 nM was selected on the server. Lower IC50 value signifies higher binding. The HLA-binding affinity of the epitopes is quantitatively described in the IC50 nM units. In general, for similar ligands, higher binding affinity of the epitopes with the MHC class I molecule is reflected by the lower IC50 value. Therefore, IC50 values less than 250 nM (IC50 < 250) was selected for ensuring higher binding affinity of the epitopes. The IC50 of the epitopes were determined by the IEDB tool. IEDB being a resourceful server, can also be used for the estimation of processing score, TAP score, proteasomal cleavage, and the MHC-I binding score of the specified epitopes and their respective alleles using the stabilized matrix based method (Peters et al., 2003; Tenzer et al., 2005) . Epitopes were selected based on the highest combined score, but the final selection for further study was made after the prediction of antigenicity by VaxiJen v2.0 server and that of immunogenicity by IEDB server. The combined score is the derived from median percentile rank of seven alleles and immunogenicity score using following equation Combined percentile rank = (alpha \u00d7 Immunogenicity model score) + ((1 \u2212 alpha) \u00d7 Median Percentile rank of seven alleles), where alpha is optimized to 0.4 as described earlier (Dhanda et al., 2018) ."}, {"section_title": "Epitope immunogenicity and conservancy prediction", "text": "Immunogenicity is defined as the ability of a substance/molecule to instigate cellular and humoral immune response (Ilinskaya & Dobrovolskaia, 2016) .

The effective T-cell epitopes are more immunogenic and are considered better than the less immunogenic peptides (Adhikari, Tayebi & Rahman, 2018) . Therefore, the epitope with better immunogenicity was selected for further evaluation. The immunogenicity prediction tool available on the server http://tools.iedb.org/immunogenicity/ was utilized for the identification of immunogenicity while conservancy was predicted by the tool available on iedb (http://tools.iedb.org/ conservancy/) Calis et al., 2013) .

To determine the population coverage a tool is required that can optimally calculate the distribution of humans which will respond to a given group of epitope on the basis of HLA genotypic prevalence and MHC binding and/or T cell restriction data (Bui et al., 2007) . Population coverage for each identified epitope and their corresponding MHC HLA-binding alleles was determined by the population coverage tool available on IEDB server (http://tools.iedb.org/population/). Here we used the allelic frequency of the interacting HLA alleles for the prediction of the population coverage for the corresponding epitope.

AllergenFP 1.0 has been established on a novel alignment-free descriptorbased fingerprint technique. An accuracy of 87.9% is observed in the identification of both allergens and nonallergens by AllergenFP 1.0. In contrast, to classify allergens and nonallergens, AllerTOP v. 2.0 has been established on the basis of k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method. The web server ToxinPred (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/) was implemented to predict toxicity of the peptides (Gupta et al., 2013) .

On the IEDB database, a large group of quantitative MHC class II peptide-binding data is available (Toseland et al., 2005) . The data includes the peptide with binding affinities (IC50) for more than 14 HLA/MHC. A novel stabilized matrix method (SMM)-align method (NetMHCII) for quantitative predictions of MHC class II binding was developed which utilizes the IEDB MHC class II peptide binding database . The SMM-align method attempts to recognize a weight matrix that ideally emulates the measured IC50 values for each peptide in the training group . The MHC I epitopes derived from structural proteins were selected for the prediction of MHC-II-binding alleles using the SMM-align method. As per the instruction of the tool, an IC 50 value up to 3000 nM was considered significant.\nDesign of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of epitope\nIn order to be considered as proper vaccine candidate, an epitope need to fulfill all the criteria like antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservancy of epitopes, non-toxicity and it should be non-allergen.

HADDOCK is an information-driven flexible docking approach for the modeling of biomolecular complexes. Despite continuous advances in the field, the accuracy of ab initio docking-without using any experimental restraints-remains generally low (Huang, 2015) . Data-driven approaches such as HADDOCK (Van Zundert et al., 2016) , which integrate information derived from biochemical, biophysical or bioinformatics methods to enhance sampling, scoring or both (Rodrigues & Bonvin, 2014) , perform remarkably better. The main attribute of HADDOCK is the Ambiguous Interaction Restraints or AIRs. These permit the conversion of raw data including mutagenesis experiments or NMR chemical shift perturbation into distance restraints which are integrated in the energy functions. These energy functions are used in calculations. In the docking protocol of HADDOCK, molecules pass through varying degrees of flexibility and distinct chemical surroundings (Van Zundert et al., 2016) .\nThe performance of HADDOCK protocol depends on the number of models generated at each step. The grading of the clusters is based on the average score of the top four members of each cluster. The score is calculated as:\nHADDOCK score = 1.0 \u00d7 Evdw + 0.2 \u00d7 Eelec + 1.0 \u00d7 Edesol + 0.1 \u00d7 Eair Where, \"Evdw\" represents the intermolecular van der Waals energy, \"Eelec\" is the intermolecular electrostatic energy, where as \"Edesol\" is an empirical desolvation energy (Fern\u00e1ndez-Recio, Totrov & Abagyan, 2004) , and Eair represents the AIR energy.\nNumbering of cluster in the results indicates the magnitude of the cluster. The diverse elements of the HADDOCK score are also described for each cluster on the results web page. The top cluster is the most reliable according to HADDOCK.

Likewise one more epitope \"LKKRWQLAL\" was marked as potential vaccine candidates based on their scores gathered during the analysis by the computational tools (Table 1; Table S3 )."}, {"section_title": "MHC-I alleles", "text": "In contrast to epitopes from spike and ORF3a proteins, although E protein epitope \"LLFLAFVVF\" exhibited binding affinity with seven MHC I alleles and high antigenicity, immunogenicity, it could not pass the allergenicity evaluation. Thus, no epitope from envelope protein could be regarded as potential vaccine candidates. Among epitopes from M protein, \"LTWICLLQF\" had high antigenicity score of 1.1393 and immunogenicity score of 0.06584. \"LTWICLLQF\" exhibited binding to (i) HLA-C \u00c3 14:02 (129.6), (ii) HLA-B \u00c3 58:01, (141.02), (iii) HLA-C \u00c3 12:03 (166.42), (iv) HLA-A \u00c3 32:01 (245.43) molecules and had a conservancy score of 77.78%.

The binding models of epitopes and their respective HLA molecules (both class I and class II) were generated by taking advantage of HADDOCK 2.4. The tool generated clusters and the numbering of cluster reflected the size of the cluster. The various components of the HADDOCK results like HADDOCK score, Cluster size, Root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the overall lowest-energy structure, Van der Waals energy, Electrostatic energy, Desolvation energy, Restraints violation energy, Buried Surface Area, and Z-Score were reported for each cluster on the results web page. Irrespective of the number of cluster, the top cluster is considered as most reliable according to HADDOCK. Therefore, the first cluster from the result displayed by HADDOCK server was selected for visualization of structures. The more negative results of HADDOCK score and Z score signifies better structures and interaction. At the first instance two promising MHC I epitopes viz; \"PYRVVVLSF\", \"QLTPTWRVY\" from surface glycoprotein was used for the docking with HLA-C \u00c3 07:02. The HADDOCK score of the first cluster was \u221230.4 \u00b1 7.5 and the Z score was \u22121.2 indicating the proper docking solution for HLA-C \u00c3 07:02 and epitope PYRVVVLSF (Table 2) . Similarly the second epitope \"QLTPTWRVY\" from S protein also had negative values for both the HADDOCK score and Z score indicating the cluster as a good docking solution. In the next HADDOCK analysis epitope \"HVTFFIYNK\" from ORF3a was used along with the HLA-A \u00c3 30:01. The best cluster had the HADDOCK score of \u221265.5 \u00b1 7.7 and the Z score of \u22121.8, suggesting proper docking results.

First docking analysis was performed using HLA-DRB1 \u00c3 01:01 structure obtained from PDB and the structure of MHC class II epitope \"TNGVGYQPYRVVVLS\" (from S protein) predicted using PEPFOLD tool. The HADDOCK protocol produced the best cluster with the HADDOCK score of \u221238.1 \u00b1 9.9 and the Z score of \u22122.2, which indicated optimum solution of docking. The second docking analysis between the MHC-II allele (HLA-DRB1 \u00c3 01:01) and epitope \"ITLKKRWQLALSKGV\" from ORF3a protein also resulted in desired negative values of HADDOCK and Z scores The last HADDOCK docking examination was performed with the MHC II allele (HLA-DRB1 \u00c3 04:01) and the epitope \"LFLTWICLLQFAYAN\" from membrane glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which revealed a HADDOCK score of \u221278.4 \u00b1 10.7 and the Z score of \u22121.6 ( Table 2 ). Similar to MHC I, the model structures of all the above three best clusters obtained in the HADDOCK results were downloaded from the HADDOCK result page. 3D models of the clusters were visualized by PYMOL and Discovery Studio was implied for getting the 2D interaction maps of all three docking solutions (Fig. 3) .

The B-cell epitopes are categorized into two distinct groups as (i) continuous or linear and (ii) discontinuous or conformational B-cell epitopes. One of the significant steps of epitope-based vaccine design is the identification of B-cell epitopes from the antigenic proteins of pathogens. Consequently, the web server based computational tools, BepiPred-2.0 and LBtope were used to find out B-cell vaccine candidates in the different proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The BepiPred-2.0 generated fair number of linear B-cell epitopes from the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among these linear epitopes eleven were non-antigenic as predicted by the VaxiJen v2.0 server and had conservancy level between 56.25% and 97.50% (Table S7) . Accordingly, these epitopes could not be considered as prospective vaccine candidates.

Compared to the spike protein, only five linear B-cell epitopes from ORF3a protein were identified by BepiPred-2.0 (Table S7) . Out of these epitopes, three were non-antigenic as discerned by the VaxiJen v2.0 server and their conservancy scores varied between 57.69% and 74.29%.

After due consideration of all the factors like allergenicity (AllerTOP 2.0 and AllergenFP v. 1.0) and toxicity, none of the epitope predicted by BepiPred-2.0 could be safely recommended as potential linear B-cell epitopes. Another tool for linear epitope discovery, LBtope, led to the identification of only three linear B-cell epitopes from the ORF3a protein.

The least survival time of more than 10 h was estimated in Escherichia coli. Unlike the proteins, proposed MHC I epitopes had different half life. An estimated half life of less than an hour in mammalian reticulocytes was associated with QLTPTWRVY epitope derived from S protein, whereas maximum half life of 30 h was estimated for GVYFASTEK.

The disease is generated by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (World Health Organization, 2020). Keeping the SARS-CoV-2 (RNA-virus) mutability in mind (Twiddy, Holmes & Rambaut, 2003; Manzin et al., 1998) , a comprehensive vaccine needs to be designed to overcome the adverse effects of this viral infection. However, an efficacious vaccine development and mass production are expensive and can take several years to be completed. Therefore, an attempt was made to design a peptide-based vaccine using the immuno-informatics approaches to minimize the time required for searching a potent vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2. At present, distinct Bioinformatics approaches are available for the design and development of successful and safe new-generation vaccines (Mar\u00eda et al., 2017; Seib, Zhao & Rappuoli, 2012) . The advancement in computational immunology and newer immuno-informatics tools have created a broader way in developing the vaccine or vaccine candidates by the adequate understanding of the human immune response against a pathogen within a short period of time (De Groot & Rappuoli, 2004; Korber, LaBute & Yusim, 2006; Purcell, McCluskey & Rossjohn, 2007) . The scheme of an epitope-based vaccine against rhinovirus, (Lapelosa et al., 2009 ) dengue virus, (Chakraborty et al., 2010) chikungunya virus, (Islam, Sakib & Zaman, 2012 ) Saint Louis encephalitis virus, (Hasan, Hossain & Alam, 2013) etc. has already been proposed.\nIn the present study, we first attempted to identify the potential vaccine candidates based on the T cell peptide epitope. In contrast to earlier vaccines, which are predominantly based on B cell immunity, vaccine based on T cell epitope has also been recommended as the host can induce a strong immune response by CD8 + T cell against the infected cell (Van Regenmortel, 2001) . Due to antigenic drift, any foreign particle can escape the antibody memory response mounted by B cells; however, the immune response generated by T cells usually provides long-lasting immunity. There are various specifications that need to be fulfilled by a peptide vaccine candidate. The potential epitopes proposed in our study satisfied all the criteria evaluated using computational tools.\nThe T-cell epitope was identified based on high threshold values (1.25) obtained in the output of NetCTL 1.2 tool. Primarily, more than one hundred fifty epitopes from six structural proteins were identified by selecting twelve super types of MHC-1 alleles. The antigenicity, immunogenicity and conservancy of the epitopes are considered as important determinants. Therefore, by maintaining critical thresholds of the antigenicity, immunogenicity and conservancy of the epitopes, we picked thirty eight epitopes from structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) . These selected T-cell epitopes had a higher conservancy between 65.0% and 100.0%, which further support the feasibility of these predicted epitopes and indicate them as a potential vaccine candidate.\nMost of the present day vaccines activate the immune system into allergic state (McKeever et al., 2004) by inducing type 2 T helper T (Th2) cells and immunoglobulin E (IgE). Consequently, allergenic property is one of the major hurdles in vaccine development. Hence, all the selected T-cell epitopes were screened for allergenicity by two computational tools; AllerTOP v.2.0 and AllergenFP 1.0. Altogether only eleven epitopes were classified by both the tools as non-allergens. Those eleven epitopes with all the characteristics of good vaccine candidates may be considered most important epitope in comparison with the other epitopes.\nAnother important factor in the selection of a potential vaccine is population coverage. The human leukocyte antigen alleles are remarkably polymorphic in diverse ethnic populations. Consequently, allele specificity of T-cell epitopes is considered as the initial criterion for the induction of proper immune responses in numerous ethnic human populations (Stern & Wiley, 1994) . For all the eleven promising T cell vaccine candidates, the cumulative percentage of population coverage was measured. Overall the recommended epitopes from surface glycoprotein showed world population coverage of 80.37% followed by nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and ORF3a epitopes showing 68.10% and 54.43% of world population coverage, respectively (Table S4 ). The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has resulted pandemic in which cases have been reported in almost all the countries of world (World Health Organization, 2020), so a vaccine candidate which can protect the majority of world's population is required.\nHowever, the epitopes from membrane protein could cover only 31.04% population of World. Notably, the epitopes from the surface protein had population coverage of 89.08% for China, where the virus originated (Zhou et al., 2020) and 88.99% for Southeast Asia. In the list of badly hit countries, majority is from Europe (World Health Organization, 2020) and the epitope from S protein had coverage of 80.69% of Europe's population. The population coverage of 77.72% was obtained for USA where the highest number of cases has been reported (World Health Organization, 2020). The nucleoprotein epitopes covered 76.28% of Europe population followed by 69.53% and 63.26% of Italy and United States populations; respectively. Next, the ORF3a epitopes had 64.57% coverage of China's population followed by 63.85% and 57.98% of Hong Kong and Europe's population, respectively. Taken together all the suggested epitopes having higher population coverage may be considered as strong vaccine candidates.\nThe proper binding of the T cell epitope to the MHC I antigen binding cleft is essential for the induction of desired immune response (Stern & Wiley, 1994) . The legitimate binding should result in a negative HADDOCK and Z scores. Thus the 3D structure of the proposed vaccine candidate was designed using PEP-FOLD and the crystal structure of the selected MHC allele was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB). Thereafter, removal of water and retrieval of chain wise structure of MHC alleles were performed using PyMol.\nIn the next step molecular docking simulation was executed with selected chain of the MHC as protein molecule and the proposed vaccine candidate as ligand using HADDOCK 2.4. The HADDOCK and Z scores, the two most significant parameters in the results of HADDOCK indicated the predicted epitopes to be reasonable. The 3D and 2D interaction maps were derived using the HADDOCK best cluster model generated in result page by applying appropriate bio-informatics resources like PYMOL and Discovery studio. These structures exhibited appropriate binding of predicted epitopes in MHC I peptide binding cleft suggesting the pertinent selection of bio-informatics approach for epitope identifications. The re-docking and validation of docking method was carried out by using the seven crystal structures of MHC I and MHC II alleles and their corresponding peptide epitope obtained from PDB. The structures of both HLA allele and corresponding peptides were obtained using PyMol and re-docking was performed using HADDOCK 2.4. The docking procedures were same as that for the SARS-CoV-2 predicted epitopes. HADDOCK and Z scores were in the acceptable range (negative values) and the 3D and 2D interaction results were similar to the corresponding PDB structures. Furthermore the results of HADDOCK re-docking were similar to those achieved by dockings performed using the predicted SARS-CoV-2 MHC I and MHC II epitopes, which reflected valid docking methodologies adopted in the present study. The physicochemical properties of proposed epitopes indicated that these can be produced in any three of the systems used for the expression of peptides, viz, mammalian cells, yeast cell or E. coli (Table S9) Most of the current day vaccines are based on the B cell epitopes (Sarkander, Hojyo & Tokoyoda, 2016) . BepiPred-2.0 might be viewed as the prime and most up-to-date B-cell epitope prediction computational tool as it exhibits notably good performance on both epitope data obtained from a vast number of linear epitopes taken from the IEDB database and on structural data of epitope derived from crystallography studies. LBtope is other robust tool for linear B-cell epitope prediction. It has been generated based on the experimentally proven non B-cell epitopes derived from the IEDB database. Antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and conservancy of the predicted B cell linear epitopes are prime determinants for identifying potential vaccine candidates. Therefore, all the four criteria were evaluated using different standard bioinformatics tools and potential epitopes were selected on the basis of high threshold values as fixed for T cell epitopes. Thus, on the basis of above criteria and conservancy altogether seven B cell epitopes from structural proteins were proposed as potential B cell vaccine candidates. The majority of the B-cell epitopes are discontinuous or conformational epitopes, and the quantum of this epitope is more than 90% (Van Regenmortel, 2001) . Therefore, discontinuous B-cell epitopes were identified using ElliPro, a strong tool for the identification of conformational B cell epitopes. The tool identified four epitopes from surface glycoprotein followed by two epitopes each from the orf3a protein, membrane protein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The extensive range of these conformational epitopes drawn on different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 indicated their potential as conformational B cell vaccine candidates.\nAn earlier study has reported a single epitope from spike protein having the conservancy of about 64% (Oany, Emran & Jyoti, 2014) . Here we have reported several epitopes as potential vaccine candidates from five structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2.\nAs all the vaccine candidates need to be verified in clinical trials, the normal path of vaccine development, we propose the identified potential vaccine candidates should be pursued in clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In view of the present COVID-19 pandemic, for development of vaccine efficiently and within minimal time, vaccine candidates need to be identified at the early. Based on advanced computational approaches, we have altogether identified eleven potential T-cell epitopes, seven B cell linear epitopes and ten B cell conformational epitopes from the six structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together these numerous potential vaccine candidates may provide important timely avenues for effective vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2. The future efforts may focus on the clinical trials of the multi-epitope vaccine candidates based on the present study."}]
