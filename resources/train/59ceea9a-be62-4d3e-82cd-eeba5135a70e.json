This method establishes the biomarkers' true value in predicting the AD-pathology status by combining the reference test and the biomarker data with available information on the reliability of the reference test. The new methodology was applied to two clinical datasets to establish the joint accuracy of three cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid-\u2424 1-42 , Total tau, and P-tau 181 ) by including the clinical diagnosis as imperfect reference test into the analysis. 1 Part of the data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

Fig. 1 . Schematic summary on the construction of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and interpretation of the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The ROC curve is a plot of the sensitivity and (1-specificity) for each value of a continuous diagnostic marker. AUC can be interpreted as the probability that, for a randomly selected pair of non-AD and AD subjects, the value of the score for the AD subject will be larger than the value of the non-AD subject. For a score that perfectly separates non-AD and AD populations, the value of AUC is equal to 1, corresponding to the ROC curve passing through the (0,1) point, i.e., the point corresponding to a diagnostic test with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. For a score that has no discriminative ability, the value of AUC is equal to 0.5, corresponding to a ROC curve along the diagonal line.
