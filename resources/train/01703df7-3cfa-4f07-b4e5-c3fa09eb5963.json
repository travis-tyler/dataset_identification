Fred Short is the Program Manager for UNH and is the primary contact for UNH. Fred Short will be responsible for coordinating all program activities. This work is being done under contract for the NH Estuaries Project so the Program Manager will be accountable to the NHEP Coastal Scientist (Phil Trowbridge) and the NHEP Director (Jennifer Hunter). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provides funding to the NH Estuaries Project. Jean Brochi is the project manager for EPA. Daily operations of the project will be managed by the Program Manager. The Program Manager will manage all field staff, be responsible for \"stop/go\" decisions in the field, and coordinate data analysis. The Project QA Officer will be Jeffrey Gaeckle. The QA Officer will be responsible for a memorandum to the Program Manager summarizing any deviations from the procedures in the QA Project Plan, the results of the QA/QC tests, and whether the reported data meets the data quality objectives of the project. This memorandum should clearly state whether any data should be rejected because they did not pass QA tests. GIS staff is Jamie Adams. Field staff will include David Rivers. Field staff will report any problems to the Program Manager. The Program Manager will be responsible for resolving any logistical problems and communicating the results to the field staff. The principal users of the data from this project will be the NH Estuaries Project staff and NHDES. The Program Manager will submit a report to the NHEP/NHDES Coastal Scientist and the NHEP Director at the end of the project with all the data and the QA Officer's summary report.

The UNH Seagrass Ecology Group has mapped the distribution of eelgrass in Great Bay every year from 1986 to 2001 in the Great Bay. The entire Great Bay Estuary system (Great Bay, Little Bay, tidal tributaries, Piscataqua River, and Portsmouth Harbor) was mapped in 1996, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Figure 2 shows the trend in eelgrass cover in Great Bay over time. Eelgrass cover in Great Bay has been relatively constant for the past 10 years at approximately 2,000 acres. In 1989, there was a dramatic crash of the eelgrass beds down to 300 acres (15% of normal levels). The cause of this crash was an infestation of a slime mold Labryrinthula zosterae, commonly called \"wasting disease\" (Muehlstein et al., 1991). The greatest extent of eelgrass was observed in 1996 following several years of good water quality (Fred Short, pers. comm.). The most recently mapped (2001) eelgrass coverage in the estuary is shown in Figure 3.  The New Hampshire Estuaries Project (NHEP) coordinates environmental monitoring in NH's estuarine waters. Maps of eelgrass distribution in the Great Bay Estuary provide useful information on water quality and critical habitats within the estuary. The NHEP has developed a series of environmental indicators to track trends and to evaluate progress toward management goals. Eelgrass distribution is part of the NHEP Monitoring Plan to gather data on these indicators (NHEP, 2003). The NHEP contracted with UNH-JEL to continue this monitoring program in 2003 to ensure that the record of annual assessments would be unbroken. Maps of eelgrass in the estuary will be used by the NH Estuaries Project, NH Department of Environmental Services, and other coastal resource managers to evaluate trends in eelgrass populations over time.

Appendix D of EPA guidance on QAPP elements for geospatial studies (EPA, 2003) was consulted and used a guide for the correct location of relevant information within this and other sections of the QAPP. Precision: Not applicable. Accuracy: The method for mapping eelgrass in the Great Bay Estuary generally follows the standardized \"C-CAP\" protocol for mapping submerged aquatic vegetation (Coastal Change Analysis Program, NOAA). The aerial photographs are taken at 3,000 feet with roughly 60% overlap. Photographs are taken with a 35 mm camera at near vertical angles. Representativeness: The entire estuarine system will be mapped so the results will be representative of the whole system. Comparability: The method to be used for acquiring the imagery is a modification of the C-CAP protocol. The method is described in previously published papers (Short and Burdick, 1986).
