It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new strain isolated from the Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan, China in December 2019 (Fox 2020; Khan et al. 2020b ). Horseshoe bat is a primary reservoir, but the intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is fully understood Singhal 2020) . Human coronaviruses (Coronaviridae family; Nidovirales order) can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and central nervous system diseases. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus of which two \u03b1-coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and two \u03b2-coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) are causing only mild self-limiting upper respiratory diseases. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV can cause severe diseases ). Human-to-human contact and travel-related cases are transmission mechanisms for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (Ralph et al. 2020) . The fecal-oral transmission is a possible transmission mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children (Zhang et al. 2020c ). SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to heat and UV rays and can be effectively destroyed with the use of 75% ethanol, p-acetic acid, and chlorine-containing disinfectants ).\nOn 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a pandemic. As of 20 July 2020, 14.6 million cases have been confirmed in more than 210 countries, with 608k deaths. The United States, Spain, Italy, and Germany have registered more cases than China, where the outbreak started (https://www.worldometers.info/ coronavirus/). Consequently, the WHO declared a state of global health emergency to coordinate scientific and medical efforts to rapidly develop a cure for patients (Sohrabi et al. 2020) . The development of more targeted inhibitors is highly desirable, but no effective antiviral drugs or vaccines available to date ). The source of origin, transmission, and pathogenesis mechanisms of this virus are not yet known. It hampers further investigation of safe and valuable antiviral medications. The massive research works on its genomics perspectives provide a warrant to discover antivirals against COVID-19 infectivity."}, {"section_title": "Genomic insights of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "Genome structure SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus (\u03b2-Coronavirus genus). It is an enveloped virus containing a single positive-stranded RNA (Chan et al. 2020a; Licastro et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020a, b) . The first genome sequence (accession: NC_045512.2) was completed for SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolated from Wuhan, Hubei province, China . Continuous genome sequencing attempts of different laboratories have been produced 930 GenBank sequences and 288 next-generation sequences to date. The genome size of this virus is 29.9 kb with 11 open reading frames (Orfs). ORF1ab (266-21555 nts.) encodes replicase polyprotein 1ab. After cleaved by two proteases, ORF1ab (266-13483 nts.) encodes replicase polyprotein 1a with multiple functions. Gene-coding proteins are organized as 5\u2032-leader-UTR-replicase-ORFab-S (spike)-E (envelope)-M (membrane)-N (nucleocapsid)-3\u2032UTR-poly (A) tail-3\u2032-UTR end Zhou et al. 2020a) (Table 1) .\nThe ORF1ab gene encodes a polyprotein consisting of 15 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16) (Fig. 1 ). This polyprotein is auto-proteolytically cleaved into multiple enzymes that form replicase-transcriptase machinery consisting of RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease, endoRNAse and 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase. These enzyme components are essential to viral genome replication and nucleic acid metabolism (Gordon et al. 2020) . The replicase-transcriptase system assembles at the host endoplasmic reticulum where structural proteins assembled to make essential cellular components (capsid).\nA nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) is a host translation inhibitor that facilitates efficient viral gene expression in infected cells and evasion from the host immune response by interacting with the 40S ribosomal subunit. ORF1ab gene contains coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element stemloop 1 and 2 in the position of 13476-13503 and 13488-13542 nucleotides, respectively. ORF10 gene harbors coronavirus 3\u2032 UTR pseudo-knot stem-loop 1 (29609-29644 nucleotides) and 2 (29629-29657 nucleotides). The size of the stem-loop structure is ranged from 27 to 54 nucleotides. The genomic position 29740-29758 nucleotides form a noncanonical C: T base pair. The homologous positions form a highly conserved C: G base pair (Ashour et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020d )."}, {"section_title": "Genome evolution", "text": "The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is about 82%, 96%, and 86.9% identical to the SARS-CoV, bat-CoV-RaTG13, and bat-SL-CoVZC45, respectively ). However, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is genetically distinct from SARS-CoV and has a relatively long branch length to the bat-CoV-RaTG13 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. SARS-CoV-2 genome is 99.98% identical across the SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from different patients . The genome-coding potential is closely related to those of the bat, civet, and HCoVs (Chan et al. 2020a) . Genetic recombination events are complex more likely occurring in bat-CoV-RaTG13 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21than in SARS-CoV-2 Paraskevis et al. 2020) . A phylogenetic network analysis of 160 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes found three central mutational variants distinguished by amino acid changes. Accordingly, it has classified into A, B, and C ancestral types. The synonymous mutations T29095C and T8782C are identified in type A and type B, respectively. The nonsynonymous mutations C28144T (Leu to Ser) and G26144T (Gly to Val) are detected in type B and type C, respectively (Forster et al. 2020) . Therefore, the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 has been expanded in human hosts due to the establishment of hyper-variable genomic hotspot its population )."}, {"section_title": "Hyper-variable genomic hotspots", "text": "Some mutational hotspots identified from structural and nonstructural genes had deleterious effects on the functional evolution of coding proteins, host specificity, and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (Li et al. 2020c; Phan 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 mutational hotspots are located at positions 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403, and 28881 , where a mutation at position 14408 is adjacent to the drugs targeting RdRp hydrophobic clef (Pachetti et al. 2020) . The spike glycoprotein of this virus contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), which shares only a 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses (Chan et al. 2020a ). It has the non-synonymous mutation sites that slow down the development of therapeutics apart from biologics and macrocyclic peptides (Morse et al. 2020 ). The RBD has three possible mutation hotspots include D614G, G476S, and V483A of which V483A repeated more frequently followed by G476S. A variant D614G could bring a potentially crucial change in a protein sequence due to aspartic acid is a negatively charged and acidic amino acid compared to glycine (Banerjee et al. 2020 ). The envelope and nucleocapsid proteins contain two evolutionarily conserved regions with a sequence identity of 89-96% to the SARS-CoV. ORF3b and ORF8 proteins are structurally different from those of SARS-CoV ). The endosome-associated-protein-like domain in sp2 protein had a stabilizing mutation. The Nsp3 protein is imposed by a destabilizing mutation. It suggests a possible mechanism of differentiating SARS-CoV-2 from SARSrelated coronaviruses . The hypervariable genomic hotspot (Ser/Lue) is found in ORF8 protein (Ceraolo and Giorgi 2020) . The mutations identified in Nsp1, Nsp3, and Nsp15 might facilitate human adaptation and infection . The intrinsic disorder predisposition in the nonstructural proteins during evolution may also provide important information to explore its infectivity (Fahmi et al. 2020; Goh et al. 2020 ). Since, finding mutational variants in viral target proteins are important to assess possible drug-resistance phenotypes, leading to modulate the clinical presentation of the COVID-19 worldwide.\nThe high-frequency SNP mutation sites and hypervariable hotspots are important for designing a COVID-19 vaccine and rapid detection of different genotypes of SARS-CoV-2. Most recently, a genotypic method has been established for monitoring and tracing SARS-CoV-2 mutations (Yin 2020) . The 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov) was built for studies on viral taxonomy, genome evolution, molecular diagnosis, and drug development ). The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool has been developed for accurate tracking of new viral mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (Cleemput et al. 2020 ). These resources would allow us to agitate the drug discovery process for the COVID-19 infectivity."}, {"section_title": "Pathogenomics", "text": "The functions of structural and nonstructural proteins are associating with pathophysiology and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. The envelope protein has a critical role in viral assembly and releases exerting viral pathogenicity and other nonstructural proteins have not yet been described ). The surface glycoprotein contains the S2 subunit comprising a fusion peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Rabaan et al. 2020 ). These domains are guiding the link to host receptors. An in silico mutational study suggests a higher affinity of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein favorable to the human ACE2 receptor, compared to the Bat-CoV spike protein Ortega et al. 2020) . The N82 in ACE2 is closer contact with spike protein than M82 in human ACE2 (Luan et al. 2020) . Structural genomics analysis on spike protein provides important insights to design an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The structural variations in spike protein (Ser19Pro; Glu329Gly) and the transmembrane helical segments of nsp2 and nsp3 proteins (Ser723Gly; Pro1010Iso) may determine the host specificity of SARS-CoV-2. Such mutation hotspots in spike protein and nonstructural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 might affect molecular recognition and specificity of antivirals or vaccigenic candidates. These mutations can also influence the binding efficiency of PCR primers or probes during the molecular diagnosis of clinical samples. Consequently, evidence of such mutation hotspots could explain how SARS-CoV-2 has a mechanism for disease relapses in a host Korber et al. 2020) .\nSARS-CoV-2 infection is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. The IL-6 is produced during infection by activated leukocytes and acts on a large number of cells and also stimulates the production of acute-phase proteins important to the thermoregulation. Subsequently, B lymphocyte differentiation has been elevated for inhibition of further virus replication in a host (Cascella et al. 2020; Prompetchara et al. 2020; Rabaan et al. 2020) . SARS-CoV accessory protein ORF6 antagonizes the antiviral activity of the STAT1 transcription factor by sequestering IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 on the rough ER/Golgi membrane (Frieman et al. 2007 ). Ivermectin is the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent and HIV-1 integrase, which reported as an effective nuclear transport inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Caly et al. 2020) . The density of the expression levels of ACE2 in neurological tissue also suggests the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19 .\nSARS-CoV-2 requires host cellular factors for successful replication during infection. The mechanisms of its infection can be elucidated with a systematic analysis of virushost protein-protein interactions (PPIs) (B\u00f6sl et al. 2019; Rothan and Byrareddy 2020) . It is hypothesized that a host protein that functionally associates with this virus is localized in the corresponding sub-network within the comprehensive human interactome network. The host dependency factors mediating virus infection and effective molecular targets should be identified for developing broadspectrum antiviral drugs for COVID-19. The previous virus-host proteome interaction studies identified the key host-specific proteins and interactions pathways including DNA replication, epigenetic and gene expression regulators, vesicle trafficking, lipid modification, ubiquitin ligases, and nuclear transport machinery ( Table 2 ). Orf10 of SARS-CoV-2 has interacted with the human ubiquitin system with multiple members of the Culin-2 E3 Ligase complex (Gordon et al. 2020 )."}, {"section_title": "Structural genomics on drug targets", "text": "Structural genomics analysis reveals the SARS-CoV-2 genome consisting of four structural proteins (S-E-M-N) and two nonstructural proteins (main protease and RdRp) .

The structural and functional characteristics of these proteins are summarized here and represented in Table 3 . Viral exoribonuclease greatly affects the cell's transcriptome by RNA processing and degradation."}, {"section_title": "Spike glycoprotein", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type-II pneumocytes where an envelope-anchored spike protein binds to a host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) Li et al. 2020e; Zhou et al. 2020a ). The spike protein is cleaved via aciddependent proteolysis by furin protease into an N-terminal S1 subunit (residue 14-685) and a C-terminal S2 region (residue 686-1273), followed by fusion of the viral envelop to the cellular membranes (Coutard et al. 2020 ). It has a functional polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1-S2 boundary through the insertion of 12 nucleotides. Both the polybasic cleavage site and the three adjacent predicted Olinked glycans are unique to SARS-CoV-2. Insertion of a furin cleavage site at the S1-S2 junction enhances cell-cell fusion without affecting viral entry (Hasan et al. 2020; Rabaan et al. 2020; Walls et al. 2020) .The function of the predicted O-linked glycans could create a 'mucin-like domain' that helps SARS-CoV-2 to utilize mucin-like domains as glycan shields involved immunoevasion (Bagdonaite and Wandall 2018).\nCrystallographic studies reveal the structure of the sixhelical bundle core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the S2 subunit (Fig. 2 ). It has a defined RBD in an N-terminal S1 subunit that specifically recognizes its receptor in humans Xia et al. 2020) . The RBD contains a core structure and a receptor-binding motif (RBM) that binds to the ACE2 receptor-binding region, integrin (Cagliani et al. 2020; Sigrist et al. 2020) . The involvement of glucose-regulated protein-78 and RBD are important in recognition of the host ACE2 receptor. The binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein and glucoseregulated protein-78 .\nThe binding efficiency of RBD on ACE2 can be enhanced by the presence of specific amino acids at the 442, 472, 479, 480, and 487 positions. Gln493 and Asn501 residues in the RBM provide possible interactions with ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 has acquired some capacity for human cell infection and human-to-human transmission by super binding affinity of Gln493 and Asn501 residues in RBM with ACE2 (Wan et al. 2020) . It is most likely the result of natural selection on a human (Andersen et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020a) .\nThe RBM recognizes directly the integrins of the ACE2 receptor-binding region and RBD has a critical impact on the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies. It suggests a promising therapeutic target. EK1C4 is the most potent pancoronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein ). ACE2 blocker is repurposed to control COVID-19 from gaining entry into the host cell (Phadke and Saunik 2020) . Therefore, it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies targeting RBD and fusion inhibitors targeting the S2 subunit, which will be effective therapeutics against COVID-19 (Sigrist et al. 2020; Shanmugaraj et al. 2020; Tian et al. 2020 )."}, {"section_title": "RNA-dependent RNA polymerase", "text": "The RdRp is a crucial viral enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses that catalyzes the replication of RNA from the RNA template.

The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation. It is imperative to discover affordable drugs to control and diminish the pandemic. The present review will provide new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies and also possible new strategies for drug designing or repositioning to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. Compared to de novo drug discovery and randomized clinical trials, drug repurposing strategy could significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost of antiviral drugs. Nevertheless, experimental approaches for drug repurposing are costly and time consuming. It can be resolved by systems pharmacology approaches because targeting single virus proteins often has a high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes. Perhaps, the repositioning of launched or even failed drugs to viral diseases will provide unique translational opportunities. Genome-scale systems biological perspective of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions can guide the further in vitro and in vivo clinical studies on validation of newly identified drugs for COVID-19 infectivity. Genomic insights into developing and deploying drugs of antiviral drugs for COVID-19 will offer a substantially higher probability of success to the market and a significantly reduced cost and timeline to clinical availability. The currently established animal models are not very promising for the studies of pathogenesis and treatment of COVID-19 and therefore, testing the drugs for COVID-19 requires suitable animal models before their use in humans.
