Here, using an AD and normal aging dataset primarily consisting of three AD multi-center studies (n = 1,781), we compared the effect of APOE and amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) on baseline hippocampal volumes in AD patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and healthy controls.

Hippocampal volumes were processed using FreeSurfer. In the AD and normal aging dataset, hippocampal comparisons were performed in each APOE group and in 4 carriers with positron emission tomography (PET) A\u2424 who were dichotomized (A\u2424+/A\u2424-) using previous cut-offs. We found a linear reduction in hippocampal volumes with 4 carriers possessing the smallest volumes, 3 carriers possessing intermediate volumes, and 2 carriers possessing the largest volumes. Moreover, AD and MCI 4 carriers possessed the smallest hippocampal volumes and control 2 carriers possessed the largest hippocampal volumes. Subjects with both APOE 4 and A\u2424 positivity had the lowest hippocampal volumes when compared to A\u2424-4 carriers, suggesting a synergistic relationship between APOE 4 and A\u2424. However, we found no hippocampal volume differences between APOE groups in healthy 14-year-old adolescents.

The APOE 4 allele, a genetic risk factor known to substantially increase the risk of AD in a dose-dependent fashion, is associated with higher amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) deposition [4, 5] . By contrast, the APOE 2 allele has been suggested to confer a protective effect against AD [6] .\nHippocampal volumetry has been shown to be a sensitive, albeit non-specific marker of neurodegeneration in AD. Previously, it has been used to demonstrate accelerated rates of hippocampal atrophy in 4 carriers with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [7, 8] . Although the exact temporospatial relationship between A\u2424 and tau in the pathological cascade of AD is unclear, it has been suggested that both proteinopathies may have a synergistic effect on neuronal toxicity [9] . Emerging data also suggests that these pathological processes that influence cognitive decline in AD are moderated by APOE 4 through both A\u2424-dependent and A\u2424-independent mechanisms [10] . However, evidence for the direct mechanistic actions of APOE 4 is mixed.\nDespite the numerous studies, our limited understanding of APOE 4 risk in asymptomatic individuals and individuals with varying stages of AD pathophysiology warrants further study. Evidence has suggested that equivocal findings in neuroimaging studies of APOE 4 may be attributed to the lack of specificity between changes that are due to normal aging and those that manifest as a result of pathological neurodegeneration [11] . Furthermore, some APOE neuroimaging findings originate from studies with limitations in sample size and hence study power [12] . This is further exacerbated by the varying distribution of APOE 4 carrier status across different samples. However, recent neuroimaging APOE studies with well-characterized samples (between 400-700 subjects) are beginning to address this methodological issue [13, 14] . Also, recent neuroimaging evidence from young APOE 4 carriers has shown that structural and functional alterations in the brain may precede A\u2424 pathology [15, 16] . This had led researchers to postulate that APOE 4 may exert neurodevelopmental changes that provide a foothold for the pathological cascade of AD later in life.\nIn order to capture the heterogeneity of varying AD risk, we combined several well-characterized cohort studies to evaluate the neuroanatomic effect of APOE genotype on hippocampal volumes. The first dataset in our study, known as the AD and normal aging dataset (n = 1,781) consisted of imaging data from three large multi-center AD consortiums, (i) The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), (ii) the AddNeuroMed study (ANM), and (iii) the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyles (AIBL) study, as well as a sample of non-demented individuals from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) and a dementia study from King's College London, UK (BRC-AD). The sample of non-demented individuals from the SNAC-K study were considered separate from healthy controls as the recruitment criteria for these subjects was epidemiological in nature and we could not exclude the possibility of memory impairment in some subjects. In our second dataset, we used a large sample of healthy 14-yearold adolescents (n = 1,387) in order to determine the neurodevelopmental effect of APOE 4 genotype on hippocampal volume. This is particularly important because adolescence is a time of substantial dynamic neurobiological and behavioral changes. These changes are often beneficial and can optimize the brain for adult maturation, but can also confer neural vulnerabilities for certain types of psychiatric or neurological illness.\nThe aim of this study was to firstly evaluate the neuroanatomic effect of APOE genotype on the hippocampus in the AD and normal aging dataset. Previous studies have demonstrated a linear effect of APOE genotype on disease risk, with 2 carriers possessing a low risk of developing AD, and 4 carriers possessing the greatest risk [17] . We aimed to test if this linear stepwise effect of APOE genotype also imparted a similar neuroanatomic effect on the hippocampus across the different stages of AD pathophysiology. We then tested the neuroanatomic effect of APOE genotype on hippocampal volumes of healthy 14-year-old adolescents to determine the role of APOE in adolescent brain development.\nOn the other hand, converging evidence suggests that APOE 4 modifies A\u2424 accumulation and may have downstream effects on tau neurodegeneration [18] . To further elucidate the mechanisms of this proposed synergistic relationship, we aimed to examine whether high levels of A\u2424 deposition would lead to greater hippocampal loss compared to low levels of A\u2424 deposition in APOE 4 carriers."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHOD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Datasets", "text": "Cohort specific inclusion criteria and details of the study design can be found in previous publications [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .

With recent studies proposing a neurodevelopmental foothold of APOE 4 on the brain [43, 44] , understanding whether atrophy in AD-susceptible areas, such as the hippocampus, are attributed to pre-clinical manifestations of the disease, or whether these constitute a part of non-specific normal aging is of great importance for earlier diagnosis.\nHere we present the largest cross-sectional multicohort study of APOE and hippocampal volume to date (n = 3,168) and discuss a number of key findings. Firstly, a linear neuroanatomic effect of the APOE genotype was observed for hippocampal volumes of AD and MCI subjects, whereby 4 carriers presented with the lowest volumes, 3 homozygotes possessed intermediate volumes, and 2 carriers possessed the largest volumes. As expected, 4 carriers in the AD and the MCI group had significantly lower hippocampal volumes when compared to CN individuals and a population-based sample of elderly non-demented individuals from the SNAC-K study. These findings are in agreement with previous studies demonstrating a distinct neuroanatomic effect of APOE genotype on brain structure, as well as studies reporting smaller hippocampal volumes in MCI subjects with prodromal stages of AD. Furthermore, our finding of larger hippocampal volumes in 2 carriers in older healthy groups supports the 2 allele's suggested effect of protection against neurodegeneration. Previous cellular models have advocated its role in a disease staving protective effect, in particular its ability to modify the neuropathological effects of A\u2424 accumulation [45] .\nThe absence of APOE-dependent hippocampal volume loss in CN individuals and in a populationbased sample of elderly individuals suggested that APOE 4 may not be independently associated with hippocampal atrophy in normal aging. Although the findings from previous APOE studies in non-demented individuals are mixed, our findings replicate a number of earlier neuroimaging studies showing no effect of APOE 4 on regions such as the hippocampus in normal aging [46] [47] [48] . One explanation for the discrepant APOE findings in CN individuals may be related to differences in defining those that fulfil the criteria for pre-clinical AD from subjects showing typical normal aging [11] . Recent Data are presented as the mean of normalized hippocampal volumes (Volume/ICV \u00d71000 ). SE with min-max is shown in parentheses. Table 6 Demographic characteristics of 4 carriers from the ADNI and AIBL study divided into A\u2424+ and A\u2424-participants\nADNI study (n = 95) Number of subjects (n (%)) 8 (8. In the ADNI study, of the 95 subjects who underwent PET neuroimaging, 66 were scanned using 18 F-florbetapir and 29 using 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB). In the AIBL study, all subjects underwent PET neuroimaging using PiB. studies have since shown that APOE 4 is linked to A\u2424 deposition and may exert a synergistic effect to promote cognitive decline [49, 50] .\nTo test whether an A\u2424-dependent effect of APOE 4 would be associated with greater hippocampal volume loss, we examined the combined effect of APOE 4 and A\u2424 on the hippocampus. We found no significant differences in hippocampal volume between CN A\u2424+ 4+ individuals and CN A\u2424-4+ individuals, suggesting that in healthy individuals there is no effect of APOE 4 and A\u2424 on the hippocampus. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that the relationship between APOE 4, A\u2424, and brain atrophy is mediated by CSF ptau181 levels [51, 52] and, in the absence of abnormal p-tau181 levels, there is no synergistic relationship between APOE 4 and A\u2424 deposition. Hippocampal volumes of MCI A\u2424+ 4+ individuals did not differ when compared to AD A\u2424+ 4+ participants, suggesting that a similar degree of hippocampal loss that is expected in AD has already manifested in MCI subjects. Our findings are supported by empirical evidence which has shown that APOE induces intracellular degradation of A\u2424 peptides facilitating synaptotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and tau hyperphosphorylation [5, 53] . It is therefore possible that A\u2424 and the 4 in conjunction impart greater levels of neuronal toxicity and injury in the presence of hippocampal neurodegeneration.\nRecent studies have suggested an A\u2424 independent effect of the APOE 4 on neuronal integrity as another explanation for the gene's effect on brain structure [47, 54] . A study by Dean and colleagues [44] argued that an early neurodevelopmental foothold of APOE on the brain may render individuals more susceptible to the toxic and downstream neurodegenerative effects of A\u2424 later in life. However, findings from our large sample of 14-year-old adolescents showed that there were no hippocampal volume differences present between the APOE groups, suggesting that 4 carriers are unlikely to be at risk in adolescence, but may perhaps develop a greater risk later in life. Similar studies, such as that of O'Dwyer and colleagues [15] reported lower hippocampal volumes in 4 carriers aged in their mid-twenties. Although differences may be attributed to the methodological approach adopted for the automated segmentation of the hippocampus, we cannot exclude the possibility of a low APOE penetrance in our young sample. Nevertheless, previous studies in younger 4 carriers have shown that APOE plays a fundamental role in modulating brain function in the absence of any differences in brain volume [47] .\nAn important caveat when interpreting the results of this study is that the multi-cohort data was crosssectional and a more complete understanding of how hippocampal trajectories vary with age would require longitudinal data. In particular, more neuroimaging studies need to be conducted into typical cognitive aging across the lifespan [18] in order to differentiate between brain changes that are associated with typical normal aging from those that arise from APOE 4 dependent mechanisms and \u2424-amyloidosis. Additionally, when combining data across cohort studies, it is important to consider study design differences that may complicate the interpretation of our results. For instance, the use of different AD diagnostic criteria across the different cohort studies may contribute to a level of diagnostic variability between groups. Participants from the ADNI and AIBL study were also highly educated, had few comorbidities, and were of Caucasian background. As such, future prospective studies with more representative samples should be conducted to address how these comorbidities, namely the presence of vascular disease, could potentially influence the size of the hippocampus. We demonstrated that systematic bias was not present in our dataset when comparing hippocampal volumes between APOE groups within each cohort study separately (Supplementary Material). Additional factors such as the use of two different PET radioligands meant that SUVR values of tracer uptake could not be compared as a single continuous measure. However, ongoing working groups such as the Centiloid project will further enable a more standardized approach for the direct comparability of results across different labs when different tracers and methods of analysis are employed [55] .\nDespite these limitations, this is first multi-cohort neuroimaging study of APOE genotype that attempts to characterize the differential risk of APOE on hippocampal volumes of subjects with varying stages of AD. Using metadata and clinical phenotyping pooled across several cohort studies, we were systematically able to demonstrate differential effects of the different APOE gene polymorphisms on hippocampal volume. An independent sample of healthy 14-year-old adolescents also provides an understanding into the role of APOE in adolescent brain neurodevelopment.\nIn conclusion, our findings in the largest APOE neuroimaging dataset show that hippocampal volume loss is present in patients with AD and in subjects with an increased risk of developing AD, particularly subjects with memory impairment. However, healthy older individuals did not show APOE 4 dependent changes in the hippocampus, suggesting that the relationship between APOE 4 and A\u2424 may be mediated by the presence of neurodegeneration. The same pattern was also observed in healthy young adolescents who possessed no hippocampal differences between different APOE groups. Our study thus shows hippocampal volume loss is moderated by APOE 4 and A\u2424 in AD and the MCI stages of the AD pathological process. The influence of these three markers could be considered as prognostic tools in clinical trials and therapeutic interventions of AD."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni. loni.ucla.edu).
