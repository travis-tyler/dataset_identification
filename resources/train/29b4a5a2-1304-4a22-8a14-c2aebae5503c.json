[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The world is currently undergoing and living with the great threat of pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has newly emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province, China (Du Toit, 2020; Hui et al., 2020; Wang C. et al., 2020) . Apart from this, in recent years, we have also witnessed sporadic outbreaks and epidemics of various lethal viruses, i.e., Ebola, Zika, Nipah, etc (Gupta et al., , 2020 . The current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 (also named as 2019-nCoV) is now reported to spread over 199 countries and to be responsible for excessive economic loss worldwide . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a public health emergency with a global alert (Ryu and Chun, 2020; Wang C. et al., 2020) . Overall, more than 10 million cases and over 0.5 million deaths had been reported worldwide by the end of June 2020 1 . Earlier in different years, CoVs have emerged periodically in various regions worldwide with different death rates (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Bogoch et al., 2020; Guarner, 2020) . During the epidemic in 2002-2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) led to reported deaths and infected cases of 916 and 8422, respectively. Likewise, another outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was reported in 2012, with 543 deaths out of 1401 total cases, giving it a mortality rate of around \u223c39% (de Wit et al., 2016) .\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family . CoVs are the largest known RNA virus genomes, being 27 to 32 kb in length. CoV genomes contains 10-12 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for the four structural proteins, i.e., surface glycoprotein (or spike) (S), envelope (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid (N), 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP16) (orf1ab polyprotein), other accessory proteins like ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10. These are only RNA viruses, which encode proofreading machinery, i.e., exonuclease and other replicase proteins, for the regulation of fidelity .\nCoronaviruses are genotypically divided into four genera, viz., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. Among these, beta coronaviruses are further classified into four subgroups, i.e., A, B, C, and D . Previously, six CoVs, two from the alpha group (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and four belonging to the beta group [HCoV-HKU1 (subgroup-A), HCoV-OC43 (A), SARS-CoV (subgroup-B), MERS-CoV (subgroup-C)], were known to infect humans. SARS-CoV-2 becomes the seventh coronavirus member to infect humans (Cheng and Shan, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . CoVs are highly pathogenic agents known to cause mainly fatal respiratory ailments (like pneumonia) and to infect various species like humans, bats, pigs, etc Lu et al., 2020; Wang C. et al., 2020) . Common symptoms are fever, cough, fatigue, breath shortness, muscle ache, headache, diarrhea, etc Del Rio and Malani, 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) .\nDifferent strategies have been trialed and applied to combat these viruses (Dennis Lo and Chiu, 2020; Maxmen, 2020; Watts et al., 2020; . Primarily, four proteins, which include two proteases, i.e., coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro), which are responsible for the proteolysis process, a replicase RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) responsible for the replication of RNA genome, and surface glycoprotein (spike), which mediates viral entry and fusion to host cells, are essential for the CoVs, making them preferred targets for therapeutics (Du et al., 2017; Cheng and Shan, 2020; Goo et al., 2020; Morse et al., 2020; . Researchers have mainly explored the ability of existing FDA-approved drugs to control SARS-CoV-2 (Zumla et al., 2016; Lu, 2020) . For example, Wang et al., has shown that Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide prodrug, and Chloroquine effectively inhibit 2019-nCoV in vitro (Colson et al., 2020; Wang M. et al., 2020) . Remdesivir is known to exhibit broad antiviral activity and has also previously been shown to have effective inhibition efficiency against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, Ebola, and Nipah (de Wit et al., 2020; Lu, 2020; Sheahan et al., 2020) . Further, various antiviral agents are also in separate clinical trials targeting different SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions/proteins (Maxmen, 2020) .\nFurthermore, different studies have also reported potential inhibitors to combat CoVs (Momattin et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2019; Totura and Bavari, 2019; Xia et al., 2019) . Various studies have also shown the use of different vaccine candidates primarily based on the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), and envelope (E) proteins (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019; Yong et al., 2019; Zumla et al., 2019; Goo et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020) .\nAdditionally, various groups have also advocated the use of immune-informatics and computational approaches to target the different proteins of CoVs (SARS as well as MERS). For example, Qamar et al., provide B-and T-cell epitopes against the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein (Tahir Ul Qamar et al., 2019) . Srivastava et al., used the in silico method to design a multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Srivastava et al., 2018 (Srivastava et al., , 2019 . Shi et al. (2015) have screened epitope-based vaccine targets against MERS-CoV. Another study provides N protein-based B and CTL epitopes against MERS-CoV (Hori et al., 1989) . Recently, a report identified T-cell and B-cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV (Baruah and Bose, 2020) . However, there is no approved drug and licensed vaccine available to combat the virus. Therefore, effective control strategies are urgently required to combat this deadly pathogen (Kickbusch and Leung, 2020; Lu, 2020; Zhang and Liu, 2020) . To support the global efforts to fight this virus, we have performed an in silico analyses and developed a resource of vaccine candidates and therapeutics to assist the global scientific community."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection and Curation", "text": "The aim of the current work and analysis is to target all of the Human infecting coronaviruses, with a prime focus on SARS-CoV-2. Complete genome sequences of the CoVs having Humans as hosts were retrieved from the NCBI. An advanced search interface is also deployed on the server to serve the users' requirements. Along with this, we have also implemented a genome browser for interactive graphical visualization utilizing JBrowse (Buels et al., 2016) . Further, as the world is currently suffering from the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, we have primarily concentrated on the alternative therapeutic options and vaccine candidates. For this, we mainly utilized the protein and gene sequences of the reference SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2). We have also explored the cross targeting and conservancy of different putative regimens against the other six reference CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV (NC_004718.3), MERS-CoV (NC_019843.3), HCoVs NL63 (NC_005831.2), HCoVs 229E (NC_002645.1), HCoVs OC43 (NC_006213.1), and HCoVs HKU1 (NC_006577.2)."}, {"section_title": "Vaccine Epitopes", "text": "The sequences of a large polyprotein (ORF1ab), four structural proteins [Envelope (E), Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), and Membrane (M)], and accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10) of annotated SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) were retrieved and utilized for the analysis. These sequences were used to predict putative T-cell epitopes (MHC-I and MHC-II binders, Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), and Immunogenic CD8 + and CD4 + epitopes) and B-cell epitopes (linear and conformational) that can be used for designing vaccines against CoVs. An overview of the epitope analysis pipeline is depicted in Figure 1 ."}, {"section_title": "T-Cell Epitope Prediction", "text": "We predicted MHC-I and MHC-II binders, CTL epitopes, immunogenic CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell epitopes, and IFN-\u03b3inducing peptides (restricted by MHC-II) from all protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2.\nFor MHC-I and MHC-II binding prediction, we used the corresponding tools available at the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) Epitope analysis tool page 2 (Peters and Sette, 2005; Nielsen et al., 2007) . For this, the \"IEDB recommended\" approach was utilized. This approach adopts a consensus method comprising ANN, SMM, and CombLib (if the predictor is available for a particular HLA; otherwise, it uses NetMHCpan EL) for MHC-I and NN-align, SMM-align, CombLib, and Sturniolo for MHC-II (Kim et al., 2012) . Shortlisting of predicted binders can be done based on percentile ranks and predicted affinities, where peptides with low percentile rank and low-affinity value (IC50 < 50 nM) are considered good binders (Kim et al., 2012) .\nThe prediction of CD8 + (CTL) T-cell epitopes was performed using NetCTLpan v 1.1 Server 3 for 12 HLA supertypes (A1, A2, A3, A24, A26, B7, B8, B27, B39, B44, B58, and B62) (Stranzl et al., 2010) . While predicting CTL epitopes, it takes into account various sequence-processing steps such as cleavage by proteasomes, TAP binding, and MHC-I binding (Stranzl et al., 2010) . MHC-I-restricted immunogenic peptides were identified using the \"IEDB Class I Immunogenicity tool\" 4 with the default settings (Calis et al., 2013) . This is based on amino acid properties and their respective positions within the sequence and gives an output in the form of scores, where a higher score indicates a greater probability of eliciting an immune response (Calis et al., 2013) .\nThe immunogenicity of MHC-II restricted peptides was predicted using the \"CD4 T cell immunogenicity prediction tool\" available at the IEDB 5 . The prediction was performed with the \"IEDB recommended\" method, which uses a combination of MHC-binding to seven alleles and the immunogenicity method (Dhanda et al., 2018) . The output is in the form of a table containing a description of the input sequences along with the combined score, immunogenicity score, 9-mer peptide core, median percentile rank, and score for each of the seven alleles.\nFurthermore, Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) is secreted by T-helper cells and is of central help in clearing the viruses from the host (Chesler and Reiss, 2002) . IFN-\u03b3-inducing peptides were predicted among positive MHC-II binders (15-mer) using the IFNepitope web server 6 (Dhanda et al., 2013) . The default settings (\"motif and SVM hybrid\" and the \"IFN-gamma vs. Non-IFNgamma\" model) were used to predict IFN-\u03b3-inducing peptides based on score, where the higher the score, the higher the chance of inducing IFN-\u03b3 (Dhanda et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "B-Cell Epitope Prediction", "text": "The identification of linear (continuous) B-cell epitopes is an important step in designing a vaccine against a microorganism. Linear B-cell epitope prediction was accomplished using the \"BepiPred Linear Epitope Prediction 2.0\" method available at the B-cell epitope prediction tool of the IEDB 7 . The tool is based on the random forest algorithm and was trained on amino acids of epitopes and non-epitopes identified from antigen-antibody crystal structures (Jespersen et al., 2017) . Amino acid residues with scores greater than the default threshold value of 0.5 are envisaged as being part of an epitope (Jespersen et al., 2017) . The conformational B-cell epitopes are discontinuous or scattered amino acid sequences that make up an antigen and interact with B-cell receptors (BCR) (Sanchez-Trincado et al., 2017) . Prediction of these discontinuous B-cell epitopes was performed using the ElliPro tool available at the IEDB 8 (Ponomarenko et al., 2008) . It predicts discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on the 3D structure of protein antigen depending on selected parameters, with the defaults being 0.5 and 6 Angstrom (\u00c5) for minimum score and maximum distance, respectively (Ponomarenko et al., 2008) .

Vaxijen v2.0 was used with a default cut-off of 0.4, indicative of viral antigens, to assess the antigenicity of these peptides (Doytchinova and Flower, 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Toxicity and Allergenicity Prediction", "text": "The toxicity of antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes with a Vaxijen score above 0.4 was predicted using the ToxinPred web server 10 (Gupta et al., 2013) . It is based on a quantitative matrix and Support Vector Machine (SVM) utilizing various peptide properties (Gupta et al., 2013) . We used the SVM (Swiss-Prot)based method while keeping all other criteria as default. Epitopes with the prediction result \"Non-toxin\" were used for further analysis. Likewise, putative vaccine candidates must be checked for allergenicity to prevent allergic responses in the host that may be caused by vaccination (McKeever et al., 2004) . We used AllerTOP v. 2.0 11 to predict the allergenicity of the epitopes being forecasted as \"Non-toxic\" by ToxinPred. This was developed based on using the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method to discriminate allergens from non-allergens (Dimitrov et al., 2014) . 9 http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html 10 http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/toxinpred/ 11 http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/"}, {"section_title": "Epitope Conservancy Analysis", "text": "The conservancy of the predicted epitopes was further analyzed using the epitope conservancy tool available at the IEDB 12 (Bui et al., 2007) . Conservancy is an indication of the percentage identity of the selected epitopes with the proteins of other similar organisms (here, other coronaviruses). We tested the conservancy of predicted epitopes with the other six coronavirus strains that are responsible for causing respiratory illnesses in humans, comprising two alpha coronaviruses (NL63 and 229E) and four beta coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, OC43, and HKU1)."}, {"section_title": "Population Coverage Analysis", "text": "The numerous polymorphic HLAs present in different populations have varied frequencies, and the epitopes restricted by such HLAs would have biased population coverage (Sidney et al., 2010) . Hence, during a vaccine design, population coverage must be accounted for to avoid a decrease in the applicability of a vaccine candidate in some populations (Bui et al., 2006) . Therefore, it is vital to calculate the frequency of individuals that are anticipated to respond to a given epitope set based on HLA typing (Bui et al., 2006) .\nWe further analyzed the population coverage of the predicted CD8 + (MHC-I), CD4 + (MHC-II), and CTL epitopes and their respective HLA alleles using the IEDB population coverage tool 13 (Bui et al., 2006) . This reflects the percentage of individuals in a population likely to respond to at least one T-cell epitope from the collection (Bui et al., 2006) . The \"HLA-epitope pairs\" set (epitopes with their restricted HLA alleles) was utilized to compute the projected population coverage (PPC) using query-\"area_country_ethnicity\" and selecting each of the 16 areas to provide broad global coverage, including China.\nThe T-cell epitopes selected following the conservancy analysis were used to compute population coverage. We used the population coverage tool offered by the IEDB (see text footnote 14) to compute the population covered by predicted MHC-I, MHC-II binders, and CTL epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 (Bui et al., 2006) .\nThe maximum population coverage of predicted MHC-I binders (which are also antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergenic) was found for the European population (97.71%), which was followed by North America, West Indies, West Africa, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, North Africa, Oceania, South Africa, South Asia, East Africa, South America, Southwest Asia, Central Africa, and Central America, with predicted population coverages (PPC) of 97. 48, 96.96, 92.96, 92.68, 92.61, 92.46, 91.64, 88.81, 88.78, 86.85, 85.18, 84.32, 83.82, and 7 .76%, respectively, as shown in Supplementary Table S14. The highest PPC for CTL epitopes was also found for the European population (95.66%), which was immediately followed by the North American population (87.54%). The PPC for Northeast Asia, including China (the area of COVID-19 outbreak), covered by these epitopes was quite low (65.65%) as compared to the high PPC (92.61%) for MHC-I binders for the same region. For MHC-II binders, the highest PPC was observed for the North American population (99.99%) closely followed by the European population (99.92%). Here, the area of Northeast Asia also had a high estimated PPC (93.81%).

The conservancy analysis showed that only two immunogenic CD8 + T-cell epitopes (present in ORF7b) were 100% conserved with the SARS-CoV sequences, while five were 90% conserved ( Supplementary Table S5) .\nSimilarly, MHC-II binders from SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were predicted using the IEDB MHC-II binding prediction method. As per IEDB recommendation, we used peptides with IC50 less than 50 nM as a cut-off to select strong binders . Using this selection criterion, we obtained 1478 strong binders restricted by MHC-II alleles. These predicted binders were subjected to antigenicity prediction. Out of the 1478 predicted MHC-II peptides, 831 were found to be antigenic on the basis of a Vaxijen score greater than 0.4. After subjecting these antigenic peptides prediction of Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) secreting peptides, only 304 were found to be positive according to the IFNepitope score. Toxicity prediction reduced this number to 296 (i.e., non-toxic). These 296 peptide sequences were then further subjected to allergenicity prediction, and 194 peptides were found to be non-allergenic, while 102 were allergenic. These 194 peptides can be used as vaccine candidates to elicit helper T-cells (CD4 + ) ( Supplementary Tables S7, S8) . Additionally, epitope conservancy and population coverage by these epitopes were also determined. Out of these 194 peptides, only three sequences were 100% conserved (S: 2, ORF1ab: 1) within the SARS-CoV sequence, while the total number of sequences with more than 90% conservancy was 78, with a variable degree of conservation with other CoVs (Supplementary Table S7 ).\nPrediction of immunogenic CD4 + T-cell epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 proteins using the \"CD4 T cell immunogenicity prediction tool\" available at the IEDB resulted in 319 immunogenic peptides. Out of these 319 epitopes, 132 were found to be antigenic. Further testing of these peptides for toxicity resulted in 129 peptides where no \"non-toxic\" peptide was found in ORF10. Among these 129 peptides, 44 were found to be nonallergic (Supplementary Tables S9, S10 ) and, thus, can be safely used for vaccine formulations after testing them further for conservancy and population coverage. The conservancy analysis showed that 19 epitopes were 100% conserved with SARS-CoV sequences, while there were 28 sequences in total that were more than 90% conserved with SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table S9) .\nLikewise, 320 linear B-cell epitopes were predicted from the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Predicted epitopes varied in length from 111 (maximum) to a single amino acid residue (minimum). Of these epitopes, only 135 were found to be antigenic using Vaxijen. Toxicity prediction of these 135 antigenic peptides resulted in 126 non-toxic and 9 toxic sequences. Allergenicity prediction of these non-toxic peptides showed that only 65 sequences were predicted to be non-allergenic, while the remaining 61 were allergenic. These epitope sequences and their lengths, start and end points in a protein, and conservancies are shown in Supplementary Table S11. Supplementary Table S12 shows the protein-wise distribution of the counts of these epitopes. These 65 sequences were further tested for conservancy with other coronavirus strains (Supplementary Table S11) .\nOf these 65 epitopes, 20 were found to be 100% conserved and 26 sequences (N = 2, S = 1, ORF1ab = 23) were more than 90% conserved with SARS-CoV (Table 3) . These 20 sequences are located in ORF1ab polyprotein in various regions. One Spike glycoprotein (S) epitope ( 404 GDEVRQIAPGQTGKIA DYNYKLP 426 ) with a length of 23-mer was found to be 91.3% conserved with the SARS-CoV spike protein. For envelope protein, only one sequence ( 57 YVYSRVKNLNSSRVP 71 ) was conserved within SARS-CoV, with 80% conservancy. Nucleocapsid protein (N) had two sequences ( 226 RLNQLESKMS GKGQQQQGQTVTKKSAAEASKKPRQKRTATKA 267 and 276 R RGPEQTQGNFGDQELIRQGTDYK 299 ) that were more than 95% conserved with the SARS-CoV sequence (Supplementary Table S11 ).\nThe epitopes from ORF1ab polyprotein, with length greater than 9-mer, were found to be variously conserved within ORF1ab polyprotein from the other six viruses. Two sequences (KLQNNELSPVAL and SYKDWSYSGQ) each of length 12mer and 10-mer were conserved within four other coronavirus strains, while few are conserved within only SARS-CoV. No epitope sequences were found to be conserved within these five coronavirus strains according to our set criteria (Supplementary Table S11) .\nFurther, a total of 37 conformational B-cell epitopes were predicted using the Ellipro method (Supplementary Table S13 ). The top 10 sequences of these 37 predicted epitopes had protrusion scores lying between 0.77 and 0.99. A high protrusion index (PI) value means enhanced solvent availability. Among these 10 sequences, 5 sequences belonging to the proteins ORF3a [(M1, D2, L3, F4, M5, R6), (T9, I10, G11, T12, V13, T14, L15)], ORF7b (E39, T40, C41, H42, A43), ORF8 (E92, P93, K94), and ORF10 (R24, N25, Y26) had PI scores above 0.80. The two highest-scoring peptides belonged to ORF3a, with PI scores of 0.99 and 0.94, respectively (Supplementary Table S13 ).\nA few recent immunological studies have experimentally validated several epitope sequences and found some to be positive in qualitative/quantitative assays against SARS-CoV-2 proteins, specifically spike glycoprotein (Poh et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020; Yi et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) . Poh et al. (2020) have found 2 linear B-cell epitopes (S14P5 and S21P2) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and our predicted linear B-cell epitope sequences, namely-555 SNKKFLPF 562 and 807 PDPSKPSK 814 , in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mapped on these two experimentally validated epitopes. These epitopes were found to be antigenic and nontoxic but allergenic in nature.\nA study published in Science by Yuan and group found a conformational B-cell epitope in the receptor-binding domain that was highly conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Yuan et al., 2020) . We have also predicted a linear B-cell epitope that is a part of this discontinuous epitope with the sequence 369 YNSASFSTFKCYGVSPTKLNDLCFT 393 . This epitope was found in our analysis to be antigenic, non-toxic, and nonallergenic, having 84% sequence conservancy with SARS-CoV.\nSimilarly, Yi et al. (2020) also found some key residues in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that interact with ACE2 as well as with neutralizing antibodies. These residues mapped on our predicted linear B-cell epitope 369 YNSASFSTFKCYGVSPTKLNDLCFT 393 (mentioned above).\nTrevor et al., found nine MHC-I-restricted T-cell epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Smith et al., 2020) . Out of these nine epitopes, three were found to match with our predicted epitopes. \"VLSFELLHA\" mapped on one of the epitopes (VVLSFELLHAPATVC) and was found to be antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergenic in our analysis. In the same way, \"VVFLHVTYV\" was predicted to be positively antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergenic and completely mapped on an epitope (PHGVVFLHVTYVPAQ) found in the abovementioned study. These two sequences can be used as vaccine candidates to elicit the adaptive arm of the immune system and provide protection against SARS-CoV-2. Epitope sequence \"KIADYNYKL, \" predicted as a positive epitope by this study, also had a few residues matching with an experimentally confirmed epitope (YNYKLPDDFTGCVIA). However, it was found to be allergenic in our study."}, {"section_title": "T-Cell and B-Cell Epitopes of All Coronaviruses", "text": "The search for T-cell and B-cell epitopes from all global coronaviruses was performed in the IEDB, which harbored details for the following coronaviruses: Alphacoronavirus 1, Avian coronavirus, Betacoronavirus 1, Coronavirus HKU15, HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, Murine coronavirus, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, SARS-CoV, and Swine acute diarrhea syndromerelated coronavirus. We obtained 320 positive T-cell epitopes, with 778 T-cell assays related to these epitopes. Similarly, 663 positive B-cell epitopes with 1568 B-cell assays were found in IEDB. Of these 663 epitopes, 582 were linear and 81 were conformational. The conservancy analysis of T-cell and B-cell epitopes from these coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2 proteins showed that 41 unique T-cell and 83 linear B-cell epitopes were 100% conserved within SARS-CoV-2. Only Humans (Homo sapiens) and various experimental mice (Mus musculus) were found as hosts for these coronaviruses in the case of T-cell epitopes. However, in the case of linear B-cell epitopes from other coronaviruses that shared 100% conservancy with SARS-CoV-2, various animals such as the Formosan rock macaque (Macaca cyclopis), Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were also observed as hosts as well as Homo sapiens and Mus musculus."}, {"section_title": "Cross-Protective Epitopes (CPEs) Between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2", "text": "At a time when a vaccine is urgently required against SARS-CoV-2, the non-availability of epitope information for it is a shortcoming that may lengthen the vaccine development process. To help the researchers in developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we sought to identify the cross-protective epitopes (CPEs) and unique epitopes (UE) based on antigenic similarities and differences between SARS-CoV epitopes and SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences. For this, we extracted 119 T-cell and 405 linear B-cell epitope sequences of SARS-CoV (ID: 694009) available on the IEDB. These 119 T-cell epitopes were dispersed in 51 and 68 MHC class I and class II alleles, respectively. The conservancy analysis to find cross-protective epitopes was performed by mapping SARS-CoV T-and B-cell epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Of the 119 T-cell epitopes, 27 potential cross-protective epitopes were found with 100% conservancy (no mutation) distributed in four different proteins (N: 13, S: 12, ORF1ab: 1, and M: 1) of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, 75 T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV were found with high sequence identity (>80%) with SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, 13 sequences had moderate similarity (>70% but <80%) and 29 had low similarity (<70%) and can be considered as unique in SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table S15) .\nWe also checked the IFNepitope score (for MHC-II epitopes), toxicity, and allergenicity of these experimentally confirmed T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV and their corresponding sequences in SARS-CoV-2. Among the 27 epitopes that were 100% conserved, 14 were predicted to be non-toxic and non-allergenic ( Table 4 ). Out of the 7 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes (100% conserved), only 2 were found to have positive IFNepitope scores, and only one ( 306 AQFAPSASAFFGMSR 320 ) was found to be nontoxic and non-allergenic. Supplementary Table S15 lists T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV with conservancy with SARS-CoV-2 that fulfill other criteria [IFNepitope (for MHC II), Non-Toxic, Non-Allergenic] that can be used as vaccine candidates to provide cross-protection against each other.\nIn parallel, the mapping of linear B-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV showed that out of 405 epitopes, 83 were 100% conserved in SARS-CoV-2 proteins (E: 1, ORF1ab: 1, M: 6, N: 32, and S: 43). Comprehensively, there were 237 epitopes with sequence identity >80% (Supplementary Table S16 ). Toxicity and allergenicity prediction of SARS-CoV epitopes resulted in 45 non-toxic and non-allergenic sequences that were 100% conserved with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These 45 shared epitopes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can provide cross-protection against each other and can be utilized as potent linear B-cell epitopes to elicit humoral immunity (Table 5) .\nOverall, an immuno-informatics-driven methodology was implemented to discover the B-cell (linear and conformational) and T-cell (CD8 + and CD4 + ) epitopes, which can help researchers at the initial stage of the design of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. With no experimentally confirmed epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 to date, we sought to address potential epitopes using various computational tools. We also considered various other properties, neglecting which may destroy the purpose of the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, such as antigenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity.\nSome parallel studies are available that have identified different epitope components of SARS-CoV-2 through bioinformatics predictions (Ahmed et al., 2020; Baruah and Bose, 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020; Lucchese, 2020; Qiu et al., 2020) . Grifoni et al., mapped experimentally confirmed epitopes of SARS-CoV on SARS-CoV-2 and predicted new epitope sequences as well (Grifoni et al., 2020) . Ahmed et al., also mapped experimentally confirmed epitopes of SARS-CoV on SARS-CoV-2 and analyzed the population coverage for T-cell epitopes to find epitopes for vaccine formulation (Ahmed et al., 2020) . Qui T. et al., searched for cross-protective epitopes on Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Lucchese, 2020) . Bose et al., identified T-and B-cell epitopes in spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 using an immunoinformatics method (Baruah and Bose, 2020) . Our work is different from other studies in several aspects and gives various new insights that are important for designing vaccine formulations against SARS-CoV-2. The most important difference is that we are providing a unifying online platform for easy, free, and direct access to components to assist researchers. We have not limited our study to a selected few but have performed a comprehensive analysis of all proteins of SARS-CoV-2, specifically the structural proteins, to find vaccine candidates.\nWe performed antigenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity prediction of our addressed epitope sets since these are important considerations in vaccine formulation. For the MHC-II-restricted epitopes predicted in our study, we have also predicted the IFN-gamma-inducing ability of these peptides. We have performed cross-conservancy analysis of predicted epitopes with other coronaviruses causing diseases in Humans. To the best of our knowledge, no study has performed these analyses on SARS-CoV-2 proteins.\nOur study suggests several epitopes as probable vaccine candidates on the basis of antigenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity along with IFN-gamma-inducing properties for MHC-IIrestricted epitopes. The epitope mapping on the proteins of other human-infecting coronavirus strains showed conservancy to SARS-CoV to variable degrees. We found 169, 2, 19, and 20 CTL, immunogenic CD8 + , immunogenic CD4 + , and B-cell epitopes, respectively, with 100% sequence conservancy within SARS-CoV, which can be used as potent vaccine candidates against both of the viruses. However, very few sequences were found to be conserved with the other five coronaviruses, highlighting the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is quite different from these humaninfecting viruses. This finely selected list of predicted epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 can be tested in future studies for the elicitation of immune response for their use as vaccine candidates. We have predicted T-cell epitopes in order to cover the Chinese ethnicity as well as the majority of the population around the world.\nSeveral studies have highlighted the importance of the adaptive arm of the immune system (i.e., T-cells and B-cells) in providing protection against SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2004; Xu and Gao, 2004; Chen et al., 2010; Channappanavar et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017) . We have identified SARS-CoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes with 100% conservancy in SARS-COV-2 proteins. These are cross-protective and can be used for designing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. A total of 27 T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV were found that were fully conserved in different proteins (N: 13, S: 12, ORF1ab: 1, and M: 1) of SARS-CoV-2. We also checked peptide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that were found with variable levels of conservancy with SARS-CoV epitopes and predicted their antigenicity, toxicity, IFN-gammasecreting ability, and allergenicity. We found one MHC-IIrestricted epitope, namely, 306 AQFAPSASAFFGMSR 320 , present in nucleocapsid of SAR-CoV that was 100% conserved within SARS-CoV-2 and was predicted to be antigenic, non-toxic, IFN-gamma-inducing and non-allergenic. Hence, this epitope sequence can be incorporated in designing a vaccine to provide cross-protection against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We also found 45 shared linear B-cell epitopes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that were antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergenic that can provide cross-protection against each other and can be utilized as potent vaccine candidates to elicit humoral immunity. We expect that this study may help researchers in developing an inexpensive epitope-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that may provide immunity to the entire world's population."}, {"section_title": "siRNAs and miRNAs", "text": "RNA interference-based silencing of viral genes provides an excellent alternative therapeutic tool.

A similar pattern of positioning of the viral taxa has been observed in the previous reports (Benvenuto et al., 2020a,b; Malik et al., 2020) , where all of the SARS-CoV-2 strains were clustered together, indicating their uniqueness and identity when compared with the previously reported strains (Supplementary Figures S1, S2) ."}, {"section_title": "Codon Usage and Bias Analysis", "text": "We analyzed the nucleotide composition, amino acid numbers, number of codons, relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), rare codons, codon context, effective number of codons (ENC), and codon adaptation index (CAI) for the different genes of SARS-CoV-2. The nucleotide composition of all of the coding regions in SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the most and least frequent bases are T and G, respectively. The nucleotide frequencies were T > A > C > G (Supplementary Table S20) . Also, the same frequency is observed for nucleotides at the third position (NT3s) of a codon. This shows that AT% > GC% in the SARS-CoV-2 genome ( Supplementary Table S20 ). Further, codon numbers and RSCU were analyzed. This gives the ratio of expected to observed frequencies of synonymous codon usage by amino acids. An RSCU value of 1 indicates no bias in codon usage, whereas RSCU values <1 or >1 indicate negative and positive codon usage bias (Sheikh et al., 2020) . From the RSCU values for different coding regions, the most preferred (RSCU \u2265 1.5) and the least favored codons (RSCU \u2264 0.5) are identified in Supplementary Table S21 . A list of codons and RSCUs values for each coding region, i.e., ORF1ab, ORF1a, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10, E, M, N, and S are provided on the web resource. The analysis showed that U3s and A3s were the most recurrent nucleotides in the represented (preferred) codons and that C3s and G3s were the least frequent in all coding regions. Furthermore, gene-wise rare codons are also shown in a histogram. Simultaneously, gene-wise codon context analysis is also performed using Anaconda software, which provides the association between two codons, and the color scale indicates the preferred (green color with residual value more than +3), rejected (red color with residual value more than \u22123), and codon context with no bias (black color with residual values \u22123 to +3) codon pairs. The codon context for all of the coding regions is also provided on the server.\nMoreover, codon usage bias is also deduced by determining the effective number of codons (ENC values) for different coding regions (Supplementary Table S22) . ENC values range between 20 and 61. The higher ENC values indicate low codon bias, which indicates that more synonymous codons are used for amino acids (Chen et al., 2017) . ENC values for different regions except ORF7b are greater than 40, which also shows low codon usage bias in SARS-CoV-2. In order to look into the relative adaptiveness of SARS-CoV-2 to its host, the codon adaptation index (CAI) was also calculated (Supplementary Table S22) . CAI values range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that the gene always uses the most frequently used synonymous codons in the reference set (Castells et al., 2017) . The mean CAI value for all coding regions is 0.686, which is greater than 0.5 and indicates moderate adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 to its host.\nWe have assessed all of the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 for codon usage patterns, bias, and adaptability to the host. SARS-CoV-2 showed low GC content, like other members of the Coronaviridae family, such as SARS-CoV (Zhao et al., 2008) , MERS-CoV (Chen et al., 2017) , and BCoV (Castells et al., 2017) . The RSCU values for each coding region in SARS-CoV-2 showed that almost all preferred codons ended with Us and As at the 3rd position of synonymous codons, whereas the least preferred ended with Gs and Cs at the 3rd position of synonymous codons. This showed that codon usage bias exists. The mean ENC value (46.845) of all coding regions in SARS-CoV-2 is greater than 40, which indicates low codon usage bias. This is consistent with previous studies on other SARS viruses like BCoV (mean ENC = 43.78), SARS-CoV (ENC = 48.99), Avian coronavirus Infectious bronchitis virus (ENC = 42.79), and Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (ENC = 47.91) (Castells et al., 2017) . The low codon usage bias indicates that SARS-CoV-2 might be able to use many synonymous codons to code for a single amino acid, which can be helpful in better survival and adaptability of a virus to its host. Further, to gain insight into the adaptation, the codon adaptation index (CAI) for each coding region was calculated in relation to the codon usage of its host, i.e., Homo sapiens. The mean CAI value of 0.686 showed better adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 to its host, Homo sapiens."}, {"section_title": "Structural Analysis and Interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins", "text": "In this analysis, six different important proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Helicase, Spike (S), Envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M) were structurally analyzed and compared against the other humaninfecting CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other HCoVs (OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1).

M proteins of some alphacoronaviruses contain an additional hydrophobic segment that functions as a signal peptide (de Haan and Rottier, 2005) ."}, {"section_title": "Envelope (E) Protein", "text": "Envelope (E) protein of coronavirus is a small, integral membrane protein containing 76 to 109 amino acids that are involved in assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis in the virus life cycle. The E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a remarkable 94% sequence identity, and other strains of coronavirus MERS, HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E share 36, 31, 31, 18, and 27%, respectively (Supplementary Figure S6) ."}, {"section_title": "Helicase Protein", "text": "The unwinding of the double-stranded oligonucleotides into the single-stranded form using ATP during the replication cycle of the coronavirus is carried out by the enzyme helicase. Helicase proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 99.83% sequence identity, and other strains of CoVs, i.e., MERS, HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E, share 72, 65, 68, 61, and 60%, respectively (Supplementary Figure S7) . Structural conservation of these helicase proteins from different CoVs is also shown in Supplementary Figure S3 . Helicase carries out the unwinding of nucleic acids during replication, recombination and DNA repair and is also involved in other biological processes, like movement of Holliday junctions, chromatin remodeling, displacement of proteins from nucleic acid, catalysis of nucleic acid conformational changes, and several aspects of RNA metabolism and mitochondrial gene expression (Adedeji and Lazarus, 2016) . As the helicases of different coronaviruses are very homologous, helicase inhibitors are good and reliable anti-CoV treatment options. The helicase inhibitors can be categorized into two groups depending on their mechanism of action. Bananins and 5-hydroxychromone derivatives come under the first class of inhibitors, which inhibit viral replication in vitro by preventing the unwinding and ATPase activity of SARS-CoV helicase (Tanner et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2011) . The second class of inhibitors includes those inhibitors that inhibit the unwinding but not the ATPase activity of helicase of CoV (Zumla et al., 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Nucleocapsid (N) Protein", "text": "This is a protein with numerous activities. Packaging of the viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) is done by the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. It plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly. The suppression of RNA silencing and RNA interference that is triggered by either short hairpin RNAs or siRNAs is done by the N protein. The SARS-CoV-2 N protein is a phosphoprotein of 419 amino acids, sharing 90% sequence identity with the N protein of SARS-CoV. It shows a sequence identity of 38, 36, 48, 38, and 28% with the 229E, HKU1, MERS, OC43, and NL63 strains, respectively (Supplementary  Figures S3, S8) . N protein consists of two separate domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), which are capable of binding to RNA in vitro via different mechanisms (Chang et al., 2006; Hurst et al., 2009) . It also binds to nsp3 and M protein, nsp3 being the key component of the replicase complex (Sturman et al., 1980; Hurst et al., 2009 Hurst et al., , 2013 . These protein interactions are likely to help in the packaging of the encapsulated genome into viral particles (Fehr and Perlman, 2015) . Previous studies also show that N protein has been widely used as a diagnostic target of SARS-CoV. Viral N protein is considered to be a genetically stable protein, which is a primary criterion for selecting an efficient drug target candidate. It is even a therapeutic target in antiviral therapy due to its role in pathogenicity inside the cell (Chang et al., 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Spike (S) Glycoprotein", "text": "Surface glycoprotein or Spike (S) is a major immunogenic antigen of CoVs that is essential for interactions between a virus and host cell receptor, i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S protein priming by a cellular protease, i.e., TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . It has also been found that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use a common receptor, ACE2, for entry, and this is important for understanding the transmissibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Further, it is also estimated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein may have high binding affinity toward Human ACE2 (Smith et al., 2020; Zhang H. et al., 2020) . In order to activate membrane fusion, virus entry, and syncytium formation, cleavage at the S1-S2 junction is necessary, and it undergoes structural rearrangement (Chan et al., 2015) . When receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 subunit attaches to the host cell receptors, it causes conformational changes in the S2 subunit, which ultimately leads to the fusion of the viral and the cell membrane by bringing them into close proximity (Lu et al., 2014; Wrapp et al., 2020) . Spike glycoprotein can be an ideal target for vaccine and antiviral development due to its role in receptor binding and membrane fusion. Various previous studies summarize the development of SARS vaccines based on the spike protein (Casais et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2005; Roper and Rehm, 2009; Du et al., 2010) . Various ideas and strategies (live-attenuated SARS-CoV, killed SARS-CoV, DNA vaccines, and viral-vectored vaccines) that have been used to develop vaccines against animal-CoVs could be used to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as well. Additionally, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor may block the entry of the virus and might constitute a treatment option (Casais et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2005; Roper and Rehm, 2009; Du et al., 2010; Morse et al., 2020) .\nS proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 75% sequence identity, and other strains of CoVs, MERS, HKU1, OC43, NL63, FIGURE 4 | (A) The Spike protein structure of SARS-CoV-2 (green) compared to SARS-CoV (red). The RBD is represented by a cartoon, while the rest of the protein is represented by sticks. The highlighted part is the comparison of the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 (Purple) and SARS-CoV (Cyan). Magnified view of RBM shows both subunits. Subunit 1 of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are highlighted in yellow and deep blue, respectively. Likewise, subunit 2 of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are depicted in gray and forest green, respectively. (B) The sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike RBD. The yellow and gray shaded parts represent the RBD of both of the CoVs, and the RBM is represented in red. The conservancy and variation among subunit 1 (black boxes) and subunit 2 (pink boxes) are also shown in the alignment. and 229E, share 35, 35, 37, 30, and 31% identity, respectively (Supplementary Figures S3, S9) . Further, S protein mainly consists of receptor-binding domain (RBD) and receptor-binding motif (RBM), which are critically important for viral entry and attachment. The RBD of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV shows high conservancy; however, it is important to notice that both of the subunits (S1 and S2) present in RBM show less conservancy, thus suggesting different modes and affinities to receptor binding and membrane fusion. The conservation and variation of RBD and RBM are shown in Figures 4A,B . The figure also depicts the receptor-binding S1 at amino-terminal and membrane fusion S2 subunits at carboxy-terminal along with RBD and RBM (Figures 4A,B) . Further, some major structural differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are depicted in Figure 5 . Moreover, the active sites of S protein interacting with ACE2 are very critical for viral entry and transmission. We also analyzed and mapped the active sites, i.e., T402, R426, Y436, Y440, Y442, S460, L472, N473, Y475, N479, D480, Y484, T486, T487, G488, and Y491 of SARS-CoV S protein RBD on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and marked the corresponding residues, which are structurally and sequentially conserved as putative active sites (Figure 6) .\nBased on the structural alignment, we found that amino acids at different positions, viz., T415, Y449, Y453, N487, Y489, T500, G502, and Y505, of SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD remained the same, corresponding to the SARS-CoV S protein amino acids, i.e., T402, Y436, Y440, N473, Y475, T486, G488, and Y491, respectively (Figure 6) . Furthermore, other amino acids, i.e., R and T at positions 426 and 487 of SARS-CoV was replaced by N at positions 439 and 501 of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Likewise, L445 of SARS-CoV-2 replaced the aromatic amino acid Y442, Q at positions 474, 493, and 498 replaced S460, N479, and Y484 of SARS-CoV, respectively. The L472 and D480 of SARS-CoV were substituted by the aromatic amino acid F at positions 486 and S494 of SARS-CoV-2, respectively (Figures 4B, 6) .\nAs S protein may be an ideal target for vaccine design and development and, to date, there is no licensed vaccine or drug available for the treatment of the infection (COVID-19) , a peptide vaccine could be designed based on S protein subunit 1, relying on the fact that ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (Shang et al., 2020) . We have also depicted the predicted potential B cell (linear and discontinuous) (Supplementary Figures S10, S11 ) and T cell (CD4 + , CD8 + , and CTL) vaccine candidates on S protein (Supplementary Figures S12, S13) . The Figure S11) .\nFurther, predicted CD4 + and CD8 + epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 are depicted on the S protein (Supplementary Figure S12) . The predicted epitopes are present at the 231-IGIN ITRFQTLLAH-245 (14 AA) and 61-NVTWFHAIHV-70 (10 AA) positions, respectively. Likewise, predicted CTL epitopes, i.e., 746-STECSNLLL-754, 821-LLFNKVTLA-829, 1053-VV FLHVTYV-1061, 827-TLADAGFIK-835, 507-PYRVVVLSF-515, 712-IAIPTNFTI-720, 886-WTFGAGAAL-894, 327-VRFPN ITNL-335, 505-YQPYRVVVL-513, 1016-AEIRASANL-1024, and 898-FAMQMAYRF-906 of length 9-mer, are also represented on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Supplementary Figure S13) .\nWe have focused on structure prediction and conservation analysis of distinct proteins of seven different CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2. Comparisons between different coronavirus proteins provided valuable information on protein evolution, conservation, and variations to strategically develop antiviral agents against different CoVs, specifically for SARS-CoV-2. We also provide mapping of putative binding sites of S protein and potential epitopes for the active development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Moreover, high conservation against different proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 provides an opportunity for the repurposing of small molecules and inhibitors and the development of cross-protective vaccine and antiviral therapy."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The ongoing infectious COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of deaths worldwide with no vaccine or therapeutic treatment to date to combat the deadly virus.
