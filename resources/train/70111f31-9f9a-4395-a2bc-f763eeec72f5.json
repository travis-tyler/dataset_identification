[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives. To assess tobacco product availability, advertised discounts, and prices in rural and nonrural stores, comparing results for two definitions of rural. Method. This geospatial study linked data from marketing surveillance in a representative sample of licensed tobacco retailers in California (n = 1,276) and categorized rural/ nonrural stores at the county and tract levels. Data were collected from January to March, 2017, and mixed-models analyses tested for differences by location (rural vs. nonrural). Results. Compared to nonrural stores, ruralcounty stores were 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI; 1.2, 3.6]) times more likely to sell chewing tobacco and 2.5 (95% CI [1.4, 4.2]) times more likely to sell roll-your-own. Rural-county stores sold larger packs of cigarillos for less than $1 (coefficient = 0.22, 95% CI [0.05, 0.39]) and charged less for the cheapest cigarette pack regardless of brand (estimated mean difference = $\u22120.21, 95% CI [\u22120.39, \u22120.03]). Contrary to expectation, a popular brand of chewing tobacco cost more in rural-county stores. A tract-level definition of rural reclassified only 1 in 10 stores, and did not substantially alter the results. Overall, 32.9% of stores advertised discounts on chewing tobacco, but this was more common in rural than nonrural census tracts (adjusted odds ratio = 1.81, 95% CI [1.14, 2.88] ). Discussion. Evidence that $1 buys more cigarillos in rural-county stores than elsewhere adds to health equity concerns that the prevalence of cheap, flavored tobacco is not limited to neighborhoods characterized by socioeconomic disadvantage, higher proportions of African Americans, and higher proportions of school-age youth. Policies that focus on the retail environment for tobacco are needed to make tobacco less attractive and more costly everywhere, including rural areas."}, {"section_title": "> > InTRoducTIon", "text": "Higher rates of tobacco use among rural populations represent a significant public health concern, with long-term consequences for geographic disparities in all tobacco-related cancers, such as cancer of the oral cavity, lung and bronchus, acute myeloid leukemia, and others (Zahnd et al., 2018) . Results from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Survey (2013-2014) confirm different patterns of tobacco use among adults in urban versus rural areas, defined by residence in census blocks with less than 2,500 residents per square mile (Roberts et al., 2017) . For example, the prevalence of past-month use among adults in rural areas was significantly higher for daily cigarette smoking (18.3% in rural areas vs. 13.4% in urban areas) and smokeless tobacco (6.3% vs. 2.1%); however, hookah use was significantly lower among adults in rural areas (0.9% vs. 2.5%) and past-month use of cigar products was not significantly different (Roberts et al., 2017) . Although adult cigarette smoking declined over the past decade, the gap in prevalence of cigarette smoking for adults in rural and urban areas widened from 2007 to 2014 (Doogan et al., 2017) .\nGeographic disparities in tobacco use are also evident among U.S. youth. Analyses of the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) substantiate different patterns of tobacco use among youth in urban areas versus rural areas, defined by residence in counties categorized as micropolitan or noncore (Ingram & Franco, 2012) . For example, the prevalence of past-month use was significantly higher among adolescents in rural areas for any tobacco (17.0% rural vs. 13.3% urban), cigarettes (11.0% rural vs. 6.7% urban), and smokeless (7.0% rural vs. 2.9% urban); however, past-month use of cigar products (6.6% vs. 5.8%) and e-cigarettes (3.2% vs. 3.4%) was not significantly different (Pesko & Robarts, 2017) . In more recent surveys, past-month cigarette smoking was higher among youth living in rural counties than in metropolitan counties in Florida and in California, the state where the current study was conducted (Bernat & Choi, 2018; Zhu et al., 2019) . According to the California Student Tobacco Survey 2017-2018, polyuse of tobacco products in the past 30 days was greater among high school students in rural counties than in nonrural counties (4.6% vs. 3.1%), including cigarettes (3.2% vs. 1.9%), roll-your-own cigarettes (0.8% v. 0.4%), little cigars/cigarillos (3.6% vs. 2.1%), smokeless (2.1% vs 1.7%), and hookah (2.0% vs. 1.7%) but not for e-cigarettes (8.0% vs. 11.2%; Zhu et al., 2019) . One in four rural-county high school students who were current cigarette smokers reported using rollyour-own (Zhu et al., 2019) .\nThis research is broadly informed by socioecological theory (Golden & Earp, 2012) and by specific concerns about environmental influences on tobacco use, such as preemption of tobacco control policies (U.S. Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2012, 2014) , inequities in the concentration of tobacco retailers (Rodriguez, Carlos, Adachi-Mejia, Berke, & Sargent, 2014) , and differential patterns of retail tobacco marketing (Lee, Henriksen, Rose, Moreland-Russell, & Ribisl, 2015) .\nWith concern for the growing geographic disparity in tobacco use, the rural retail environment for tobacco warrants more attention. In 2002, cigarette prices were lowest and advertising was more prevalent in U.S. stores located in catchment areas for rural schools than suburban and urban schools (Ruel et al., 2004) . However, more recent literature about rural tobacco marketing is limited to studies of Appalachian counties in Ohio and North Carolina. One Ohio study documented significantly fewer outdoor tobacco advertisements per store in Appalachia than in urban Columbus (Roberts, Berman, Slater, Hinton, & Ferketich, 2015) . In another Ohio study, the number of advertised smokeless tobacco brands doubled in three Appalachian Ohio counties within 1 year (2009 -2010 Klein et al., 2012) . In North Carolina, the odds of violating marketing restrictions (e.g., cigarettes labelled light/mild, self-service displays of cigarettes) were significantly higher at stores in one Appalachian county compared to two nonrural counties in that state (Rose, Myers, D'Angelo, & Ribisl, 2013) . This finding contributes to concerns about differential compliance with marketing restrictions and sales to minors in rural areas (Dai & Hao, 2018) .\nThis geospatial study advances the science about geographic inequities in retail marketing by comparing stores in rural and nonrural areas of California, a state with more than 2.7 million rural residents (Reynolds, 2017) . Given higher rates of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use among rural than urban residents (Doogan et al., 2017; Roberts et al., 2017; Pesko & Robarts, 2017) , we anticipated greater product availability, greater presence of advertised discounts, and lower prices in rural stores. The current study also examines how the classification of stores and the results from retail marketing surveillance differ for county-level and tract-level definitions of rural."}, {"section_title": "> > MeTHod", "text": "The California Tobacco Retail Surveillance Study (CTRSS) is an observational study in a large, representative cohort of licensed tobacco retailers that has been conducted five times since 2005 .

The CTRSS 2017 sample was enlarged using a state licensing list from December 2016, which had been geocoded using ArcGIS Version 10.1 (mapping rate = 98.6%). Because the state did not require vape shops to obtain a tobacco retailer license until 2017, the sampling frame was also modified to include vape shops identified from Yelp and Google in order to capture stores that were not yet licensed. We telephoned all tobacco retailers that were last visited in 2014 (n = 579), then randomly selected additional stores from the state retailer licensing list (n = 1,500) and from the list for vape shops from online sources (n = 145) for a target sample of 1,350."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "Our research team conducted a daylong training session with nine professional data collectors, including classroom instruction, a detailed manual, online quizzes, field practice, and debriefing.

In addition, data collectors recorded the price of multiple products. The survey averaged 18.4 minutes (SD = 10.3). Retail marketing surveillance was conducted between January and March 2017, before the state implemented a $2 increase in excise tax on cigarettes and increased tax on other tobacco products from 27.3% of the wholesale price (59.27% as of July 2019).\nTo assess interrater reliability (IRR), two different coders visited 75 randomly selected stores on separate occasions. The average time between visits was 4 days (SD = 3.8, minimum = 0, maximum = 21)."}, {"section_title": "Retail Marketing Measures", "text": "The current study reports on a subset of measures about product availability, promotion and price. Product availability measures whether the store sold cigarettes, little cigars/cigarillos, loose tobacco (roll-your-own), hookah, chewing tobacco, snus, and vaping products (vaping devices and e-liquids).\nAdvertised discounts are temporary price reductions, such as \"___ cents off,\" a lower price for purchasing multiple packs, buy-one-get-one-free, or another special price. Data collectors looked throughout the interior and exterior of the store for professionally produced signs, price boards, or stickers on products themselves. The presence of at least one advertised price discount (interior or exterior) was recorded for the four most commonly available tobacco products: cigarettes, little cigars/cigarillos, chewing tobacco, and vaping products.\nRegarding price, data collectors recorded the price and whether sales tax was included for five cigarette varieties: cheapest cigarette pack regardless of brand, Marlboro red, Newport menthol, Natural American Spirit (yellow), and Pall Mall (red; Epperson, Johnson, Schleicher, & Henriksen, 2019) . For chewing tobacco, data collectors recorded the price for Grizzly wintergreen (RJ Reynolds) and Copenhagen nonmenthol (Altria), both 1.2-ounce tins of long-cut chewing tobacco. Data collectors also recorded the largest quantity of cigarillos in a package (one, two, three, four, or more) that could be purchased for less than $1.00.\nData collectors classified stores into one of 10 categories: convenience stores, gas kiosk, head shop, liquor store, pharmacy, small market/deli/produce market, supermarket, tobacco shop, vape shop, or other (Epperson et al., 2019) . In the field, data collectors determined that 3.3% of the n = 1,350 phone verified stores were ineligible (i.e., no longer in business or selling tobacco). Reasons for incomplete observations in eligible stores were merchant refusal before/during surveillance and road closure due to inclement weather (completion rate = 98.1%, n = 1,277)."}, {"section_title": "Operational Definitions of Rural", "text": "One obstacle to characterizing the rural retail environment for tobacco is to define rural from options that vary by spatial unit (e.g., county, tracts, blocks, school catchment areas; Bernat & Choi, 2018; Pesko & Robarts, 2017) and by classification criteria, such as population density cutpoints and rural/urban continuum codes (James et al., 2017; Roberts et al., 2015) . The current study uses two classification options to designate rural areas. Specifically, the California Tobacco Control Program identified counties classified by health departments as rural (largely nonincorporated areas that are sparsely populated), which determines eligibility for grants from the state's Regional Rural Initiative to Reduce Tobacco-Related Disparities.\nFor sensitivity analyses, we used a tract-level definition of rural that avoids an assumption of a uniform distribution of population within rural counties. As in other studies of urban/rural differences in the retail environment for tobacco (Rodriguez, Carlos, Adachi-Mejia, Berke, & Sargent, 2013) , the tract-level definition of rural was derived from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes. RUCA codes classify census tracts into one of 10 categories based on 2010 census and 2006-2010 American Community Survey data about population size and commuting patterns (USDA, 2016) . Following a recommendation of the Economic Research Service of the USDA (rural Definition 8; USDA, 2010), we collapsed the 10 primary RUCA codes to compare stores in census tracts in nonrural, metropolitan areas (codes 1-3) with stores in census tracts in micropolitan, small town, and rural areas (codes 4-10). This dichotomous definition is recommended by the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (Health Resources and Services Administration, Federal Office of Rural Health Policy, 2018) and used in previous research (e.g., Coburn et al., 2007; Fan, Wen, & Kowaleski-Jones, 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "Analyses", "text": "Descriptive statistics were computed for product availability, advertised discounts, and prices by geography for both definitions of rural. Analyses of advertised discounts and prices were restricted to the subset of stores that sold the product category. Using ArcGIS Version 10.1, we created store-centered neighborhoods as the area (or buffer) defined by a \u00bd-mile roadway network around each store (i.e., the area that could be traveled from the store in any direction for \u00bd mile; buffer mapping rate = 99.9%, n = 1,276). Using ArcGIS and data from 5-year census tract estimates from the American Community Survey (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) , the store neighborhoods were characterized by median household income, non-Hispanic race (% African American, % Asian/Pacific Islander, % American Indian/Alaskan Native, % multiple/other races, % White), ethnicity (% Hispanic), % school-age youth (ages 5-17 years), % young adults (ages 18-24 years), and population density.\nUsing a county-level definition of rural yielded a multilevel data set, with stores (Level 1) nested within counties (Level 2). The average number of observed stores per county was 23 (SD = 46, minimum = 1, maximum = 324). Bivariate associations between type of county (rural vs. nonrural) and product availability, presence of advertised discounts, and prices were assessed using PROC GLIMMIX for binary outcomes (generalized linear mixed models) and PROC MIXED for numeric outcomes (linear mixed models) in SAS 9.4. These bivariate models included a random intercept, with full-likelihood estimation (binary outcomes). For bivariate associations with p value < .10 for county status, we estimated subsequent models that controlled for store type. Due to sparse data in rural counties, store type was recoded (convenience stores = 1, all other store types = 0). Price (before sales tax) was modeled because tobacco prices were typically advertised without sales tax and variation in local sales tax was 1.25% to 2.50% (California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, 2018). The State of California has no local excise taxes on tobacco.\nFor a tract-level definition of rural stores derived from RUCA classifications, data were not treated as nested because there was minimal clustering of stores (n = 1,276) within tracts (n = 1,130). Indeed, 88.8% of tracts had one store. Therefore, to assess bivariate differences between stores in rural and nonrural tracts, simple logistic regression models were used for binary outcomes (e.g., product availability and advertised discounts) and ordinary least squares regression models for numeric outcomes (e.g., price and number of cigarillos in largest pack). As for counties, subsequent models controlled for store type when bivariate associations with type of tract had a p value < .10."}, {"section_title": "Interrater Reliability", "text": "We computed Cohen's kappa statistics for binary measures and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for numeric measures. For product availability, kappa ranged from 0.59 for chewing tobacco to 0.97 for cigarettes. Presence of at least one advertised discount was the least reliable measure (kappa = .52 for cigarettes), and we excluded results for cigar products due to low reliability. The prevalence of discounts for chewing tobacco (12.2%) and vaping products (17.6%) among the 75 IRR stores was too low to compute kappa. However, percentage agreement for the presence of at least one advertised discount was high (89.2% for chewing tobacco, 82.4% for vaping products). Good reliability was obtained for the largest quantity of cigarillos for less than $1 (ICC = 0.75) and for cigarette prices (minimum ICC = 0.67 for Natural American Spirit, maximum = 0.81 for cheapest pack). However, IRR for price of chewing tobacco could not be computed because too few stores with repeat visits sold the specified varieties."}, {"section_title": "> > ResulTs", "text": "Table 1 characterizes store neighborhood demography, by rural classification for both county and tract. Focusing first on the county-level definition for rural stores, 31 of 58 California counties were rural and 11.4% of observed stores were located in rural counties. Convenience stores represented a greater proportion of the tobacco retailers in rural than in nonrural counties (53.1% vs. 41.4%). Median household income and population density were lower in store neighborhoods in rural than in nonrural counties. Table 2 summarizes retail availability, presence of advertised discounts, and tobacco prices in rural and nonrural California counties. After cigarettes, little cigars/ cigarillos were the most widely sold tobacco productin 87.6% of rural-county stores. Roll-your-own tobacco was available in the majority of rural-county stores (69.0%) and hookah was available in 9.7% of rural-county stores.

Regardless of the definition, rural stores were more than twice as likely to sell roll-your-own tobacco and chewing tobacco. Rural-tract stores were almost twice as likely to sell little cigars/cigarillos. Significantly larger packs of cigarillos were sold for less than $1 in rural-county stores and rural-tract stores were significantly more likely to advertise discounts on chewing tobacco, both of which would appeal to price-sensitive consumers, including youth (Chaloupka, 2003) . These geographic differences in retail tobacco marketing shed some light on geographic differences in tobacco use among California high school students (Zhu et al., 2019) .\nAlthough the cheapest cigarette pack regardless of brand cost significantly less in rural-county stores, at least one popular brand of chewing tobacco cost significantly more in rural stores, regardless of the definition. Perhaps the higher price reflects higher costs to stock products at stores located outside major cities, as observed in other research (Burton et al., 2014) .\nStrengths of the current study are data from a large representative sample of licensed tobacco retailers in a state with more than 2.7 million rural residents. The study assessed multiple conventional tobacco products, including roll-your-own tobacco and hookah/shisha, which are too little studied. Using the Standardized Tobacco Assessment for Retail Settings (Henriksen et al. 2016) , practitioners and advocates could assess and compare product availability, discounts, and price, focusing on sampling stores from neighborhoods that represent different priority populations to inform health equity (Pearlman, Arnold, Guardino, & Welsh, 2019) . With concern for geographic disparities, stratified sampling is recommended to ensure a sufficiently large number of retailers in the most rural areas.\nAnother strength of the current study is a sensitivity analysis that compared results for two operational definitions of \"rural.\" Less than 10% of stores were reclassified (i.e., rural-county stores in nonrural census tracts and vice versa). If there were substantial heterogeneity within the rural-tract category then we would anticipate greater reclassification of stores. There were few differences in results for county-and tract-level definitions of rural, suggesting that either measure could be used in future studies. However, additional research is needed to demonstrate that the tract-level and county-level measures may be interchangeable in states other than California.\nThe main limitation of the current study was that data were collected before California increased excise taxes on cigarette and noncigarette tobacco products. Given evidence that tobacco tax increases are not passed on equally to all consumers (Brock, Choi and Health, 2012 and Health, , 2014 , there is reason to expect that differential patterns for price and discounts persist in rural areas, but replication is warranted in California and elsewhere. Another limitation of the current study was the low IRR for some measures, particularly for advertised discounts (e.g., cigarettes and cigar products). In addition, there were too few observations of price for chewing tobacco from different observers in the same stores to compute reliability. Because low IRR can increase the probability of Type II errors (Hallgren, 2012) , the findings about advertised discounts should be interpreted with caution. The current study was also limited to one state; therefore future research should consider whether the findings generalize to markets other than California."}, {"section_title": "> > conclusIon", "text": "Evidence that $1 buys more cigarillos in rural-county stores than elsewhere adds to health equity concerns that the prevalence of cheap, flavored tobacco is not limited to neighborhoods characterized by socioeconomic disadvantage, higher proportions of African Americans, and higher proportions of school-age youth (Cantrell et al., 2013; Henriksen et al., 2017; Trapl, Yoder, Frank, Borawski, & Sattar, 2016) . To better characterize the omnipresence of tobacco in the rural retail environment, future research should assess what proportion of food stores (and all stores) sell tobacco (Lovato, Hsu, Sabiston, Hadd, & Nykiforuk, 2007) and investigate how geographic context, such as tobacco retailer density, proximity, and travel time, affects purchase behaviors and quit attempts (Doogan et al., 2018) . Greater retail availability of chewing tobacco in rural stores may also contribute to rural adolescents' perceptions that use is common and consistent with community norms (Couch, Darius, Walsh, & Chaffee, 2017) . Research that improves our understanding of how retail saturation of tobacco products influences personal attitudes and community norms about tobacco control is essential. Indeed, public health priorities to denormalize tobacco and to end its use are impossible to achieve in an environment where retailers and advertisements are omnipresent and low prices and flavors make tobacco attractive to youth.\nThe cheapest pack of cigarettes (regardless of brand) and little/cigars cigarillos cost less in rural-county stores than others, suggesting that minimum price and/or package size policies could equalize prices in rural and nonrural areas. To reduce the observed inequities in tobacco pricing in rural California and elsewhere (Lee et al., 2015) , policies could be enacted to establish a minimum pack size for little cigars/cigarillos, and establish minimum prices for cigarettes and other tobacco products, including roll-your-own tobacco. This is important because greater availability of roll-your-own in rural stores suggests that price harmonization could reduce geographic disparities in tobacco use (Agaku & Alpert, 2016) . Policy interventions could also restrict discounts and coupons as a tool for target marketing (Tobacco Control Legal Consortium, 2015) . Indeed, evidence suggests that price promotions contribute to the use disparities for cigarettes and chewing tobacco between rural and urban areas (Doogan et al., 2018) .\nTo address the gaps in federal regulation of menthol cigarettes and characterizing flavors (including menthol) in noncigarette tobacco products, at least 200 U.S. localities restrict the sales of flavored tobacco (Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, 2019). In California, however, only one of the 41 jurisdictions with such policies in 2019 was a rural county (The Center for Tobacco Policy and Organizing, 2019). Advancing tobacco use prevention in rural areas requires a focused investment in funding and capacity building. Assets of rural communities, including a mentality that rural areas are \"great places to raise kids,\" opportunities for informal networking, and increased access to decision makers (Reynolds, 2017) , could be leveraged to limit youth exposure to retail tobacco marketing."}, {"section_title": "oRcId ids", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Lisa Henriksen", "text": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9288-3562\nTrent O.
