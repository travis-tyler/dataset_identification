[{"section_title": "COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", "text": "Coronavirus-2) a divergent RNA (ribonucleic acid) virus for the present devasting the world, with over 60 million cases and more than 1.4 million deaths until November 25, 2020 (1) . The SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and how COVID-19 disease spread rapidly in the early phase across the globe contributed to the genetic diversity inside the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 including clades (2, 3) . Scientists isolated the virus and named SARS-CoV-2, they found a high nucleotide sequence homology with Betacorona viruses isolated from bats such as bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (88%) and Malayan pangolins Pangolin-CoV (85.5% to 92.4%) (4) . Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 share similarity with other emerging human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV (79.5%) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, MERS (50%) (5, 6) .\nThe family of coronaviridae under the betacoronavirus genus as an RNA virus causes various diseases in birds and mammals, including SARS-CoV-2. It contains an RNA polymerase with proofreading activity (7, 8) . The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains ~29800 bp (9) , therefore Sprotein (spike protein) covers the surface of SARS-CoV-2, and consists of 1273 amino acids with a protein size between 180-200 kDa. The S-protein is composed of two subunits (S1 and S2) which play a key role in the cell membrane fusion process and receptor recognition, hence Spike protein becomes a target for vaccine development(10) (11, 12) . The analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence showed that Spike protein and RNA polymerase endure constant mutations according to geographic location (Asia, Europe and America). The SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis and generation of data have been a key component of discovering SARS-CoV-2 4 pathogenicity (13) (14) (15) . Due to the frequent travels link between Rwanda to other geographic regions like China, United Arab Emirates, Europe, America and other African countries. It enhanced the chance to spot the first COVID-19 case on March 14, 2020;  in Rwanda and the initial period of total lockdown started seven days later on March 21, 2020 (16) . We hypothesized that the viral evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We aimed to track evolution and mutation within nucleotides sequence and proteins of SARS-CoV-2 genome by phylogenetic analysis to understand the pathogenesis and viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 in Rwanda."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "In total, we downloaded 75 genomes sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/) database, such as 10 genomes parameters (17) . All targeted genomes of SARS-CoV-2 samples were aligned to the reference strains using the Maximum Parsimony method by the Subtree-Pruning-Regrafting algorithm (18) .\nThe nucleotide variants within the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the coding regions were performed by Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool (19) ."}, {"section_title": "Phylogenetic analysis", "text": "We compared the SARS-CoV-2 query sequences isolated in Rwanda from July to August 2020 to the other SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated in Africa with Wuhan strains. The analysis of phylogenomic indicated that SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Rwanda belongs to lineage B.1. We found a significant sequence similarity of 90-95% between the WH-Human1_China_2019-Dec genome sequence and the SARS-CoV-2 present in Rwanda. Our data add to important information about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Rwanda (Supplementary figure S1)."}, {"section_title": "Mutational analysis", "text": "The lineage assessment among the different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B and B.1) indicated that lineage B.1 dominant in the SARS-CoV-2 genome isolated from Rwanda. All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequence from Rwanda presents a universal type of mutations. "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The government of Rwanda implemented public health measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 like national lockdown, social distance between people, wearing face masks in public.\nTherefore, the tracing showed that COVID-19 disease was maintained within the cities of Rwanda and no further spread of SARS-Cov-2 in the entire population, which resulted in a lower number of positive COVID-19 cases (16) (Fig. 1) . The availability of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 supports valuable resources to understand the viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (20) .\nThe genetic variation of the virus is classified into three clades (S, V, and G) (21); hence we note that clade G appears to be predominant in ten clinical sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Rwanda. The clade G was mostly spread in North America and Europe (22, 23) . The phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from Rwanda showed to be belonging to 1 1 phylogenetic lineage B.1, which is sharing a common ancestor with the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated in Europe, America, Asia and Australia (24) . Further, the evolutional history was inferred using the Maximum Parsimony method with 0.223 of consistency index (CI), 0.636 of retention index (RI) and 0.142 of the composite index, therefore if CI is less than 0.5 designated that much homoplasies has occurred which is similar to our findings (25) . The percentage of replicated tree taxa clustered indicated 90-95% (Supplementary figure S1). We performed a mutational analysis by observing changes in bases within SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table 3) and\nwe found that all genomes sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Rwanda has a common type of mutations (Table 4) "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The phylogenetic analysis shows genetic variation and the common genes or proteins but doesn't rule out the probability that the importation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus originates from Europe, Asia or America. We recommend that the utility of epidemic surveillance based on genome sequence analysis as a key factor in monitoring the evolution and origin of SARS-CoV-2 in Rwanda. 1 3 "}]
