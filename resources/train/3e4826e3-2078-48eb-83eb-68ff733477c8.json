[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Analysis of North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data requires controls for factors that influence detectability of birds along survey routes. Identifying factors that influence the counting process and incorporating them into analyses is a primary means of limiting bias in estimates of population change. Twedt (2015) implemented an alternative counting protocol on operational and nonrandom BBS survey routes in the southeastern United States. Observers on selected routes employed a time-distance protocol in which they recorded birds in 1-min intervals and in 2 distance categories. We hypothesized that processing and recording observations using this time-distance protocol could cause observers to count fewer birds relative to observers using the standard protocol. We used a hierarchical log-linear model with a categorical covariate associated with protocol (standard vs. time-distance) to assess whether use of the time-distance protocol had a measurable effect on counting birds along BBS routes. We applied this model to BBS data from portions of 8 states in which the time-distance protocol was implemented and estimated a protocol effect for 167 bird species. We documented a significant overall effect of the time-distance protocol on observers' counts of birds. On average, the effect of the time-distance protocol was a 10% decline in counted birds; 80% of species had lower counts when the time-distance protocol was used on a survey route. However, because the time-distance protocol was only used on a small portion of the operational BBS routes and for a limited time, including the covariate for the time-distance protocol data had insignificant effects on analysis of population change. Although the covariate controlled for the effects of the time-distance protocol in BBS data, the results emphasize the importance of standardization as well as a need to track and, if necessary, control in analyses for changes in counting procedures along BBS routes."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is a roadside survey of birds that covers the contiguous United States, Alaska, most of Canada, and portions of Mexico (Sauer et al. 2013) . BBS data are collected using a simple protocol. Birds are sampled at 50 stops along roadside routes using 3-min point counts, during which observers record all birds heard as well as birds seen within a 400-m radius of the point. Because counts collected at stops are not censuses, BBS data are potentially affected by changes to the counting process that influence the probability of detection. All analyses of BBS data must in some way accommodate the issue of incomplete detection of the total number of individuals present. For analysis of population change, which is a primary use of BBS data, controls for observer effects are a routine component of analyses (Sauer et al. 1994b . However, because a variety of other factors can influence counts on BBS routes, identification of additional factors is an active source of research.\nHierarchical models presently used to analyze BBS data have great flexibility for modeling and controlling for factors that might bias estimation of population change, provided the factors are observable covariates that can be included in the models. Phenology (year-day effects) and automobile-related disturbance (number of cars) are factors that we have assessed for possible influence on counts and population change estimation (Griffith et al. 2010 , Sauer et al. 2013 . We view identifying and evaluating the importance of factors influencing counts on BBS routes to be an essential component of survey development, as uncontrolled sources of variation in detectability of birds have the potential to undermine the credibility of the survey.\nSome investigators have recommended modifying BBS protocols to allow direct estimation of detectability (e.g., Nichols et al. 2000) . These modified protocols generally have associated analysis procedures that permit direct estimation of detectability. However, all proposed protocols that provide direct information for detectability estimation (such as collection of distance, time of observation, or replicate survey data) have significant logistical or practical limitations that make implementation problematic at regional scales (e.g., Nichols et al. 2000; Farnsworth et al. 2005 , Alldredge et al. 2008 , Riddle et al. 2010 . Consequently, the official BBS protocols and current analyses of BBS data (e.g., do not incorporate any of these modified protocols due to concerns that modified protocols are likely to influence the counting process; that is, a 3-min count conducted while collecting time and/or distance (time-distance) data is likely to record fewer birds than a count conducted without time-distance data due to the time required to record and process the additional information. If modified protocols do influence detection of birds, a protocol effect would have to be controlled for in analyses. Implementations of time-distance protocols on BBS routes thus need to be evaluated to determine whether they have a measurable effect on counts. Twedt (2015) implemented a time-distance protocol (Farnsworth et al. 2005) for counting on BBS routes. The intent of the study was to estimate species-specific detection rates and compute regional population estimates for selected species (e.g., Rosenberg and Blancher 2005) . His procedure involved collecting covariate information on distance (\u226450 m and >50 m from point) and time (three 1-min categories) of detections for bird count data collected during the standard 3-min BBS counting period at each stop. He implemented this protocol along specifically created \"nonrandom\" BBS routes within national parks. Routes with this designation are maintained by the BBS program to meet local monitoring needs but, because these routes were not established using standard BBS protocols, the results they provide are not included in USGS population analyses. The time-distance protocol was also implemented on a subset of standard BBS routes in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. Twedt (2015) began collecting data in 2009; data were collected using the modified protocol until 2015 when the experiment was completed. Data from these time-distance protocol surveys were summed across time and distance categories to arrive at the standard BBS data format, which was then submitted to the BBS office. Because they were submitted in the form of standard BBS summaries, the summarized time-distance protocol data were originally not differentiated within the BBS dataset. However, based on a preliminary analysis conducted in 2015, these data were assigned unique \"run type\" codes (501 and 502) within the BBS dataset (Pardieck et al. 2018) to distinguish them from data collected using the standard BBS protocol (run type 101).\nThese time-distance data (Twedt 2015) provide an opportunity to examine a critical question: Do changes to the standard BBS counting protocol influence the counting process? We hypothesized that implementation of the time-distance protocol would be associated with lower counts along survey routes, as collection of the additional data increases the burden on observers for categorizing and recording data (Nichols et al. 2000) . Answering this question will assist BBS coordinators in defining guidelines for future requests for use of time-distance protocols on BBS routes.\nWe evaluated the consequences of including routes surveyed with this time-distance protocol on the annual BBS analyses. Hierarchical models currently used for the analysis of temporal change in bird populations from BBS data allow for model-based controls for factors influencing detection rates of birds that operate at the scale of survey routes. Start-up effects in BBS data are controlled for with a single parameter that models a proportional change\nThe Condor: Ornithological Applications XX:1-12, \u00a9 2019 American Ornithological Society in counts associated with the first year of an observer's counts (Kendall et al. 1996) . Similarly, here we modified BBS models to include a protocol effect, using a parameter that models proportional change in counts associated with a time-distance protocol. Although ~170 species were encountered on BBS routes in regions where the time-distance protocol was implemented, many of these species had limited data and protocol effects could only be imprecisely estimated. To accommodate the differences in quality of information, we employed an additional hierarchical model to estimate composite protocol effects among species ."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "BBS Survey Design", "text": "The BBS is a continental-scale roadside survey of birds. Standard BBS routes are randomly located within degree blocks of latitude and longitude and consist of 50 pointcount locations (stops) located ~800 m (~0.5 miles) apart. To assist in localized research and monitoring efforts, the BBS program additionally maintains some nonstandard routes established by nonrandom means on public lands (e.g., roads within national parks). Routes are surveyed once each year, by a single observer during a ~1.5-mo period that varies latitudinally to accommodate differences in peak bird breeding activity. The observer drives the route path, beginning 30 min before local sunrise, and conducts 3-min point counts at each roadside stop, recording all birds heard as well as birds seen within a 400-m (0.25 mile) radius of the point. Sauer et al. (2013 provide more detailed information regarding the BBS design and analysis. Twedt (2015) implemented a modified BBS protocol that incorporated time and distance information. At each count point, observers were instructed to record categorical distance (\u226450 m and >50 m from point) and time (three 1-min intervals) information associated with each observation, for all birds heard as well as birds seen within a 400-m radius of the point. Implementation of the modified protocols involved levels of training similar to standard BBS protocol training (i.e. observers were not tested on counting or distance-estimation abilities). Twedt (2015) analyzed data from 130 surveys on 36 BBS routes, but in total the protocol was used during 297 surveys conducted from 2009 to 2015 on 106 routes (Pardieck et al. 2018) ."}, {"section_title": "Time-Distance Protocol", "text": "Routes were surveyed with the time-distance protocol in states surrounding the lower Mississippi River. The standard USGS trend and relative abundance analyses use strata defined as the intersection of states and Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs; Sauer 2002, Sauer et al. 2013 "}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "We modified a hierarchical log-linear model used in BBS analyses , Sauer et al. 2013 to assess the effects of the time-distance protocol. This model describes counts, Y ijt , as conditionally independent Poisson random variables with means \u03bb ijt ,\nExpected counts \u03bb ijt are explained by stratum-specific intercepts (S) and slopes (\u03b2), along with effects for observer/ route combinations (\u03c9), year (\u03b3), and overdispersion effects ( ); i, j, and t index stratum, route/observer, and year, respectively. Start-up effects (\u03b7) model additive change on the log scale associated with first-years of counting on routes. The model also includes a protocol effect \u03d5 , allowing for additive change on the log scale in counts associated with routes and years for which the time-distance protocol was used. The indicator I ( j, t) takes values 1 (for counts associated with first year of survey by an observer on a route) or 0 (for other than first-year observations). Similarly, L ( j, t) indexes protocols, taking values 1 if the time-distance protocol was used on the route or 0 if the standard BBS protocol was used. Following Sauer et al. (2013) , S i , \u03b2 i , \u03b7, and \u03d5 were assigned mean zero diffuse normal prior distributions. Observer/route effects (\u03c9), and overdispersion effects (\u03f5) were assigned mean zero normal prior distributions, with common variances \u03c3 2 \u03c9 and \u03c3 2 , respectively. Year effects were assigned mean zero normal priors, with variances \u03c3 2 \u03b3i that varied among strata. All variances were assigned flat inverse gamma prior distributions. We fit the model to all strata within which the timedistance protocol was implemented. In this analysis, we used data collected through 2015. Because the primary interest of our analysis was to model the protocol effect, \u03d5 , we included nonrandom routes in the analysis. Of the 297 surveys that implemented the time-distance protocol, 107 were on 29 nonrandom routes. We fit the model using program JAGS (Plummer 2003 ) that implements the iterative Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure for estimating posterior distributions of parameters. We allowed 10,000 iterations for burn-in (time for the MCMC procedure to stabilize), then used the next 10,000 iterations to estimate 2.5th, 50th (median), and 97.5th percentiles of the posterior The Condor: Ornithological Applications XX:1-12, \u00a9 2019 American Ornithological Society distributions. We used these percentiles from the posterior distributions as our estimates and associated credible intervals of parameters. Our experience with these models has shown that a burn-in of 10,000 iterations is sufficient for BBS analyses (Sauer and Link 2011 ).\nApplication of model (1) to data for each bird species encountered in the study area results in a collection of estimated means (\u03c6 s ) and variances (V (\u03c6 s )) of the posterior distributions of \u03d5 s , where s indexes species. These estimates are difficult to compare due to differences in the quality of the results; species with limited data provide poor estimates that tend to be extreme, leading to poor estimates of rankings and means of the collection of estimates. Developing reasonable approaches for summary of collections of estimates has been an important aspect of BBS research (e.g., Link and Sauer 1995 , Link and Barker 2010 . Statistical approaches for summary of collections of estimates employ shrinkage estimators; see Efron and Morris (1977) for an interesting discussion of the history of these approaches. We use a hierarchical model described in Sauer and Link (2002) for summary analysis of \u03d5 s among species. In this summary analysis, the model defines each \u03c6 s as a random quantity governed by a normal distribution with mean \u03c8 s and a variance; the estimated variances of \u03c6 s are assumed to have a chi-square distribution. The \u03c8 s (i.e. the actual parameter values for species s) are treated as a sample of a normal distribution with mean \u00b5 \u03c8 and variance \u03c3 2 \u03c8 . Sauer and Link (2002) applied this model to summary of a collection of trend estimates, but the model and the general conceptual approach (i.e. Efron and Morris 1977) is applicable to summary of any collection of estimates. Here, the model uses the estimates (\u03c6 s ) and their estimated variances as input, and model output is species-specific posterior distributions of \u03c8 s , the modelbased posterior distribution of the parameters, and the posterior distribution of the mean protocol effect \u00b5 \u03c8 . This analysis allows us to make statements about the attributes of the collection of protocol effects, provides a means of assessing the relative precision of species-specific \u03c6 s, and improves estimation of species-specific \u03c6 s (i.e. by permitting estimation of \u03c8 s ) in the context of the group . We calculated the posterior distributions of (1) the mean protocol effect (\u00b5 \u03c8 ), (2) the number and proportion of species with negative protocol effects, and (3) the model-based estimates of protocol effects (\u03c8 s ); (1) and (2) provide overall summaries of the protocol effect over all species, and (3) provides information about both the ordering of the estimates and their relative precision. The ratio of the 95% credible interval width of \u03c6 s (estimated species-specific protocol effect) to the 95% credible interval width of \u03c8 s (species-specific protocol effect) provides a measure of relative precision of the species-specific estimate. We used program WinBUGS (Lunn et al. 2000) to implement the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure for estimating posterior distributions of parameters; we allowed 10,000 iterations for burn-in, and used iterations 10,001-20,000 to estimate 2.5, 50 (median), and 97.5 percentiles of the posterior distributions. For presentation of results, we transform \u03c8 s and \u03c6 s to percentage changes,\nThat is, a \u03c8 s = 100% indicates that a count collected using the alternative protocol effect is 100% (i.e. the same as) of a count collected with the standard protocol."}, {"section_title": "Protocol Effects on Regional Trend Estimation", "text": "Our analysis of protocol effects cannot be used to directly address the effects of the inclusion of time-distance protocol data on population trend estimates. Nonrandom routes were included in our analysis to maximize the number of routes for estimation of the protocol effect; 36% (107 of 297 surveys) of the time-distance data used in this study came from nonrandom routes that are not included in standard BBS analyses (e.g., . We also limited our analysis to strata in which the time-distance protocol was implemented and included only years up to the final year of the protocol.\nTo estimate the differences in estimated trend associated with omission of the protocol covariate, we incorporated the protocol covariate into the full BBS analysis, estimating population trend at the scale of the entire survey area and states for all species for which we estimated protocol effects. Although the protocol covariate documents the direct effect on counts of a change in protocol, those effects may have little influence on estimated population change, which is a derived statistic in our analysis. To produce a trend estimate from model (1), we first estimated yearly annual indices of abundance at the scale of a single stratum i (i.e. n i,t = exp(S i + \u03b2 i (t -t*) + \u03d2 i,t + 0.5\u03c3 \u03c9 2 + 0.5\u03c3 \u03b5 2 ); regional indices were area-weighted means of component n i,t . Trends were defined as ratios of annual indices-the trend from 1966 to 2017 for stratum i is defined as:\n(Sauer and Link 2011).\nOur focus was on estimation of differences in estimated trend associated with not including the protocol covariate for regional analyses-fitting model (1) with and without the protocol effect, \u03d5 , and estimating the difference in trend estimates when the protocol covariate is included in, or omitted from, the analysis. As in the protocol analysis, we fit these models using a Bayesian analysis, using Markov chain Monte Carlo to estimate posterior distributions of the trend parameter. We computed trends for all species occurring in the 8 states and survey wide, determined whether trends based on\nThe Condor: Ornithological Applications XX:1-12, \u00a9 2019 American Ornithological Society analyses including and omitting the protocol covariate were significantly different (as defined by overlapping of 95% credible intervals based on percentiles of their posterior distributions), and computed a mean difference between the trend estimates for each species."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "We obtained protocol effect estimates (\u03c6 s ) for 167 species (Table 1) . These species comprise a diverse group; as might be expected they vary greatly in number of routes on which they were encountered, from 4 to 396, with a mean of 199 routes. Because these species differ greatly in habitat preferences and life history characteristics, estimates of the protocol effects vary widely in both precision and magnitude ( Figure 1A) . Ranking results by magnitude of \u03c6 s documents that many of the extreme values are also extremely poorly estimated, as shown both by the very large credible intervals associated with the \u03c6 s and by the differences in the \u03c8 s that are plotted with these estimates ( Figure 1A ). Reordering the graphic to sort by ranking of \u03c8 s shows a clearer picture of the ranking of the protocol effect ( Figure 1B) ; many of the extreme \u03c6 s provide little information. When considered as part of the collection of estimates, their lack of precision places them in the middle of the rankings. The ratio of the length of the credible intervals associated with \u03c6 s to that of \u03c8 s (i.e. our measure of relative precision) is >4 for 57 of the 167 species.\nThe summary analysis permits an overall assessment of the protocol effects, controlling for the differences of precision of the \u03c6 s. The overall mean \u00b5 \u03c8 , when transformed to a percentage (i.e. exp(\u00b5 \u03c8 ) \u00d7 100), is 90.0% (87.3, 92.5), indicating that on average, implementing the time-distance protocol on a survey route resulted in 10% fewer observations. Our summary analysis estimated the number of \u03c8 s > 100% as 34 (21, 49) ; the percentage of species for which \u03c8 s > 100% was 20. 4% (12.6, 29. 3), that is, the time-distance protocol leads in general to a diminution in the number of birds counted along BBS routes. Ten species with very small sample sizes had very small \u03c6 s. For these species, the summary analysis produced \u03c8 s very close to the overall mean. As the 10 species had similar \u03c8 s , we omitted them from Figure 1 . We include these species results in Table 1 , but note that they had little effect on the summary analysis. Conducting the summary analysis without those species (N = 157) results in estimates of exp(\u00b5 \u03c8 ) \u00d7 100 of 90.0% (86.9, 93.1), very similar to results produced when the 10 species are included in the analysis.\nThe time-distance protocol data collected from 190 surveys along operational BBS routes, when included in the standard BBS analyses (e.g., , did not significantly influence our estimates of population change. Summary trends are presented as part of our web-based Summary and Analysis ; here, we summarize results among species within states and overall. For all regions, none of the trends considered in this analysis differed between analyses (as shown by overlapping 95% CIs) for any species. Survey-wide, the average absolute difference in trends among the 167 species was 0.05% per year, but among states, average absolute differences were slighter larger, ranging from 0.15% per year to 0.25% per year (Table 2) . We note that there were no consistent differences among trends estimated including and omitting the covariate within species; for all states the mean differences were very close to 0 (mean difference in among states = \u22120.011% per year), and survey-wide the mean difference was \u22120.001% per year."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Controlling for methodological features that influence counts is a critical component of BBS analyses. Results presented here indicate that BBS operations and analyses need to be sensitive to the possibility that changes in the counting procedures can produce measurable changes in counts. Modifying the standard BBS counting protocol to include time-distance measures (Twedt 2015) had a significant overall effect on observers' counts of birds. By including a categorical covariate associated with protocol (standard vs. time-distance) in our hierarchical log-linear model, we could estimate a protocol effect for 167 bird species. Although species results varied in quality of information, we quantified an average decline of 10% in counts, with 80% of species having lower counts when the timedistance protocol had been used on a survey route. For users of BBS data, this result has a clear implication: If data collected using the time-distance protocol exist on BBS routes you are analyzing, you need to consider how these data are likely to influence your analysis and if necessary control for protocol effects. The models presented here provide a reasonable approach to control for protocol effects in multi-route (i.e. stratum-level) analyses. For routelevel summaries of BBS data (e.g., route trend analyses in ), a protocol effect could be modeled in either a Poisson regression or semiparametric smooth (Fewster et al. 2000 .\nFrom the standpoint of regional BBS analyses, we wanted to ensure that the time-distance protocol data collected on BBS routes were clearly documented, in both metadata for users and effects on population change estimation. Even though 107 of the 287 surveys conducted using the timedistance protocols were on routes not used in most BBS analyses, the remaining 180 surveys represent a significant amount of data that we felt should be incorporated into the analysis if logistically feasible. However, routinely adding on the additional column of information (the L(j,t) in Eq. 1) needed to estimate the covariate complicates the data management and analysis, and is not relevant for most of the regions in the survey. Our evaluation of the consequences associated with not including the protocol covariate on trend estimation indicated that there were no significant effects on trend estimates associated with including the 190 surveys in the standard analysis without the protocol effect. This is to be expected, as there is no reason to expect that any short-term lowering of counts during years in which the protocol effect was implemented would not carry over to influence trend estimates after the time-distance protocol was discontinued. Unlike a single route analysis, regional analyses involve data from many routes, and protocol effects are less evident when combined with routes not experiencing changes in protocols. Also, the time-distance protocol data cover only a short interval within the time-series; no time-distance protocol data were collected on any routes after 2015. Of course, even though effects associated with the alternative protocol appears negligible in the context of regional trend estimates, this result does not convey to other inferences. For example, there is some evidence that occupancy analyses show lower detection probabilities in regions where the time-distance protocol was used (C. W. Rushing, personal communication), suggesting that caution be used in evaluating annual indices or metrics of trend based on linear regression in the 14 strata during years in which the time-distance protocol was implemented. Analysts of BBS data should be cautious in use of these data and consider whether protocol effects might need to be included in their analysis.\nOur experience with the time-distance data also provides useful insights into the complications of managing data collected using nonstandard BBS protocols. Although the BBS program has anticipated the possibility that data can be collected using alternative protocols (e.g., BBS The Condor: Ornithological Applications XX:1-12, \u00a9 2019 American Ornithological Society metadata lists 28 run protocol IDs in file RunProtocolID. txt), there are significant costs associated with curation and maintenance of these data, and no capacity presently exists for management of data collected using alternative protocols. The time-distance protocol data were summarized into the form of standard BBS data (i.e. counts for each species at each stop without time and distance information) and entered in the BBS data set. Although the protocol ID \"flags\" these data as different from data collected using standard BBS protocols, users are left with uncertainty about possible uses of these data. There is also the risk that users will ignore the protocol ID for data that appear to be standard BBS data. Without evaluations such as those presented here, use of these summarized data are problematic. Although it would be preferable to provide the full time-distance data, the BBS program lacks resources to curate and provide appropriate metadata for the observation-specific time and distance information collected during the counts. It is likely that future innovations to improve our modeling of BBS counts will require collection of additional information while surveying BBS routes. These data may offer new opportunities for analysis, but we have shown that vigilance is needed to ensure that they are appropriately integrated with historical protocols to prevent bias in trend estimation. Concerns about data collection activities and how they influence counts extend well beyond the clearly defined protocol changes; many more-subtle changes in observer activities likely influence bird detection along BBS routes. Collecting additional data during the surveys is a temptation for some observers; at least one observer was known to collect \"how sighted\" data (visual or aural; Sauer et al. 1994a) , and many BBS observers participate in many bird monitoring programs such Breeding Bird Atlases and eBird, leading to a temptation to collect additional data such as breeding status information along BBS routes, or directly entering data using mobile phone apps such as eBird Mobile (http://help.ebird. org/customer/portal/articles/1848031-ebird-mobile-appsoverview) to record data during BBS counts. These observer activities merit scrutiny for their potential to influence counts on BBS routes. Gradual, undocumented implementation of counting and data recording methods along BBS routes can lead to changes in counts and bias in trend estimates, and BBS coordinators must ensure that they have adequate understanding and documentation of how observers are counting along routes. Observer training should highlight this concern, as many BBS observers are likely unaware of the need to communicate to the BBS office their use of apps or other approaches that could change the efficiency of counting.\nThis study demonstrates the need to balance any possible benefits of alternative protocols and costs associated with additional data management and analytical complexity. Survey coordinators should be conservative in recommending changes to the standardized BBS protocols, and need to be alert to the effects of changes in the counting process. We recommend that any change in the counting protocols must (1) be demonstrated to clearly benefit the estimation of population change from BBS data, and (2) be implemented only after a clear analysis framework has been developed that integrates new data with historical data to permit comprehensive analyses based on all BBS data. The BBS office has funded a variety of studies to investigate alternative protocols to enhance inference from the BBS (e.g., Riddle et al. 2010) , including the detectability analysis presented in Farnsworth et al. (2005) that the time-distance protocol is designed to inform. Although we encourage innovation in counting and estimation for the BBS, plans for implementing these innovations in the counting procedures should undergo careful review to ensure that analyses can provide continuity with historical data. Without careful planning and implementation, changes in counting procedures or recording of data could undermine the comparability of the survey's data and damage the credibility of the survey.\nResults presented here focus solely on the consequences of the time-distance protocol in the context of the current analytical model for BBS data; we did not attempt to use the additional information collected from the protocol to enhance inference by directly estimating detectability. Twedt (2015) used these data to estimate detection at the species level to permit adjustment of BBS counts to abundance estimates. Although data collected using the alternative protocol could, in principle, be used to estimate detection associated with observers and other factors relevant to the estimation of population change, its use for this purpose has not been explored."}]
