& PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nExecutive Summary\nTIMSS 2003 is the third in a continuing cycle of international mathematics and science assessments conducted every four years. TIMSS assesses achievement in countries around the world and collects a rich array of information about the educational contexts for learning mathematics and science, with TIMSS 2003 involving more than 50 participants. This report contains the science results for 46 countries and four benchmarking participants at the eighth grade and for 25 countries and three benchmarking participants at the fourth grade. Trend data are provided at the eighth and fourth grades for those countries that also participated in 1995 and 1999 (please see the Introduction for more information about TIMSS 2003.)\nStudents\u2019 Science Achievement in 2003\n\u2022 At the eighth grade, Singapore and Chinese Taipei were the topperforming countries having signi\ufb01cantly higher average science achievement than the rest of the participating countries. The Republic of Korea also performed very well, with average achievement signi\ufb01cantly higher than all of the other participating countries except Singapore, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong, SAR.\n\u2022 At the fourth grade, Singapore was the top-performing country with higher average science achievement than all other participating countries. Chinese Taipei had signi\ufb01cantly higher performance\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n3\n\n\fEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nthan all countries except Singapore, and, in turn, Japan, Hong Kong SAR, and England outperformed the rest of countries except Singapore and Chinese Taipei.\nTrends in Science Achievement\n\u2022 At the eighth grade, several countries showed signi\ufb01cantly higher average science achievement in 2003 compared to the previous assessments in 1995 and 1999. Korea, Hong Kong SAR, the United States, and Lithuania as well as the benchmarking Canadian province of Ontario, showed a pattern of improvement from assessment to assessment with signi\ufb01cant change over the 8-year period from 1995 to 2003. Of the countries with results only from the 1999 and 2003 assessments, Malaysia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, and the Philippines showed signi\ufb01cant improvement.\n\u2022 At the eighth grade, countries showing a decrease in average achievement in 2003 compared to previous assessments (1995, 1999, or both) included Hungary, Sweden, the Slovak Republic, Belgium (Flemish), the Russian Federation, Norway, Bulgaria, Iran, Cyprus, Indonesia, and Tunisia.\n\u2022 At the fourth grade, many countries showed signi\ufb01cant gains in average achievement between 1995 and 2003, including Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, England, Hungary, Latvia (LSS)1, New Zealand, Slovenia, Cyprus, and Iran, as well as the benchmarking province of Ontario. The only signi\ufb01cant declines were found in Japan, Scotland, Norway, and Quebec province.\nGender Differences in Science Achievement\n\u2022 In the majority of participants at the eighth grade (33 out of 49), boys outperformed girls in science, often by a substantial margin. This was attributable mainly to higher performance by boys in\n\n1 Trend data for Latvia are annotated LSS because they include Latvian-speaking schools only.\n\n4\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fphysics and earth science, although girls had, on average, higher achievement in life science. In eleven countries, including Egypt, Iran, Chinese Taipei, Botswana, South Africa, Lebanon, Singapore, Estonia, Cyprus, the Philippines, and New Zealand, the gender difference was not signi\ufb01cant. In a further seven countries \u2013 Macedonia, Moldova, Armenia, the Palestinian National Authority, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Bahrain \u2013 the gender difference favored girls.\n\u2022 The trend results at the eighth grade show that girls had greater improvement, on average, since 1999 than boys. Fifteen participants showed signi\ufb01cant improvements for girls, and just eight for boys. Both girls and boys improved over previous assessments in nine countries and Ontario province. Re\ufb02ecting declines in achievement across assessments, both genders had lower achievement in TIMSS 2003 in seven countries. In Indonesia, Macedonia, and the Russian Federation, the boys but not the girls had a signi\ufb01cant decrease.\n\u2022 At the fourth grade, the average gender difference in science achievement was negligible, although girls had signi\ufb01cantly higher average achievement in Armenia, Moldova, the Philippines, and Iran, and boys had higher average achievement in the United States, Chinese Taipei, Cyprus, the Netherlands, and Scotland.\n\u2022 The fourth-grade trend results show that average science achievement improved for both boys and girls since 1995. Both boys and girls improved in eight countries and Ontario province; in England only girls improved; and in Japan, Norway, and Quebec, both boys and girls showed a decline. Boys but not girls showed a decline in the Netherlands and the United States.\nPerformance at the International Benchmarks in TIMSS 2003\nTIMSS identi\ufb01ed four benchmark levels to describe what students know and can do in science and demonstrate the range of performance internationally\u2013advanced, high, intermediate, and low. There were large\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n5\n\n\fEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\ndifferences across countries in the percentages of students reaching the various benchmarks.\nAt the eighth grade, students reaching the advanced benchmark demonstrated a grasp of some complex and abstract science concepts. At the other end of the performance continuum, those reaching the low benchmark recognized some basic facts from the life and physical sciences.\n\u2022 The highest performing countries \u2013Singapore and Chinese Taipei \u2013 had one-third to one-fourth of their students reaching the advanced benchmark. Next came Korea (17%), England and Japan (15%), Hungary (14%), Hong Kong SAR and Estonia (13% each), and the United States (11%.) All other countries had less than 10 percent of their students reaching the advanced benchmark, including 17 of the lowest-performing countries with one percent or less.\n\u2022 Fifteen countries, the US state of Indiana, and the two Canadian provinces had 95 percent or more of their students reaching the low benchmark whereas seven countries had less than half their students reaching the low benchmark.\nAt the fourth grade, students reaching the advanced benchmark could apply knowledge and understanding in beginning scientific inquiry. Those reaching the low benchmark demonstrated some elementary knowledge of the earth, life, and physical sciences.\n\u2022 With fewer and less variable countries at the fourth grade, Singapore had 25 percent of its students reaching the advanced benchmark. This was followed by England (15%), Chinese Taipei (14%), the United States (13%), Japan (12%), the Russian Federation (11%), and Hungary (10%.) Three of the lowest-performing countries had one percent or less of their students reaching the advanced benchmark.\n\u2022 Eight countries as well as the US state of Indiana and Ontario province had 95 percent or more of their students reaching the low\n\n6\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fbenchmark and all except \ufb01ve countries had at least three-fourths of their students reaching this level. In the Philippines, Tunisia, and Morocco, less than half the students reached the low benchmark.\nStudents\u2019 Home Context for Learning Science\n\u2022 At the eighth grade, students were asked about the level of their parents\u2019 schooling and their own expectations. Higher levels of parents\u2019 education were associated with higher student achievement in science in almost all countries. Also, students expecting to \ufb01nish university had substantially greater average science achievement than those without university expectations.\n\u2022 At both the eighth and fourth grades, in general, students from homes where the language of the test was always or almost always spoken had higher average science achievement than those who spoke it less frequently.\n\u2022 At both the eighth and fourth grades, across countries on average, there was a clear-cut relationship between number of books in the home and science achievement.\n\u2022 Science achievement was positively related to computer usage, particularly at eighth grade, with average achievement highest among students reporting using computers at home and at school. Next highest was achievement among students using computers at home but not school, followed by students using computers at school but not home, and then those using computers at other places or not using them at all. At both grades, the percentages of students reporting that they did not use a computer at all varied dramatically across countries \u2013 from one percent or less to as many as two-thirds at the eighth grade and three-fourths at the fourth grade.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n7\n\n\fEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Science Curriculum\n\u2022 Most countries had science curricula de\ufb01ned at the national level (except Australia and the United States) and often supported by ministry directives, instructional guides, school inspections, and recommended textbooks. In 23 countries, science was taught as a single general subject. In other countries, separate courses were offered in the different science subjects.\n\u2022 At both the eighth and fourth grades, most participants emphasized understanding science concepts and knowing basic science facts. Considerable emphasis also was placed on writing explanations about what was observed and why it happened. Less emphasis was placed on experimental work.\n\u2022 In relation to the TIMSS 2003 assessment at the eighth grade, on average, participants reported that a great deal of the science content was included in their curricula (71% of assessment topics intended for all or almost all students), with each of the \ufb01ve science content areas included in about equal proportions. About three-fourths of the physics and life science topics (75% and 73%, respectively) were included in their curricula, 70 percent of the chemistry topics, 69 percent of the environmental science topics, and 66 percent of the earth science topics.\n\u2022 At the fourth grade, on average, 56 percent of the science topics were included in the curriculum. In life science, 60 percent of the topics assessed were included in the participants\u2019 curricula, 57 percent of the physical science topics, and 50 percent of the earth science topics.\n\u2022 Although the relationship was not consistent across all countries, it appears that having at least moderate coverage of the science topics in the curriculum is a prerequisite for high performance, but that high coverage in the intended curriculum does not of itself necessarily lead to high student achievement.\n\n8\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\f\u2022 At the eighth grade, across countries on average, teachers reported that 70 percent of the students had been taught the life science and chemistry topics, 66 percent the physics topics, 61 percent the earth science topics, and 49 percent the environmental science topics.\n\u2022 At the fourth grade, across countries on average, teachers reported that 69 percent of the students had been taught the life science topics, 58 percent the earth science topics, and 56 percent the physical science topics.\nTeachers of Science\n\u2022 Science teachers reported considerable teaching experience. At the eighth and fourth grade, on average, students were taught by teachers with 15 and 16 years of experience, respectively.\n\u2022 On average, 79 percent of the eighth-grade students and 65 percent of the fourth-grade students were taught by teachers with at least a university degree.\n\u2022 Most eighth-grade students (82% on average) had science teachers with a science subject major (biology, physics, chemistry, or earth science) and more than one-third (37%) with a major in science education or both. Biology was the most popular science major, followed by chemistry, physics, and earth science. At the fourth grade, teachers typically studied primary or elementary education (80% of the students with such teachers, on average).\n\u2022 At both grades, schools reported that their professional development programs emphasized improving content knowledge and teaching skills. More than 80 percent of students were taught science by teachers having at least some professional development training in these areas.\n\u2022 Across the science content areas assessed, teachers reported being ready to teach nearly all the major topics tested by TIMSS. Almost\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n9\n\n\fEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nall of the eighth-grade students were taught by such teachers \u2013 90 percent or more for 16 out of 21 topics (all but three earth science and two environmental science topics). At the fourth grade, teachers reported being less well-prepared. In only 8 of the 19 topics were 90 percent or more of the fourth-grade students taught by teachers reporting readiness for teaching (2 of 6 life science topics, 2 of 7 physical science topics, and 4 of 6 earth science topics).\nClassroom Instruction\n\u2022 In general at the eighth grade, students in countries with separate science subjects had more instructional hours in the sciences. Annual hours of science instruction ranged from 284 hours in the Slovak Republic, where students take biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science simultaneously, to 69 hours in Italy, where science is taught as a single, integrated subject. There was less instructional time for science at the fourth grade, with annual hours ranging from 176 in the Philippines (the most by far) to 33 hours in the Russian Federation.\n\u2022 At the eighth grade, on average, teachers reported that 27 percent of the instructional time was devoted to life science, 24 percent to physics, 21 percent to chemistry, 13 percent to earth science, 9 percent to environmental science, and 5 percent to other. At fourth grade, with fewer content areas, the pro\ufb01le was different. Life science received 41 percent of the instructional time, earth science 28 percent, physical science 24 percent, and other 8 percent.\n\u2022 At the eighth grade, on average, students reported a moderate degree of emphasis on a range of activities related to science investigations. For example, in integrated-science countries, about two-thirds of students, on average, said that, in at least half of their lessons, they were asked to write explanations about what they had observed and why it happened (66%) or watch the teacher demonstrate an experiment\n\n10\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\for investigation (64%). At the fourth grade, most students reported that they watch the teacher do a science experiment, and write or give an explanation for something they are studying in science, once or twice a month or more (69% of students for each activity).\n\u2022 At both eighth and fourth grades, the textbook was often the foundation of science instruction. On average, more than half of students at both grades (56%) had teachers who reported using a textbook as the primary basis for their lessons, and many more as a supplementary resource (39% at eighth grade and 26% at fourth grade).\n\u2022 On average, the three most common instructional activities in science classes (totaling 57% of class time) were teacher lecture (24% of class time), teacher-guided student practice (19%), and students working on problems on their own (14%).\n\u2022 Although the curriculum contained statements about computer use in science in about half of the countries, access to computers remains a challenge in many countries. Teachers reported that, on average, internationally, computers were not available for 62 percent of the eighth-grade students and 54 percent of the fourth-grade students. Even in countries with high availability, using computers in science class was extremely rare at either grade.\n\u2022 At the eighth grade, on average, almost all students (88%) were taught by teachers who used only or mostly constructed-response tests (28%) or an equal mixture of constructed-response and multiple-choice tests (60%). Very few students (13%, on average) had teachers who used only multiple-choice tests, and these students had lower average achievement than did students whose teachers used only constructed-response tests or a combination.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n11\n\n\fEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSchool Contexts for Learning and Instruction\n\u2022 At the eighth grade, average science achievement was 51 points higher for students in schools with few students from economically disadvantaged homes than for students attending schools with more than half their students from disadvantaged homes. At fourth grade, the difference was 43 points.\n\u2022 At both eighth and fourth grades, there was a strong positive relationship between the principals\u2019 perception of school climate (based on seven questions about behaviors of teachers, parents, and students) and average science achievement. Asked the same seven questions, teachers had a somewhat more gloomy view of school climate than principals, but the relationship with achievement still was positive.\n\u2022 Teachers were asked about the safety of their schools\u2019 neighborhoods, how safe they felt in their schools, and the suf\ufb01ciency of security policies and practices. On average, 70 percent of eighth-grade students and 76 percent of fourth-grade students attended school characterized as safe by their teachers. At both grades, there was a positive relationship between school safety and science achievement.\n\n12\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n13\n\n\fINTRODUCTIOnNutdonIrtucnodintrcnioIotdurocntotunIitdonIrtiucnodinrcntioIotduocntortunIitdnIrtiuocnodnrcntoioItudocntortunIintdIrtiocnodunrcntoioItudocnItortunintdnIrtiocodunrcntoioItutdonIortucnintrdnIiocotdunrocntooItiutdonIrtucnointrdnIiocotdurocnntoItiutdonIrtucnodintrniocIotdurocnntouItitdonIrtucnodintrcnioIotdurocntotunIitdonIrtiucnodnrcntoioItduocntortunIitdnIrtiuocnodnrcntoioItudocntortunIintdIrtiocnodunrcntoioItudonItortunintdnIrtiocodunrcntoioItutdonIortucnintrdnIiocotdunrocntoItiutdonIrtucnointrdnIiocotdurocnntoItiutdonIrtucnodintrniocIotdurocntounItitdonIrtucnodintrcnioIotdurocntotunIitdonIrtiucn\n\n14\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\nIntroduction\nWhat is TIMSS? TIMSS 2003 is the most recent in a very ambitious series of international assessments conducted in nearly 50 countries to measure trends in mathematics and science learning. The aim of TIMSS, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, is to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics and science by providing data about students\u2019 achievement in relation to different types of curricula, instructional practices, and school environments. The variation across the nearly 50 participating countries provides a unique opportunity to study different approaches to educational practices and how these can improve achievement.\nTIMSS is a project of the International Association for the Evaluation of International Achievement (IEA), an independent international cooperative of national research institutions and government agencies that has been conducting studies of cross-national achievement since 1959. Conducted \ufb01rst in 1995 and then in 1999, the regular four-year cycle of TIMSS studies provides countries with an unprecedented opportunity to obtain comparative information about their students\u2019 achievement in mathematics and science.\nEven more important, TIMSS also collects a rich array of contextual information about how mathematics and science learning takes place in each country. TIMSS asks students, their teachers, and their school principals to complete questionnaires about the curriculum,\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n15\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\nschools, classrooms, and instruction. This data gives policy makers, curriculum specialists, and researchers a dynamic picture of implementation of educational policies and practices around the world, providing an invaluable perspective from which to consider educational reform and improvement. TIMSS results, which were \ufb01rst reported in 1996, have stirred debate and spurred reform efforts around the world.1\nTIMSS 1995 compared the mathematics and science achievement of students in 41 countries at \ufb01ve grade levels. TIMSS 1999 was designed to provide trends in eighth-grade mathematics and science achievement. Also, 1999 represented four years since the \ufb01rst TIMSS, and the population of students originally assessed as fourth-graders had advanced to the eighth grade. Thus, TIMSS 1999 also provided information about whether the relative performance of these students had changed in the intervening years. TIMSS 2003 was administered at the eighth and fourth grades. For countries that participated in previous assessments, TIMSS 2003 provides three-cycle trends at the eighth grade (1995, 1999, 2003) and data over two points in time at the fourth grade (1995 and 2003). In countries new to the study, the 2003 results can help policy makers and practitioners assess their comparative standing and gauge the rigor and effectiveness of the mathematics and science programs.\nWho Conducts TIMSS?\nTIMSS is a major undertaking of the IEA, and together with PIRLS, comprises the core of IEA\u2019s regular cycle of studies.2 The IEA delegated responsibility for the overall direction and management of the project to the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College. Headed by Michael O. Martin and Ina V.S. Mullis, the study center is located in the Lynch School of Education. In carrying out the project, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center works closely with the IEA Secretariat in Amsterdam, the IEA Data Processing Center in Hamburg, Statistics Canada in Ottawa, and Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey.\n1 Robitaille, D.F., Beaton, A.E., and Plomp, T., eds. (2000), The Impact of TIMSS on the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics and Science, Vancouver, BC: Paci\ufb01c Educational Press.\n2 PIRLS is the IEA\u2019s Progress in International Reading Literacy Study developed to assess students\u2019 reading achievement at fourth grade. Thirty\ufb01ve countries participated in PIRLS 2001, and nearly 50 countries are participating in PIRLS 2006.\n\n16\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fTo coordinate the TIMSS project nationally and to work with the international team, each participating country designates an individual to be the National Research Coordinator (NRC). The NRCs have the formidable task of implementing the TIMSS study in their countries in accordance with the TIMSS guidelines and procedures. The quality of the assessments depends on the work of the NRCs and their colleagues in carrying out the very complex sampling, data collection, and scoring tasks involved. Continuing the tradition of superlative work established in 1995 and 1999, the TIMSS 2003 NRCs performed their many tasks with great dedication, competence, and energy, and should be commended for their commitment to the project and the high quality of their work (see Appendix G for a list of the TIMSS 2003 NRCs).\nWhich Countries Participated in TIMSS 2003?\nExhibit 1 shows the 49 countries that participated in TIMSS 2003. The decision to participate in any IEA study is coordinated through the IEA secretariat in Amsterdam and made solely by each member country according to its own data needs and resources. Exhibit 1 shows that 23 countries also participated in TIMSS 1995 and TIMSS 1999. For these participants, trend data across three-points in time are included in this report. Eleven countries participated in TIMSS 2003 and TIMSS 1999 only, while three countries participated in TIMSS 2003 and TIMSS 1995. These countries have trend data for two points in time. TIMSS 2003 is proud to welcome 12 new participating countries to the study. TIMSS 2003 is equally proud of its \ufb02edgling benchmarking program, whereby regions or localities of countries can participate in the study to compare to international standards. TIMSS 2003 included four benchmarking participants (one US state, two Canadian provinces, and Spain\u2019s Basque Country) in addition to its 49 countries.\nAt the eighth grade, results are presented for 46 countries and 4 benchmarking participants. At the fourth grade, results are presented for 25 countries and three benchmarking participants.

Because the characteristics of their samples are not completely known, the results for Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen are presented in Appendix F.\nFor the sake of comparability across countries and across assessments, all testing was conducted at the end of the school year, except in Korea. As noted in the Exhibits in this report, Korea tested the same cohort of students as other countries, but later in 2003 at the beginning of the next school year. The seven countries on a Southern Hemisphere school schedule (Australia, Botswana, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa) tested in October through December of 2002, which was the end of the school year there. The remaining countries tested towards the end of the 2002-2003 school year, most often in April, May, or June of 2003.\nWhat Is the Comparability Across the Grades and Ages Tested?\nExhibit 2 contains information about the grade(s) tested in each country. Because TIMSS studies the effectiveness of curriculum and instruction on student learning, it is designed to assess mathematics and science achievement at the same point in schooling across countries. More speci\ufb01cally, TIMSS tries to assess students at two points \u2013 at the end of four years of formal schooling and at the end of eight years of formal schooling.\nExhibit 2 reveals that, with few exceptions, the grade(s) tested in each country represented the eighth year of formal schooling and the fourth year of formal schooling. Thus, solely for convenience, the report usually refers to the grade tested as the eighth or the fourth grade, respectively.\nAs can be seen from the \ufb01rst two columns in Exhibit 2, countries have different policies and practices about the age of entry to primary school. This information is extremely valuable and important in considering the achievement results, since differences in these policies can affect achievement through the grades. Everything else being equal,\n\n20\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fstudents who start their formal schooling at a younger age will be younger than their counterparts at the grades assessed and those who start their schooling at an older age will be older. Again, everything else being equal, students who are older may be considered more mature. In many countries, students must be 6 years old to start school and they do start school at that age. In several countries, students must be six, but they do not need to start school at that age and can wait. In this case, students or their parents may wait, most often for economic reasons, so that the older students may come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Also, in a number of countries children must be 7 years old. On the other hand, in several countries some or all of the students are younger than six when they start school, including Australia, Cyprus, England, Jordan, Scotland, and Tunisia.\nBesides the age of entry, policies on promotion and retention also can effect how old students are when they reach a particular grade. If students have been retained, they will be older when they are assessed. Most often, it is the lower achievers who are retained and consequently the older students have lower achievement. Consistent with most educational endeavors, the interaction between grade and age in school is complicated. As can be seen from Exhibit 2, the variation in policies and practices across the countries assessed resulted in a considerable range in the average age of the students assessed. At the eighth grade, for example, Scotland with an additional year of schooling because they start school at such a comparatively early age (4.5 to 5.5 years old), had the youngest students assessed \u2013 13.7 years old on average. At the other end of the spectrum, students in Ghana start school closer to age 7 and may be retained because of attendance problems; as a result they were the oldest students assessed at 15.5 years old. Despite this wide range, however, eighth grade students in most countries were between 14 and 15 years old. Similarly, fourth grade students averaged between 10 and 11 years old, even though those in Scotland were 9.7 years old and those in Latvia had an average age of 11.1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n21\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nINTRODUCTION\nExhibit 2: Information About the Students Tested in TIMSS 2003\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries Armenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish)\nBotswana\nBulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus\nEgypt\nEngland Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy\n\nPolicy on Age of Entry to\nPrimary School1\n\nPractice on Age of Entry to Primary\nSchool\n\nPolicy on Promotion / Retention\n\nCountry\u2019s Name for\nGrade Tested\n\nYears of Schooling2\n\nAverage Age\nat Time of Testing\n\nChildren must be 7 years old Children must be 5 or 6 years old, depending on state or territory\nChildren must be 6 years old\n\n6.5 to 7 Automatic\n\nGrade 8\n\n8\n\n14.9\n\n5 or 6 Automatic\n\nYear 8\n\n8 or 9\n\n13.9\n\nAutomatic in grade 1, students in\n\n6 grades 2-8 must demonstrate a\n\nSecond intermediate\n\n8\n\n14.1\n\ncertain amount of academic progress\n\nChildren begin school during the calendar year in which they become 6 years old\n\n6\n\nStudents must show progress, based on exam by teachers\n\nSecond grade of secondary education\n\n8\n\n14.1\n\nStudents can be retained if found to\n\nChildren must be 6 years old by June\n\n6 to 7\n\nbe extremely deficient, after consultation with parents and teachers;

The accuracy of the survey results depends on the quality of the sampling information available, and particularly on the quality of the samples. TIMSS developed procedures and guidelines to ensure that the national samples were of the highest quality possible. Standards were established and well documented for coverage of the target population and participation rates. For the most part, the national samples were drawn in accordance with the TIMSS standards, and achievement results can be compared with con\ufb01dence. Countries that deviated from the guidelines are specially noted in this report.\nWhat Was the Nature of the Science Test and Background Questionnaires?\nA particular challenge for TIMSS 2003 was updating the set of frameworks underlying the assessments. The publication entitled TIMSS Assessment Frameworks and Speci\ufb01cations 2003 serves as the basis of TIMSS 2003 and beyond.3 It describes in some detail the mathematics and science content to be assessed in mathematics and science. Content areas are elaborated with objectives speci\ufb01c to the eighth and fourth grades. In general, the science content areas are life science, chemistry, physics, earth science, and environmental science.\nDeveloping the TIMSS tests for 2003 was a cooperative venture involving all of the NRCs during the entire process. The TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center began the process with an item-writing workshop for NRCs and their colleagues. Through a series of efforts, countries then submitted items that were reviewed by science subjectmatter specialists. Participating countries \ufb01eld-tested the items with representative samples of students, and all of the potential new items were reviewed by the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee. The NRCs had several opportunities to review the items and scoring criteria. The resulting TIMSS 2003 science tests contained 189 items at the eighth grade and 152 items at the fourth grade.4\n\n3 Mullis, I.V.S., Martin, M.O., Smith, T.A., Garden, R.A., Gregory, K.D., Gonzalez, E.J., Chrostowski, S..J, and O\u2019Connor, K.M. (2003), TIMSS Assessment Frameworks and Speci\ufb01cations 2003 (2nd Edition), Chestnut Hill, MA: Boston College.\nThe TIMSS frameworks developed 1995 also were used for 1999. See, Robitaillle, D.F., McKnight, C.C., Schmidt, W.H., Britton, E.D., Raisen, S.A., and Nicol, C. (1993), TIMSS Monograph No. 1: Curriculum Frameworks for Mathematics and Science, Vancouver, BC: Paci\ufb01c Educational Press.\n4 For more detail, see Appendix A.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n27\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\n\nAt both fourth and eighth grades, about two-\ufb01fths of the questions were in the constructed-response format, requiring students to generate and write their answers. These questions, some of which required extended responses, were allotted almost half of the testing time. Chapter 2 of this report contains example items illustrating the range of science concepts and processes covered in the TIMSS 2003 tests. Appendix A contains more information about test development for TIMSS 2003.\nTo guide questionnaire development, the TIMSS frameworks document also describes the contextual factors associated with students\u2019 learning in mathematics and science. A special effort was made for TIMSS 2003 to reduce burden for students, teachers, and schools and to address emerging policy concerns. In particular, TIMSS worked to examine curricular goals; the educational resources and facilities provided; the teaching force and how it is educated, equipped, and supported; classroom activities and characteristics; home support and involvement; and the experiences and attitudes that students themselves bring to the educational enterprise.\nHow Do Country Characteristics Differ?\nInternational studies of student achievement provide valuable comparative information about student performance, instructional practice, and curriculum. It is important, however, to consider the results in light of country-wide demographic and economic factors. Some selected demographic characteristics of the TIMSS 2003 countries are presented in Exhibit 3. As can be seen, countries range widely in population size and in geographic area. Countries also vary widely on indicators of health, such as life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rate. The economic indicators, such as gross national income per capita, reveal there is great disparity in the economic resources available to countries. Finally, there are differences in enrollment rates and pupilteacher ratios. For the enrollment rates, \ufb01gures only were available for primary and secondary school and not speci\ufb01cally for fourth and\n\n28\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\feighth grades. For the fourth grade, it can be seen that the countries generally had 90 percent or more of their children enrolled in primary school. The \ufb01gures pertinent to the eighth grade in particular were not available, but they most certainly would be higher than those provided for the secondary school.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n29\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nINTRODUCTION\nExhibit 3: Selected Characteristics of TIMSS 2003 Countries\n\nCountries\nArgentina Armenia Australia 12 Bahrain 10 Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile 9 Chinese Taipei 12 Cyprus Egypt 11 England Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway 12 Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

It also shows trends in student performance at the eighth grade for those countries that also participated in TIMSS 1995 and 1999. At the fourth grade, trends are presented for those countries that participated in the 1995 assessment (no assessment was conducted at the fourth grade in 1999). Achievement differences by gender at both grades also are provided.\nHow Do Countries Differ in Science Achievement? The first page of Exhibit 1.1 presents the distribution of student achievement1 for the 46 countries and four benchmarking entities that participated at the eighth grade in TIMSS 2003 and the second page presents the distribution of student achievement for the 25 countries and three benchmarking entities that participated at the fourth grade.2 Countries are shown in decreasing order of average (mean) scale score, together with an indication of whether the country average is\n1 TIMSS used item response theory (IRT) methods to summarize the achievement results on a scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. Given the matrix-sampling approach, scaling averages students\u2019 responses in a way that accounts for differences in the dif\ufb01culty of different subsets of items. It allows students\u2019 performances to be summarized on a common metric even though individual students responded to different items in the science test. For more detailed information, see the \u201cIRT Scaling and Data Analysis\u201d section of Appendix A.\n2 Argentina was unable to complete the necessary steps on schedule for their data to appear in this report. Because the characteristics of their samples are not completely known, achievement results for Syria at the eighth grade and Yemen at the fourth grade are presented in Appendix F.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n33\n\n\fCHAPTER 1: INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN SCIENCE\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher or lower than the international average. The international average of 474 at the eighth grade was obtained by averaging across the mean scores for each of the 46 participating countries. The mean scores for the four benchmarking participants were not included in calculating the average.3 At the fourth grade, the international average of 489 was obtained by averaging across the mean scores for the 25 participating countries. It should be noted that the results for the eighth and fourth grades are not directly comparable. While the scales for the two grades are expressed in the same numerical units, they are not directly comparable in terms of being able to say how much achievement or learning at one grade equals how much achievement or learning at the other grade. Comparisons only can be made in terms of relative performance.4\nAt the eighth grade, with such a large number of participating countries, it is not surprising that the results reveal substantial differences in science achievement between the highest- and lowest-performing countries, from an average of 578 for Singapore to 244 for South Africa. Twenty-four countries (including England) and the four benchmarking participants had average science achievement that was signi\ufb01cantly above the international average and 18 countries had average achievement below the international average. Bulgaria, Jordan, Moldova, and Romania performed about the same as the international average. At the fourth grade, the range in achievement was from 565 in Singapore to 304 in Morocco. Sixteen countries and the three benchmarking participants performed above the international average. Moldova and Slovenia performed at about the international average. Seven countries had achievement below the international average.\nFor both the eighth and fourth grades, Exhibit 1.1 illustrates the broad range of achievement both within and across the countries assessed. It shows a graphical representation of the distribution of student performance within each country. Achievement for each country is shown for the 25th and 75th percentiles as well as for the 5th and 95th percentiles.5 Each percentile point indicates the percent-\n\n3 Even though England worked very hard to meet the TIMSS sampling requirements and adjustments were made to make the results representative, it did not meet the school participation rates as speci\ufb01ed in the guidelines and consequently its results are shown below a line.\n4 Since the TIMSS scales were developed using IRT technology, like all such scales, the eighth- and fourth-grade scales cannot be described in absolute terms.\n5 Tables of the percentile values and standard deviations for all countries are presented in Appendix D.\n\n34\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 1: INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN SCIENCE\nage of students performing below and above that point on the scale. For example, 25 percent of the eighth-grade students in each country performed below the 25th percentile for that country, and 75 percent performed above the 25th percentile. The range between the 25th and 75th percentiles represents performance by the middle half of the students. In most countries, the range of performance for the middle group was between 80 and 120 scale-score points. In contrast, performance at the 5th and 95th percentiles represents the extremes in both lower and higher achievement. The range of performance between these two score points, which includes 90 percent of the population, is more variable and is between 200 and 300 points in most countries. The dark boxes at the midpoints of the distributions show the 95 percent con\ufb01dence intervals around the average achievement in each country.6\nAs well as showing the wide spread of student achievement within each country, the percentiles also provide a perspective on the size of the differences among countries. Even though average performance generally differed very little between one country and the next higher- or lower-performing country, the range in performance across the participating countries was very large at both grades. For example, Singaporean students had the highest average achievement at both grades, with their average eighth-grade performance exceeding performance at the 95th percentile in the lower-performing countries such as Botswana, Ghana, and South Africa. Similarly at the fourth grade, average performance in Singapore exceeded performance at the 95th percentile in Tunisia and Morocco. This means that only the most pro\ufb01cient students in the lower-performing countries approached the level of achievement of Singaporean students of average pro\ufb01ciency.\nTo aid in interpretation, Exhibit 1.1 also includes the years of formal schooling and average age of the students in each country. Equivalence of chronological age does not necessarily mean that students have received the same number of years of formal schooling or studied the same curriculum. For example, as described in the introduction, countries have different policies about the age at which\n6 See the \u201cIRT Scaling and Data Analysis\u201d section of Appendix A for more details about calculating standard errors and con\ufb01dence intervals for the TIMSS statistics.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n35\n\n\fCHAPTER 1: INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN SCIENCE\nExhibit 1.1: Distribution of Science Achievement\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCountries\n\nYears of Average Schooling* Age\n\nSingapore Chinese Taipei \u00bf Korea, Rep. of \u2020 Hong Kong, SAR Estonia Japan Hungary \u2020 Netherlands \u2021 United States Australia Sweden Slovenia New Zealand 1 Lithuania Slovak Republic Belgium (Flemish) Russian Federation Latvia \u2020 Scotland Malaysia Norway Italy 2 Israel Bulgaria Jordan International Avg.

Most notably, students in Norway, most of Slovenia, and parts of the Russian Federation had fewer years of formal schooling than their counterparts in other countries, while those in England, Scotland, New Zealand, and parts of Australia had more years of schooling. Even though the students assessed at the eighth grade typically averaged between 14 and 15 years old, the variety of countries assessed and their situations also resulted in a considerable range in the average age of the students assessed. To illustrate how education policies can affect the interaction between age and number of years of schooling, it is interesting to note that Scotland, one of the few countries with an additional year of schooling, starts formal schooling at an early age and had the youngest students assessed \u2013 13.7 years old on average. Other countries assessing students younger than 14 years old included Slovenia, Norway, and Cyprus with 13.8 and Australia, Jordan, and Italy with 13.9. Students in the Balkans and some Eastern European countries start school later and tended to be older, particularly in Estonia with an average of 15.2. Students also were older in several African countries including Botswana and South Africa both averaging 15.1, Morocco averaging 15.2, and Ghana averaging 15.5. In these countries, it is not unusual for students to start school at an older age and also, perhaps, to \ufb01nd it necessary to interrupt their schooling.\nAt the fourth grade, the aim was to assess students having had four years of formal schooling and this was the case for the most part. However, some students in Slovenia and parts of the Russian Federation had only three years of formal schooling, and students in England and Scotland as well as some in Australia and New Zealand had \ufb01ve years. In terms of chronological age, students in most countries averaged between 10 and 11 years old. Consistent with the patterns at the eighth grade, students were somewhat younger in Scotland, averaging\n\n38\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 1: INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN SCIENCE\n9.7 years old; Italy, Slovenia, and Norway, averaging 9.8; and Australia, and Cyprus, averaging 9.9. The students in the Balkan and Eastern European countries were somewhat older, especially in Latvia with an average age of 11.1.\nAs a reminder that not all countries are equally well equipped to meet the challenge of educating their young people, Exhibit 1.1 includes the value for each country on the Human Development Index provided by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).7 The index has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum of 1.0. Countries with high values on the index enjoy long life expectancy, high levels of school enrollment and adult literacy, and a good standard of living as measured by per capita GDP. For example, TIMSS countries with index values greater than 0.9 included Australia, Belgium (Flemish), England, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, The Netherlands, Scotland, Sweden, and the United States. All have average eighthgrade science achievement above the international average. However, not all countries above the international average had an index value as high as this.\nExhibit 1.2 shows how a country\u2019s average achievement in science compares to achievement in the other countries. This \ufb01gure shows whether or not the differences in average achievement between pairs of countries are statistically signi\ufb01cant. Selecting a country of interest and reading across the table, a circle with a triangle pointing up indicates signi\ufb01cantly higher performance than the comparison country listed across the top; absence of a symbol indicates no signi\ufb01cant difference in performances; and a circle with triangle pointing down indicates signi\ufb01cantly lower performance.\nThe data in Exhibit 1.2 reinforce the point that, when ordered by average achievement, adjacent countries usually did not signi\ufb01cantly differ from each other, although the differences in achievement between the high-performing and low-performing countries were very large.

The Republic of Korea also performed very well, with mean science achievement higher than all of the other participating countries except Singapore, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong SAR. Hong Kong SAR, Estonia and Japan had signi\ufb01cantly higher achievement than most other participating countries, as did England, Hungary, and the Netherlands. Singapore was the top-performing country at the fourth grade, with higher average science achievement than all other participants. With the exception of Singapore, Chinese Taipei had higher average achievement than the rest of the participating countries. Japan, Hong Kong SAR, and England had signi\ufb01cantly higher average achievement than the other participating countries. The United States, Latvia, Hungary, and the Russian Federation also performed better, on average, than most of the other countries.\nHow Has Science Achievement Changed Since 1995 and 1999?\nExhibit 1.3 shows the countries that have comparable data from previous TIMSS assessments at the eighth and fourth grades. At the eighth grade, 35 countries and three of the benchmarking participants have data from one or both of the previous TIMSS assessments conducted in 1995 and 1999. Well over half of the countries and two of the benchmarking entities, the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, have participated in all three TIMSS assessments. Of these, 18 countries as well as Ontario and Quebec have trends in science achievement for their eighth-grade students across three points in time \u2013 1995, 1999, and 2003. For several three-time participants, not all the results are presented because they were not strictly comparable.

Also, the 1995 data are not shown for Israel, Italy, and South Africa since the characteristics of their samples were not completely known in that \ufb01rst assessment. Twelve countries and the U.S. state of Indiana can monitor changes in performance between 1999 and 2003, and \ufb01ve countries including Australia, Sweden, Slovenia, Scotland, and Norway, between 1995 and 2003. At the fourth grade, 15 of the TIMSS 2003 countries as well as Ontario and Quebec also participated in TIMSS 1995. Since TIMSS was not conducted at the fourth grade in 1999, these participants can track changes in student achievement over an eight-year period, between 1995 and 2003.\nFor the countries participating in assessments prior to TIMSS 2003, Exhibit 1.3 shows the results and the differences in average achievement between the years.8 Countries are presented in descending order according to their average achievement in TIMSS 2003. At the eighth grade, a number of participants had signi\ufb01cantly higher achievement in TIMSS 2003 than in previous assessments. Most notably, Korea, Hong Kong SAR, the United States, Lithuania, and Ontario have shown a pattern of improvement from assessment to assessment with signi\ufb01cant change over the eight-year period. Malaysia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, and the Philippines showed signi\ufb01cant improvement from 1999 to 2003. Australia and Slovenia did not participate in 1999, but showed improvement from 1995 to 2003. Latvia (LSS) and Quebec showed improvement from 1995 to 2003 but not from 1999. Countries showing a decrease at the eighth grade in TIMSS 2003, from 1995, 1999, or both, included Hungary, Sweden, the Slovak Republic, Belgium (Flemish), the Russian Federation, Norway, Bulgaria, Iran, Cyprus, Indonesia, and Tunisia.\nAt the fourth grade, many countries had signi\ufb01cant increases in average achievement between 1995 and 2003. Participants showing improved performance included Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, England, Hungary, Latvia (LSS), New Zealand, Slovenia, Cyprus, Iran, and\n8 TIMSS used IRT methods to place the TIMSS 2003 results on the same scales that were developed for 1995 and also used for 1999 at the eighth grade. See Appendix A for more detailed information.\n\n48\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 1: INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN SCIENCE\nOntario. Several participants showed signi\ufb01cant declines, including Japan, Scotland, Norway, and Quebec.\nA number of countries showed remarkable changes in science achievement over the eight-year period covered by the TIMSS assessments, some of which may be the result of societal or educational changes during this time. For example, the political changes in Eastern Europe more than a decade ago spawned far-reaching educational reform initiatives that have changed the face of education in many countries in the region. The achievement growth in Latvia and Lithuania as well as the strong performance of Estonia in its \ufb01rst TIMSS appearance may re\ufb02ect the efforts at improvement in those countries. In contrast, countries in the region where reform efforts seem to have been less successful include Bulgaria, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, each of which show decreases over the period.\nWhat Are the Gender Differences in Science Achievement?\nExhibit 1.4 shows gender differences in eighth- and fourth-grade mathematics achievement in 2003. It presents average achievement separately for girls and boys for each of the TIMSS 2003 countries, as well as the difference between the means. Countries are shown in increasing order of this gender difference. The gender difference for each country is shown by a bar indicating the amount of the difference, whether the direction of the difference favored girls or boys, and whether the difference is statistically signi\ufb01cant (indicated by a darkened bar).\nOn average, across all countries, boys outperformed girls at the eighth grade by six scale-score points (477 vs. 471), although the situation varied considerably from country to country. In eleven countries, including Egypt, Iran, Chinese Taipei, Botswana, South Africa, Lebanon, Singapore, Estonia, Cyprus, the Philippines, and New Zealand, the gender difference was not signi\ufb01cant. Countries where the gender difference favored girls included Macedonia, Moldova, Armenia, the Palestinian National Authority, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Bahrain.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n49\n\n\fCHAPTER 1: INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN SCIENCE\nHowever, in the majority of participants (33), boys outperformed girls, often by a substantial margin. For example, countries where the gender difference was 20 points or more included Israel, Australia, Belgium (Flemish), Tunisia, Hungary, Chile, and Ghana. At the fourth grade, the average difference internationally was negligible. However, girls had signi\ufb01cantly higher average achievement in Armenia, Moldova, the Philippines, and Iran. Boys had higher average achievement in the United States, Chinese Taipei, Cyprus, the Netherlands, and Scotland.\nAchievement differences between TIMSS 2003 and 1995 and 1999 are presented separately for girls and for boys in Exhibit 1.5. At the eighth grade, girls showed a seven-point improvement, on average, since 1999, however, boys showed no improvement. Fifteen participants showed signi\ufb01cant improvement for girls, and just eight for boys. Both boys and girls had signi\ufb01cantly higher achievement in 2003 than in previous assessments in Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Jordan, Latvia (LSS), Lithuania, Malaysia, the Philippines, the United States, and Ontario. Girls but not boys showed improved performance compared to 1999 in Iran, Korea, Moldova, Singapore, and England. Only in Australia and Quebec did boys show improvement and girls not. Both boys and girls had signi\ufb01cantly lower average achievement in TIMSS 2003 in Belgium (Flemish), Bulgaria, Cyprus, Norway, the Slovak Republic, Sweden, and Tunisia. In Indonesia, Macedonia, and the Russian Federation, the boys, but not the girls, had a signi\ufb01cant decrease.\nAt the fourth grade, both boys and girls improved performance signi\ufb01cantly on average since 1995 (17 points for girls and 9 points for boys). Both genders improved in Cyprus, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary, Iran, Latvia (LSS), New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, and Ontario. In England, only girls improved. Both boys and girls showed declines in Japan, Norway, and Quebec. Boys but not girls showed declines in the Netherlands and the United States.\n\n50\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 1: INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN SCIENCE\nExhibit 1.4: Average Science Achievement by Gender\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCountries\nEgypt Iran, Islamic Rep. of Chinese Taipei Botswana South Africa Lebanon Singapore Estonia Cyprus 1 Lithuania 1 Serbia International Avg.

The TIMSS science achievement scale summarizes student performance on test items designed to measure a wide range of student knowledge and pro\ufb01ciency. In order to provide meaningful descriptions of what performance on the scale could mean in terms of the science that students know and can do, TIMSS identi\ufb01ed four points on the scale for use as international benchmarks. Selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally, the advanced benchmark is 625, the high benchmark is 550, the intermediate benchmark is 475, and the low benchmark is 400. TIMSS worked with the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee to conduct an ambitious scale-anchoring exercise to describe performance at these benchmarks.\nExhibit 2.1 summarizes what eighth- and fourth-grade students scoring at these benchmarks typically know and can do. At the eighth grade, performance ranged from demonstrating a grasp of some complex and abstract science concepts at the advanced benchmark to\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n57\n\n\fCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nrecognizing some facts from the life and physical sciences at the low benchmark. At the fourth grade, students at the advanced benchmark can apply knowledge and understanding in beginning scienti\ufb01c inquiry whereas those at the low benchmark demonstrated just some elementary knowledge of the earth, life, and physical sciences. More detailed descriptions appear in the remaining sections of the chapter, together with example test items illustrating performance at each benchmark.\nExhibit 2.2 displays the percentage of students in each participating country that reached each international benchmark. Both the eighth- and fourth-grade results are presented in decreasing order by percentage reaching the advanced benchmark. In general, the highperforming countries had greater percentages of students reaching each benchmark, and the low-performing countries had lower percentages. Among the high performers at the eighth grade, for example, Singapore and Chinese Taipei had one-fourth or more of their students reaching the advanced benchmark, about two-thirds reaching the high benchmark, around 85 percent or more reaching the intermediate benchmark, and almost all (95 percent or more) reaching the low benchmark. In contrast, low-performing countries had almost no students reaching the advanced benchmark, no more than 8 percent reaching the high benchmark, about one-third reaching the intermediate benchmark, and about two-thirds reaching the low benchmark. At the fourth grade, 25 percent of the Singaporean students performed at or above the advanced benchmark, followed by about 15 percent of the students from England and Chinese Taipei. In all three of these top-performing countries, nearly all fourth-grade students, from 94 to 98 percent, reached the low benchmark. For the lowest-performing countries, Tunisia and Morocco, very few, if any, fourth-grade students reached the advanced benchmark, 1 or 2 percent reached the high benchmark, 9 to 10 percent the intermediate benchmark, and 24 to 27 percent the low benchmark.\nAlthough Exhibit 2.2 is organized to draw particular attention to the percentage of high-achieving students in each country, it\n\n58\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nconveys information about the distribution of middle and low performers also. For example, even though the Netherlands does not have the highest percentages at the advanced benchmark (6 percent at eighth grade and 3 percent at fourth grade), it appears to do an excellent job of educating all of its students, since 98 percent of the eighth-grade students and 99 percent of the fourth-grade students reached the low benchmarks at their respective grades. It should be noted that at the eighth grade, 13 countries as well as three of the benchmarking participants have less than 10 percent of their eighthgrade students reaching the advanced benchmark but have 90 percent or more reaching the low benchmark.\nExhibits 2.3 and 2.4, for the eighth and fourth grades, respectively, provide information on the changes in student performance between the previous assessments and TIMSS 2003. The exhibits show the percentage of students reaching each international benchmark (advanced-625, high-550, intermediate-475, and low-400) in each of the years. In general, the patterns in overall achievement are re\ufb02ected in the benchmarks. For example, at the eighth grade the decrease in performance in the Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Belgium (Flemish), and Cyprus is also apparent at all four benchmarks, implying a decrease at most levels of the pro\ufb01ciency distribution. In the Russian Federation, however, the decrease is re\ufb02ected at the three top benchmarks but not at the low benchmark. Although Hong Kong SAR and Lithuania had an increase in performance over earlier assessments at all four benchmarks, and participants such as Korea, Latvia, Jordan, and Ontario had increases at all but the advanced benchmarks, for many countries increased performance was re\ufb02ected at the intermediate and low international benchmarks. The United States, Australia, New Zealand, Scotland, Slovenia, Israel, Malaysia, Moldova, England, and Quebec all showed improved performance in the lower half of the pro\ufb01ciency distribution.\nAt the fourth grade, the general improvements between 1995 and 2003 also are re\ufb02ected generally at the benchmarks. Singapore,\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n59\n\n\fCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nHungary, Iran, and Ontario showed improvement at all four international benchmarks, while England, Latvia (LSS), Hong Kong SAR, Slovenia, and Cyprus improved at all but the advanced benchmark. Japan and Norway had a decrease in performance at all four benchmarks, while Quebec showed declines at all but the low international benchmark. The United States, Scotland, and the Netherlands had decreased performance at the advanced and high international benchmarks but not at the two lower ones, and Australia had a decrease at the advanced benchmark only.\nTo help interpret the achievement results, the remaining sections of the chapter \ufb01rst describe eighth-grade science achievement at each of the international benchmarks together with examples of the types of items typically answered correctly by students performing at the benchmark and then describes fourth-grade achievement at each of the international benchmarks together with examples of the types of items typically answered correctly by students performing at the benchmark.\nAt both the eighth and fourth grades, the analysis of performance at these benchmarks in science suggests that \ufb01ve primary factors appeared to differentiate performance among the four levels:\n\u2022 The depth and breadth of content knowledge;\n\u2022 The context of the problem (progressing from practical to more abstract);\n\u2022 The level of scienti\ufb01c investigation skills;\n\u2022 The complexity of diagrams, graphs, and tables;\n\u2022 The completeness of written responses.\nAt both grade levels, student performance at the lower benchmarks is characterized by elementary knowledge of basic science facts, whereas at the advanced benchmarks students can, in addition, draw on more abstract conceptual knowledge and engage in scienti\ufb01c inquiry.\n\n60\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nHow Were the Benchmark Descriptions Developed?\nTo develop descriptions of achievement at the TIMSS 2003 international benchmarks, the TIMSS International Study Center used the scale anchoring method. Scale anchoring is a way of describing students\u2019 performance at different points on the TIMSS 2003 achievement scales at eighth and fourth grades in terms of the types of items students at those grades, respectively, answered correctly. It involves an empirical component in which items that discriminate between successive points on the scale are identi\ufb01ed, and a judgmental component in which subject matter experts examine the content of the items and generalize to students\u2019 knowledge and understandings.\nFor the scale anchoring analysis, the results of students from all the TIMSS 2003 countries were pooled, so that the benchmark descriptions refer to all students achieving at that level. (That is, it does not matter which country the students are from, only how they performed on the test.) Criteria were applied to the TIMSS 2003 achievement scale results at the eighth grade to identify the sets of items that eighth-grade students reaching each international benchmark were likely to answer correctly and that those at the next lower benchmark were unlikely to answer correctly.1 Similarly, criteria were applied to the TIMSS 2003 achievement scale results at the fourth grade to identify the sets of items that fourth-grade students reaching each international benchmark were likely to answer correctly and that those at the next lower benchmark were unlikely to answer correctly.\nThe sets of items produced by the analysis represented the accomplishments of students reaching each successively higher benchmark, and were used by a panel of subject-matter experts from the TIMSS countries to develop the benchmark descriptions.2 The work of the panel involved developing a short description for each item of the mathematical understandings demonstrated by students answering it correctly, summarizing students\u2019 knowledge and understanding across the set of items for each benchmark to provide more general statements of achievement, and selecting example items illustrating the descriptions.\n1 For example, for the advanced benchmark, an item was included if at least 65 percent of students scoring at the scale point corresponding to this benchmark answered the item correctly and less than 50 percent of students scoring at the high benchmark answered it correctly. Similarly, for the high benchmark, an item was included if at least 65 percent of students scoring at that point answered the item correctly and less than 50 percent of students at the intermediate benchmark answered it correctly.\n2 The participants in the scale anchoring process are listed in Appendix G.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n61\n\n\fCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nHow Should the Descriptions Be Interpreted?\nIn general, the parts of the descriptions that relate to the scienti\ufb01c concepts or procedures are relatively straightforward. It needs to be acknowledged, however, that the cognitive behavior necessary to answer some items correctly may vary according to students\u2019 experience. An item may require only simple recall for a student familiar with the item\u2019s content and context, but necessitate problem-solving strategies from a student unfamiliar with the material. Nevertheless, the descriptions are based on what the panel believed to be the way the great majority of eighth- or fourth-grade students could be expected to perform when responding to the item.\nIt also needs to be emphasized that the descriptions of achievement characteristic of students at the international benchmarks are based solely on student performance on the TIMSS 2003 items. Since those items were developed in particular to sample the science domains prescribed for this study, neither the set of items nor the descriptions based on them purport to be comprehensive. There are undoubtedly other science curriculum elements on which students at the various benchmarks would have been successful if they had been included in the assessment.\nPlease note that at both grades students reaching a particular benchmark demonstrated the knowledge and understandings characterizing that benchmark as well as the competencies of students at the lower benchmarks. The description of achievement at each higher benchmark is cumulative, building on the description of achievement demonstrated by students at the next lower benchmark.\nFinally, it must be emphasized that the descriptions of the international benchmarks are provided as one possible way of beginning to examine student performance. Some students scoring below a benchmark may indeed know or understand some of the concepts that characterize a higher level. Thus, it is important to consider performance on the individual items and clusters of items in developing a pro\ufb01le of student achievement in each country.\n\n62\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nSeveral example items are included for each benchmark to complement the descriptions by giving a more concrete notion of the abilities students were able to demonstrate. Each example item is accompanied by the percentage of correct responses for each country as well as the international average. In general, at each grade, the \ufb01ve or six countries scoring highest on the overall test also scored highest on each of the items used to illustrate benchmarks. Likewise, the \ufb01ve or six countries with the lowest mean achievement also tended to have consistently low percentages of correct responses on the illustrative items. Not surprisingly, this was true for items assessing a range of cognitive skills \u2013 recall of information, using conceptual knowledge, and applying reasoning and analytic skills. The TIMSS 2003 results support the premise that successful problem solving and inquiry is grounded in mastery of more fundamental knowledge and skills.\nItem Examples and Student Performance\nBeginning with the eighth grade and then for the fourth grade, the remainder of this chapter describes each benchmark and presents two example items illustrating what students know and can do at that level. For each example item, the percent correct for each of the TIMSS 2003 countries is displayed, as well as the international average. The correct answer is circled for multiple-choice items. For open-ended items, the answers shown exemplify the types of student responses that were given full credit. The example items are ones that students reaching each benchmark were likely to answer correctly, and they represent the types of items used to develop the description of achievement at that benchmark.3\n\n3 Some of the items used to develop the benchmark descriptions are being kept secure to measure achievement trends in future TIMSS assessments and are not available for publication.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n63\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nExhibit 2.1: TIMSS 2003 International Benchmarks of Science Achievement\nAdvanced International Benchmark \u2013 625\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nStudents demonstrate a grasp of some complex and abstract science concepts.

Eighth-grade students reaching this benchmark demonstrated a grasp of some complex and abstract science concepts and could apply knowledge of earth, life, physical, and environmental science. They understand some fundamentals of scienti\ufb01c investigation and could apply basic physical principles to solve quantitative problems. They also could provide written explanations to communicate scienti\ufb01c knowledge. They typically demonstrated success on the knowledge and skills represented by this benchmark, as well as those demonstrated at the high, intermediate, and low benchmarks.\nExample Item 1 in Exhibit 2.6 illustrates the type of physics question an eighth-grade student performing at the advanced benchmark generally answered correctly. Students were shown a diagram depicting a ray of sunlight entering a glass prism and a screen on the other side, and were asked to describe what would be seen on the screen, drawing on the diagram if necessary. To receive full credit, students had to explicitly indicate that different colors are seen on the screen, either through a written explanation or by drawing on the diagram. Partial credit was awarded to students who mentioned refraction or bending of the light beam but made no reference to color. This question was dif\ufb01cult for most students, with on average just 23 percent receiving full credit for their responses. However, more than half the students in Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Ontario gained full credit.\nStudents reaching the advanced benchmark typically could interpret information in diagrams, maps, graphs, and tables to solve problems or draw conclusions. Illustrating this, Example Item 2 from earth science shown in Exhibit 2.7 provides students with information in tabular form about the planets Venus and Mercury \u2013 surface temperature, atmospheric composition, distance from the Sun, and time to revolve around the Sun. To answer this item correctly, students had to recognize that the best explanation for the higher surface temperature\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n71\n\n\fCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\non Venus was that the high proportion of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect. This item was answered correctly by 36 percent of students on average, with more than half of the students in Korea, Hong Kong SAR, Chinese Taipei, and Singapore choosing the correct answer.\n\n72\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nExhibit 2.5: Description of TIMSS 2003 Advanced International Benchmark (625) of Science Achievement\nAdvanced International Benchmark \u2013 625\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nSummary\nStudents demonstrate a grasp of some complex and abstract science concepts. They can apply knowledge of the solar system and of Earth features, processes, and conditions, and apply understanding of the complexity of living organisms and how they relate to their environment. They show understanding of electricity, thermal expansion, and sound, as well as the structure of matter and physical and chemical properties and changes. They show understanding of environmental and resource issues. Students understand some fundamentals of scientific investigation and can apply basic physical principles to solve some quantitative problems. They can provide written explanations to communicate scientific knowledge.\n\nStudents can apply knowledge of the solar system and of Earth features, processes, and conditions. They relate the changing seasons to the tilt in Earth\u2019s axis as it orbits the Sun and the phases of the Moon to its motion around Earth. They recognize the gravitational pull of the moon as the major cause of tides. They recognize that surface temperature of a planet is amplified by atmospheric composition and can relate latitude to average yearly temperature. Students identify a physical process that causes weathering of rocks and, from a list of rock types, identify limestone as the type involved in the formation of underground caves. Students recognize the low percentage of water on Earth that is fresh.\nStudents show understanding of the complexity of living organisms and how they relate to their environment. They recognize the hierarchy of organization in living organisms, and can state one structure that is found in plant but not animal cells. They state two factors in addition to chlorophyll that are needed for photosynthesis, can explain that photosynthesis takes place when light is shone on a plant, and recognize that the gas given off is oxygen. They can justify their choice of plants or animals as the likely first inhabitants of an island, and state one effect of introducing a new predator. They recognize that producers use energy from the sun to make food chemical elements and that recycle back into the environment when animals and plants die. Students also know some animal adaptations needed for survival including physical and behavioral characteristics. In addition, they can list some conditions that are found at the bottom of oceans that make it difficult for most organisms to live there, and recognize that fossils found in sedimentary rock are formed from organisms that lived in the sea. In the area of human health, students recognize that leafy vegetables are a good source of minerals and that vaccines provide the body with long-term immunity.\nStudents show understanding of physics principles and phenomena, including electricity, thermal expansion, and sound. They interpret a circuit diagram and recognizes that the current flows through two bulbs is the same and recognize that an iron nail becomes magnetized when current flows through a wire coiled around the nail. They recognize that mass is conserved during thermal expansion and that railway tracks have gaps to allow for thermal expansion. They recognize that the motion and arrangement of particles of a liquid are slower and closer together than those of gas particles. Students also recognize that force of gravity acts on a person regardless of position and movement. They can describe what is seen when sunlight passes through a glass prism. They recognize that plucking a guitar string harder affects the volume rather than the pitch of sound produced, and they can predict the effect of removing air on the propagation of sound.\nStudents demonstrate an understanding of the structure of matter as well as of physical and chemical properties and changes. They recognize that the nucleus of most atoms is composed of protons and neutrons, that an ion is formed when a neutral atom gains an electron, and that the diagram that best represents the structure of water molecules. They identify which of oxygen, hydrogen, and water are elements and distinguish between mixtures and a pure substance (sugar). Students recognize that sugar molecules continue to exist when sugar is dissolved in water. They recognize that water should be added to a saline solution to make it half as concentrated, and determine the amount of water necessary. Based on an incomplete table comparing pure water and salt water, students can explain that the addition of salt to water produces a solution of greater density. They can distinguish between chemical and physical changes, identify oxygen as the gas that causes rust formation, and recognize that both burning coal and exploding fireworks release energy. Students explain why litmus paper does not change color in a mixture of the right proportions of an acid and a base. Students can identify a property of metals and describe how this property may be used to determine whether a substance is a metal or nonmetal. They recognize that electrical conductivity has been used to classify materials into two groups. Students can calculate the density of a metal in a block given the block's mass and length of its sides. They can compare the previously computed density of a metal block to the densities of different metals presented in a table, infer what metal the block is made of, and explain their answers.\nStudents show understanding of environmental and resource issues. They can state one renewable energy source and describe one way it can be used, and recognize coal as a non-renewable resource. Students recognize that increased algal growth in a lake is likely due to fertilizer runoff, can explain how acid rain is formed from the burning of fossil fuels, and can describe how science and technology may be used to address oil spills in the oceans. Based on demographic and other information, students can predict population change and explain how this will affect land use and pollution. They can state one reason why the human population increased rapidly over the last 200 years.\nStudents demonstrate understanding of some fundamentals of scientific investigation. In an experimental situation, they recognize which variables to control, what questions can be addressed by an investigation, why scientists make repeated measurements and how an estimate may be improved by averaging repeated measurements. Given a set of equipment, they can design a procedure to measure the volume of an irregularly-shaped object. They apply basic physical principles to solve some quantitative problems and develop explanations involving abstract concepts. They can compare information from several sources, combine information to draw conclusions, and interpret information in diagrams, maps, graphs, and tables to solve problems. They can provide written explanations to communicate scientific knowledge.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n73\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nExhibit 2.6: TIMSS 2003 Advanced International Benchmark (625) of Science Achievement \u2013 Example Item 1\nAn ItemThat Students Reaching the Advanced International Benchmark Are Likely to Answer Correctly*\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nContent Area: Physics Description: Describes that a spectrum can be seen when sunlight passes through by a glass prism.\nThe answer shown illustrates the type of student response that was given full credit.\n\nCountry\n\u00bf Korea, Rep. of Singapore Malaysia\n\u2020 Hong Kong, SAR \u2021 United States \u2020 Netherlands\nNew Zealand Chinese Taipei Jordan Bahrain Armenia Palestinian Nat'l Auth. 1 Lithuania Iran, Islamic Rep. of \u2020 Scotland Sweden Egypt Hungary Italy International Avg.

Eighth-grade students performing at this level demonstrated conceptual understanding of some science cycles, systems, and principles. For example, they were able to interpret a four-step decision diagram showing how to separate a mixture of sand, salt, iron \ufb01lings, and small pieces of cork into its components, as depicted in Example Item 3 in Exhibit 2.9. To obtain full credit, students had to identify the component of the mixture extracted at each of the four steps. Partial credit was awarded to students identifying two or three components correctly. Internationally, 34 percent of the students, on average, achieved full credit. Countries where the majority of students were awarded full credit included Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Hong Kong SAR, Estonia, Korea, Hungary, the Slovak Republic, and province of Quebec.\nEighth-grade students reaching the high benchmark generally showed some understanding of ecosystems and food chains. In Example Item 4 in Exhibit 2.10, students were asked to predict what would happen to a community consisting of mice, snakes, and wheat plants if the snakes were all killed. To obtain full credit, students had to mention explicitly the effect on both the mouse population and the wheat plants. Partial credit was awarded to students who referred to one or other effect, but not both. The majority of students in Singapore, Malaysia, Chinese Taipei, Estonia, Australia, and Ontario achieved full credit, although internationally, just about one-third of the eighthgrade students did so.\n\n76\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nExhibit 2.8: Description of TIMSS 2003 High International Benchmark (550) of Science Achievement\nHigh International Benchmark \u2013 550\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nSummary\nStudents demonstrate conceptual understanding of some science cycles, systems, and principles.

(see Exhibit 2.17). Example Item 1 in Exhibit 2.18 is part of an extended problem solving and inquiry task in the earth science content area, in which students were provided with a plan of a house and garden and were required to answer a series of questions about planting a new garden. In the question shown in this example, students were given a plan of the house and garden showing the points of the compass, and asked to explain which side of the house would receive most sun in the morning. To be awarded credit, students had to choose the East side, and explain their answer in terms of the sun rising in the East. Internationally, on average, just 26 percent of the fourth-grade students answered this item correctly. The best performance was in Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong SAR, where more than half of the students answered correctly.\nIn physical science, fourth-grade students reaching the advanced level were able to use their knowledge of physical properties to identify common materials. In Example Item 2 (Exhibit 2.19), students were required to interpret tabular information about the physical properties of three materials to identify which of them were wood, rock, and iron. To obtain full credit, students had to identify all three. Students correctly identifying one or two of the materials were awarded partial credit. On average, internationally, 38 percent of students achieved full credit. Performance was highest in Singapore and Japan, where 74 and 69 percent, respectively, obtained full credit.\n\n88\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nExhibit 2.17: Description of TIMSS 2003 Advanced International Benchmark (625) of Science Achievement\nAdvanced International Benchmark \u2013 625\n\nTIMSS2003\n4 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nSummary\nStudents can apply knowledge and understanding in beginning scientific inquiry.

At this benchmark, fourth-grade students could apply basic knowledge and understanding to practical situations in the sciences. In physical science, students showed some understanding of familiar physical phenomena, states, and changes. For example, as illustrated by Example Item 5 in Exhibit 2.24, when presented with a diagram depicting four identical burning candles each covered by a glass container of different size, students recognized that the candle in the largest container will be the last to go out. Sixty-six percent of the fourth-grade students, on average, internationally, answered the question correctly. Eighty percent or more answered correctly in Cyprus, Singapore, the Netherlands, and Hong Kong SAR.\nIn life science, the fourth-grade students demonstrated knowledge of some basic facts related to human biology and health. For example, as shown in Example Item 6 in Exhibit 2.25, when shown a diagram depicting six different organisms (a human, a frog, a dog, a whale, a butter\ufb02y, and a bird) students could classify them according to how they produce their young - those that give birth and those that lay eggs. Students correctly classifying all six organisms achieved full credit on this item, while those misclassifying no more than two earned partial credit. On average, internationally, 58 percent of fourth-grade students received full credit, with highest performance in Singapore (84%), the United States (76%), New Zealand (74%), the Netherlands (73%), and Australia (72%).\n\n96\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nExhibit 2.23: Description of TIMSS 2003 Intermediate International Benchmark (475) of Science Achievement\nIntermediate International Benchmark \u2013 475\n\nTIMSS2003\n4 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nSummary\nStudents can apply basic knowledge and understanding to practical situations in the sciences.

For example, they recognize from pictorial diagrams the bird most likely to eat mammals, and the type of plants usually found in a tropical rain forest. They show some understanding of development and life cycles of organisms, including knowing that snakes shed their outer covering as they grow larger and classifying common organisms into those that give birth and those that lay eggs. From a list of common items, students can distinguish between living and non-living things. They can interpret from a food chain diagram that snakes eat voles and that tadpoles eat plants. They know that trees make their own food using sunlight, and can recognize from pictures of two types of seeds that they are scattered by the wind. They combine information from a plan of a garden and a diagram showing plants and their light requirements to explain why roses do not grow well under an oak tree.\nStudents show some understanding of familiar physical phenomena, states, and changes. They recognize that all objects have mass and that copper is a good heat conductor. They can state two uses of electricity in daily life. They recognize the state of a material from the shape it takes when transferred from a smaller to a larger container. Students can state one way that water in ice and liquid forms is used by humans. They recognize that salt water is a mixture, and can identify an object that is made of metal. They recognize that soap bubbles contain air. They can infer the color of a white shirt under a blue light. They recall that plant matter (apple core) will decay faster than other given substances. They can identify materials that burn, and from diagrams of candles in sealed containers, can identify the candle in the largest container as the last to go out.\nStudents apply factual knowledge to practical situations (e.g., recognize that excess food is stored as fat) and demonstrate some ability to interpret information in pictorial diagrams to reason to a conclusion (e.g., interpreting diagrams showing rocks of different shapes and sizes to identify the rock carried furthest down a river). They can also combine information from two sources to draw a conclusion (e.g., planning a garden).\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n97\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nExhibit 2.24: TIMSS 2003 Intermediate International Benchmark (475) of Science Achievement \u2013 Example Item 5\nAn Item That Students Reaching the Intermediate International Benchmark Are Likely to Answer Correctly*\n\nTIMSS2003\n4 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nContent Area: Physical Science\nDescription: Recognizes that a candle in the largest sealed container will be the last to go out.\n\nCountry\n\nPercent Full Credit\n\nCyprus Singapore \u2020 Netherlands \u2020 Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Latvia Belgium (Flemish) Chinese Taipei Italy Slovenia \u2020 United States 1 Lithuania \u2020 England Norway International Avg.

As an example from life science (Example Item 7 in Exhibit 2.27), students could identify insects from a diagram by the presence of six legs. This item was answered correctly by most students (81 percent on average, internationally) and by more than 90 percent in Lithuania, Singapore, Japan, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United States, and Norway.\nStudents reaching the low benchmark showed familiarity with everyday physical phenomena. For example, as shown in Example Item 8 in Exhibit 2.28, students recognized that the weight of an object is independent of its orientation on a weighing scale. Almost three-fourths (72%), on average, internationally, recognized that an object would weigh the same regardless of how it was placed on the scale. More than 80 percent of the fourth-grade students in Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Slovenia, Chinese Taipei, and Latvia answered this question correctly.\n\n100\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nExhibit 2.26: Description of TIMSS 2003 Low International Benchmark (400) of Science Achievement\nLow International Benchmark \u2013 400\n\nTIMSS2003\n4 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nSummary\nStudents have some elementary knowledge of the earth, life, and physical sciences. Students recognize simple facts presented in everyday language and context about Earth\u2019s physical features, the seasons, the solar system, human biology, and the development and characteristics of animals and plants. They recognize facts about a range of familiar physical phenomena \u2013 rainbows, magnets, electricity, boiling, floating, and dissolving. They interpret labeled pictures and simple pictorial diagrams and provide short written responses to questions requiring factual information.\nStudents know some elementary facts about Earth\u2019s physical features, seasons, and the solar system. They identify oxygen as the gas in the air needed for breathing, can explain why people should not drink water directly from the oceans, and recognize the hottest of Earth\u2019s layers. They know that the Sun is hotter than the Earth, the Moon, or Mars, that the Earth moves around the Sun, and can state the names of two seasons.\nIn life science, students demonstrate knowledge of some simple facts related to human biology. They recognize that air enters the lungs, that washing hands prevents illness by removing germs, which teeth are used for grinding, and that rice is edible and cotton is not. They also demonstrate some knowledge of animal development and structure. For example, they recognize that tadpoles hatch from frogs\u2019 eggs, that the larval form of a butterfly, that fat layers help keep animals warm, and that birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm. They recognize wings as being common to birds, bats, and butterflies, which foot structure belongs to a bird that lives on water, and can identify insects by the presence of six legs. Given lists of familiar animals, students can identify those that exhibit specified characteristics, such as eating only plants, eating only animals, and not laying eggs. From pictorial diagrams, students identify an animal that lives in the desert and the root as the plant part that takes in water. They can communicate an effect of environmental change (temperature) on aquatic life.\nStudents are familiar with some everyday physical phenomena, for example, sunlight and rain are required to produce rainbows, water changes into vapor during boiling, and sugar dissolves in water. From a diagram, they can identify the heaviest floating object, and recognize that the weight of an object does not depend on how it is placed on a scale. They recognize that magnets attract iron and that iron nails rust. In addition, students recognize that an iron nail can complete an electrical circuit to allow a bulb to light, and given diagrams showing a light bulb connected to a battery, recognize in which one the bulb will light.\nStudents interpret labeled pictures and simple diagrams (e.g., plant parts, stages of development of animals, simple electrical circuit) and provide short written responses to questions requiring factual information (e.g., an example of temperature change on aquatic life).\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n101\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\nExhibit 2.27: TIMSS 2003 Low International Benchmark (400) of Science Achievement \u2013 Example Item 7\nAn Item That Students Reaching the Low International Benchmark Are Likely to Answer Correctly*\n\nTIMSS2003\n4 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nContent Area: Life Science Description: Given a diagram, recognizes insects by presence of six legs.\n\nCountry\n\nPercent Full Credit\n\n1 Lithuania Singapore Japan Italy Russian Federation\n\u2020 United States Norway Chinese Taipei Belgium (Flemish)\n\u2020 Netherlands \u2020 Australia\nHungary \u2020 England\nCyprus New Zealand Moldova, Rep. of Latvia \u2020 Scotland International Avg. \u2020 Hong Kong, SAR Slovenia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Philippines Armenia Tunisia Morocco Benchmarking Participants Indiana State, US Ontario Province, Can.

Basic scienti\ufb01c inquiry skills were not demonstrated until the upper benchmarks, indicating that science curricula in many countries may not be placing much emphasis on scienti\ufb01c investigation at fourth or eighth grades.\nIn looking across the item-level results, it also is important to note the variation in performance across the topics covered. For example, on just the few items (16) presented in this chapter, there was a substantial range in performance for many countries. While some countries consistently registered high or low performance, and others had results consistently near the international average, a number of countries performed signi\ufb01cantly above the international average on at least one item, and signi\ufb01cantly below the international average on at least one item. Such results may re\ufb02ect intended differences in emphasis in national curricula. It is likely, however, that such results may be unintended, and the \ufb01ndings will provide important information about strengths and weaknesses in intended or implemented curricula. At the very least, an in-depth examination of the TIMSS 2003 results may reveal aspects of curricula that merit further investigation.\n\n104\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 2: PERFORMANCE AT INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n105\n\n\fCHAPTER 3: AVERAGE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SCIENCE CONTENT AREAS\n\n106\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 3: AVERAGE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SCIENCE CONTENT AREAS\nChapter 3\nAverage Achievement in the Science Content Areas\nChapter 3 presents results by the major content areas in science to provide information about the possible effects of curricular variation on average achievement. Average performance is provided for \ufb01ve content areas at the eighth grade: life science, chemistry, physics, earth science, and environmental science, and for three at the fourth grade: life science, physical science, and earth science. Relative achievement is shown among the content areas for each country and results are presented by gender. Trends from 1999 are shown for the eighth grade (insuf\ufb01cient items are available from 1995 to report trends within content areas).\nThe TIMSS 2003 science assessments at the eighth and fourth grades were designed to allow as fair comparisons as possible among participating countries. Considerable effort was devoted to updating the science framework newly published in the TIMSS Assessment Frameworks and Speci\ufb01cations 2003.1 IEA gratefully acknowledges the generous support of the US National Science Foundation in helping to fund this work, which took about two years, including a special international expert panel, iterative reviews by the NRCs, and a curriculum questionnaire completed by the countries.

Following on the framework development, also with additional funding from the US National Science Foundation, an enormous, collaborative test development effort involving the participating countries occurred at both grades to re\ufb02ect the framework and its new emphasis on problem solving and inquiry. Nevertheless, curriculum data collected as part of TIMSS2 indicate differences in the grade level at which particular topics are introduced and in the teaching emphases given some topics. In addition, within countries there can be variation among teachers in the relative emphasis given particular topics.\nThe TIMSS 2003 science tests were designed to enable reporting by \ufb01ve content areas in accordance with the TIMSS science framework. These areas, with their main topics, are:\nLife science 1. Types, characteristics, and classi\ufb01cation of living things 2. Structure, function, and life processes in organisms 3. Cells and their functions 4. Development and life cycles of organisms 5. Reproduction and heredity 6. Diversity, adaptation, and natural selection 7. Ecosystems 8. Human health. At grade 4, cells and their functions is not included.\nChemistry 1. Classi\ufb01cation and composition of matter 2. Particulate structure of matter 3. Properties and uses of water\n2 Chapter 5 contains information about the of\ufb01cial curriculum in each country as well as teachers\u2019 reports about the topics students have been taught. Appendix C provides an analysis of the match between the test and curriculum in different TIMSS 2003 countries and the effect of this match on the results.\n\n108\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 3: AVERAGE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SCIENCE CONTENT AREAS\n4. Acids and bases 5. Chemical change. At grade 4, chemistry is not reported separately, but combined with physics as physical science. At this grade level, the particulate structure of matter and acids and bases are not included.\nPhysics 1. Physical states and changes in matter 2. Energy types, sources, and conversions 3. Heat and temperature 4. Light 5. Sound and vibration 6. Electricity and magnetism 7. Forces and motion. At grade 4, physics is not reported separately, but combined with chemistry as physical science. At this grade level, sound and vibration is not included.\nEarth science 1. Earth\u2019s structure and physical features 2. Earth\u2019s processes, cycles, and history 3. Earth in the solar system and the universe.\nEnvironmental science 1. Changes in population 2.

Changes in environments.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n109\n\n\fCHAPTER 3: AVERAGE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SCIENCE CONTENT AREAS\nEnvironmental science is not assessed at grade 4. However, there were a few items in the fourth-grade assessment that addressed the use and conservation of natural resources and changes in environments. These were reported as part of life science.\nHow Does Achievement Differ Across Science Content Areas?\nExhibit 3.1 presents average achievement in each of the \ufb01ve science content areas at the eighth grade and in the three content areas at the fourth grade. Countries are displayed in alphabetical order, and symbols indicate whether a country\u2019s performance is statistically signi\ufb01cantly above or below the international average. To provide a basis of comparison for the performance of each country in each content area, the international average for each content area was scaled to be 474, the same as the overall international average.\nAt both grades, the countries scoring highest in the overall science assessment tended also to be the highest-scoring countries (though not always in the same rank order) in each of the major content areas. Correspondingly, countries scoring lowest on the overall test tended to have low average performance across all content areas.\nAt the eighth grade, the differences in average achievement between the highest- and lowest-performing countries were greatest for physics (340 scale-score points), next for life science (319), then earth science (311), chemistry (308), and environmental science (307). In contrast to the consistency in performance across content areas displayed by the higher- and lower-performing countries overall, performance varied substantially for some middle-performing countries. For example, Bulgaria performed signi\ufb01cantly above the international average in physics and earth science, below average in environmental science, and about the international average in life science and chemistry.\nAt the fourth grade with fewer and less variable countries, the differences in achievement within the content areas were smaller between the highest- and lowest-performing countries.

For the other two content areas, the differences were 268 for life science, and 248 for earth science.\nIn Appendix B, Exhibits B.1 through B.5 for the eighth grade and Exhibits B.6 through B.8 for the fourth grade compare average achievement among individual countries for each of the content areas, respectively. The exhibits show whether or not the differences in average achievement between pairs of countries are statistically signi\ufb01cant.\nIn Which Content Areas Are Countries Relatively Strong or Weak?\nTo highlight relative strengths and weaknesses within each country, Exhibit 3.2 pro\ufb01les the relative average achievement in science content areas within each country at the eighth and fourth grades. For each country, Exhibit 3.2 displays the difference between average performance in each content area and average performance overall. The pro\ufb01les reveal that at the eighth grade, many countries performed relatively better or worse in one or more content areas than they did overall. For example, it can be seen that Armenia performed relatively worse in environmental science than in the other four content areas. With just three content areas at the fourth grade, there also were fewer performance differences between the content areas. One example, however, is the Netherlands, which performed relatively better in life science than in physical science or earth science.\nDifferences in relative performance may be related to one or more factors, such as emphases in intended curricula or widely used textbooks, strengths or weaknesses in curriculum implementation, and the grade level at which topics are introduced. Differences in the match between the implemented curriculum and content measured by the test may also be a factor.\nThe profiles of relative performance reveal more variation across the content areas in some countries than in others. Average\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n113\n\n\fCHAPTER 3: AVERAGE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SCIENCE CONTENT AREAS\nachievement across content areas showed considerable variation in some countries. For example, at the eighth grade, variation of 60 or more scale-score points (one area at least 30 above and one 30 below) was found in Lebanon, the Philippines, and Indonesia. On the other hand, there were only a small number of scale points of difference between highest and lowest content area means in some countries at the eighth grade, with good examples being Latvia, Romania, Bahrain, and Cyprus. For the latter group of countries, the TIMSS 2003 data indicate a greater balance in science content covered through the grades. At the fourth grade, no countries had differences as large as 60 points, even though several had a particular strength or weakness. Generally, countries had comparable levels of performance across the three fourth-grade content areas.\n\n114\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON

Content Areas?\nExhibit 3.3 displays average achievement in science content areas by gender for the eighth and fourth grades. Perhaps not surprising in view of the gender differences favoring boys in overall science eighthgrade achievement described in chapter 1, boys outperformed girls on average in four of the \ufb01ve content areas at this grade level. The most striking results were the large number of signi\ufb01cant differences favoring boys in earth science and in physics.3 In earth science, boys had higher average achievement than the girls in 34 countries and all four benchmarking participants whereas the girls had higher achievement in only 2 countries. On average internationally, the boys had an advantage of 16 points. In physics, boys had higher average achievement than the girls in 30 countries and 4 benchmarking participants compared to the girls having higher achievement in only 4 countries. The overall difference was 12 points higher for boys, on average. In environmental science, with a 4-point advantage on average, boys performed signi\ufb01cantly higher in 20 countries and 2 benchmarking entities and girls in 7 countries. Although there was no difference in average performance in chemistry, boys performed better than girls in 12 countries and all 4 benchmarking participants whereas girls did better in just 8 countries. The most even gender balance was in life science, where girls outperformed boys by 3 points on average, and had higher average achievement in about the same number of countries \u2013 girls outperformed boys in 13 countries; boys outperformed girls in 12 countries. For each TIMSS assessment, examining item statistics to detect any gender bias is an important stage of item selection. It is therefore reasonable to assume that where signi\ufb01cant differences do occur, they result from differences in performance rather than problem situations favoring one gender or the other.\nAt the fourth grade, gender differences in science content areas were much less pronounced, and there was a more even balance between boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 achievement levels. In both life science and\n3 The results for TIMSS 2003 show many more signi\ufb01cant differences than TIMSS 1999 because a Bonferroni correction was applied in 1999 across countries leading to extremely conservative estimates given the large number of countries.\n\n120\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 3: AVERAGE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SCIENCE CONTENT AREAS\nphysical science, girls had signi\ufb01cantly higher achievement than boys (4 points in life science and 2 points in physical science). Girls performed better in life science than boys in 7 countries, whereas boys performed better in only one. In physical science, girls performed better than boys in six countries, and boys performed better in four countries. In earth science, however, the boy-girl difference was reversed, with boys having slightly higher average achievement overall (a 2-point difference). Boys performed better than girls in 9 countries, whereas girls performed better in 4 countries.\nIn some respects, the patterns in the performance of girls and boys found in TIMSS 2003 are consistent with previous IEA science assessments. Girls tended to perform about the same as boys in life science in both previous TIMSS assessments and the Second International Science Study (SISS),4 while boys were markedly stronger in earth science and physics in previous studies.\n\n4 Martin, M.O., Mullis, I.V.S., Gonzalez, E.J., Gregory, K.D., Smith, T.A., Chrostowki, S.J., Garden, R.A., and O\u2019Connor, K.M.

If achievement improved signi\ufb01cantly between assessments, the 1999 result is annotated with an up arrow or down arrow. This content-area trend analysis uses average percent correct rather than average scale score because there were insuf\ufb01cient items to reliably link the results for both assessments to the TIMSS scale in all of the \ufb01ve different content areas. The \ufb01rst column in the table shows overall trends in the average percentage correct metric. For the most part, signi\ufb01cant differences agree with those in the overall scale score (and the direction is always consistent).\nDuring the four years between 1999 and 2003, participants were generally consistent in either showing improvements or declines. Lithuania had statistically signi\ufb01cant improvements in all \ufb01ve content areas. Chile and Israel improved in four areas, and Ontario in three. Participants improving in two areas included Hong Kong SAR, Moldova, the Philippines, and the United States. On the other hand, Belgium (Flemish), Bulgaria, and Tunisia had statistically signi\ufb01cant decreases in all \ufb01ve content areas. In Cyprus, average achievement showed statistically signi\ufb01cant decreases in four content areas. Japan and the Slovak Republic showed signi\ufb01cant decreases in three content areas and an increase in one.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n125\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 3: AVERAGE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SCIENCE CONTENT AREAS\nExhibit 3.4: Trends in Average Percent Correct in Science Content Areas*\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nAustralia Belgium (Flemish) Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia (LSS) Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Netherlands New Zealand Philippines Romania Russian Federation Singapore Slovak Republic Slovenia South Africa Tunisia United States \u00b6 England International Avg.

However, as documented extensively by previous IEA studies of science achievement,1 student achievement also is related to home background factors, and to students\u2019 activities and attitudes. Since information on such factors is indispensable for interpreting the achievement results, this chapter provides detailed information about students\u2019 home backgrounds and resources for learning, how they spend their time out of school, their self-con\ufb01dence in learning science, and the value they place on science. Also provided is information on trends in attitudes to learning science across 1995, 1999, and 2003.\nWhat Educational Resources Do Students Have in Their Homes? IEA\u2019s ongoing assessments of student achievement in mathematics and science (TIMSS) and reading literacy (PIRLS) have shown that in almost every country, students from homes with extensive educational resources have higher achievement in science and other subjects than\n1 For results from TIMSS 1999, see Martin, M.O., Mullis, I.V.S., Gonzalez, E.J., Gregory, K.D., Smith, T.A., Chrostowski, S.J., Garden, R.A., and O\u2019Connor, K.M.

For the 2003 data presented in this report, TIMSS has focused on just a few central variables: level of parental education, students\u2019 educational aspirations, speaking the language of the test at home, having a range of study aids in the home and computer use at home, and at school.\nBecause for most children, parents are their \ufb01rst and probably most important educators, the level of education of the parents may be the most important educational resource in the home. Exhibit 4.1 summarizes eighth-grade students\u2019 reports of the highest level of education attained by their parents. Ordered alphabetically by country, this two-page display shows the percentages of students in each of \ufb01ve categories of parents\u2019 educational level, together with their average science achievement. Standard errors for percentages and averages also are shown. The education level of the parent with most education was used in assigning students to categories.\nAlthough response rates to questions in the TIMSS questionnaires generally were high, students in some countries had dif\ufb01culty in answering speci\ufb01c questions, particularly those about their parents\u2019 level of education. The exhibits in this chapter have special notations on this point. For a country where responses are available for at least 70 but less than 85 percent of the students, an \u201cr\u201d is included next to its data. Where responses are available for at least 50 but less than 70 percent of the students, an \u201cs\u201d is included. Where responses are available for less than 50 percent, an \u201cx\u201d replaces the data.\nExhibit 4.1 reveals great diversity in levels of parental education within and across the TIMSS countries. On average across countries, the percentages of eighth-grade students reporting that the highest level of education attained by either parent was as follows: \ufb01nished university \u2013 28%; \ufb01nished post-secondary education but not university \u2013 17%; \ufb01nished upper secondary \u2013 28%; \ufb01nished lower secondary \u2013 15%; and no more than primary (includes not attending school at all) \u2013 12%. Countries with the highest percentages (40% or more) of students reporting university-educated parents included Armenia, Estonia,\n\n130\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 4: STUDENTS\u2019 BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE\nIsrael, Japan, Latvia, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United States. Among benchmarking participants, Indiana and Ontario were included. In contrast, countries reporting the highest percentages (40% or more) of parents with no more than primary education included Botswana, Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia.\nThe different educational approaches, structures, and organizations across the TIMSS countries make comparisons of educational levels dif\ufb01cult, and this is exacerbated by high levels of \u2018do not know\u2019 and missing responses in some countries. Nonetheless, Exhibit 4.1 makes it clear that higher levels of parents\u2019 education are associated with higher eighth-grade student achievement in science in almost all countries. At 507 score points, the average science achievement of students with university-educated parents was more than 90 points greater than the average of students whose parents had no more than primary education.\nAs shown in Exhibit 4.2, students generally had high expectations for university education, particularly those who had a parent with a university education. More than half the eighth-grade students (54% on average across countries) reported that they expect to \ufb01nish university, 30 percent do not expect to complete a university education, and a further 15 percent do not know. Students expecting to \ufb01nish university had substantially greater average science achievement than those without university expectations. Among those expecting to \ufb01nish university, the average achievement of those students with a parent who \ufb01nished university (21% of students) was 30 points greater than those without a university-educated parent (33%).\nAlthough speaking more than one language has advantages, TIMSS 1999 showed that, with some exceptions, countries with large proportions of students from homes where the language of the test (and consequently the language of instruction) is not often spoken had lower average science achievement at eighth grade than those who spoke it more often. Exhibit 4.3, which presents students\u2019 reports of how frequently they spoke the language of the TIMSS test\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n131\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 4: STUDENTS\u2019 BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE\nExhibit 4.1: Highest Level of Education of Either Parent*\n\nCountries\n\nArmenia\n\nAustralia\n\nr\n\nBahrain\n\nBelgium (Flemish)\n\ns\n\nBotswana\n\nBulgaria\n\nChile\n\nChinese Taipei\n\nCyprus\n\nEgypt\n\nEstonia\n\nGhana\n\nHong Kong, SAR\n\nHungary\n\nr\n\nIndonesia\n\nIran, Islamic Rep. of\n\nIsrael\n\nr\n\nItaly\n\nJapan\n\nr\n\nJordan\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nLatvia\n\nr\n\nLebanon\n\nLithuania\n\nr\n\nMacedonia, Rep. of\n\nMalaysia\n\nMoldova, Rep. of\n\nMorocco\n\nr\n\nNetherlands\n\nr\n\nNew Zealand\n\ns\n\nNorway\n\ns\n\nPalestinian Nat'l Auth.\n\nPhilippines\n\nRomania\n\nRussian Federation\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nScotland\n\nSerbia\n\nSingapore\n\nr\n\nSlovak Republic\n\nr\n\nSlovenia\n\nr\n\nSouth Africa\n\nr\n\nSweden\n\ns\n\nTunisia\n\nUnited States\n\nr\n\n\u00b6 England\n\nInternational Avg.\n\nBenchmarking Participants\n\nBasque Country, Spain\n\nIndiana State, US\n\nr\n\nOntario Province, Can. s\n\nQuebec Province, Can. r\n\nFinished University or Equivalent or Higher\n\nPercent of Students\n51 (1.5) 29 (1.3) 33 (0.7) 25 (1.4) 10 (0.7) 28 (1.3) 16 (1.0) 17 (1.4) 28 (0.8) 24 (1.1) 40 (1.4) 10 (0.7) 12 (1.0) 37 (1.6) 9 (0.9) 10 (0.8) 45 (1.3) 21 (1.3) 45 (1.4) 35 (1.8) 35 (1.2) 43 (1.8) 19 (1.2) 36 (1.6) 22 (1.3) 11 (0.9) 34 (1.4) 16 (1.3) 22 (1.6) 28 (1.9) 66 (1.4) 27 (0.9) 19 (1.2) 17 (1.8) 44 (2.3) 27 (1.9) xx 20 (1.2) 16 (0.6) 34 (1.9) 26 (1.3) 11 (1.0) 48 (1.8) 11 (0.9) 56 (1.3) xx 28 (0.2)\n\nAverage Achievement\n475 (4.1) 564 (4.7) 462 (2.6) 542 (3.2) 419 (8.8) 494 (10.1) 480 (4.3) 619 (3.7) 470 (3.5) 482 (4.8) 574 (3.1) 310 (9.5) 577 (5.9) 580 (3.1) 465 (6.7) 490 (5.7) 523 (3.9) 514 (5.7) 576 (2.5) 506 (5.2) 580 (2.2) 532 (3.7) 434 (6.7) 548 (2.6) 498 (5.0) 548 (6.4) 495 (3.9) 413 (6.1) 563 (4.6) 558 (7.0) 517 (2.3) 469 (4.4) 440 (7.8) 522 (5.8) 536 (3.3) 424 (6.0)\nxx 514 (3.1) 638 (3.6) 556 (3.8) 548 (2.9) 341 (20.1) 550 (3.7) 426 (5.1) 554 (3.4)\nxx 507 (0.9)\n\n34 (2.1) 46 (2.1) 46 (2.3) 33 (1.6)\n\n510 (4.5) 551 (5.5) 557 (3.4) 549 (4.4)\n\nFinished Post-secondary Vocational/Technical Education\nBut Not University\n\nPercent of Students\n22 (0.9) 27 (1.0) 7 (0.5) 26 (1.0) 14 (0.6) 36 (1.4) 10 (0.5) 11 (0.6) 14 (0.7) 0 (0.0) 39 (1.1) 17 (0.9) 12 (0.5) 0 (0.0) 6 (0.5) 10 (0.7) 24 (0.9) 5 (0.4) 18 (0.7) 15 (0.8) 15 (0.6) 0 (0.0) 21 (1.0) 31 (1.0) 19 (0.9) 20 (0.9) 18 (1.0) 0 (0.0) 32 (1.3) 30 (1.5) 16 (1.0) 12 (0.5) 22 (0.8) 16 (1.0) 26 (1.5) 0 (0.0) xx 68 (1.2) 4 (0.3) 0 (0.0) 31 (0.8) 13 (0.7) 18 (1.1) 12 (0.8) 9 (0.4) xx 17 (0.1)\n\nAverage Achievement\n461 (4.4) 540 (4.7) 446 (5.6) 540 (3.0) 388 (4.4) 485 (5.2) 444 (4.6) 593 (4.2) 459 (3.7)\n~~ 548 (2.7) 285 (8.5) 565 (4.3)\n~~ 438 (6.4) 471 (3.8) 487 (4.2) 507 (6.1) 555 (3.2) 488 (4.9) 560 (3.0)\n~~ 417 (5.9) 523 (3.2) 476 (4.3) 526 (4.1) 483 (4.8)\n~~ 560 (3.7) 541 (5.9) 494 (4.0) 443 (5.4) 399 (6.8) 489 (5.1) 515 (4.3)\n~~ xx 467 (2.6) 605 (7.2) ~~ 530 (2.3) 280 (12.5) 540 (4.5) 424 (3.7) 522 (3.6) xx 487 (0.8)\n\n14 (1.1) 10 (0.8) 37 (1.6) 34 (0.9)\n\n493 (3.6) 531 (5.4) 534 (3.1) 540 (3.8)\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nFinished Upper Secondary Schooling\n\nPercent of Students\n24 (1.1) 25 (1.1) 23 (0.6) 31 (1.1) 16 (0.8) 29 (1.4) 32 (1.1) 46 (1.0) 36 (0.9) 11 (0.6) 19 (0.7) 22 (1.0) 36 (0.9) 49 (1.6) 24 (1.1) 15 (0.8) 18 (0.9) 40 (0.9) 36 (1.1) 30 (1.0) 41 (1.0) 34 (1.4) 19 (0.7) 30 (1.3) 43 (1.2) 27 (0.9) 21 (1.1) 17 (0.8) 43 (1.9) 34 (1.9) 12 (0.9) 36 (0.8) 33 (0.9) 47 (1.5) 24 (1.2) 12 (0.5) xx 2 (0.2) 21 (0.8) 65 (1.9) 34 (1.1) 30 (0.9) 22 (1.3) 16 (0.6) 26 (0.9) xx 28 (0.2)\n21 (1.1) 33 (1.3) 13 (1.1) 21 (1.1)\n\nAverage Achievement\n451 (4.8) 517 (4.6) 449 (3.5) 516 (3.5) 360 (4.1) 469 (6.3) 415 (3.2) 568 (3.3) 439 (3.4) 452 (6.6) 534 (3.4) 276 (7.3) 558 (3.0) 530 (2.8) 433 (5.1) 475 (3.9) 468 (5.0) 501 (3.1) 536 (2.5) 475 (3.6) 551 (2.0) 517 (3.5) 405 (5.8) 497 (2.7) 449 (3.7) 518 (4.2) 471 (4.8) 405 (5.9) 527 (3.2) 518 (5.3) 496 (6.5) 441 (3.3) 368 (5.9) 475 (5.0) 494 (4.4) 404 (5.9)\nxx ~~ 602 (4.1) 512 (3.2) 515 (3.1) 250 (7.1) 518 (4.3) 411 (4.3) 511 (3.0) xx 472 (0.8)\n488 (3.7) 530 (5.4) 527 (4.5) 516 (3.4)\n\nBackground data provided by students.\n* Based on countries' categorizations to UNESCO's International Standard Classi\ufb01cation of Education (Operational Manual for ISCED-1997).\n\u00b6 Did not satisfy guidelines for sample participation rates (see Exhibit A.9).\n( ) Standard errors appear in parentheses.

At both eighth and fourth grades, students from homes where the language of the test is always or almost always spoken had higher average achievement than those who spoke it less frequently.\nWhereas in most countries a large majority of students at each grade are from homes where the language of the test is spoken frequently, on average, internationally, about 20 percent of students were from homes where the language of the test was spoken only sometimes, or never. Countries where the majority of students speak the language of the test so infrequently included Botswana, Ghana, Indonesia, Lebanon, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Africa at the eighth grade, and Morocco, the Philippines, and Singapore at the fourth grade. Although in general average science achievement in such countries was relatively low, Singapore was a notable exception, with average achievement above the international average even among those rarely speaking the language of the test at home.\nMany countries tested in more than one language in order to cover their whole student population. These included Bahrain (Arabic and English), Egypt (Arabic, English, and French), Estonia (Estonian and Russian), Hong Kong SAR (Chinese and English), Israel (Hebrew and Arabic), Latvia (Latvian and Russian), Lebanon (French and English) Macedonia (Macedonian and Albanian), Moldova (Moldavian and Russian), New Zealand (English and Maori at grade 4 only), Norway (Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk), the Palestinian National Authority (Arabic and English), Romania (Romanian and Hungarian), the Slovak Republic (Slovak and Hungarian), and South Africa (English and Afrikaans). Among benchmarking participants, the Basque Country, Spain tested in Basque and Castilian, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec in English and French. However, in countries like Botswana, Ghana, Indonesia, Morocco, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Africa, testing in all possible dialects and languages was prohibitive.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n135\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 4: STUDENTS\u2019 BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE\nExhibit 4.3: Students Speak Language of the Test at Home\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

For example, TIMSS 1999 has shown a consistent relationship between number of books in the home and student achievement in both mathematics and science at the eighth grade,2 and PIRLS 2001 demonstrated a similar relationship with reading literacy at the fourth grade.3 Providing further information on this topic, Exhibit 4.4 shows for each country at both eighth and fourth grades the percentage of students at each of \ufb01ve ranges of number of books in the home in relation to average science achievement. This exhibit reveals a wide range both across and within each country. For example, the percentage of eighth-grade students reporting more than 200 books in their homes exceeded 30 percent in Australia, Estonia, Hungary, and Sweden, whereas in Botswana, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Iran, Morocco, the Philippines, and South Africa, more than 30 percent of students were from homes with 10 books or less. The situation among fourth-grade students was similar.\nAcross countries, on average, 15 percent of eighth-grade students were from homes with more than 200 books, 13 percent from homes with 101-200 books, 27 percent from homes with 26-100 books, 26 percent from homes with 11-25 books, and 18 percent with 0-10 books. There also was a clear-cut relationship, on average, between number of books in the home and science achievement. Eighth-grade students reporting more than 200 books in their homes had an average score of 506 on the science scale, compared with an average of just 438 for students reporting 10 books or less, a difference of 68 points. The difference at fourth grade was similar.\nIn addition to literacy resources such as books, TIMSS has found that having study aids such as a computer or a study desk or table at home was associated with higher student achievement. Exhibit 4.5 shows the percentage of eighth- and fourth-grade students in each country that had a computer or study desk or table, together with their average science achievement. About 60 percent\n\n138\n\n2 Mullis, I.V.S., Martin, M.O., Gonzalez, E.J., Gregory, K.D., Garden, R.A., O\u2019Connor, K.M, Chrostowski, S.J., and Smith, T.A.

However, there were great differences between countries. For 17 of the participants \u2013 Australia, Belgium (Flemish), Chinese Taipei, England, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Singapore, Sweden, the United States, Indiana, Ontario, and Quebec \u2013 virtually all eighth-grade students (90% or more) reported having a computer at home. In contrast, less than 20 percent of eighth-grade students in Armenia, Botswana, Egypt, Indonesia, Moldova, and Morocco reported having a computer. The science achievement difference between students with a computer at home and those without was substantial on average \u2013 35 scale score points at eighth grade and 27 points at fourth grade.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, somewhat greater percentages of students reported having a study desk or table at home \u2013 83 percent and 80 percent at eighth and fourth grades, respectively. In many countries (20 at eighth grade and 9 at fourth grade), more than 90 percent of students reported having a study desk. Having such a study facility was associated with higher average science achievement at both grades \u2013 34 point difference at eighth grade and a 26 point difference at fourth grade.\nBecause having a computer at home does not necessarily mean that students have access to it, TIMSS also asked students where they actually use a computer \u2013 at home, at school, or some other place. Exhibit 4.6 summarizes these responses, presenting countries in order of the percentage of students that reported using a computer both at home and at school. On average, almost 40% of eighth-grade students reported using a computer both at home and at school. Eighteen percent reported using a computer at home but not at school, 19 percent using one at school but not at home, and 10 percent at some other place. Fourteen percent of eighth-grade students reported that they do not use a computer at all. The percentages for fourth grade were fairly similar.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n139\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 4: STUDENTS\u2019 BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE\nExhibit 4.4: Books in the Home\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

Next highest was achievement among students using computers at home but not school (476 points), followed by students using computers at school but not home (450 points). Countries with the greatest percentages of eighth-grade students using computers at home and at school included Hong Kong SAR, Chinese Taipei, Australia, England, and Indiana (80% or more), as well as Singapore, the United States, The Netherlands, Sweden, Scotland, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, and Cyprus (70% or more).\nHow Much of Their Out-of-School Time Do Students Spend on Homework During the School Week?\nOne of the major ways that students can consolidate and extend classroom learning is to spend time out of school studying or doing homework in school subjects. Well-chosen homework assignments can reinforce classroom learning, and by providing a challenge can encourage students to extend their understanding of the subject matter. Homework also allows students who are having trouble keeping up with their classmates to review material taught in class.\nTo summarize the amount of time typically devoted to science homework in each country, TIMSS constructed an index of the time students spend doing science homework (TSH) that assigns students to a high, medium, or low level on the basis of the frequency and amount of science homework they are assigned each week. Students at the high level reported that they were assigned more than 30 minutes of science homework at least 3-4 times per week. Students at the low level were reportedly assigned not more than 30 minutes of science homework, twice per week. The middle level included all other response combinations.\nExhibit 4.7 presents the percentages of eighth- and fourth-grade students at the various levels of this index across countries, and their\n\n150\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 4: STUDENTS\u2019 BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE\naverage science achievement. Countries are ordered by the percentage of students at the high level of the index. Also, the 17 countries that taught biology, earth science, chemistry, and physics as separate science subjects at eighth grade are presented in separate panels for each subject. Twenty-seven of the countries and all four benchmarking participants at the eighth grade taught science as a single subject. Among these, 13 percent of students were at the high level of the time spent on science homework index, 44 percent at the medium level, and 43 percent at the low level. Countries with the greatest emphasis on homework included Ghana, Egypt, the Palestinian National Authority, and Malaysia, where 20 percent or more of the students were at the high level of the index. In these countries, homework seems to be an important part of teachers\u2019 instructional strategy. In contrast, there seems to be relatively little emphasis on homework in Australia, Chile, England, Hong Kong SAR, Iran, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, and Tunisia, as well as the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, where less than 10 percent of students were at the high level of the index. Included in this group are several of the countries with the highest achievement levels \u2013 Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and Korea.\nIn countries teaching eighth-grade biology as a separate subject, nine percent of students on average were at the high level of the index, compared with 10 percent for earth science, and 14 percent each for chemistry and physics. Among these separate-science-subject countries, the Russian Federation, Moldova, and Armenia had the greatest percentages of students at the high level of the science homework index. It is noteworthy that there are several high-achieving countries among those at the low level of the homework index, including Belgium (Flemish), Hungary, The Netherlands, the Slovak Republic, and Sweden.\nIn general, less science homework is assigned at the fourth grade, with six percent of students on average at the high level of the index, 33 percent at the middle level, and 61 percent at the low level.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n151\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 4: STUDENTS\u2019 BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE\nExhibit 4.7: Index of Time Students Spend Doing Science Homework (TSH) in a Normal School Week\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nIndex of Time Students Spend Doing Science Homework\n\nCountries\n\nHigh\n\nMedium\n\nLow\n\nTSH\n\nTSH\n\nTSH\n\nPercent of Average Percent of Average Percent of Average Students Achievement Students Achievement Students Achievement\n\nGeneral/ Integrated Science\n\nIndex based on students\u2019 reports on the frequency and amount of science homework they are given.

Particularly among separatescience-subject countries, students at the high level of the index had the lowest average achievement. This pattern is also apparent at fourth grade, and suggests that, compared with their higher-achieving counterparts, the lower-performing students may be assigned more homework as a remedial strategy in an effort to keep up academically.\nTo provide a fuller picture of how students spend their outof-school time on a school day, Exhibit 4.8 gives students\u2019 reports on how they spend their daily leisure time. The two most popular activities were watching television or videos and playing or talking with friends (each about two hours per day at eighth grade and a little less at fourth grade). Students reported spending more than one hour per day playing sports and working at jobs at home, and about one hour playing computer games and using the internet.\nHow Con\ufb01dent Are Students in Their Ability to Learn Science? To investigate how students think of their abilities in science, TIMSS created an index of students\u2019 self-con\ufb01dence in learning science (SCS). This index is based on students\u2019 responses to four statements about their science ability:\n\u2022 I usually do well in science; \u2022 Science is more dif\ufb01cult for me than for many of my classmates;* \u2022 Science is not one of my strengths; \u2022 I learn things quickly in science.* In countries where the sciences are taught as separate subjects, students were asked about each subject separately.\n* The response categories for this statement were reversed in constructing the index.\n\n158\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 4: STUDENTS\u2019 BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE\nStudents who agreed a little or agreed a lot with all four statements on average were assigned to the high level of the index, while students who disagreed a little or disagreed a lot with all four on average were assigned to the low level. The medium level includes all other possible combinations of responses. The percentages of students at each level of this index, and their average science achievement, are presented in Exhibit 4.9 for both eighth and fourth grades. This fourpage display summarizes the data in one panel for the countries that teach science as a single subject at the eighth grade, and in separate panels for earth science, biology, physics, and chemistry for countries that teach the sciences separately. There is a single panel also displaying the fourth-grade data.\nOn average, internationally, almost half (48 percent) of the eighth-grade students in the single-science countries had high selfcon\ufb01dence in learning science. The percentages ranged from a high of 69 percent in Tunisia to a low of 20 percent in Japan. Although there was a clear positive association between self-con\ufb01dence in learning science and science achievement internationally and in every country, at the country level the relationship was more complex. It is noteworthy that the four countries with lowest percentages of students in the high self-con\ufb01dence category \u2013 Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and Korea \u2013 all had high average science achievement. Since all of these are Asian Paci\ufb01c countries, they may share cultural traditions that encourage modest self-con\ufb01dence.\nIn countries teaching the sciences as separate subjects at the eighth grade, the percentage of students at the high level of the selfcon\ufb01dence in learning science index was greatest for biology and earth science, with 59 percent and 56 percent of students in the high category on average for these subjects, respectively. The percentage was lower for physics and chemistry (40 percent each). Although there was some variation, generally countries with high percentages of students in the high category for one subject had high percentages in the other subjects also. Serbia had the highest percentages in the high category for\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n159\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 4: STUDENTS\u2019 BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE\nExhibit 4.9: Index of Students' Self-Con\ufb01dence in Learning Science (SCS)\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nIndex of Students' Self-Confidence in Learning Science\n\nCountries\n\nGeneral/ Integrated Science\n\nIndex based on students\u2019 responses to four statements about science:1) I usually do well in science; 2) Science is more difficult for me than for many of my classmates (Reversed); 3) Science is not one of my strengths (Reversed); 4) I learn things quickly in science.\n\nTunisia Egypt Norway Israel Scotland Saudi Arabia Jordan Italy Ghana\n\nAverage is computed across the four items based on a 4-point scale: 1.

Romania had the lowest percentage in the high category for earth science, chemistry, and physics. The positive association between self-con\ufb01dence in learning science and science achievement that was found for science as a single subject was also evident in each of the science subject areas.\nAt fourth grade, 59 percent of students were at the high level of the self-con\ufb01dence in learning science index, compared with 32 percent at the medium and just nine percent at the low. The countries with the greatest percentages included Slovenia, The Netherlands, Cyprus, and Hungary, each with 70 percent or more. Countries with relatively lower percentages included Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore, each with less than 50 percent at the high level. Again, there was a positive relationship, on average, between self-con\ufb01dence in learning science and science achievement.\nWhat Value Do Students Place on Science?\nStudents\u2019 motivation to learn science can be affected by whether they \ufb01nd the subject enjoyable, place value on the subject, and think it is important for success in school and for future career aspirations. In addition, developing such positive attitudes towards science among students is an important goal of science education in many countries. To gain some understanding about the value eighth- and fourth-grade students place on science, TIMSS created an index of students valuing science (SVS). Students were asked to state their agreement with the following seven statements about science:\n\u2022 I would like to take more science in school;\n\u2022 I enjoy learning science;\n\u2022 I think learning science will help me in my daily life;\n\u2022 I need science to learn other school subjects;\n\n164\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 4: STUDENTS\u2019 BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE\n\u2022 I need to do well in science to get into the university of my choice;\n\u2022 I would like a job that involved using science;\n\u2022 I need to do well in science to get the job I want.\nIn countries where the sciences are taught as separate subjects, students were asked about each subject area separately.\nStudents who agreed a little or agreed a lot, on average, with all seven statements were assigned to the high level of the index, while students who, on average, disagreed a little or disagreed a lot with all seven were assigned to the low level. Students between these extremes were placed in the medium category. The percentages of students at each level of this index, and their average science achievement, are presented in Exhibit 4.10 for both eighth and fourth grades. This threepage display summarizes the data in one panel for the countries that teach science as a single subject at the eighth grade, and in separate panels for earth science, biology, physics, and chemistry for countries that teach the sciences separately.\nIn countries where eighth-grade science is taught as a single subject, students generally placed a high value on science, with 57 percent on average across countries in the high category, and a further 31 percent in the medium category. Only 12 percent of students were in the low category. Countries with large percentages of students at the high level included Botswana, Egypt, Ghana, Jordan, Tunisia, the Palestinian National Authority, and Morocco, with 80 percent or more in this category. Among countries placing less value on science were Chinese Taipei, Japan, and Korea. Since these are countries with high average science achievement, it may be that the students follow a demanding science curriculum, one that leads to high achievement but little enthusiasm for the subject matter. Within almost all the single-sciencesubject countries at the eighth grade, there was a positive association between valuing science and average science achievement.

Greater percentages of students were in the high index category for biology (37 percent, on average) and physics (31 percent), and lower percentages for earth science and chemistry (29 percent each). Countries with relatively large percentages of students at the high level in all subject areas included Armenia, Macedonia, Moldova, and Indonesia and Lebanon where applicable. The relationship between valuing science and science achievement was even less consistent for the separate science subject areas than for science as a single subject, partly because relatively high-achieving countries such as Belgium (Flemish), Estonia, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Sweden had low percentages of students in the high index category. Only for physics was there a positive relationship between valuing physics and science achievement.\nTo provide more information on changes from 1995 and 1999 in an important component of the students valuing science index, Exhibit 4.11 displays the percentages of eighth-grade students in 2003, 1999, and 1995 that \u201cagree a lot,\u201d \u201cagree a little,\u201d or \u201cdisagree\u201d that they enjoy learning science. This four-page display summarizes the data in one panel for the countries that teach science as a single subject at the eighth grade, and in separate panels for earth science, biology, physics, and chemistry for countries that teach the sciences separately. Comparable data at fourth grade are shown in a single panel for 2003 and 1995 only.\nAmong countries where eighth-grade science is taught as a single subject, there has been an increase from 1995 and 1999 in the average percentage of students agreeing a lot that they enjoy learning science, from 23 percent in 1995 to 32 percent in 1999 to 44 percent in 2003.

A similar trend was apparent among separate-science countries in biology, earth science, and chemistry, with greater percentages of students in 2003 than in 1995 or 1999 agreeing a lot that they enjoy learning the subject. For physics, the percentage of students in this category in 2003 was greater than in 1995 but slightly less than in 1999.\nAt fourth grade, the average percentage of students agreeing a lot that they enjoy learning science increased from 44 percent in 1995 to 55 percent in 2003. Participants showing a signi\ufb01cant increase included Australia, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary, Iran, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, the United States, Ontario, and Quebec.\n\n174\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 4: STUDENTS\u2019 BACKGROUNDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n175\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\n\n176\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nChapter 5\nThe Science Curriculum\nThe \ufb01rst part of Chapter 5 presents information about the curricular goals in the TIMSS 2003 countries, referred to as the intended curriculum. Information is provided about the science subjects offered in each country, whether the participating countries have national curricula and public examinations in science, how the curriculum is supported and monitored within each country, whether countries differentiate the curricula for students with different levels of ability, and the approaches and processes that are emphasized in the intended curriculum. The second part of the chapter presents data about the coverage of the TIMSS science topics in the intended curriculum for each country, as well as teachers\u2019 reports about the science topics actually taught to their students, also known as the implemented curriculum.\nIn comparing achievement across countries, it is important to consider differences in students\u2019 curricular experiences and how they may affect the science they have studied. Students\u2019 opportunity to learn the content, skills, and processes tested in the TIMSS 2003 science assessment depends to a large degree on the curricular goals and intentions inherent in each country\u2019s policies for science education. Just as important as what students are expected to learn, however, is what their teachers choose to teach them. The lessons provided by the teacher ultimately determine the science students are taught.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n177\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nThis chapter presents information about the curricular goals in science in the TIMSS 2003 countries and teachers\u2019 reports about the science content studied. Teachers\u2019 instructional programs for their classes are usually guided by an \u201cof\ufb01cial curriculum\u201d that describes the science education that should be provided. The of\ufb01cial curriculum can be communicated by means of documents or statements of various types (often called guides, guidelines, or frameworks) prepared by the education ministry or by national or regional education departments. These documents or statements, together with supporting material such as instructional guides or mandated textbooks, are referred to as the intended curriculum. To collect information about the intended science curriculum in each of the TIMSS 2003 countries, the National Research Coordinators (NRCs) responsible for implementing the study completed curriculum questionnaires, often with the assistance of curriculum specialists, and responded to follow-up queries.\nIn many cases, teachers need to interpret and adapt the intended curriculum according to their perceptions of the needs, abilities, and interests of their students, and this evolves into the implemented curriculum. Research has shown that the implemented curriculum, even in highly regulated educational systems, is not identical to the intended curriculum. To collect data about the implemented curriculum, the science teachers of the students tested in TIMSS 2003 completed questionnaires about whether the students had been taught the various science topics included in the assessment.\nWhich Science Subjects Are Offered Up To and Including Eighth Grade?\nOne of the primary differences among science curricula of the TIMSS 2003 countries in eighth and earlier grades is that the sciences are taught as separate subjects in some countries and integrated to form a general science course in others. Exhibit 5.1 shows how science instruction is organized in these grades in the TIMSS countries. By the eighth grade, most of the continental European countries, as well as Chinese\n\n178\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nTaipei, Indonesia, Lebanon, Morocco, and the Philippines, were teaching some or all of biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science as separate subjects (in some cases chemistry and physics or biology and earth science are combined), although not necessarily contemporaneously. Elsewhere, the common practice was to integrate the sciences into a general science curriculum.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n179\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nExhibit 5.1: Science Subjects Offered Up To and Including Eighth Grade\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt England Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania\nMacedonia, Rep. of\nMalaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands\nNew Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

Some countries, on the other hand, have less centralized systems, with such decisions made at the regional or local level. Centralized decision making can add coherence and uniformity to curriculum coverage, whereas less centralized decision making may give a school or teacher more \ufb02exibility in tailoring instruction to the needs of students.\nExhibit 5.2 shows that, of the 47 countries that participated in TIMSS 2003 at the eighth grade,1 all but 3 reported that the speci\ufb01cations for students\u2019 curricular goals in science at this level were developed as national curricula. In Australia and the United States, curricula were determined at the state level. In Belgium (Flemish), although there was no national curriculum, there were of\ufb01cially de\ufb01ned \ufb01nal attainment levels, and school boards developed their own curricula based on these. Among benchmarking participants, the US state of Indiana and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec had system-wide curricula determined at the state and provincial level, respectively, while in the Basque Country of Spain, 55 percent of the curriculum was determined at the national level and 45 percent at the community level.\nIn the recent past, it has become common for countries\u2019 intended curricula to be updated regularly. At the time of the TIMSS 2003 testing, the of\ufb01cial eighth-grade science curriculum in 27 of the participants had been in place for \ufb01ve years or less, and more than half of those were in revision. Of the 24 participants with an eighth-grade science curriculum of more than \ufb01ve years standing, 18 were revising it at the time of the assessment. For Australia and the United States, with less centralized educational systems, curriculum renewal varied by state and was generally an ongoing process.\n1 Curriculum data are presented for the Syrian Arab Republic at the eighth grade, and for Yemen at the fourth grade, because these data are not dependent upon the countries\u2019 samples.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n181\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nAt the fourth grade, Exhibit 5.2 shows that of the 26 countries that participated in TIMSS 2003 at this level, all but 3 reported having national curricula in fourth-grade science. Similar to the eighth grade, fourth-grade science curricula in Australia and the United States were determined at the state level, and school boards in Belgium (Flemish) developed their own curricula based on of\ufb01cially de\ufb01ned \ufb01nal attainment levels. Among benchmarkers, Indiana, Ontario, and Quebec had system-wide curricula determined at the state or provincial level, respectively.\nAt the time of the TIMSS 2003 assessment, the of\ufb01cial fourthgrade science curriculum had been in place for \ufb01ve years or less in 20 of the participants, and nearly half of those were in revision. Of the nine participating entities with a fourth-grade science curriculum of more than \ufb01ve years standing, \ufb01ve were revising it at the time of the assessment. As at the eighth grade, curriculum renewal in Australia and the United States varied by state and was generally an ongoing process.\nPublic examinations with consequences for individual students are another common feature of many countries\u2019 educational systems. Although public examinations can provide information of interest to national and regional policymakers, their main purpose is to make decisions about individual students, such as promotion from one grade to another, entry to a higher school system, or graduation from secondary school. Among all TIMSS 2003 participants, 39 countries and one benchmarking entity reported having public examinations in science at one or more grades. Grade 12 was the most prevalent, with 33 countries giving students public examinations in science at this level.\n\n182\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nExhibit 5.2: Intended Science Curriculum\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia\nBahrain 1 Belgium (Flemish)\nBotswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt England Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR\nHungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel 2 Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania\nMacedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

The use of public examinations as a mechanism to support and monitor implementation of the intended curriculum is prevalent among many countries, as noted above. Another way to help ensure alignment is to develop instructional materials, such as textbooks, instructional guides, and ministry notes, tailored to the curriculum. In addition, countries can also monitor curriculum implementation by means of national assessments based on student samples, and by systems of school inspection or audit. The different methods used by the TIMSS 2003 countries are shown in Exhibit 5.3, \ufb01rst for countries that participated at the eighth grade and then for those at the fourth grade.\nOf the methods for supporting and monitoring curriculum implementation shown in Exhibit 5.3, at the eighth grade, 11 participants reported using all 7, and an additional 25 used 5 or 6. The most widely used methods were instructional or pedagogical guides (47 participants) and ministry notes and directives (40 participants). Also commonly used were a system of school inspection or audit (38 participants), mandated or recommended textbooks (38 participants), curricular evaluation during or after implementation (35 participants), and the use of speci\ufb01cally developed or recommended instructional activities (33 participants). The least widely used method was national assessments based on student samples (21 participants).\nAt the fourth grade, three participants reported using all seven methods shown in Exhibit 5.3 to support and monitor curriculum implementation, and 21 participants used \ufb01ve or six. The most widely used methods were instructional or pedagogical guides (28 participants), ministry notes and directives (23 participants), and speci\ufb01cally developed or recommended instructional activities (23 participants). The use of curriculum evaluation during or after implementation as a means of monitoring the fourth-grade science curriculum was reported\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n185\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nby 22 participants. A system of school inspection or audit was used by 21 participants and mandated or recommended textbooks also by 21 participants. Similar to the eighth grade, the least widely used method at the fourth grade was national assessment based on student samples (10 participants).\nAn additional method countries often use to support curriculum implementation is to provide science teachers with speci\ufb01c preparation in how to teach the intended curriculum as part of their pre-service and/or in-service education.

STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nHow Much Instructional Time is Intended for Science?\nMany countries designate in their intended curriculum the percentage of total instructional time that should be devoted to science and other subjects at different grade levels. The percentage of instructional time designated for science in the intended curriculum for grades 2, 4, 6, and 8 is shown in Exhibit 5.4 for all TIMSS 2003 participants.2 These data provide a good estimate of students\u2019 intended instructional time for science across the primary and middle school years. The general pattern across countries shows that the percentage of time increases or remains the same from grade 2 to grade 4, from grade 4 to grade 6, and from grade 6 to grade 8, with the largest increase usually between grades 6 and 8. Interestingly, the reverse pattern holds for mathematics, with proportionally less instructional time designated at the higher than at the lower grades.3 Where decreases occurred in the percentage of instructional time designated for science, they generally were between grades 2 and 4. Not all countries conformed to this general pattern, however. The percentage of total instructional time speci\ufb01ed for science ranged from 4 to 20 percent at second grade, from 4 to 28 percent at fourth grade, from 5 to 28 percent at sixth grade, and from 7 to 32 percent at eighth grade. Schools\u2019 and teachers\u2019 reports of the percentage of instructional time actually devoted to science at grades 4 and 8, shown in Exhibit 7.3, generally correspond with the intended percentages reported in Exhibit 5.4, although slightly more so at eighth grade than at fourth grade.\n\n2 Some of the countries that teach science as separate subjects at eighth grade provided the percentages individually for each subject, rather than as a total.\n3 Mullis, I.V.S., Martin, M.O., Gonzalez, E.J., and Chrostowski, S.J., (2004), TIMSS 2003 International Mathematics Report: Findings from IEA\u2019s Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study at the Eighth and Fourth Grades, Chestnut Hill, MA: Boston College.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n189\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nExhibit 5.4: Percentage of Total Instructional Time Intended for Science\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana\nBulgaria\nChile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt England\nEstonia\nGhana Hong Kong, SAR\nHungary\nIndonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia\nLebanon\nLithuania\nMacedonia, Rep. of\nMalaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway\nPalestinian Nat'l Auth.\nPhilippines\n\nGrade 2\nj j 5 12\n5\n8 12 5 j\n-\n5\n5\n11 10 j 10 8\n-\n20\n-\n4.3 6 j j 5\n13\nj\n\nGrade 4\nI hour per week j 10 10 8\n6\n10 12 5 9 j\n9\n13 5\n9\n20 11 10 15 10 12 10.3 7\n15\n20\n10\n13 4 6 j j 5\n10\n-\n\nGrade 6\n5 hours per week j 10 15 10\n12\n10 12 5 11 j\n8\n13 5\n8\n20 14.3\n20 10 12 9.3 6\n15\n10\n6.5\n13 14 6 j j 8\n14\n-\n\nGrade 8\nBiology, Chemistry, Physics, Earth Science 2 hours each per week\nj\n13 j\n13\nBiology 5.8; Chemistry 5.8; Physics 5.8; Earth\nScience 5.8\n7\nPhysics/Chemistry 12\nChemistry 2.8; Physics 5.7; Earth\nScience 5.7\n11 j\nBiology 5.2; Chemistry 6.25;\nPhysics 6.25; Geography 5.2\n10\n10-15\nBiology 5.4; Chemistry 5.5;\nPhysics 5.4; Earth Science 5.4\nBiology 7.5; Physics 7.5\n14.3\n10.3\n20\n11\n15\n11.8\n17\nLife and Earth Sciences 5; Chemistry 5; Physics 5\nBiology 4; Chemistry 8; Physics 8; Geography 8\nBiology 7.6; Chemistry 7.6;\nPhysics 7.6; Geography 7.6\n13\n25\n14\nBiology 6; Physics/Chemistry 6;\nGeography 3\nj\n10\nEnvironment and Hygiene 5.6;\nTechnology and Applied Sciences 5.6\nBiology 20\n\nj\n\nCountry reported that the national curriculum\n\ndoes not specify the\n\npercentage of total\n\ninstructional time\n\nintended for science\n\nBackground data provided by National Research Coordinators.\n\nA dash (\u2013) indicates comparable data are not available.\n\n190\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nExhibit 5.4: Percentage of Total Instructional Time Intended for Science\n\nTIMSS2003\n4 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nRomania\nRussian Federation\nSaudi Arabia Scotland Serbia Singapore\nSlovak Republic\nSlovenia South Africa 1 Sweden Syrian Arab Republic Tunisia United States Yemen Benchmarking Participants Basque Country, Spain Indiana State, US Ontario Province, Can.

Exhibit 5.5 indicates how countries addressed this issue in organizing the intended science curriculum, \ufb01rst for countries that participated at the eighth grade and then for those at the fourth grade.\nThe most common approach at the eighth grade, reported by 39 participants, was to have the same intended curriculum for all students with no grouping of students. Nine countries reported having one curriculum for all students, but at different dif\ufb01culty levels for groups of students with different ability levels. Four countries \u2013 Belgium (Flemish), the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, and Singapore \u2013 had different curricula for different groups of students according to their ability level.\nAt the fourth grade, all participants reported having just one science curriculum for all students, and in most cases with no grouping by ability level. Five countries, Australia, England, New Zealand, Scotland, and the United States, had just one curriculum for all students, but provide different levels of dif\ufb01culty for students of differing ability levels.\n\n192\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nExhibit 5.5: The Way the Intended Science Curriculum Addresses the Issue of Students with Different Levels of Ability\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt England Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

At the eighth grade, \u201ca lot of emphasis\u201d was most commonly placed on understanding science concepts (34 participants) and knowing basic science facts (35 participants). Considerable emphasis also was placed on writing explanations about what was observed and why it happened (20 participants).\nLess emphasis was placed internationally on experimental work, with conducting experiments or investigations emphasized a lot in the curricula of 16 participants, formulating hypotheses or predictions to be tested in the curricula of 12 participants, and designing and planning experiments or investigations in the curricula of 9 participants.\nUnderstanding human impact on the environment was given a lot of emphasis in the intended eighth-grade curriculum of 16 participants, and learning about technology and its impact on society in that of 9 participants. Learning about the nature of science and inquiry received a lot of emphasis in 10 participating entities.\nRelative to the other approaches and processes, participants reported placing less emphasis on integrating science with other subjects and incorporating the experiences of different ethnic/cultural groups. Only four participants (Botswana, Israel, Italy, and South Africa) reported placing a lot of emphasis on integrating science, and just two countries \u2013 South Africa and Sweden \u2013 reported placing a lot of emphasis on the multicultural approach in the intended curriculum.\nIn the intended science curriculum at the fourth grade, most emphasis was placed on understanding science concepts (15 participants emphasized a lot), knowing basic science facts (13 participants), and writing explanations about what was observed and why it happened (13 participants). Conducting experiments or investigations was given a lot of emphasis in 11 participating entities.

The TIMSS Assessment Frameworks and Speci\ufb01cations: 2003 served as the basis for the TIMSS 2003 science assessment.4 It delineates the science content and skills to be assessed at both the eighth and fourth grades, and represents a consensus among the countries participating in TIMSS 2003 about the science that students at these grades should be expected to have learned. Content and topic areas are elaborated in the frameworks, with each topic area presented as a comprehensive list of objectives speci\ufb01c to the target grades (eighth or fourth grades) covered in a majority of participating countries. However, the frameworks do not consist solely of content and behaviors included in the intended curricula of most participating countries. The aim was to ensure that goals of science education regarded as important in a signi\ufb01cant number of countries be included. Hence, not all topics included in the TIMSS 2003 assessment are in all participating countries\u2019 intended curriculum, and consequently the curricula of some countries align more closely than others with the TIMSS frameworks.5\nNational Research Coordinators were asked to indicate whether each of the TIMSS 2003 science topics was included in their countries\u2019 intended curricula through the target grade (eighth or fourth grade),\n\n4 Mullis, I.V.S., Martin, M.O., Smith, T.A., Garden, R.A., Gregory, K.D., Gonzalez, E.J., Chrostowski, S.J., and O\u2019Connor, K.M.

On average, across participants at the eighth grade, 71 percent of the assessment topics were intended for all or almost all students, and a further 4 percent for only the more able students. In only eight countries were less than half of the topics included in the eighth-grade curriculum: Belgium (Flemish), Botswana, Cyprus, Indonesia, Lebanon, Morocco, South Africa, and Tunisia. Coverage of the TIMSS science topics was particularly sparse in South Africa and Tunisia, with just 16 and 7 percent of the topics, respectively, in the intended curriculum for all or almost all students.\nIt is noteworthy that in most countries, those topics included in the curriculum were intended for all students. Only in Hong Kong SAR, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa, Sweden, the Basque Country, and Quebec were more than 10 percent of science topics intended only for the more able students.\nEach of the \ufb01ve content areas in the TIMSS eighth-grade science assessment \u2013 life science, chemistry, physics, earth science, and environmental science \u2013 was included in the intended curriculum in about equal proportions (65-75%), on average. In life science, 73 percent of the topics, on average, were included in participants\u2019 intended curriculum for all or almost all students. At least 10 of the 12 life science topics were included in the curriculum of about half of the participants (25). Participants with relatively low coverage (no more than half of the 12 topics) included Botswana, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Indonesia, Iran, Lebanon, Morocco, Slovenia, Tunisia, and Quebec.\nChemistry had fewer topics than life science (8 vs. 12) but a proportionally similar level of inclusion in the intended curriculum \u2013 70 percent of topics, on average. Ten participants included all eight chemistry topics in their curricula, and a further 13 participants included seven of the eight topics. None of the chemistry topics were\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n201\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nincluded in the intended curriculum in Belgium (Flemish), Indonesia, and Tunisia.\nOf the physics topics in the TIMSS assessment, three-fourths, on average, were included in the intended curricula of the participating countries and benchmarking entities for all or almost all students. All 10 physics topics were in the curricula of 17 participants, and 9 of the 10 in that of a further 5 participants. Similar to chemistry, none of the physics topics were included in the curricula of Belgium (Flemish) or Tunisia.\nEarth science had, by a small margin, the fewest topics in the participants\u2019 intended curricula \u2013 66 percent, on average. All 11 earth science topics were included in the curricula of 10 of the participating entities, and a further 8 participants had at least 10 of the 11 topics in their curricula. Fewer than half of the 11 topics were intended to be taught in Belgium (Flemish), Botswana, Chile, Chinese Taipei, Cyprus, Indonesia, Iran, Korea, Malaysia, Morocco, South Africa, and Tunisia.\nEnvironmental science had just three topics in the assessment, and about two of the three, on average, were included in the participants\u2019 curricula for most students. About half of the participants included all three topics in their intended curriculum. In contrast, seven participants \u2013 Botswana, Chinese Taipei, Cyprus, Iran, Korea, Lebanon, and Tunisia \u2013 included no environmental science topics in their intended curricula.\nUnlike mathematics, where the relationship between inclusion in the intended curriculum and student achievement was moderately positive,6 in science this relationship was not as straightforward. The six highest performing countries in science, with the exception of Korea, had relatively high percentages (about 70%) of the science topics in their intended curricula, and there were several examples of lower-performing countries with few topics in their curricula \u2013 Botswana, Indonesia, Lebanon, South Africa, and Tunisia. However, although among the top-performing countries only Korea and Hong Kong, SAR had less than 70 percent of the topics in their curricula, there were some lowperforming countries (such as Ghana and the Philippines) with many\n6 Mullis, I.V.S., Martin, M.O., Gonzalez, E.J., and Chrostowski, S.J., (2004), TIMSS 2003 International Mathematics Report: Findings from IEA\u2019s Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study at the Eighth and Fourth Grades, Chestnut Hill, MA: Boston College.\n\n202\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\ntopics in their intended curricula. Belgium (Flemish) is unusual in that it had low coverage of the TIMSS science topics in its intended curriculum (just 23%) but still performed above the international mean. It appears that having at least moderate coverage of the science topics is a prerequisite for high performance, but that high coverage in the intended curriculum does not of itself lead to high student achievement.\nAt fourth grade, Exhibit 5.7 shows that internationally, on average, 56 percent of the TIMSS 2003 science topics were included in the intended curricula for all or almost all students, and a further 4 percent for only the more able students. More than 70 percent of the science topics were included in the intended curriculum for all or almost all students in Armenia, England, Lithuania, Italy, Moldova, Norway, the United States, and Ontario.\nAt the fourth grade even more than at the eighth, those topics that were included in the curriculum were intended for all students. Only Armenia, Belgium (Flemish), Cyprus, Morocco, New Zealand, Scotland, and Quebec had any science topics intended only for the more able students.\nLife science, with 10 topics, had the highest percentage of topics included in participants\u2019 intended curricula at the fourth grade (60% for most students and 7% for the top track only). Eleven participants had 8 or more of the 10 topics included. However, there were also eleven participants with no more than half of the life science topics included in their intended curricula at this grade level.\nPhysical science, which at the fourth grade incorporates topics from both physics and chemistry, was next in terms of inclusion in the intended curriculum, with 57 percent of its topics, on average, intended for most students and a further 4 percent for the top track only. Almost one-third of the participants included 10 or more of the 13 physical science topics in their intended curricula for most students. About the same proportion, however, included no more than half of the topics, mostly the same participants with low levels of inclusion overall.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n203\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nExhibit 5.7: Summary of TIMSS Science Topics in the Intended Curriculum\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nPercentage of TIMSS Science Topics Intended to be Taught Up to and Including Eighth Grade*\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt England Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

Only three countries, Italy, Moldova, and the Russian Federation, had as many as 8 of the 9 topics in their curricula for most students, and 13 participants had fewer than half of the topics included.\nAt the fourth grade, as at the eighth grade, the relationship between the coverage of the TIMSS science topics in participants\u2019 intended curricula and student achievement in science is not straightforward. Among the six top-performing countries, there was a range of topic coverage in the intended curriculum: two countries included about 40 percent of topics (Singapore and Chinese Taipei), two included about 50 percent of topics (Japan and Hong Kong, SAR), and two about 75 percent (England and the United States). Among the three lowestperforming countries, the Philippines included more than half the topics (59%) but Morocco included just one of the 32 science topics, and Tunisia none at all.\nAre the TIMSS Science Topics Taught in School?\nThe previous section described the coverage of the TIMSS science topics in participating countries intended curricula at the eighth and fourth grades, with a focus on the percentage of topics that were included in countries\u2019 intended curricula for all or almost all students. This section describes the coverage of the TIMSS topics in countries\u2019 implemented curricula at the eighth and fourth grades, based on teachers\u2019 reports of the percentage of students actually taught these topics.\nTo gather information about science coverage in the implemented curricula of participating countries, the science teachers7 of the students assessed were asked to indicate whether each of the TIMSS 2003 science topics was \u201cmostly taught before this year,\u201d \u201cmostly taught this year,\u201d or \u201cnot yet taught or just introduced.\u201d Exhibit 5.8 presents for eighth and fourth grade the percentage of students whose teachers reported that the students had been taught the TIMSS science topics\n7 At fourth grade there was one teacher questionnaire that asked about both mathematics and science, and at eighth grade there were separate questionnaires for mathematics teachers and science teachers.\n\n208\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\neither prior to or during the year of the assessment. The exhibit shows for each TIMSS participant, averaged across science content areas, the percentage of students whose teachers reported that the students had been taught each topic. The topics were listed in a questionnaire completed by the science teachers of the students who took the TIMSS 2003 test.8 Although generally, teacher participation was high, sometimes teachers did not complete the questionnaire assigned to them, so most countries had some percentage of students for whom no teacher questionnaire information is available. The exhibits in this chapter have special notations on this point. For a country where teacher responses are available for at least 70 but less than 85 percent of the students, an \u201cr\u201d is included next to its data. Where teacher responses are available for at least 50 but less than 70 percent of the students, an \u201cs\u201d is included. Where teacher responses are available for less than 50 percent, an \u201cx\u201d replaces the data.\nExhibit 5.8 shows that, according to their teachers, on average 67 percent of the eighth-grade students tested in TIMSS 2003 had been taught the TIMSS science topics. In \ufb01ve countries, Armenia, Egypt, Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia, teachers reported that almost all students (90 percent or more) had been taught the topics, as had the majority of students in all participating entities except Belgium (Flemish), Botswana, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa and Tunisia.\nLife science and chemistry were the content areas with the greatest coverage in the classroom, with 70 percent of students, on average, having been taught the TIMSS life science and chemistry topics by the eighth grade. Physics had the next greatest coverage (66%), followed by earth science (61%), and environmental science (49%). In life science, chemistry, physics, and earth science, teachers in 6-8 countries reported that almost all students (90 percent or more) had been taught the topics. Environmental science (just three topics) appears to have received proportionally less attention in the classroom than the other science areas.\n8 Further results from the teacher questionnaire are presented in Chapters 6 and 7.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n209\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study

The majority of students in every participating entity except Belgium (Flemish), Japan, the Netherlands, and Quebec had been taught the topics.\nConsistent with the data reported on the intended science curriculum at the fourth grade (Exhibit 5.7), life science was the content area with the greatest percentage of students taught the topics, on average (69%). Percentages were greatest in Lithuania (96%) and the Philippines (91%) and least in Japan (35%). For physical science and earth science, the average percentages of fourth-grade students taught the TIMSS science topics were similar, 56 percent and 58 percent, respectively. The percentage of students taught physical science ranged from 79 percent in the Philippines to 30 and 31 percent in Belgium (Flemish) and the Netherlands, respectively. Although earth science topics did not \ufb01gure prominently in the intended curriculum at the fourth grade, teachers\u2019 reports indicated that students have to a considerable extent been taught the topics. According to teachers\u2019 reports, the majority of students in 18 of the participating entities have been taught the earth science topics.\n\n212\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nWhich TIMSS Science Topics Are in the Intended and Implemented Curricula?\nFor \ufb01rst the eighth grade and then the fourth grade, this section presents information about the coverage of each individual science topic in each country\u2019s intended and implemented curricula. For each topic, the exhibits indicate whether the topic was intended to be taught and if so, to all or only the more able students; the grade(s) at which the topic was primarily intended to be taught; and the percentage of students actually taught the topic. Exhibits 5.9 through 5.13 present these data for the science content areas at eighth grade, and Exhibits 5.14 through 5.16 for those at fourth grade.\nExhibit 5.9 presents information on the 12 life science topics at eighth grade. As shown in this exhibit, several of the TIMSS life science topics were included in the intended curriculum of most participants, and were taught to most students. These topics included \u201cclassi\ufb01cation of organisms\u201d (in the curriculum of 47 participants for most students; taught to 84% of students, on average), \u201cmajor organ systems in humans and other organisms\u201d (in the curriculaof 44 participants for most students; taught to 82% of students, on average), and \u201cthe interaction of living organisms in an ecosystem\u201d (in the curriculum of 42 participants for most students; taught to 69% of students, on average). In addition, there were several topics less widely intended or taught, but in the curriculum of more than 30 participants and taught to at least 70 percent of the students: \u201chow systems function to maintain stable bodily functions,\u201d \u201ccell structures and functions,\u201d \u201cphotosynthesis and respiration,\u201d \u201clife cycles of organisms,\u201d and \u201creproduction and heredity.\u201d Exhibit 5.9 also shows that there was great variation among participants in the grade(s) at which the life science topics were primarily intended to be taught. Also, while some countries reported that topics were intended to be taught primarily at a single grade, many provided a range of grades in which they were taught.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n213\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nExhibit 5.9: Intended and Taught TIMSS Life Science Topics\n\nLife Science\n\nClassification of organisms\n\nThe major organ systems in humans and other organisms\n\nHow the systems function to maintain stable bodily conditions\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\nCell structures and functions\n\nStudent population intended to be taught topic through 8th grade\nGrade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic Student population\nintended to be taught topic through 8th grade Grade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic Student population\nintended to be taught topic through 8th grade Grade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic Student population\nintended to be taught topic through 8th grade Grade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic SOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCountries\n\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt\nEstonia\nGhana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy\nJapan\nJordan\nKorea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway\nPalestinian Nat'l Auth.\nPhilippines\nRomania\nRussian Federation Saudi Arabia Scotland Serbia Singapore Slovak Republic Slovenia South Africa Sweden Syrian Arab Republic Tunisia United States \u00b6 England International Avg.

The most frequently reported topic \u2013 \u201cclassi\ufb01cation and composition of matter\u201d \u2013 was included for all or almost all students in 43 of the participating entities and taught to 85 percent of students, on average. Of \u201cproperties of solutions,\u201d \u201cthe particulate structure of matter,\u201d and \u201cproperties and uses of water,\u201d each was included in the curricula of at least 35 participants, and each was taught to 78 percent of students. In contrast, \u201cclassi\ufb01cation of familiar chemical transformations\u201d was included in the intended curriculum of just 17 participants, and was taught to just 47 percent of students, on average. Most participants indicated that this topic would be taught in later grades.\nThe TIMSS physics topics were widely included in participants\u2019 intended curricula at the eighth grade. Of the ten physics topics, three were in the curricula of at least 40 participants (\u201cphysical states and changes of matter,\u201d \u201cthe processes of melting, freezing, evaporation, and condensation,\u201d and \u201cbasic properties and behavior of light\u201d), and the remaining seven in the curriculum of at least 34 participants (see Exhibit 5.11). Coverage in the classroom varied somewhat, however, from 85 percent of students, on average, having been taught \u201cphysical states and changes in matter\u201d to just 51 percent having been taught \u201cproperties of permanent magnets and electromagnets.\u201d The latter topic also was one of those in the curriculum of fewest participants (34).\nAs noted earlier, the 11 earth science topics were included in fewer curricula than the other eighth-grade science topics. As shown in Exhibit 5.12, only one topic, \u201cEarth\u2019s water cycle,\u201d appeared in the curricula of as many as 40 participants. A further seven were included in the curricula of between 30 and 40 participants. The two topics with the least coverage \u2013 \u201cgeological processes occurring over billions of years\u201d and \u201cthe physical features of Earth\u201d \u2013 were reported in the curriculum of between 20 and 30 participants. The percentages of students taught the topics in the classroom were rather similar, ranging from\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n217\n\n\fCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nExhibit 5.10: Intended and Taught TIMSS Chemistry Topics\n\nChemistry\n\nClassification and composition of matter\n\nProperties of solutions\n\nParticulate structure of matter\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\nProperties and uses of water\n\nStudent population intended to be taught topic through 8th grade\nGrade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic Student population\nintended to be taught topic through 8th grade Grade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic Student population\nintended to be taught topic through 8th grade Grade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic Student population\nintended to be taught topic through 8th grade Grade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic SOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCountries\n\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt\nEstonia\nGhana\nHong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy\nJapan\nJordan\nKorea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway\nPalestinian Nat'l Auth.\nPhilippines Romania Russian Federation Saudi Arabia Scotland Serbia Singapore Slovak Republic Slovenia South Africa Sweden Syrian Arab Republic Tunisia United States \u00b6 England International Avg.

As shown in detail in Exhibit 5.13, the three topics were included for most students in the intended curricula of between 30 and 39 participants. \u201cChanges in environments\u201d and \u201cuse and conservation of natural resources\u201d were included in the curricula of 39 and 38 participants, respectively, and had the greatest percentages of students who were taught them \u2013 53 percent and 56 percent, respectively. \u201cTrends in human population and its effects on the environment\u201d was included in 30 participants\u2019 curricula and was taught to just 38 percent of students, on average.\nAt the fourth grade, 10 of the 32 TIMSS science topics were in life science. As shown in Exhibit 5.14, three of the topics \u2013 \u201ctypes, characteristics, and classi\ufb01cation of living things,\u201d \u201cmajor body structures and their function in humans and other organisms,\u201d and \u201cthe general steps in the life cycle of familiar organisms\u201d \u2013 were included in twothirds or more of participants\u2019 intended curricula and were generally well-covered in the classroom. On average, 82 percent, 77 percent, and 78 percent of students, respectively, were taught these topics. The remaining life science topics were included in fewer participants\u2019 curricula, from a maximum of 17 to a minimum of 13. The average percentage of students taught these topics ranged from 80 percent for \u201cways of maintaining good health, including diet and exercise\u201d to 53 percent for \u201cplant and animal reproduction.\u201d\nAs shown in Exhibit 5.15, the 13 TIMSS physical science topics vary considerably, both in terms of inclusion in the intended curriculum and in being taught in the classroom.

The remaining topics were in the intended curricula of between 13 and 19 participants, with the percentage of students taught the topics ranging from 35 to 69 percent, on average. The topics taught to the least percentages of students were \u201cproperties and uses of metals\u201d (38%) and \u201cforming and separating mixtures\u201d (35%).\nAs described before, earth science topics did not \ufb01gure prominently in the intended fourth-grade science curricula of the participating countries, and they were taught to fewer students than the other science content areas. As shown in Exhibit 5.16, \u201cwater on Earth\u201d was the topic included in the curriculum of most participants (18). Other topics included in the curricula of about half the participants were: \u201crocks, minerals, sand, and soil,\u201d \u201cair,\u201d \u201ccommon features of the Earth\u2019s landscape,\u201d \u201cEarth\u2019s water cycle,\u201d and \u201cweather conditions from day to day or over the seasons.\u201d The percentage of students taught these topics, on average, ranged from 41 percent (rocks, minerals, sand, and soil) to 81 percent (Earth\u2019s water cycle). \u201cFossils of animals and plants\u201d was included in the curriculum of the fewest participants and had the lowest percentage of students taught the topic (27%).\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n231\n\n\fStudent population intended to be taught topic through 4th grade\nGrade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic Student population\nintended to be taught topic through 4th grade Grade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic Student population\nintended to be taught topic through 4th grade Grade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic Student population\nintended to be taught topic through 4th grade Grade(s) topic is intended to be\ntaught Percent of students\ntaught the topic SOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 5: THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM\nExhibit 5.15: Intended and Taught TIMSS Physical Science Topics\n\nPhysical Science\n\nClassification of objects and materials based on physical properties\n\nProperties and uses of metals\n\nForming and separating mixtures\n\nTIMSS2003\n4 SCIENCE\nGrade\nProperties and uses of water\n\nCountries\n\nArmenia Australia Belgium (Flemish) Chinese Taipei Cyprus England Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Iran, Islamic Rep. of Italy\nJapan\nLatvia Lithuania Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Philippines Russian Federation Scotland Singapore Slovenia Tunisia United States Yemen International Avg.

The chapter begins with information about the licensing and/or certi\ufb01cation requirements for teaching science at the eighth and fourth grades in the TIMSS countries. The National Research Coordinators were responsible for providing this information as part of completing the Curriculum Questionnaire.\nThe remaining sections of the chapter include information about the demographic characteristics of the teaching force and about teachers\u2019 educational background and preparation, including opportunities for professional development. To collect information from teachers, TIMSS administered a two-part questionnaire in which teachers were asked to provide information about their background and training and their instructional practices. Chapter 6 essentially presents teachers\u2019 responses to the \ufb01rst part of the questionnaire, while Chapter 7 presents information from the second part about classroom instruction.\nBecause the sampling for the teacher questionnaires was based on participating students, teachers\u2019 responses do not necessarily represent all eighth-grade or all fourth-grade science teachers in each country. Rather, they represent teachers of the representative samples\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n241\n\n\fCHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF SCIENCE\nof students assessed. It is important to note that when information from the teacher questionnaire is being reported, the student is always the unit of analysis. That is, the data shown are the percentages of students whose teachers reported on various characteristics or instructional strategies. Using the student as the unit of analysis makes it possible to describe the instruction received by representative samples of students and the characteristics of the teachers delivering that instruction. Although this perspective may differ from that obtained by simply collecting information from teachers, it is consistent with the TIMSS goals of providing information about the educational contexts and performance of students.\nThe teachers who completed the questionnaires were the science teachers of the students who took the TIMSS 2003 test. At the eighth grade, the general sampling procedure was to sample a mathematics class from each participating school, administer the test to those students, and ask both their mathematics and science teachers to complete the questionnaire. In countries where science is taught as separate subjects, all science subject teachers of the students in the sampled mathematics classes were asked to complete a questionnaire. At the fourth grade, students often only have one teacher for all subjects, so this teacher is their science teacher and the one who completed the questionnaire. In either grade, the information about teachers\u2019 characteristics and instruction is tied directly to the students tested. Sometimes, however, teachers did not complete the questionnaire assigned to them, so most countries had some percentage of students for whom no teacher questionnaire information is available. The exhibits in this chapter have special notations on this point. For a country where teacher responses are available for at least 70 but less than 85 percent of the students, an \u201cr\u201d is included next to its data. Where teacher responses are available for at least 50 but less than 70 percent of the students, an \u201cs\u201d is included. Where teacher responses are available for less than 50 percent, an \u201cx\u201d replaces the data.\n\n242\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF SCIENCE\nWhat Are the Requirements for Being a Science Teacher?\nExhibit 6.1 presents the country-level responses about the requirements for being certi\ufb01ed or licensed to teach science at the eighth and fourth grades. Countries were asked about \ufb01ve requirements, including supervised practical experience (practicum), passing an examination, obtaining a university degree, completion of a probationary period, and completion of an induction program. At the eighth grade, 72 percent of the TIMSS countries (34 out of 47) and three benchmarking entities required a university degree (or equivalent) and just as many participants required ful\ufb01llment of some type of practicum for certi\ufb01cation as a science teacher. In more than half of the countries (30 out of 47) and three of the benchmarking participants, certi\ufb01cation required passing an examination. A probationary period was required in 28 countries and one benchmarking entity. Of the TIMSS countries, nine required completion of an induction program as did one of the benchmarking entities. For the United States and Canada, it should be noted that requirements for certi\ufb01cation vary across states and provinces.\nAt the fourth grade, most of the TIMSS countries (19 out of 26) and two of the benchmarking participants required some type of practicum for certi\ufb01cation. Seventeen of the countries participating at the fourth grade and two of the three benchmarking participants required two or more of the following for certi\ufb01cation \u2013 passing an examination, a university degree, or completion of a probationary a period. Similar to the eighth grade, the fewest number of fourth grade participants required completion of an induction program.\nExhibit 6.2 contains participants\u2019 reports about the organization or authority responsible for granting certi\ufb01cation for science teachers. Across participants at the eighth grade, universities or colleges were most likely to be responsible for granting certi\ufb01cation (70% of the countries and Quebec province). The next most prevalent procedure was for the ministry of education to grant certi\ufb01cation. A handful of participants reported using licensing boards and three (New Zealand, Scotland, and Syria) reported granting certi\ufb01cation through a teacher\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n243\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF SCIENCE\nExhibit 6.1: Current Requirements for Being a Science Teacher\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt England Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

The responses at the fourth grade were similar, with ministries of education and universities/colleges being the organizations most often responsible for granting certi\ufb01cation.\nWhat Are the Background Characteristics of Science teachers?\nExhibit 6.3 presents a considerable amount of information about the background characteristics of science teachers at the eighth and fourth grades, including their gender, age, certi\ufb01cation status, and number of years of teaching experience. Typically, larger percentages of students were taught science by female teachers than male teachers, particularly at the fourth grade. At the eighth grade, on average, internationally, 60 percent of the students were taught science by females and 40 percent by males, and similar percentages were found in a number of countries. However, at least 80 percent of students had female teachers in Armenia, Bulgaria, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, and Slovenia. By contrast, only in Ghana and Japan were as many as 80 percent of the students taught science by male teachers. At the fourth grade, on average, internationally, almost four-\ufb01fths (79%) of the science teaching force was female. Across the participants, in each country with the exception of Tunisia, at least 50 percent, and often a much higher percentage, of the students were taught by female teachers.\nLooking to the last column of Exhibit 6.3, it can be seen that, in general, the science teaching force around the world is quite experienced. Eighth-grade science teachers reported 15 years of teaching experience, on average, internationally, and fourth-grade teachers reported 16 years.\nGiven their years of teaching experience, it follows that the majority of the eighth-grade and the fourth-grade students were taught science by teachers in their 30s and 40s. If there was a steady replenishing of the teaching force, one might expect approximately equivalent percentages of students taught by teachers in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s. Few countries, however, had a comparatively younger teach-\n\n248\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF SCIENCE\ning force at either the eighth or fourth grades. At the eighth grade, on average, internationally, only 20 percent of students were taught by teachers younger than age 30. The four countries with the most students (more than 40 percent) taught by younger teachers were Botswana, Ghana, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. The pattern was very similar at the fourth grade. On average, internationally, 20 percent of the students were taught by teachers younger than 30 years old, and with the exception of Cyprus (48%) and Singapore (45%), this percentage was usually well under 40 percent.\nAt the other end of the age distribution, 22 percent of the eighthgrade students and 21 percent of the fourth-grade students internationally were taught by teachers age 50 or older. At the eighth grade, interestingly, the teaching force was relatively older in some countries. For example, at least half of the students in Italy and Macedonia had teachers at least 50 years of age.\nFinally, from Exhibit 6.3, it can be seen that teachers at both the eighth and fourth grades, reported having full certi\ufb01cation rather than provisional or emergency credentials. Given the potential problem of teacher shortages for a variety of reasons, it is interesting to note that, on average, internationally, 87 percent of the eighth-grade students and 84 percent of the fourth-grade students were taught science by certi\ufb01ed teachers. Of course, the situation varied dramatically across the TIMSS countries. For example, in Lebanon, only 45 percent of the eighth-grade students and in Tunisia only 21 percent of the fourthgrade students were taught science by a fully certi\ufb01ed teacher.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS

Even though the percentages were somewhat higher at the eighth grade than the fourth grade, approximately two-thirds of the eighth- and fourth-grade students were taught science by teachers having at least a university degree or equivalent. At the eighth grade, 57 percent of the students were taught by teachers with a university degree and another 22 percent by teachers who had coursework beyond the initial university degree. At the fourth grade, 52 percent of the students were taught by teachers with a university degree and another 13 percent by teachers with coursework beyond that degree.\nDespite a relatively well-educated teaching force, on average, the situation varied dramatically among countries. At the eighth grade, for example, at least half the students were taught by teachers with work beyond the initial university degree in Armenia, Australia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, Tunisia, the United States, and the Basque Country, Spain. In contrast, 44 percent of the eighth-grade students in Morocco and 25 percent in Malaysia were taught by teachers only having completed secondary school.\nAccording to the results of the Curriculum Questionnaire, almost all of the students participating in TIMSS 2003 were supposed to be learning science according to a national (for most countries) or regional curriculum. To gather some information about coherence between the intended curriculum and teacher preparation, the Curriculum Questionnaire also asked about speci\ufb01c teacher training in how to teach this curriculum \u2013 as part of either teachers\u2019 pre-service or inservice education. Exhibit 6.5 has the results. The majority of countries\n\n252\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF SCIENCE\nand benchmarking participants reported preparation in how to teach the intended curriculum as part of both pre- and in-service training, and most reported coverage in at least one of these places. Countries reporting no speci\ufb01c training in how to teach the intended curriculum included Chile, Korea, Moldova, Norway, and Sweden.\nTeachers\u2019 reports about their major area or areas of study during their postsecondary education also can be found in Exhibit 6.5. At the eighth grade, on average, internationally, most students (82%) had teachers who studied a science subject \u2013 biology, physics, chemistry, or earth science. Science education was also a popular option, with 37 percent of students, on average, taught by teachers with science education as a major. Less common majors for science teachers were general education (taken by teachers of 25 percent of students) and mathematics (taken by teachers of 20 percent of students). Teachers often reported that their study was focused in more than one area. For example, it was not uncommon for teachers in some countries to report pedagogy as a major area of study and a science subject as another major area. As might be considered, the situation was different at the fourth grade. Here teachers typically studied primary or elementary education (approximately 80 percent, on average, of fourth-grade students had such teachers). On average, for the primary education majors, about one-fourth (23%) of students were taught by teachers who specialized in science, 7 percent in mathematics, and half (50%) not having any particular specialization. In Latvia and the Russian Federation, more than half the fourth-grade students were being taught by science specialists.\nTo provide more information about the branches of science that science teachers studied during their postsecondary education, Exhibit 6.6 presents the percentage of eighth-grade students whose teachers reported majoring in biology, physics, chemistry, or earth science. Teachers could major in more than one of these subjects, and the percentages in the exhibit re\ufb02ect this. Biology was the most popular science major, followed by chemistry, physics, and earth science.

To provide context for considering this important part of teacher training in the TIMSS countries, Exhibits 6.7 through 6.9 contain information about teachers\u2019 opportunities for and participation in professional development activities.\nExhibit 6.7 presents schools\u2019 reports about the opportunities provided to teachers in \ufb01ve major areas: supporting implementation of the of\ufb01cial curriculum, supporting school-level goals, improving content knowledge, improving teaching skills, and using technology. Within each area, schools reported the frequency of teachers\u2019 involvement. At both grades, schools reported that their professional development programs emphasized improving content knowledge and teaching skills. About 80 percent of the students were taught science by teachers having a least some professional development training in these areas.\nExhibit 6.8 presents teachers\u2019 reports about their professional development participation in six different aspects of science teaching. The results were relatively consistent across the six topics \u2013 content, pedagogy, curriculum, technology, critical thinking/inquiry skills, and assessment. At the eighth grade, from 45 to 58 percent of the students, on average, internationally, were taught by teachers having participated in professional development in the area during the past two years. The highest percentage (58%) was for science content. At the fourth grade, on average, the percentages were somewhat lower, ranging from 27 to 37 percent. The highest percentages were for content and pedagogy (37% each). The lowest percentage was for integrating information technology into science (27%).\nBecause opportunities for professional development do not necessarily have to be structured by the school, teachers also were asked\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n259\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF SCIENCE\nExhibit 6.7: Professional Development Opportunities for Teachers in Mathematics and Science\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nPercentage of Students by Their School\u2019s Report of Teachers\u2019 Involvement in Professional Development Opportunities in Mathematics and Science\n\nCountries\n\nSupporting the Implementation of the National or Regional Curriculum\n\nDesigning or Supporting the School's Own Improvement Goals\n\n3 Times or More a Year\n\nArmenia\n\nr\n\nAustralia\n\nBahrain\n\nBelgium (Flemish)\n\nBotswana\n\nBulgaria\n\nChile\n\nChinese Taipei\n\nCyprus\n\nEgypt\n\nEstonia\n\nGhana\n\nHong Kong, SAR\n\nHungary\n\nIndonesia\n\nIran, Islamic Rep. of\n\nIsrael\n\nItaly\n\nJapan\n\nJordan\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nLatvia\n\nLebanon\n\nLithuania\n\nMacedonia, Rep. of\n\nMalaysia\n\nMoldova, Rep. of\n\nr\n\nMorocco\n\ns\n\nNetherlands\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNorway\n\nPalestinian Nat'l Auth.\n\nPhilippines\n\nRomania\n\nRussian Federation\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nScotland\n\ns\n\nSerbia\n\nSingapore\n\nSlovak Republic\n\nSlovenia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSweden\n\nTunisia\n\nUnited States\n\n\u00b6 England\n\ns\n\nInternational Avg.\n\nBenchmarking Participants\n\nBasque Country, Spain\n\nIndiana State, US\n\nOntario Province, Can.\n\nQuebec Province, Can.\n\n4 (1.8) 48 (5.0) 60 (0.2) 11 (2.7) 30 (4.3) 2 (1.1) 27 (4.0) 11 (2.8) 10 (0.2) 88 (2.7) 20 (3.6) 17 (3.7) 47 (4.6) 15 (3.1) 16 (3.2) 20 (3.4) 91 (2.0) 28 (3.4) 15 (3.1) 39 (4.2) 9 (2.3) 11 (3.0) 24 (3.9) 5 (2.1) 26 (4.1) 49 (4.3) 40 (4.9) 12 (3.7) 2 (1.2) 41 (5.3) 10 (2.5) 56 (4.4) 58 (3.9) 61 (4.1) 16 (2.9) 20 (4.2) 33 (5.8) 13 (2.8) 56 (0.0) 13 (3.1) 58 (4.3) 55 (3.6) 11 (2.6) 27 (3.6) 63 (3.6) 68 (6.0) 31 (0.5)\n20 (4.4) 64 (5.5) 31 (4.6) 15 (3.5)\n\n1-2 Times a Year\n34 (4.2) 38 (5.1) 23 (0.2) 67 (4.2) 38 (4.7) 30 (4.2) 55 (4.7) 46 (4.3) 90 (0.2) 8 (2.4) 62 (4.0) 33 (4.4) 46 (4.4) 32 (3.7) 34 (4.4) 48 (4.1) 6 (1.8) 34 (3.5) 28 (3.8) 41 (4.1) 73 (3.8) 42 (4.7) 37 (4.6) 35 (4.1) 54 (4.0) 43 (4.3) 46 (4.9) 24 (5.1) 43 (4.5) 53 (5.3) 43 (5.2) 33 (3.7) 38 (4.1) 25 (3.6) 63 (3.5) 27 (4.0) 60 (5.7) 33 (3.7) 42 (0.0) 38 (4.8) 38 (4.1) 27 (3.4) 41 (4.4) 26 (3.5) 34 (3.5) 27 (5.9) 40 (0.6)\n23 (4.4) 31 (5.7) 58 (4.8) 51 (4.8)\n\nNever\n63 (4.5) 14 (2.9) 16 (0.1) 22 (3.7) 32 (3.8) 68 (4.3) 19 (3.4) 43 (4.2) 0 (0.0) 3 (1.5) 18 (3.3) 50 (5.1) 7 (2.5) 53 (3.8) 50 (4.7) 32 (3.7) 3 (1.2) 38 (3.5) 57 (4.3) 20 (3.3) 18 (3.6) 46 (5.0) 39 (4.0) 60 (4.3) 20 (3.3) 8 (2.0) 14 (3.5) 64 (5.1) 56 (4.6) 5 (2.4) 47 (5.1) 11 (2.9) 4 (1.7) 14 (3.1) 22 (4.9) 54 (5.4) 7 (3.0) 54 (4.0) 2 (0.0) 49 (4.4) 4 (1.7) 18 (2.4) 49 (4.6) 47 (4.1) 4 (1.4) 4 (2.1) 29 (0.5)\n57 (5.4) 5 (3.1) 11 (2.8) 34 (4.3)\n\n3 Times or More a Year\n\nr\n\n21 (4.6)\n\n60 (4.5)\n\n66 (0.2)\n\n12 (3.2)\n\n43 (4.7)\n\n11 (2.8)\n\n50 (3.8)\n\n43 (4.3)\n\n50 (0.3)\n\n88 (2.4)\n\n25 (3.6)\n\n45 (4.3)\n\n44 (5.1)\n\n69 (3.5)\n\n26 (4.0)\n\n31 (4.1)\n\n81 (3.7)\n\n35 (3.7)\n\n31 (3.8)\n\n41 (4.6)\n\n9 (2.1)\n\n28 (3.4)\n\n38 (4.2)\n\n53 (4.6)\n\n41 (4.3)\n\n55 (4.2)\n\nr\n\n50 (5.1)\n\ns\n\n2 (1.8)\n\n23 (4.1)\n\n47 (5.8)\n\n10 (2.8)\n\n58 (4.3)\n\n70 (3.7)\n\n78 (3.4)\n\n17 (2.7)\n\n37 (5.2)\n\ns\n\n55 (5.6)\n\n46 (4.4)\n\n67 (0.0)\n\n7 (2.0)\n\n39 (4.5)\n\n49 (3.2)\n\n17 (3.1)\n\n31 (4.1)\n\n72 (3.0)\n\ns\n\n46 (7.6)\n\n42 (0.6)\n\n49 (5.1) 67 (6.7) 40 (4.8) 24 (4.5)\n\n1-2 Times a Year\n35 (4.8) 35 (4.3) 19 (0.1) 62 (4.5) 42 (4.7) 36 (4.2) 39 (3.8) 46 (4.1) 47 (0.3) 9 (2.0) 46 (4.5) 29 (4.4) 51 (5.1) 28 (3.6) 49 (4.3) 43 (3.9) 17 (3.4) 38 (3.7) 40 (3.8) 40 (3.6) 55 (3.9) 59 (4.0) 34 (4.2) 45 (4.6) 44 (3.6) 40 (4.1) 42 (4.8) 32 (5.3) 52 (5.0) 48 (6.2) 36 (4.5) 32 (4.3) 26 (3.4) 17 (3.0) 60 (4.6) 28 (4.2) 42 (5.4) 38 (4.2) 31 (0.0) 27 (3.9) 58 (4.4) 33 (3.2) 52 (4.0) 33 (4.4) 25 (3.0) 48 (7.4) 39 (0.6)\n26 (5.0) 32 (6.7) 53 (4.9) 45 (5.1)\n\nNever\n44 (4.7) 4 (1.9) 16 (0.1) 26 (3.9) 15 (3.0) 53 (4.5) 11 (2.3) 11 (2.7) 3 (0.0) 3 (1.2) 29 (4.3) 26 (3.5) 5 (2.0) 3 (1.5) 25 (4.0) 25 (3.3) 2 (1.3) 27 (3.4) 29 (3.8) 19 (3.6) 36 (3.7) 13 (2.9) 28 (3.7) 2 (1.2) 15 (3.2) 5 (2.0) 8 (2.7) 66 (5.6) 25 (4.2) 5 (2.1) 54 (4.6) 10 (2.5) 4 (1.9) 5 (2.0) 24 (4.3) 35 (5.4) 3 (2.0) 17 (3.2) 2 (0.0) 65 (4.0) 3 (1.3) 18 (3.0) 30 (4.1) 37 (4.2) 3 (1.4) 6 (3.0) 20 (0.5)\n25 (4.6) 1 (0.0) 8 (2.6) 30 (4.6)\n\nBackground data provided by schools. \u00b6 Did not satisfy guidelines for sample participation rates (see Exhibit A.9).

More speci\ufb01cally, they were asked about discussing teaching strategies for particular concepts, preparing instructional materials, and classroom observations. As shown in Exhibit 6.9, on average, the results for the TIMSS participants were consistent across grades. Teachers of most students (80% or more) reported weekly or monthly interaction about instructional issues. In contrast, observing other teachers or being observed themselves was relatively infrequent (63% never).\nHow Ready Do Teachers Think They Are to Teach Science?\nTIMSS 2003 asked teachers how ready they felt to teach the science topics included in the TIMSS 2003 science assessment. Across the \ufb01ve major content areas (life science, chemistry, physics, earth science, and environmental science), the eighth-grade teachers were asked about 21 topics (sub-areas). Exhibit 6.10 contains teachers\u2019 reports, indicating that the teachers of almost all the eighth-grade students felt ready to teach nearly all the topics. On average, internationally, the results ranged from 86 to 97 percent, with the results above 90 percent for all but the three earth science topics (Earth\u2019s structure and physical features; Earth\u2019s processes, cycles, and history; and Earth in the solar system and the universe) and two of the three environmental science topics (trends in human population and its effects on the environment; and changes in environments).\nAlthough in most countries essentially all students were taught the topics in the basic science subjects \u2013 life science, chemistry, and physics \u2013 by teachers who felt ready to teach the topics, there were some notable exceptions, including Morocco, for all three subjects, and the Philippines and Tunisia for chemistry and physics. Also, teachers in Singapore and Sweden felt somewhat less ready to teach the topics in biology than in the other two subjects, and teachers in Belgium (Flemish) less ready to teach the physics topics. Among the benchmarking participants, Quebec teachers felt somewhat less ready to teach the biology topics and the majority of topics in chemistry and physics. Con-\n\n272\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 6: TEACHERS OF SCIENCE\nsistent with information presented in Chapter 5 showing that topics in earth science and environmental science were included less often in the intended curricula of TIMSS participants and taught less often to the students, teachers in many countries reported that they felt less ready to teach these than the other science subjects.\nAt the fourth grade, teachers felt generally less well-prepared. Teachers were asked about 19 science topics, with the results ranging from 66 to 94 percent, on average, internationally. The results were above 90 percent for 8 of the 19 topics: two of the six life science topics (relationships in a living community and changes in environments), two of the seven physical science topics (states of matter and differences in their physical properties; and common energy sources and forms and their practical uses), and four of six earth science topics (features on Earth\u2019s landscape; water on Earth; air; and common features of Earth\u2019s landscape and their relationship to human use). However, results dipped below 70 percent for three topics: reproduction and development in plants and animals (life science - 66%); forming and separating mixtures (physical science \u2013 66%); and fossils of animals and plants (earth science \u2013 69%).\nIn every country, there were at least some fourth-grade science topics that teachers indicated they were less ready to teach. However, in Belgium (Flemish), the Netherlands, and Quebec, for all topics in both life science and physical science and the majority in earth science, the percentage of students taught by teachers ready to teach the topics was below 90 percent. For Japan, this was true also for all topics in earth science.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n273\n\n\fMajor organs and organ systems in humans and\nother organisms Cells and their functions, including respiration and\nphotosynthesis as cellular processes Reproduction and\nheredity Role of variation and\nadaptation in survival/extinction\nof species in a changing environment\nInteraction of living organisms\nand the physical environment in an ecosystem.

To provide information about the environment of science classrooms and the instruction that takes place, Chapter 7 presents teachers\u2019 reports from the second part of the teacher questionnaire about their science classrooms and instructional practices, as well as students\u2019 reports about the classroom activities they do in learning science. Data are presented about class size, various limitations on instruction, instructional time, instructional emphases given different science topics, and science investigations. Information also is presented about textbook use, classroom activities, the use of computers in science lessons, the role of homework, and the reliance on different types of assessment approaches.\nTeachers and the instructional approaches they use ultimately determine the science students learn. Teachers structure the content and pace of lessons, introducing new material, selecting various instructional activities, and monitoring students\u2019 developing understanding of the science concepts being studied. Teachers may help students use technology and tools to investigate scienti\ufb01c ideas, analyze students\u2019 work for misconceptions, and promote positive attitudes\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n281\n\n\fCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\ntoward science. They may also assign homework and conduct informal as well as formal assessments to evaluate achievement outcomes.\nHow Do the Characteristics of Science Classrooms Impact Instruction?\nBecause it can affect pedagogical strategies, class size data are shown in Exhibit 7.1. Teachers\u2019 reports about the sizes of their eighth-grade science classes reveal that across countries the average class size was 31 students, but there was considerable variation \u2013 from more than 54 students in the Philippines to 20 students in Belgium (Flemish). At the fourth grade, classes typically were smaller. The average class size for the TIMSS participants was 26 students, ranging from 40 in the Philippines to 20 in Belgium (Flemish), Italy, and Slovenia.\nThe relationship between class size and achievement is dif\ufb01cult to disentangle, given the variety of policies and practices that countries have in determining class size. For example, countries and schools cannot always control class size. Because of this, the ability to cap class sizes can indicate the availability of more resources in general. As another complicating factor, smaller classes can be used for advanced or practical classes such as computer or science laboratories on one hand, and for remedial learning or students with special needs on the other. The complexity of this issue is evidenced in the TIMSS results that show a curvilinear relationship, on average, between class size and science achievement at both the eighth and fourth grades.\nAt the eighth grade, science teachers were asked about the instructional impact of six characteristics of their students \u2013 differing academic abilities, range in backgrounds, students with special needs, uninterested students, low morale among students, and disruptive students. Responses were given on a four-point scale; \u201cnot at all,\u201d \u201ca little,\u201d \u201csome,\u201d and \u201ca lot.\u201d TIMSS used the teachers\u2019 responses to construct an index and the results are presented in Exhibit 7.2. Students were placed in the high category, if, on average, teachers reported their classrooms were impacted only a little (or less) and in the low category, if,\n\n282\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\non average, these factors impacted instruction at least somewhat. The remaining students fell in the medium category. The results show that average science achievement is related to the impact of student characteristics on classroom instruction, with lower achievement related to having more instructionally challenging and diverse students in the class. On average, internationally, 21 percent of the students were in such classrooms.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n283\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 7.1: Class Size for Science Instruction\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

Since different systems have school years of different lengths and different arrangements of weekly and daily instruction, the comparisons are given in terms of the average number of hours of science instruction over the school year as reported by science teachers. At the eighth grade, results are presented \ufb01rst for countries teaching science as a single subject and then by science subject for countries teaching the sciences separately.\nIn general, students in countries with separate science subjects had more total instructional hours in the sciences. Since these students study all of the subjects offered, the total time is the sum of the hours reported by each subject area teacher. Based on these sums, instructional hours for students with separate science courses ranged from 120 hours in Latvia (where students took biology and physics only) to 284 hours in the Slovak Republic (where students took all four science subjects). Not surprisingly, the countries offering all four subjects were those with the most instructional time. All of these were from central or eastern Europe, and in addition to the Slovak Republic, included Bulgaria (245 hours), Estonia (259 hours), Hungary (235 hours), Lithuania (230 hours), Macedonia (255 hours), Romania (232 hours), and Serbia (223 hours). Among countries teaching science as a single subject, instructional time ranged from 69 hours in Italy to 202 in the Philippines, with an international average of 117 hours.\nThe percentage of instructional time at the eighth grade that was devoted to science ranged from 18 percent in the Philippines to 7 percent in Norway for single science countries. Among countries teaching separate science subjects, the percentage was between 6 and 7 percent for each subject. Combining these percentages gives a range from 13 percent for Latvia to 30 percent for the Slovak Republic.\nAt the fourth grade, countries devote less instructional time to science than at the eighth grade, in terms of both the total instructional\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n287\n\n\fCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\nhours and the percentage devoted to instruction. Total instructional time for science ranged from 33 hours in the Russian Federation to 176 in the Philippines. The \ufb01gure for the Philippines was almost twice that for the next highest, the Canadian province of Ontario (93 hours). The percentage of instructional time at the fourth grade that was devoted to science ranged from 3 percent in Netherlands to 16 percent in the Philippines.\nExhibit 7.4 provides teachers\u2019 reports about how instructional time in science is allocated across the \ufb01ve major content areas assessed by TIMSS 2003. At the eighth grade, on average, internationally, the greatest percentage of science instructional time was devoted to life science (27%). Next were physics (24%) and then chemistry (21%). Earth science was given 13 percent, environmental science 9 percent, and other topics 5 percent. At the fourth grade, with fewer content areas, the pro\ufb01le was different. Again, life science received the largest amount of instructional time \u2013 41 percent, on average, internationally. Earth science was given 28 percent, physical science 24 percent, and other 8 percent.\n\n288\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\n\nExhibit 7.3\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n289\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 7.3: Instructional Time in the Sciences\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nGeneral/ Integrated Science\nd Philippines United States Jordan New Zealand Australia Sweden Malaysia Bahrain Chile Singapore Saudi Arabia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Hong Kong, SAR Korea, Rep. of Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

To examine the emphasis placed on that goal in the classroom, TIMSS asked eighth-grade students and teachers about how often students were asked to do a range of activities related to science investigations. At the eighth grade, these activities were: 1) watching the teacher demonstrate an experiment or investigation, 2) designing or planning experiments or investigations, 3) conducting experiments or investigations, 4) working in small groups on experiments or investigations, 5) writing explanations about what was observed and why it happened, and 6) relating what is being learned in science to our daily lives. Exhibits 7.5 and 7.6 present students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 reports, respectively. Results at the eighth grade are presented \ufb01rst for countries teaching science as a single subject and then by science subject for countries teaching the sciences separately.\nIn most of the integrated-science countries, students reported a moderate emphasis on doing these types of activities in science class. About two-thirds, on average, internationally, said that, in at least half their lessons, they were asked to write explanations about what was observed and why it happened (66%) or watch the teacher demonstrate an experiment or investigation (64%). More than half reported working in small groups on experiments or investigations (59%), conducting experiments or investigations (57%), or relating what is being learned in science to their daily lives (57%). Students reported the least attention to designing or planning an experiment or investigation (49%). Among countries teaching the sciences as separate subjects, students reported watching the teacher demonstrate an experiment or investigation most frequently in chemistry and physics class (63% and 58%, on average, respectively), and much less so in biology (39%) and earth science (28%). Relating what is being learned in science to their daily lives was reported by students in biology and earth science classes as the most frequent activity (51%, on average).\n\n296\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\nAt fourth grade, most students reported that they watch the teacher do a science experiment and write or give an explanation for something they are studying in science once or twice a month or more (69%, on average, for each activity). More than half the students (57%) reported working with other students in small groups on a science experiment or investigation, and 50 percent reported either designing or planning a science experiment or investigation or actually doing such an activity.\nOn average, internationally, teachers at both grade levels reported less emphasis on students watching them demonstrate an experiment or investigation than did the students. For example, at eighth grade in integrated science countries, teachers of only 38 percent of the students reported asking their students to watch them demonstrate an experiment or investigation in at least half the lessons, whereas 64 percent of student reported this activity at this frequency. Similarly at fourth grade, teachers of only 23 percent of students reported asking them to do this activity, while 69 percent of students reported doing so.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n297\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 7.5: Students\u2019 Reports on Doing Science Investigations\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nGeneral/ Integrated Science Australia Bahrain Botswana Chile a Chinese Taipei Egypt Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Malaysia Morocco New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth. d Philippines Saudi Arabia Scotland Singapore South Africa Tunisia United States \u00b6 England International Avg.

On average, internationally, more than half of the eighth- and fourth-grade students (56%) had teachers who reported using a textbook as the primary basis of their lessons. For another 39 percent of the eighth-grade students and 26 percent of the fourth-grade students, teachers reported using textbooks as a supplementary resource. Teaching science without the aid of a textbook was more common at fourth grade, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, where more than three-fourths (79% and 83%, respectively) of students were taught in this way.\nExhibit 7.8 presents a pro\ufb01le of the activities most commonly encountered in science classes around the world, as reported by science teachers. At the eighth grade, the three most predominant activities, accounting for 57 percent of class time, on average, internationally, were teacher lecture (24% of class time), teacher-guided student practice (19%), and students working on problems on their own (14%).\n\n306\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\n\nExhibit 7.7\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n307\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 7.7: Texbook Use in Teaching Science\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\n\nArmenia\n\nr\n\nAustralia\n\nr\n\nBahrain\n\nBelgium (Flemish)\n\nBotswana\n\nBulgaria\n\nr\n\nChile\n\nChinese Taipei\n\nCyprus\n\nEgypt\n\nEstonia\n\nGhana\n\nHong Kong, SAR\n\nHungary\n\nIndonesia\n\ns\n\nIran, Islamic Rep. of\n\nIsrael\n\nItaly\n\nJapan\n\nJordan\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\ns\n\nLatvia\n\nr\n\nLebanon\n\nLithuania\n\nMacedonia, Rep. of\n\nMalaysia\n\nMoldova, Rep. of\n\nr\n\nMorocco\n\nNetherlands\n\nr\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNorway\n\nPalestinian Nat'l Auth.\n\nPhilippines\n\nRomania\n\nRussian Federation\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nScotland\n\ns\n\nSerbia\n\nSingapore\n\nSlovak Republic\n\nSlovenia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nr\n\nSweden\n\nTunisia\n\nUnited States\n\nr\n\n\u00b6 England\n\ns\n\nInternational Avg.\n\nBenchmarking Participants\n\nBasque Country, Spain\n\nIndiana State, US\n\nOntario Province, Can.\n\nQuebec Province, Can. r\n\nPercentage of Students Taught by Teachers Reporting Textbook Use\n\nDo Not Use Textbook to Teach Science\n5 (1.1) 19 (3.1) 0 (0.0) 14 (2.4) 5 (2.0) 2 (0.5) 6 (1.7) 4 (1.7) 2 (0.5) 1 (0.6) 0 (0.2) 8 (2.5) 1 (0.9) 0 (0.0) 54 (4.7) 8 (2.0) 5 (1.7) 1 (0.8) 2 (1.0) 0 (0.0) 4 (1.4) 1 (0.7) 5 (1.6) 0 (0.0) 5 (1.1) 13 (2.7) 2 (0.8) 0 (0.0) 1 (0.6) 15 (4.0) 0 (0.0) 1 (0.0) 8 (2.4) 0 (0.2) 0 (0.2) 1 (0.0) 10 (2.0) 1 (0.5) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.3) 1 (0.4) 8 (2.3) 3 (1.2) 3 (1.4) 7 (1.7) 9 (2.7) 5 (0.2)\n\nUse Textbook to Teach Science\n\nAs Primary Basis for Lessons\n72 (2.6) 31 (4.4) 67 (2.6) 43 (2.9) 25 (4.0) 75 (2.3) 21 (3.1) 82 (3.4) 62 (1.1) 67 (4.0) 80 (2.3) 34 (4.5) 91 (2.8) 66 (2.2) 21 (3.9) 81 (2.9) 45 (4.0) 63 (3.5) 62 (3.9) 68 (3.9) 79 (2.9) 43 (2.3) 49 (4.0) 100 (0.0) 63 (3.0) 44 (3.9) 86 (2.0) 12 (3.0) 92 (1.9) 11 (3.2) 87 (2.3) 71 (3.8) 52 (4.7) 71 (2.3) 67 (3.2) 79 (4.6) 30 (4.3) 64 (2.2) 73 (2.4) 63 (2.6) 59 (3.3) 36 (3.3) 40 (3.2) 13 (2.8) 39 (3.4) 18 (3.9) 56 (0.5)\n\nAs Supplementary Resource\n23 (2.5) 50 (3.8) 33 (2.6) 43 (2.4) 70 (4.2) 23 (2.3) 74 (3.4) 14 (3.2) 36 (1.0) 33 (4.1) 20 (2.2) 58 (4.7) 8 (2.6) 34 (2.2) 24 (4.4) 12 (2.4) 50 (3.7) 36 (3.6) 37 (3.9) 32 (3.9) 18 (2.8) 56 (2.4) 46 (3.7) 0 (0.0) 32 (3.0) 43 (3.8) 12 (2.0) 88 (3.0) 7 (1.7) 74 (5.0) 13 (2.3) 28 (3.7) 41 (4.6) 29 (2.3) 33 (3.2) 20 (4.6) 61 (4.1) 34 (2.3) 27 (2.4) 37 (2.7) 41 (3.3) 56 (3.5) 58 (3.2) 84 (3.1) 54 (3.7) 72 (4.3) 39 (0.5)\n\n5 (1.8) 2 (1.4) 4 (2.1) 11 (3.1)\n\n74 (4.8) 48 (5.6) 43 (4.4) 38 (5.2)\n\n21 (4.5) 50 (5.8) 53 (4.7) 51 (5.0)\n\nBackground data provided by teachers. \u00b6 Did not satisfy guidelines for sample participation rates (see Exhibit A.9).

Across countries, 25 participants at the eighth grade and 12 at the fourth grade reported that their science curriculum contained statements about computer use and yet access to computers remains a challenge in many countries. Teachers reported that, on average, internationally, computers were not available for 62 percent of the eighthgrade students and 54 percent of the fourth-grade students. Beyond that, using computers as often as in half the lessons was extremely rare at either grade, even in countries with relatively high availability. Korea was the only country where a substantial percentage of students used a computer regularly for doing scienti\ufb01c procedures or experiments (32%) or studying natural phenomena through simulations (28%).\n\n312\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 7.9: Computer Use in Science Class\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

Exhibit 7.10 presents the index of teachers\u2019 emphasis on science homework. Students in the high category had teachers who reported giving relatively long homework assignments (more than 30 minutes) on a relatively frequent basis (in about half the lessons or more). Those in the low category had teachers who gave short assignments (less than 30 minutes) relatively infrequently (in about half the lessons or less). The medium level includes all other possible combinations of responses.\nThe results show considerable variation across countries in the emphasis placed on homework. At the eighth grade, more than 40 percent of the students in Italy and Malaysia were in the high category. For the majority of countries, most students were in the medium (41%, on average) and low (44%, on average) categories. Seventy percent or more of the students were in the low category in Serbia, Tunisia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Korea, Scotland, Japan, Belgium (Flemish), and the Slovak Republic. It can be noted, however, that students in Japan and perhaps Korea may be more likely to spend extra time in tutoring and special schools than doing homework.1 At the fourth grade, teachers reported giving science homework much less frequently than at eighth grade. On average, internationally, only 6 percent of the fourthgrade students were in the high category. About one-fourth were in the medium category and almost 70 percent were in the low category. Students in the high category at both grade levels had the lowest science achievement, on average, suggesting that homework often was being used for remedial purposes.\nExhibit 7.11 presents eighth-grade teachers\u2019 reports about how they usually use homework in their science instruction. Internationally, the eighth-grade science teachers reported always or almost always monitoring whether homework was completed (for 76 percent of the students, on average). For more than half (62%) of the eighth-grade\n1 Robitaille, D.F., (1997), National Contexts for Mathematics and Science Education: An Encyclopedia of the Education Systems Participating in TIMSS, Vancouver, BC: Paci\ufb01c Educational Press.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n315\n\n\fCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\nstudents, on average, teachers reported always or almost always correcting assignments and giving feedback to students, but for about one-fourth, on average, the students corrected their own homework in class. One-fourth of the students, on average, had teachers that reported using homework as basis for class discussion and almost onethird to contribute toward grades or marks (31%).\nAs shown in Exhibit 7.12, eighth-grade teachers reported substantial variation across countries in the frequency of testing in science class. On average, internationally, about one-third of the students (32%) reported having a science test or examination every two weeks or more and another 43 percent reported such testing about once a month. Testing every two weeks or more for most students (80% or more) was reported by eighth-grade teachers in Bahrain, Chinese Taipei, Egypt, and the Philippines. Even though the international average was relatively low (25%) for infrequent testing, there were countries where teachers reported testing only a few times a year or more for half or more of the eighth-grade students, including Bulgaria, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Japan, Norway, Serbia, Slovenia, and Sweden.\nExhibit 7.13 presents eighth-grade teachers\u2019 reports about the types of test formats they use for science tests in relation to average science achievement. On average, internationally, more than half the eighth-grade students (60%) had teachers who used constructedresponse and multiple-choice formats for their tests or examinations in about equal proportions. More than one-fourth (28%) had teachers who used only or mostly constructed-response science tests. Very few students (13%, on average) had teachers who reported using only or mostly multiple-choice testing. These students had lower science achievement, on average, than did students whose teachers used some constructed-response and multiple-choice items or only constructedresponse items.\n\n316\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 7: CLASSROOM CHARACTERISTICS AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 7.10: Index of Teachers' Emphasis on Science Homework (ESH)\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nIndex of Teachers' Emphasis on Science Homework\nIndex based on teachers' responses to two questions about how often they usually assign science homework and how many minutes of science homework they usually assign.

Information is presented about the economic status of the student body, the extent of school resources in each country, the school climate, attendance problems, and school safety.\nWhat Are the Schools\u2019 Demographic Characteristics? Exhibit 8.1 presents principals\u2019 reports about the economic background of the students in their schools. Internationally, about one-\ufb01fth of the eighth grade students (22%), on average, attended schools with few students (less than 10 percent) from economically disadvantaged homes, 26 percent attended schools with 11 to 25 percent disadvantaged students, 21 percent attended schools with 26 to 50 percent economically disadvantaged students, and 31 percent attended schools with more than 50 percent economically disadvantaged students. There was considerable variation across countries, however. In some countries more than half the students (52 to 85%) attended schools where the majority of the students came from disadvantaged homes, including Chile, Ghana, Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, the Palestinian National Authority, the Philippines, South Africa, and Tunisia.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n323\n\n\fCHAPTER 8: SCHOOL CONTEXTS FOR LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION\nAt the fourth grade across the participating countries, 34 percent of the students, on average, attended schools with few students (less 10 percent) from economically disadvantaged homes, 25 percent attended schools with 11 to 25 percent disadvantaged students, 18 percent attended schools with 26 to 50 percent economically disadvantaged students, and 24 percent attended schools with more than 50 percent economically disadvantaged students. Among the countries participating at the fourth grade, 75 percent of the students in Morocco attended schools where the majority of the students came from disadvantaged homes, but it was the only one where more than half the students attended such schools.\nAt the eighth grade, on average, internationally, science achievement for students in schools with few students from economically disadvantaged homes was 51 scale-score points greater than that for students attending schools with more than half their student population from disadvantaged homes (500 vs. 449). At the fourth grade, this difference also was substantial \u2013 43 points (505 vs. 462).\n\n324\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 8: SCHOOL CONTEXTS FOR LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 8.1: Principals' Reports on the Percentages of Students in Their Schools Coming from Economically Disadvantaged Homes\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

The results are presented in Exhibit 8.2. At both the eighth and fourth grades, the common activities across countries were attending special events (89% and 91 %, respectively) and ensuring that homework was completed (87% and 91%, respectively). Also at both grades, expecting parents to volunteer for school projects was the next activity schools expected on a relatively frequent basis (71% and 82%, respectively), followed by serving on committees (62% and 68%) and raising funds for the school (57% and 64%).\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n327\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 8: SCHOOL CONTEXTS FOR LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 8.2: Schools' Expectations for Parents' Involvement\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nPercentages of Students Whose Schools Reported That They Expect Parents to Be Involved in the School-Related Activity\n\nCountries\n\nAttend Special Events (e.g., Science Fair,\nConcert, Sporting Events)\n\nRaise Funds for the School\n\nArmenia\n\nr\n\n94 (2.5)\n\nr\n\nAustralia\n\n96 (1.0)\n\nBahrain\n\n81 (0.2)\n\nBelgium (Flemish)\n\n65 (4.4)\n\nBotswana\n\n93 (2.6)\n\nBulgaria\n\n93 (2.2)\n\nChile\n\n93 (2.1)\n\nChinese Taipei\n\n99 (0.7)\n\nCyprus\n\n100 (0.0)\n\nEgypt\n\n78 (3.4)\n\nEstonia\n\n98 (1.1)\n\nGhana\n\n93 (2.5)\n\nHong Kong, SAR\n\n93 (2.5)\n\nHungary\n\n85 (3.1)\n\nIndonesia\n\n89 (2.6)\n\nIran, Islamic Rep. of\n\n91 (2.2)\n\nIsrael\n\n96 (1.8)\n\nItaly\n\n97 (1.3)\n\nJapan\n\n95 (1.7)\n\nJordan\n\n89 (3.0)\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\n83 (3.5)\n\nLatvia\n\n91 (2.7)\n\nLebanon\n\n68 (4.0)\n\nLithuania\n\n99 (0.7)\n\nMacedonia, Rep. of\n\n93 (2.2)\n\nMalaysia\n\n93 (2.0)\n\nMoldova, Rep. of\n\nr\n\n74 (4.6)\n\nr\n\nMorocco\n\ns\n\n87 (3.8)\n\ns\n\nNetherlands\n\n58 (4.8)\n\nNew Zealand\n\n88 (3.8)\n\nNorway\n\n89 (2.4)\n\nPalestinian Nat'l Auth.\n\n95 (1.9)\n\nPhilippines\n\n91 (2.6)\n\nRomania\n\n80 (3.8)\n\nRussian Federation\n\n94 (1.8)\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\n87 (2.1)\n\nScotland\n\ns\n\n98 (1.4)\n\ns\n\nSerbia\n\n96 (1.7)\n\nSingapore\n\n88 (0.0)\n\nSlovak Republic\n\n83 (3.2)\n\nSlovenia\n\n97 (1.4)\n\nSouth Africa\n\n95 (1.5)\n\nSweden\n\n85 (2.7)\n\nTunisia\n\n60 (4.4)\n\nUnited States\n\n98 (0.9)\n\n\u00b6 England\n\n\u2013\u2013\n\nInternational Avg.\n\n89 (0.4)\n\nBenchmarking Participants\n\nBasque Country, Spain\n\n83 (3.5)\n\nIndiana State, US\n\n98 (2.2)\n\nOntario Province, Can.\n\n96 (1.9)\n\nQuebec Province, Can.\n\n92 (2.9)\n\n57 (4.7) 71 (4.1) 29 (0.2) 18 (3.5) 99 (1.0) 71 (4.1) 61 (3.6) 75 (3.1) 97 (0.1) 37 (4.3) 27 (4.0) 93 (2.7) 81 (3.6) 53 (4.6) 94 (2.3) 83 (3.0) 46 (3.9) 38 (3.7) 15 (2.7) 21 (3.5) 36 (4.0) 55 (4.4) 40 (4.2) 70 (3.6) 68 (4.0) 83 (3.5) 79 (3.5) 80 (4.7) 9 (2.3) 53 (4.0) 12 (2.3) 52 (4.1) 85 (2.7) 80 (3.2) 64 (4.3) 13 (3.3) 82 (4.6) 73 (3.5) 65 (0.0) 80 (3.6) 49 (5.0) 91 (2.2) 9 (2.5) 19 (3.2) 63 (3.1) \u2013\u2013 57 (0.5)\n36 (5.3) 63 (7.6) 86 (3.2) 70 (4.8)\n\nVolunteer for School Projects, Programs,\nand Trips\n\nEnsure That Their Child Completes His/Her Homework\n\nr\n\n73 (4.0)\n\nr\n\n92 (2.5)\n\n64 (4.4)\n\n98 (1.0)\n\n39 (0.2)\n\n75 (0.2)\n\n44 (4.2)\n\n89 (2.5)\n\n88 (3.0)\n\n97 (1.4)\n\n65 (4.1)\n\n84 (3.2)\n\n86 (2.5)\n\n96 (1.7)\n\n97 (1.5)\n\n98 (1.0)\n\n62 (0.3)\n\n100 (0.0)\n\n61 (4.1)\n\n70 (4.1)\n\n87 (2.8)\n\n95 (1.9)\n\n82 (4.0)\n\n91 (2.7)\n\n89 (3.1)\n\n94 (2.5)\n\n87 (2.4)\n\n91 (2.2)\n\n72 (3.8)\n\n99 (0.9)\n\n82 (3.1)\n\n91 (2.2)\n\n81 (3.1)\n\n83 (3.5)\n\n58 (4.1)\n\n97 (1.3)\n\n81 (3.3)\n\n74 (3.7)\n\n42 (4.6)\n\n73 (3.9)\n\n49 (4.1)\n\n83 (2.9)\n\n73 (4.0)\n\n82 (3.7)\n\n42 (4.7)\n\n79 (3.0)\n\n90 (2.6)\n\n92 (2.3)\n\n77 (3.7)\n\n90 (2.8)\n\n87 (2.8)\n\n96 (1.8)\n\nr\n\n61 (4.5)\n\nr\n\n64 (4.8)\n\ns\n\n81 (4.3)\n\ns\n\n70 (5.5)\n\n29 (4.7)\n\n95 (1.8)\n\n67 (4.8)\n\n95 (2.2)\n\n77 (3.8)\n\n94 (2.1)\n\n62 (4.3)\n\n70 (4.1)\n\n86 (3.1)\n\n89 (3.1)\n\n60 (4.0)\n\n80 (3.7)\n\n89 (2.1)\n\n84 (2.5)\n\n41 (5.1)\n\n58 (3.9)\n\ns\n\n58 (4.7)\n\ns\n\n92 (3.2)\n\n89 (2.6)\n\n87 (3.0)\n\n81 (0.0)\n\n98 (0.0)\n\n92 (2.2)\n\n95 (2.2)\n\n69 (3.7)\n\n94 (1.9)\n\n91 (2.0)\n\n94 (2.1)\n\n65 (4.1)\n\n98 (1.1)\n\n32 (3.9)\n\n40 (4.4)\n\n90 (2.1)\n\n98 (1.0)\n\n\u2013\u2013\n\n\u2013\u2013\n\n71 (0.5)\n\n87 (0.4)\n\nServe on School Committees (e.g., Select School Personnel, Review\nSchool Finances)\n\nr\n\n87 (3.1)\n\n90 (3.0)\n\n14 (0.1)\n\n7 (2.3)\n\n88 (3.1)\n\n71 (4.0)\n\n21 (3.4)\n\n86 (2.8)\n\n53 (0.3)\n\n55 (3.9)\n\n86 (3.4)\n\n84 (3.8)\n\n47 (4.8)\n\n48 (4.1)\n\n66 (3.7)\n\n76 (3.6)\n\n68 (4.0)\n\n67 (3.6)\n\n30 (3.9)\n\n25 (3.5)\n\n82 (2.9)\n\n84 (3.6)\n\n64 (4.5)\n\n93 (2.2)\n\n98 (1.2)\n\n23 (3.5)\n\nr\n\n75 (4.4)\n\ns\n\n50 (6.1)\n\n43 (5.3)\n\n72 (5.5)\n\n92 (2.6)\n\n12 (3.0)\n\n53 (4.5)\n\n49 (3.8)\n\n83 (2.4)\n\n44 (5.0)\n\ns\n\n79 (4.2)\n\n79 (4.2)\n\n64 (0.0)\n\n85 (3.1)\n\n60 (4.7)\n\n100 (0.3)\n\n63 (4.1)\n\n9 (2.4)\n\n74 (3.5)\n\n\u2013\u2013\n\n62 (0.5)\n\n74 (4.5) 88 (4.9) 94 (2.3) 62 (4.6)\n\n88 (3.4) 97 (2.3) 100 (0.0) 98 (1.0)\n\n89 (3.6) 86 (5.4) 74 (4.5) 66 (4.8)\n\nBackground data provided by schools. \u00b6 Did not satisfy guidelines for sample participation rates (see Exhibit A.9).

All the available resources, however, can work together to support science learning and instruction.\nTo measure the extent of school resources in each of the participating countries, TIMSS created an index of availability of school resources for science instruction. As described in Exhibit 8.3, the index is based on schools\u2019 average response to \ufb01ve questions about shortages that affect general capacity to provide instruction and six questions about shortages that affect science instruction in particular. Students were placed in the high category if principals reported that shortages, both general and for science in particular, had no or little effect on instructional capacity. The medium level indicates that one type of shortage affects instruction some or a lot, and the low level, that both shortages affect it some or a lot.\nSince TIMSS results in 1995 and 1999 showed that students in schools that reported being generally unaffected by a lack of resources had higher average science achievement than those in schools where across-the-board shortages affected instructional capacity some or a lot, TIMSS 2003 reported information on trends in school resources. Exhibit 8.3 shows changes in the percentages of eighth-grade students in the high, medium, and low categories for 1995, 1999, and 2003, and for the fourth-grade students for 1995 to 2003. At the eighth grade, the trend suggests similarity between 1995 and 2003 with a dip in available resources in 1999. Consistent with this overall pattern across countries, the results at the eighth grade show 13 countries having signi\ufb01cantly more students in the high category in 2003 than in 1999. At the fourth grade, the results for the participating countries were even more positive. Eleven of the countries showed signi\ufb01cant increases in the high category and none showed a decrease.\n\n330\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 8: SCHOOL CONTEXTS FOR LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION\n\nExhibit 8.3\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n331\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 8: SCHOOL CONTEXTS FOR LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 8.3: Trends in Index of Availability of School Resources for Science Instruction (ASRSI)\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nIndex of Availability of School Resources for Science Instruction\n\nCountries\n\n2003 Percent of Students\n\nSingapore\n\n92 (0.0)\n\nIndex based on principals' average response to five questions about shortages that affect general capacity to provide instruction: instructional materials (e.g., textbook); budget for supplies (e.g., paper, pencils); school buildings and grounds; heating/cooling and lighting systems; and instructional space (e.g., classrooms); and the average response to six questions about shortages that affect science instruction: science laboratory equipment and materials; computers for science instruction; computer software for science instruction; calculators for science instruction; library materials relevant to science instruction; and audio-visual resources for science instruction. Average is computed based on a 4-point scale: 1 = none; 2 = a little; 3 = some; 4 = a lot. High level indicates that both shortages are on average lower than 2. Low level indicates that both shortages are on average greater than or equal to 3. Medium level includes all other possible combinations of responses.\n\nHong Kong, SAR\n\n66 (3.6)\n\nNetherlands\n\nr 59 (4.7)\n\nBelgium (Flemish)\n\n57 (4.9)\n\nIsrael\n\n55 (4.1)\n\nAustralia\n\nr 55 (3.8)\n\nUnited States\n\nr 49 (3.8)\n\nJapan\n\n49 (4.0)\n\nSlovenia\n\nr 48 (3.8)\n\nNew Zealand\n\n45 (4.8)\n\nSweden\n\n38 (4.0)\n\nScotland\n\n36 (5.3)\n\nLebanon\n\n34 (3.6)\n\nEgypt\n\n34 (4.4)\n\nItaly\n\n31 (3.4)\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\n30 (4.0)\n\nHungary\n\n26 (3.9)\n\nChinese Taipei\n\n26 (3.9)\n\nEstonia\n\n24 (3.6)\n\nNorway\n\nr 23 (4.0)\n\nChile\n\n19 (2.7)\n\nMalaysia\n\n18 (3.3)\n\nBahrain\n\n18 (0.2)\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\n18 (5.6)\n\nJordan\n\n17 (3.6)\n\nCyprus\n\nr 16 (0.2)\n\nLatvia\n\n13 (3.0)\n\nTunisia\n\n13 (2.8)\n\nPhilippines\n\n12 (2.6)\n\nPalestinian Nat'l Auth.\n\n12 (3.0)\n\nSlovak Republic\n\n11 (2.6)\n\nGhana\n\n11 (2.9)\n\nLithuania\n\n10 (2.9)\n\nIran, Islamic Rep. of\n\n10 (2.4)\n\nMorocco\n\ns 10 (3.4)\n\nSouth Africa\n\n9 (2.0)\n\nIndonesia\n\n9 (2.5)\n\nBotswana\n\n7 (2.5)\n\nMacedonia, Rep. of\n\n6 (1.9)\n\nRomania Armenia\n\n6 (2.1) r 5 (2.0)\n\nSerbia\n\n4 (1.9)\n\nh 2003 significantly higher\n\nRussian Federation Moldova, Rep. of\n\n3 (1.2) r 3 (1.6)\n\nBulgaria\n\n3 (1.4)\n\ni 2003 significantly lower\n\n\u00b6 England International Avg.\nBenchmarking Participants\n\ns 34 (6.5) 26 (0.5)\n\nBasque Country, Spain\n\n61 (4.9)\n\nIndiana State, US\n\n43 (6.5)\n\nOntario Province, Can.\n\n25 (4.2)\n\nQuebec Province, Can. r 56 (4.4)\n\nHigh ASRSI\n\nMedium ASRSI\n\n1999 Percent of Students\n56 (3.9) h 19 (3.3) h 37 (6.4) h 60 (4.5) 36 (4.1) h \u2013\u2013 34 (3.3) h 31 (3.8) h \u2013\u2013 37 (4.1) '' '' '' '' 22 (3.1) 7 (2.2) h 24 (3.6) 5 (2.1) h '' '' 20 (3.0) 23 (3.7) '' '' 5 (1.9) h 15 (0.1) h \u2013\u2013 5 (1.9) h 11 (2.6) '' 5 (2.0) '' 6 (2.1) 5 (1.9) \u2013\u2013 7 (1.9) 21 (3.8) i '' 2 (1.2) 2 (1.1) '' '' 1 (0.9) 0 (0.0) h 0 (0.0) h 26 (4.2) 19 (0.6) h\n\n1995 Percent of Students\n62 (4.8) h 23 (5.4) h 50 (7.5) 52 (5.8) \u2013\u2013 42 (5.2) h 16 (3.3) h 25 (3.4) h 7 (2.5) h 19 (3.3) h 33 (4.8) \u2013\u2013 '' '' \u2013\u2013 2 (1.2) h 22 (3.3) '' '' 30 (4.0) '' '' '' '' '' 23 (0.5) i \u2013\u2013 '' '' '' 11 (2.5) '' 2 (1.4) h 2 (1.0) h '' \u2013\u2013 '' '' '' 3 (1.1) '' '' 1 (0.0) h '' \u2013\u2013 24 (4.8) 22 (0.9) h\n\n2003 Percent of Students\n7 (0.0) 32 (3.6) 40 (4.8) 41 (4.8) 44 (4.1) 43 (3.8) 48 (3.8) 49 (4.0) 50 (3.8) 52 (5.1) 60 (3.9) 62 (5.4) 58 (3.7) 49 (4.3) 68 (3.5) 67 (3.9) 72 (3.9) 68 (4.0) 71 (3.9) 72 (4.3) 67 (3.3) 69 (3.7) 67 (0.2) 67 (6.2) 69 (3.9) 66 (0.3) 77 (4.1) 71 (3.9) 53 (4.5) 73 (4.0) 71 (4.0) 75 (4.3) 80 (3.9) 67 (3.4) 63 (6.4) 52 (3.5) 85 (3.1) 77 (3.9) 69 (4.1) 82 (2.9) 69 (4.6) 70 (4.0) 69 (3.7) 73 (4.7) 86 (2.6) 59 (6.5) 63 (0.6)\n\n1999 Percent of Students\n40 (4.1) i 73 (3.5) i 62 (6.4) i 40 (4.5) 59 (4.1) i \u2013\u2013 59 (3.2) i 64 (4.1) i \u2013\u2013 62 (4.1) '' '' '' '' 71 (3.8) 76 (3.7) 69 (3.9) 78 (3.4) '' '' 70 (3.3) 70 (4.1) '' '' 58 (4.5) 80 (0.2) i \u2013\u2013 66 (4.3) 54 (4.1) '' 87 (3.1) i '' 71 (3.7) 71 (3.9) \u2013\u2013 45 (4.0) 67 (4.7) h '' 59 (3.7) 72 (3.7) h '' '' 46 (4.6) h 29 (3.9) h 65 (4.4) h 69 (4.5) 63 (0.7)\n\n1995 Percent of Students\n37 (4.7) i 72 (5.7) i 50 (7.5) 48 (5.8) \u2013\u2013 52 (5.4) 77 (3.5) i 67 (3.8) i 74 (4.2) i 74 (4.0) i 57 (5.2) \u2013\u2013 '' '' \u2013\u2013 81 (3.0) i 77 (3.4) '' '' 66 (4.2) '' '' '' '' '' 69 (0.6) i \u2013\u2013 '' '' '' 86 (2.8) i '' 78 (3.7) 67 (4.9) '' \u2013\u2013 '' '' '' 73 (3.8) '' '' 46 (4.3) h '' \u2013\u2013 72 (5.0) 66 (1.0) i\n\n'' 39 (7.9) 17 (3.3) 57 (6.1)\n\n'' '' 15 (3.8) 41 (6.5)\n\n38 (4.9) 53 (6.9) 67 (4.7) 41 (4.4)\n\n'' 58 (7.8) 74 (4.2) 43 (6.1)\n\n'' '' 80 (4.1) i 59 (6.5) i\n\nBackground data provided by schools.\n\u00b6 Did not satisfy guidelines for sample participation rates (see Exhibit A.9).\nTrend notes: Because of differences in population coverage, 1999 data are not shown for Australia, Latvia, Morocco, and Slovenia, and 1995 data are not shown for Israel, Italy, Latvia, and South Africa.

To measure the extent to which schools offer a positive school climate, TIMSS created two new indices in 2003 \u2013 one measuring the views of principals and the other the views of teachers. The results for the Index of Principals\u2019 Perception of School Climate are presented in Exhibit 8.4. On a scale from very high to very low, the index was based on principals\u2019 characterizations of the following:\n\u2022 teachers\u2019 job satisfaction;\n\u2022 teachers\u2019 understanding of the school\u2019s curricular goals;\n\u2022 teachers\u2019 degree of success in implementing the school\u2019s curricula;\n\u2022 teachers\u2019 expectations for students\u2019 achievement;\n\u2022 parental support for student\u2019s achievement;\n\u2022 parental involvement in schools\u2019 activities;\n\u2022 students\u2019 regard for school property;\n\u2022 students\u2019 desire to do well in school.\nStudents in the high category attended schools where the principals averaged high or very high reports for each aspect of school climate. Students whose principals characterized school climate as medium were placed in the medium category, and whose principals characterized the school climate as low or very low were placed in the low category.\nAt both grades, internationally, on average, two-thirds of the students were in the medium category. At the eighth grade, 15 percent were in the high category, and 18 percent were in the low category. Morocco, Tunisia, and Botswana had from 59 to 69 percent of their students in the low category. At the fourth grade, 23 percent were in the high category, and 11 percent in the low category.

Average is computed based on a 5-point scale: 1 =very high; 2 = high; 3 = medium; 4 = low; 5 = very low. High level indicates average is less than or equal to 2. Medium level indicates that average is greater than 2 and less or equal to 3.

It is based on the teachers\u2019 characterizations of the same aspects of school climate as were characterized by the principals (see list above). As can be seen from the results, fourthgrade teachers were in considerable agreement with principals, also placing two-thirds of the fourth-grade students in the medium category. According to their teachers, internationally, on average, 20 percent of the students attended schools in the high category and 14 percent attended schools in the low category. At the eighth grade, teachers had a somewhat more gloomy view of the climate in schools than did the principals. According to their teachers, on average, only 10 percent of the eighth-grade students were attending schools in the high category. Sixty percent were attending schools in the medium category and 30 percent in the low category. Similar to the results for the principals, at both grades, there was a positive relationship between higher reports from teachers and higher average science achievement.\n\n340\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 8: SCHOOL CONTEXTS FOR LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION\nHow Serious Are School Attendance Problems?\nIn some countries, schools are confronted with high rates of absenteeism, which can in\ufb02uence instructional continuity and reduce the time for learning. In general, research has shown that greater truancy is related to less serious attitudes towards school and lower academic achievement. To examine this issue, TIMSS developed an index of good school and class attendance based on schools\u2019 responses to three questions about the seriousness of students\u2019 absenteeism, arriving late at school, and skipping class. The high index level indicates schools reported that all three behaviors are not a problem. The low level indicates that two or more are a serious problem, or two are minor problems and the third a serious problem. The medium category includes all other possible combinations of responses.\nThe results of the index for TIMSS 2003 are presented in Exhibit 8.6, which also contains trends between 1999 and 2003 at the eighth grade. At the eighth grade, the results show very little change, on average, in attendance problems. Considering the two assessments, the high category did show a small (statistically signi\ufb01cant) increase from 21 percent in 1999 to 23 percent in 2003. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of the students \u2013 58 to 59 percent \u2013 were in the medium category in both years, and about one-\ufb01fth (19-20%) were in the low category. Student attendance problems remain a serious problem in many countries, decreasing in \ufb01ve countries but increasing in four others during the same four-year period. At the fourth grade in 2003, 47 percent of students, on average, internationally, were in the high category, where principals had judged their schools to have few if any attendance problems. Another 47 percent of the students were in schools at the medium level of the index where principals reported moderate attendance problems. Only 5 percent were in schools at the low index level.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n341\n\n\fCHAPTER 8: SCHOOL CONTEXTS FOR LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 8.6: Trends in Index of Good School and Class Attendance (GSCA)\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nIndex of Good School and Class Attendance\nIndex based on principals' responses to three questions about the seriousness of attendance problems in the school: arriving late at school; absenteeism (i.e., unjustified absences); and skipping class.

More speci\ufb01cally, teachers were asked how much they agreed with three statements:\n\u2022 This school is located in a safe neighborhood;\n\u2022 I feel safe at this school;\n\u2022 This school\u2019s security policies and practices are suf\ufb01cient.\nTIMSS used the teachers\u2019 responses to create an index, called the Index of Science Teachers\u2019 Perceptions of Safety in the Schools. If their teachers agreed or agreed a lot to all three statements, then the students were placed in the high category. If their teachers disagreed or disagreed a lot to all three statements, then students were placed in the low category. All other combinations (some agreements and some disagreements) were placed in the medium category.\nExhibit 8.7 contains the results for the Index of Science Teachers\u2019 Perception of Safety in the Schools. On the positive side of things, across countries, about three-fourths of students in both grades were in the high category (70 percent of the eighth-grade students and 76 percent of the fourth-grade students). More than one-\ufb01fth were in the medium category (24 to 20 percent, respectively), and only 6 to 4 percent were in the low category. At both grades, there was a positive relationship between teachers\u2019 reports of school safety and science achievement.\nTIMSS asked the students to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to whether each of the following \ufb01ve things had happened during the last month:\n\u2022 Something of mine was stolen;\n\u2022 I was hit or hurt by other students;\n\u2022 I was made to do things that I didn\u2019t want to do by other students;\n\n344\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fCHAPTER 8: SCHOOL CONTEXTS FOR LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION\n\u2022 I was made fun of or called names;\n\u2022 I was left out of activities by other students.\nTIMSS used students\u2019 responses to create the Index of Students\u2019 Perception of Being Safe in the Schools. Students who reported being in a safe environment, answering \u201cno\u201d to all \ufb01ve statements, were placed in the high category. Students who reported being in a much riskier school environment by answering \u201cyes\u201d to all \ufb01ve statements were placed in the low category. Students who answered \u201cyes\u201d to some statements and \u201cno\u201d to others were placed in the medium category.\nExhibit 8.8 presents the results for the Index of Students\u2019 Perception of Being Safe in the Schools. Internationally, on average, eighth-grade students reported a greater sense of security than did fourth-grade students. Nearly half of the eighth-grade students (48%) were in the high category, 37 percent were in the medium category, and 15 percent were in the low category. It should be emphasized, however, that the feeling of safety was not universal. In several countries, more than one-third of the eighth-grade students were in the low category, including Jordan, the Philippines, Ghana, and South Africa. There was a positive relationship between eighth-grade students\u2019 reporting being in safer schools and science achievement.\nAt the fourth grade, across the participating countries, 35 percent of the students, on average, were in the high category, 42 percent were in the medium category, and 23 percent were in the low category. The two countries with more than one-third of the fourthgrade students in the low category were Chinese Taipei and the Philippines. Similar to the eighth grade, there was a direct relationship at the fourth grade between students\u2019 reporting being in safer schools and having higher science achievement.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n345\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nCHAPTER 8: SCHOOL CONTEXTS FOR LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION\nExhibit 8.7: Index of Science Teachers' Perception of Safety in the Schools (TPSS)\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nIndex of Teachers' Perception of Safety in the Schools\n\nCountries\n\nIndex based on teachers' responses to three statements about their schools: this school is located in a safe neighborhood; I feel safe at this school; this school's security policies and practices are sufficient.

Since its inception in 1959, the IEA has conducted almost 20 studies of cross-national achievement in the curricular areas of mathematics, science, language, civics, and reading.\nIn particular, TIMSS 2003 continues a rich tradition of studies designed to improve teaching and learning in mathematics and science. IEA conducted the pioneering First International Science Study (FISS) in 1970-71 and the Second International Science Study (SISS) in 198384. The First and Second International Mathematics Studies (FIMS and SIMS) were conducted in 1964 and 1980-82, respectively. The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in 1994-1995 was the largest and most complex IEA study ever conducted, including both mathematics and science at third and fourth grades, seventh and eighth grades, and the \ufb01nal year of secondary school.\nIn 1999, TIMSS (now renamed the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) again assessed eighth-grade students\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n351\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nin both mathematics and science to measure trends in student achievement since 1995. Also, 1999 represented four years since the \ufb01rst TIMSS, and the population of students originally assessed as fourthgraders had advanced to the eighth grade. Thus, TIMSS 1999 also provided information about whether the relative performance of these students had changed in the intervening years.\nTIMSS 2003, the third data collection in the TIMSS cycle of studies, was administered at the eighth and fourth grades. For countries that participated in previous assessments, TIMSS 2003 provides three-cycle trends at the eighth grade (1995, 1999, 2003) and data over two points in time at the fourth grade (1995 and 2003). In countries new to the study, the 2003 results can help policy makers and practitioners assess their comparative standing and gauge the rigor and effectiveness of their mathematics and science programs. TIMSS 2007 will again assess mathematics and science achievement at fourth and eighth grades, providing previously participating countries an opportunity to extend their trend lines and new countries an opportunity to join a valuable and exciting endeavor.\nParticipants in TIMSS\nExhibit A.1 lists all the countries that have participated in TIMSS in 1995, 1999, or 2003 at fourth or eighth grade. In all, 67 countries have participated in TIMSS at one time or another. Of the 49 countries that participated in TIMSS 2003, 48 participated at the eighth grade and 26 at the fourth grade. Yemen participated at the fourth but not the eighth grade. The exhibit shows that at the eighth grade 23 countries also participated in TIMSS 1995 and TIMSS 1999. For these participants, trend data across three points in time are available. Eleven countries participated in TIMSS 2003 and TIMSS 1999 only, while three countries participated in TIMSS 2003 and TIMSS 1995. These countries have trend data for two points in time. Of the 12 new countries participating in the study, 11 participated at eighth grade and 2 at the fourth grade.\n\n352\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nOf the 26 countries participating in TIMSS 2003 at the fourth grade, 16 also participated in 1995, providing data at two points in time.\nInspired by the very successful TIMSS 1999 benchmarking initiative in the United States,1 in which 13 states and 14 school districts or district consortia administered the TIMSS assessment and compared their students\u2019 achievement to student achievement world wide, TIMSS 2003 provided an international benchmarking program, whereby regions or localities of countries could participate in the study to compare to international standards. TIMSS 2003 included four benchmarking participants at the eighth grade: the Basque Country of Spain, the U.S. state of Indiana, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Indiana, Ontario, and Quebec participated also at the fourth grade. Having also participated in 1999, Indiana has data at two points in time at eighth grade.

The resulting publication, entitled TIMSS Assessment Frameworks and Speci\ufb01cations 2003, serves as the basis of TIMSS 2003 and beyond.3\nAs shown in Exhibit A.2, the science assessment framework for TIMSS 2003 is framed by two organizing dimensions or aspects, a content domain and a cognitive domain. The content domains \u2013 life science, chemistry, physics, earth science, and environmental science at the eighth grade and life science, physical science, and earth science at the fourth grade \u2013 de\ufb01ne the speci\ufb01c science subject matter covered by the assessment. The three cognitive domains \u2013 factual knowledge, conceptual understanding, and reasoning and analysis \u2013 de\ufb01ne the sets of behaviors expected of students as they engage with the science content.\nDeveloping the TIMSS assessments for 2003 was a cooperative venture involving all of the National Research Coordinators (NRCs) during the entire process. Although about half of the items in the 1999 eighth-grade assessment had been kept secure and were available for use in 2003 to measure trends from 1995 and 1999, the ambitious goals for curriculum coverage and innovative problem solving tasks speci\ufb01ed in the Frameworks and Speci\ufb01cations necessitated a tremendous item development effort.\nTo maximize the effectiveness of the contributions from national centers, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center developed a detailed item-writing manual and conducted a workshop for countries that wished to provide items for the international item pool. At this workshop, an item development \u201cTask Force\u201d consisting of the science coordinator and two experienced science item writers reviewed general\n\n356\n\n2 For a full discussion of the TIMSS 2003 test development effort, please see Smith Neidorf, T.A. and Garden, R.A.

In the weeks that followed, more than 2,000 items and scoring guides were drafted and reviewed by the task force. The items were further reviewed by the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee, a group of internationally prominent mathematics and science educators nominated by participating countries to advise on subject-matter issues in the assessment. Committee members also contributed enormously to the quality of the assessment by helping to develop tasks and items to assess problem solving and scienti\ufb01c inquiry.\nParticipating countries \ufb01eld-tested the items with representative samples of students, and all of the potential new items were again reviewed by the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee. The NRCs had several opportunities to review the items and scoring criteria. The resulting TIMSS 2003 science tests contained 189 items at the eighth grade and 152 items at the fourth grade.\nExhibit A.3 presents the number and percentage of items, the number of multiple-choice and constructed-response items, and the number of score points in each of the science content domains for eighth and fourth grades. Comparable information is presented for the three cognitive domains. About two-\ufb01fths of the items at each grade level were in constructed-response format, requiring students to generate and write their own answers. Some constructed-response questions asked for short answers while others required extended responses with students showing their work or providing explanations for their answers. The remaining questions used a multiple-choice format. In scoring the items, correct answers to most questions were worth one point. However, responses to some constructed-response questions (particularly those requiring extended responses) were evaluated for partial credit, with a fully correct answer being awarded two points (see later section on scoring). The total number of score points available for analysis thus somewhat exceeds the number of items (211 and 168\n\n358\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nscore points for eighth- and fourth-grades, respectively). Less than half of the students\u2019 testing time (48% at eighth grade and 46% at fourth grade) was allocated to constructed-response items.\nTo ensure reliable measurement of trends over time, the TIMSS 2003 assessment included items that had been used in the 1995 and 1999 assessments as well as items developed for the \ufb01rst time in 2003. Exhibit A.4 shows the distribution of score points across content domains for both trend items and items used for the \ufb01rst time. Of the 211 score points available in the entire 2003 science assessment, 24 came from items used also in 1995, 52 from items used also in 1999, and 135 from items used for the \ufb01rst time in 2003. At fourth grade, 33 score points came from 1995 items, and the remaining 135 from new 2003 items.\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the tests represented the curricula of the participating countries and that the items exhibited no bias toward or against particular countries. The \ufb01nal forms of the test were endorsed by the NRCs of the participating countries. In addition, countries had an opportunity to match the content of the test to their curriculum. They identi\ufb01ed items measuring topics not covered in their intended curriculum. The information from this Test-Curriculum Matching Analysis, provided in Appendix C, indicates that omitting such items has little effect on the overall pattern of results.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n359\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nExhibit A.3: Distribution of Science Items by Content Domain and Cognitive Domain\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nContent Domain\nLife Science Chemistry Physics Earth Science Environmental Science Total\n\nPercentage of Items\n29 16 24 16 14 100\n\nTotal Number of Items\n\nNumber of Multiple-Choice\nItems\n\nNumber of Constructed-\nResponse Items1\n\n54\n\n29\n\n25\n\n31\n\n20\n\n11\n\n46\n\n28\n\n18\n\n31\n\n22\n\n9\n\n27\n\n10\n\n17\n\n189\n\n109\n\n80\n\nNumber of Score Points2\n65 34 49 33\n30\n211\n\nCognitive Domain\n\nPercentage of Items\n\nFactual Knowledge\n\n30\n\nConceptual Understanding\n\n39\n\nReasoning and Analysis\n\n31\n\nTotal\n\n100\n\nTotal Number of Items\n\nNumber of Multiple-Choice\nItems\n\nNumber of Constructed-\nResponse Items1\n\n57\n\n50\n\n7\n\n73\n\n42\n\n31\n\nNumber of Score Points 2\n59\n80\n\n59\n\n17\n\n189\n\n109\n\n42\n\n72\n\n80\n\n211\n\n1 Constructed-response items include both short-answer and extended-response types.

To ensure broad subject-matter coverage without overburdening individual students, TIMSS 2003, as in the 1995 and 1999 assessments, used a matrix-sampling technique that assigns each assessment item to one of a set of item blocks, and then assembles student test booklets by combining the item blocks according to a balanced design. Each student takes one booklet containing both mathematics and science items. Thus, the same students participated in both the mathematics and science testing.\nExhibit A.5 summarizes the TIMSS 2003 assessment design, presenting both the matrix-sampling item blocks for mathematics and science and the item block-to-booklet assignment plan. According to the design, the 313 mathematics and science items at fourth grade and 383 items at eighth grade are divided among 28 item blocks at each grade, 14 mathematics blocks labeled M01 through M14, and 14 science blocks labeled S01 through S14. Each block contains either mathematics items only or science items only. This general block design is the same for both grades, although the planned assessment time per block is 12 minutes for fourth grade and 15 minutes for eighth grade. At the eighth grade, six blocks in each subject (blocks 01 \u2013 06) contain secure items from 1995 and 1999 to measure trends and eight blocks (07 \u2013 14) contain new items developed for TIMSS 2003. Since fourth grade was not included in the 1999 assessment, trend items from 1995 only were available, and these were placed in the \ufb01rst three blocks. The remaining 11 blocks contain items new in 2003.\nIn the TIMSS 2003 design, the 28 blocks of items are distributed across 12 student booklets, as shown in Exhibit A.5. Each booklet consists of six blocks of items. To enable linking between booklets, each block appears in two, three, or four different booklets. The assessment time for individual students is 72 minutes at fourth grade (six 12minute blocks) and 90 minutes at eighth grade (six 15-minute blocks), which is comparable to that in the 1995 and 1999 assessments. The\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n363\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nbooklets are organized into two three-block sessions (Parts I and II), with a break between the parts.\nThe 2003 assessment was the \ufb01rst TIMSS assessment in which calculators were permitted, and so it was important that the design allow students to use calculators when working on the new 2003 items. However, because calculators were not permitted in TIMSS 1995 or 1999, the design also had to ensure that students did not use calculators when working on trend items from these assessments. The solution was to place the blocks containing trend items (blocks M01 \u2013 M06 and S01 \u2013 S06) in Part I of the test booklets, to be completed without calculators before the break. After the break, calculators were allowed for the new items (blocks M07 \u2013 M14 and S07 \u2013 S14). To provide a more balanced design, however, and have information about differences with calculator access, two mathematics trend blocks (M05 and M06) and two science trend blocks (S05 and S06) also were placed in Part II of one booklet each.\n\n364\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nExhibit A.5: TIMSS 2003 Assessment Design\n\nTIMSS 2003 Item Blocks for Matrix-Sampling\n\nSource of Items\n\nMathematics Blocks\n\nTrend Items (TIMSS 1995 or 1999) Trend Items (TIMSS 1995 or 1999) Trend Items (TIMSS 1995 or 1999) Trend Items (TIMSS 1999) Trend Items (TIMSS 1999) Trend Items (TIMSS 1999) New Replacement Items (TIMSS 2003) New Replacement Items (TIMSS 2003) New Replacement Items (TIMSS 2003) New Replacement Items (TIMSS 2003) New Replacement Items (TIMSS 2003) New Replacement Items (TIMSS 2003) New Replacement Items (TIMSS 2003) New Replacement Items (TIMSS 2003)\n\nM01 M02 M03 M04 M05 M06 M07 M08 M09 M10 M11 M12 M13 M14\n\nBooklet Design for TIMSS 2003\n\nStudent Booklet\n\nPart I\n\nBooklet 1 Booklet 2 Booklet 3 Booklet 4 Booklet 5 Booklet 6 Booklet 7 Booklet 8 Booklet 9 Booklet 10 Booklet 11 Booklet 12\n\nM01 M02 M03 M04 M05 M06 S01 S02 S03 S04 S05 S06\n\nM02 M03 M04 M05 M06 M01 S02 S03 S04 S05 S06 S01\n\nS06 S05 S04 S03 S02 S01 M06 M05 M04 M03 M02 M01\n\nTIMSS2003\n\n4 8 SCIENCE\n\n&\n\nGrades\n\nScience Blocks\nS01 S02 S03 S04 S05 S06 S07 S08 S09 S10 S11 S12 S13 S14\n\nS07 S08 S09 S10 S11 S12 M07 M08 M09 M10 M11 M12\n\nPart II\nM05 M06 M13 M14 M09 M10 S05 S06 S13 S14 S09 S10\n\nM07 M08 M11 M12 M13 M14 S07 S08 S11 S12 S13 S14\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n365\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nBackground Questionnaires\nAs in previous assessments, TIMSS in 2003 administered a broad array of questionnaires to collect data on the educational context for student achievement. For TIMSS 2003, a concerted effort was made to streamline and upgrade the questionnaires. This work began with articulating the information to be collected in the TIMSS 2003 framework and continued with extensive \ufb01eld testing.4\nAcross the two grades and two subjects, TIMSS 2003 involved 11 questionnaires. National Research Coordinators completed four questionnaires. With the assistance of their curriculum experts, they provided detailed information on the organization, emphasis, and content coverage of the mathematics and science curriculum at fourth and eighth grades. The fourth- and eighth-grade students who were tested answered questions pertaining to their attitudes towards mathematics and science, their academic self-concept, classroom activities, home background, and out-of-school activities. The mathematics and science teachers of sampled students responded to questions about teaching emphasis on the topics in the curriculum frameworks, instructional practices, professional training and education, and their views on mathematics and science. Separate questionnaires for mathematics and science teachers were administered at the eighth grade, while to re\ufb02ect the fact that most younger students are taught all subjects by the same teacher, a single questionnaire was used at the fourth grade. The principals or heads of schools at the fourth and eighth grades responded to questions about school staf\ufb01ng and resources, school safety, mathematics and science course offerings, and teacher support.\n\n4 For more information, see Chrostowski, S.J.

Of the 49 countries and four benchmarking participants, 17 collected data in two languages and one country, Egypt, in three languages \u2013 Arabic, English, and French. In addition to translation, it sometimes was necessary to modify the international versions for cultural reasons, even in the countries that tested wholly or partly in English. This process represented an enormous effort for the national centers, with many checks along the way. The translation effort included (1) developing explicit guidelines for translation and cultural adaptation; (2) translation of the instruments by the national centers in accordance with the guidelines, using two or more independent translations; (3) consultation with subject-matter experts on cultural adaptations to ensure that the meaning and dif\ufb01culty of items did not change; (4) veri\ufb01cation of translation quality by professional translators from an independent translation company; (5) corrections by the national centers in accordance with the suggestions made; (6) veri\ufb01cation by the International Study Center that corrections were made; and (7) a series of statistical checks after the testing to detect items that did not perform comparably across countries.5\n\n5 More details about the translation veri\ufb01cation procedures can be found in Chrostowski, S.J. and Malak, B. (2004), \u201cTranslation and Cultural Adaptation of the TIMSS 2003 Instruments\u201d in M.O. Martin, I.V.S. Mullis, and S.J.

However, for comparability with previous TIMSS assessments, the formal de\ufb01nition for the eighth grade speci\ufb01ed all students enrolled in the upper of the two adjacent grades that contained the largest proportion of 13-yearold students at the time of testing, and for fourth grade, all students enrolled in the upper of the two adjacent grades that contained the largest proportion of 9-year-olds. These correspond to the eighth and fourth grades in practically every country.6\nThe selection of valid and efficient samples is crucial to the quality and success of an international comparative study such as TIMSS. The accuracy of the survey results depends on the quality of sampling information and that of the sampling activities themselves. For TIMSS, NRCs worked on all phases of sampling with the TIMSS sampling experts from Statistics Canada and the IEA Data Processing Center (DPC). NRCs received training in how to select the school and student samples and in the use of the sampling software. In consultation with the TIMSS sampling referee (Keith Rust, Westat, Inc.), the TIMSS sampling experts reviewed the national sampling plans, sampling data, sampling frames, and sample execution. The sampling documentation was used by the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center, in consultation with the sampling experts and the sampling referee, to evaluate the quality of the samples.\nIn a few situations where it was not possible to test the entire internationally desired population (all students enrolled in the upper of the two adjacent grades that contained the largest proportion of 13year-old or 9-year-old students at the time of testing), countries were permitted to de\ufb01ne a national desired population that excluded part of the internationally desired population. Exhibit A.6 shows any differences in coverage between the international and national desired populations for eighth and fourth grades. Almost all participants at the\n6 The sample design for TIMSS is described in detail in Foy, P., and Joncas, M. (2004), \u201cTIMSS 2003 Sampling Design\u201d in M.O. Martin, I.V.S. Mullis and S.J.

At fourth grade, only Lithuania of the 29 participants had less than 100 percent coverage.\nWithin the desired population, countries could de\ufb01ne a population that excluded a small percentage (less than \ufb01ve percent) of certain kinds of schools or students that would be very dif\ufb01cult or resourceintensive to test (e.g., schools for students with special needs or schools that were very small or located in extremely rural areas). Countries excluding more than 10 percent of their population are annotated in the exhibits in this report. Exhibit A.6 shows that only three countries exceeded the 10 percent limit at eighth grade (Israel, Macedonia, and Syria) and no fourth-grade participant did so.\nWithin countries, TIMSS used a two-stage sample design, in which the \ufb01rst stage involved selecting about 150 public and private schools in each country. Within each school, countries were to use random procedures to select one eighth-grade mathematics class (for eighth-grade participants) and one fourth-grade classroom (fourthgrade participants). All of the students in the sampled class were to participate in the TIMSS testing. This approach was designed to yield a representative sample of at least 4,000 students per country at each grade level. Typically, between 1,200 and 2,000 students responded to each achievement item in each country, depending on the booklets in which the items appeared.\nExhibits A.7 and A.8 present achieved sample sizes for schools and students, respectively, for participating countries. Exhibit A.9 shows the participation rates for schools, students, and overall, both with and without the use of replacement schools. Most countries achieved the minimum acceptable participation rates \u2013 85 percent of both the schools and students, or a combined rate (the product of school and student participation) of 75 percent \u2013 although Hong Kong SAR, the Netherlands, and Scotland did so only after including replacement\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n369\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nExhibit A.6: Coverage of TIMSS 2003 Target Population\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt England Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco\nNetherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

The United States and Morocco had overall participation rates after including replacement schools of just below 75 percent (73% and 71%, respectively), and were annotated accordingly. Despite extraordinary efforts to secure full participation, England\u2019s participation fell below the minimum requirement of 50 percent, and so their results were annotated and placed below a line in exhibits showing achievement. Because of scheduling dif\ufb01culties, Korea was unable to test its eighth-grade students in May 2003 as planned. Instead, the students were tested in September 2003, when they had moved into the ninth grade. The results for Korea are annotated accordingly in exhibits in this report.\nAt fourth grade, all participants achieved the minimum acceptable participation rates, although Australia, England, Hong Kong SAR, the Netherlands, Scotland, and the United States did so only after including replacement schools.\nWhereas countries achieved a high degree of compliance with sampling guidelines in 2003, occasionally countries\u2019 data were omitted from exhibits dealing with trends from earlier assessments because of comparability issues. Because of differences in population coverage, 1999 eighth-grade data for Australia, Morocco, and Slovenia and fourth-grade data for Italy are not shown in this report. Israel, Italy, and South Africa, experienced dif\ufb01culties with sampling at the classroom level in 1995; consequently their eighth-grade data from that assessment are not shown in this report.\n\n378\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nData Collection\nEach participating country was responsible for carrying out all aspects of the data collection, using standardized procedures developed for the study. Training manuals were created for school coordinators and test administrators that explained procedures for receipt and distribution of materials as well as for the activities related to the testing sessions. These manuals covered procedures for test security, standardized scripts to regulate directions and timing, rules for answering students\u2019 questions, and steps to ensure that identi\ufb01cation on the test booklets and questionnaires corresponded to the information on the forms used to track students.7\nEach country was responsible for conducting quality control procedures and describing this effort in the NRC\u2019s report documenting procedures used in the study. In addition, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center considered it essential to monitor compliance with standardized procedures. NRCs were asked to nominate one or more persons unconnected with their national center to serve as quality control monitors for their countries. The International Study Center developed manuals for the monitors and briefed them in two-day training sessions about TIMSS, the responsibilities of the national centers in conducting the study, and their roles and responsibilities.\nIn all, 50 quality control monitors drawn from the 49 countries and four Benchmarking participants participated in the training.8 Where necessary, quality control monitors who attended the training session were permitted to recruit other monitors to assist them in covering the territory and meeting the testing timetable. All together, the international quality control monitors and those trained by them observed 1,147 testing sessions (755 for grade 8 and 392 for grade 4),9 and conducted interviews with the National Research Coordinator in each of the participating countries.10\nThe results of the interviews indicate that, in general, NRCs had prepared well for data collection and, despite the heavy demands\n\n7 Data collection procedures for TIMSS is described in detail in Barth, J., Gonzalez, E.J., and Neuschmidt, O.

Similarly, the TIMSS tests appeared to have been administered in compliance with international procedures, including the activities before the testing session, those during testing, and the school-level activities related to receiving, distributing, and returning material from the national centers.\nScoring the Constructed-Response Items\nBecause 40 to 50 percent of the test time was devoted to constructedresponse items, TIMSS needed to develop procedures for reliably evaluating student responses within and across countries. Scoring used two-digit codes with rubrics speci\ufb01c to each item. The \ufb01rst digit designates the correctness level of the response. The second digit, combined with the \ufb01rst, represents a diagnostic code identifying speci\ufb01c types of approaches, strategies, or common errors and misconceptions. Although not used in this report, analyses of responses based on the second digit should provide insight into ways to help students better understand science concepts and problem-solving approaches.\nTo ensure reliable scoring procedures based on the TIMSS rubrics, the International Study Center prepared detailed guides containing the rubrics and explanations of how to implement them, together with example student responses for the various rubric categories. These guides, along with training packets containing extensive examples of student responses for practice in applying the rubrics, were used as a basis for intensive training in scoring the constructed-response items. The training sessions were designed to help representatives of national centers who would then be responsible for training personnel in their countries to apply the two-digit codes reliably.\nTo gather and document empirical information about the withincountry agreement among scorers, TIMSS arranged to have systematic samples of at least 100 student responses to each item scored independently by two readers. Exhibit A.10 shows the average and range of the within-country exact percent of agreement between scorers on the\n\n380\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nconstructed-response items in the science test for the TIMSS participants. The exhibit shows agreement for both the correctness score (the \ufb01rst digit) and for the two-digit diagnostic score. A high percentage of exact agreement was observed, with an overall average of 97 percent for correctness score and 92 percent for diagnostic score at the eighth grade and 96 and 92 percent, respectively at the fourth grade. The TIMSS data from the reliability studies indicate that scoring procedures were robust for the science items, especially for the correctness score used for the analyses in this report.\nThe double scoring of a sample of the student test booklets provided a measure of the consistency within each country with which constructed-response questions were scored. TIMSS 2003 also took steps to show that those constructed-response items from 1999 that were used in 2003 were scored in the same way in both assessments. In anticipation of this, countries that participated in TIMSS 1999 sent samples of scored student booklets from the 1999 eighth-grade data collection to the IEA Data Processing Center, where they were digitally scanned and stored in presentation software for later use. As a check on scoring consistency from 1999 to 2003, staff members working in each country on scoring the 2003 eighth-grade data were asked also to score these 1999 responses using the DPC software. The items from 1995 that were used in TIMSS 2003 all were in multiple-choice format, and therefore scoring reliability was not an issue. As shown in Exhibit A.11, there was a very high degree of scoring consistency, with 92 percent exact agreement, on average, internationally, between the scores awarded in 1999 and those given by the 2003 scorers. There was somewhat less agreement at the diagnostic score level, with 81 percent exact agreement, on average.\nTo monitor the consistency with which the scoring rubrics were applied across countries, TIMSS collected from the Southern-Hemisphere countries that administered TIMSS in English a sample of 150 student responses to 21 constructed-response science questions. This set of 3,150 student responses was then sent to each Northern-Hemisphere\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n381\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nExhibit A.10: TIMSS 2003 Within-Country Scoring Reliability for the Constructed-Response Science Items\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt England Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

Upon arrival at the Data Processing Center, the data underwent an exhaustive cleaning process. This involved several iterative steps and procedures designed to identify, document, and correct deviations from the international instruments, \ufb01le structures, and coding schemes. The process also emphasized consistency of information within national data sets and appropriate linking among the many student, teacher, and school data \ufb01les.\nThroughout the process, the TIMSS 2003 data were checked and double-checked by the IEA Data Processing Center, the International Study Center, and the national centers. The national centers were contacted regularly and given multiple opportunities to review the data for their countries. In conjunction with the IEA Data Processing Center, the International Study Center reviewed item statistics for each cognitive item in each country to identify poorly performing items. On the fourth-grade science test, two items were deleted for all countries. In addition, 10 countries had one or more items deleted (in most cases, one or two). Usually the poor statistics (negative point-biserials for the key, large item-by-country interactions, and statistics indicating lack of \ufb01t with the model) were a result of translation, adaptation, or printing deviations. At eighth grade, no science items were deleted for all countries, but 16 countries had one or more items deleted (mostly one or two).\n\n11 These steps are detailed in Barth, J., Carstens, R., and Neuschmidt, O. (2004), \u201cCreating and Checking the TIMSS 2003 Database\u201d in M.O. Martin, I.V.S. Mullis, and S.J. Chrostowski (eds.), TIMSS 2003 Technical Report, Chestnut Hill, MA: Boston College.\n\n388\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nIRT Scaling and Data Analysis\nThe general approach to reporting the TIMSS achievement data was based primarily on item response theory (IRT) scaling methods.12 The science results were summarized using a family of 2-parameter and 3parameter IRT models for dichotomously-scored items (right or wrong), and generalized partial credit models for items with 0, 1, or 2 available score points. The IRT scaling method produces a score by averaging the responses of each student to the items that he or she took in a way that takes into account the dif\ufb01culty and discriminating power of each item. The methodology used in TIMSS includes re\ufb01nements that enable reliable scores to be produced even though individual students responded to relatively small subsets of the total science item pool. Achievement scales were produced for each of the science content areas (life science, chemistry, physics, earth science, and environmental science at the eighth grade and life science, physical science, and earth science at the fourth grade), as well as for science overall.\nThe IRT methodology was preferred for developing comparable estimates of performance for all students, since students answered different test items depending upon which of the 12 test booklets they received. The IRT analysis provides a common scale on which performance can be compared across countries. In addition to providing a basis for estimating mean achievement, scale scores permit estimates of how students within countries vary and provide information on percentiles of performance.\nAs shown in Exhibit A.5, TIMSS has a complicated booklet design, with blocks of items appearing in different positions in different booklets. For example, the items in block M1 appear as the \ufb01rst block in Booklet 1, as the second block in Booklet 6, and as the third block in Booklet 12. This allows the booklets to be linked together ef\ufb01ciently, but also to monitor and counterbalance any position effect. In TIMSS 2003, the counterbalanced booklet design made it possible to detect an unexpectedly strong position effect in the data as the item statistics for each country were reviewed. More speci\ufb01cally, this position\n12 For a detailed description of the TIMSS scaling, see Gonzalez, E.J., Galia, J., and Li, I. (2004), \u201cScaling Methods and Procedures for the TIMSS 2003 Mathematics and Science Scales\u201d in M.O. Martin, I.V.S. Mullis, and S.J. Chrostowski (eds.), TIMSS 2003 Technical Report, Chestnut Hill, MA: Boston College.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n389\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\neffect occurred because some students in all countries did not reach all the items in the third block position, which was the end of the \ufb01rst half of each booklet before the break. The same effect was evident for the sixth block position, which was the last block in the booklets. The IRT scaling addressed this problem by treating items in the third and sixth block positions as if they were unique, even though they also appeared in other positions. For example, the mathematics items in block M1 from Booklet 1 (the \ufb01rst position) and from Booklet 6 (second position) were considered to be the same items for scaling and reporting purposes, but those in Booklet 12 (the third position) were scaled as items that were different and unique.\nThe TIMSS science achievement scale was designed to provide a reliable measure of student achievement spanning 1995, 1999, and 2003. The metric of the scale was established originally with the 1995 assessment. When all countries participating in 1995 at the eighth grade are treated equally, the TIMSS scale average over those countries is 500 and the standard deviation is 100. The same applies for the fourth-grade assessment. Since the countries varied in size, each country was weighted to contribute equally to the mean and standard deviation of the scale. The average and standard deviation of the scale scores are arbitrary and do not affect scale interpretation. To preserve the metric of the original 1995 scale, the 1999 eighth-grade assessment was scaled using students from the countries that participated in both 1995 and 1999. Then students from the countries that tested in 1999 but not 1995 were assigned scores on the basis of the scale.\nAt the eighth grade, TIMSS developed the 2003 scale in the same way as in 1999, preserving the metric \ufb01rst with students from countries that participated in both 1999 and 2003,13 and then assigning scores on the basis of the scale to students tested in 2003 but not the earlier assessment. At fourth grade, because there was no assessment in 1999, the 2003 and 1995 data were linked directly together using students from countries that participated in both assessments, and the\n13 Because the 1995 student data had already been linked to the 1999 student data, it was not necessary to include the 1995 data in the 19992003 calibration.\n\n390\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nstudents tested in 2003 but not 1995 were assigned scores on the basis of the scale.\nTo allow more accurate estimation of summary statistics for student subpopulations, the TIMSS scaling made use of plausible-value technology, whereby \ufb01ve separate estimates of each student\u2019s score were generated on each scale, based on the student\u2019s responses to the items in the student\u2019s booklet and the student\u2019s background characteristics. The \ufb01ve score estimates are known as \u201cplausible values,\u201d and the variability between them encapsulates the uncertainty inherent in the score estimation process.\nIn addition to the scales for science overall, IRT scales also were created for each of the science content areas for the 2003 data. However, insuf\ufb01cient common items were used in 1995 and 1999 to establish reliable IRT content area scales for trend purposes. The trend exhibits presented in Chapter 3 were based on the average percentage of students responding correctly to the common items in each content area.\nEstimating Sampling Error\nBecause the statistics presented in this report are estimates of national performance based on samples of students, rather than the values that could be calculated if every student in every country had answered every question, it is important to have measures of the degree of uncertainty of the estimates. The jackknife procedure was used to estimate the standard error associated with each statistic presented in this report.14 The jackknife standard errors also include an error component due to variation among the \ufb01ve plausible values generated for each student. The use of con\ufb01dence intervals, based on the standard errors, provides a way to make inferences about the population means and proportions in a manner that re\ufb02ects the uncertainty associated with the sample estimates. An estimated sample statistic plus or minus two standard errors represents a 95 percent con\ufb01dence interval for the corresponding population result.\n14 Procedures for computing jackknifed standard errors are presented in Gonzalez, E.J., Galia, J., Arora, A., Erberber, E., and Diaconu, D. (2004), \u201cReporting Student Achievement in Mathematics and Science\u201d in M.O. Martin, I.V.S. Mullis, and S.J. Chrotowski (eds.), TIMSS 2003 Technical Report, Chestnut Hill, MA: Boston College.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n391\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nAssessing Statistical Signi\ufb01cance\nThis report makes extensive use of statistical hypothesis-testing to provide a basis for evaluating the signi\ufb01cance of differences in percentages and in average achievement scores. Each separate test follows the usual convention of holding to 0.05 the probability that reported differences could be due to sampling variability alone. There is one important difference in the way TIMSS 2003 reports signi\ufb01cance tests compared with the practice in 1995 and 1999. In the previous assessments, signi\ufb01cance tests in exhibits where the results of many tests are reported simultaneously were based on a Bonferroni procedure for multiple comparisons. The Bonferroni procedure was not used in TIMSS 2003. The procedure takes into account the number of comparisons being made, which is a function of the number of countries participating. Since this varies from assessment to assessment, the Bonferroni procedure makes it dif\ufb01cult to compare results from one assessment to the next. However, users of the reports should be aware that, following the logic of statistical hypothesis testing, on average, about \ufb01ve percent of statistical tests will be signi\ufb01cant by chance alone.\nSetting International Benchmarks of Student Achievement\nIn order to provide meaningful descriptions of what performance on the TIMSS science scale could mean in terms of the science that students know and can do, TIMSS identi\ufb01ed four points on the scale for use as international benchmarks. Selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally, the advanced benchmark is 625, the high benchmark is 550, the intermediate benchmark is 475, and the low benchmark is 400. Although the fourth- and eighth-grade scales are different, the same benchmark points are used at both grades.\nTo interpret the TIMSS scale scores and analyze achievement at the international benchmarks, TIMSS conducted a scale anchoring analysis to describe achievement of students at those four points on\n\n392\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fAPPENDIX A: OVERVIEW OF TIMSS PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE\nthe scale. Scale anchoring is a way of describing students\u2019 performance at different points on a scale in terms of what they know and can do. It involves a statistical component, in which items that discriminate between successive points on the scale are identi\ufb01ed, and a judgmental component in which subject-matter experts examine the items and generalize to students\u2019 knowledge and understandings.15\n\n15 The scale-anchoring procedure is described fully in Gonzalez, E.J., Galia, J., Arora, A., Erberber, E., and Diaconu, D.

Similar to the procedures used for developing the original TIMSS instruments, developing the TIMSS 2003 tests involved a series of reviews by representatives of the participating countries, experts in science, and testing specialists.1 The National Research Coordinators (NRCs) from each country formally approved the TIMSS 2003 tests, thus accepting them as being suf\ufb01ciently fair to compare their students\u2019 science achievement with that of students from other countries.\nAlthough the tests were developed to represent an agreed-upon framework and were intended to have as much in common across countries as possible, it was inevitable that the match between the TIMSS 2003 test and the science curriculum would not be the same in all countries. To restrict test items to just those topics included in the curricula of all participating countries and covered in the same\n1 See Appendix A for more information on test development.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n411\n\n\fAPPENDIX C: THE TEST-CURRICULUM MATCHING ANALYSIS: SCIENCE\nsequence would severely limit test coverage and restrict the research questions that the study is designed to address. The tests, therefore, inevitably have some items measuring topics unfamiliar to some students in some countries.\nThe Test-Curriculum Matching Analysis (TCMA) was conducted to investigate the appropriateness of the TIMSS 2003 science test for the eighth- and fourth-grade students in the participating countries. TCMA also shows how student performance for individual countries varies when based only on the test questions that are judged to be relevant to their own curricula.2\nTo gather data about the extent to which the TIMSS 2003 tests were relevant to the curricula of the participating countries, each NRC reported whether each item was in that country\u2019s intended curriculum at the grade tested (eighth or fourth grade in most countries). The NRC was asked to choose a person or persons who were very familiar with the curriculum at these grades to make this determination. Since an item might be in the curriculum for some but not all students in a country, an item was to be determined appropriate if it was in the intended curriculum for more than 50 percent of the students. The NRCs had considerable \ufb02exibility in selecting items and may have considered items inappropriate for other reasons. All participants returned the information for analysis except Syria at eighth grade and Yemen at fourth grade.\nExhibits C.1 and C.2 present the TCMA results for the TIMSS 2003 tests at eighth and fourth grades. Exhibit C.1 shows the average percent correct on the science items selected as appropriate by each country. Exhibit C.2 shows the standard errors corresponding to the percentages presented in Exhibit C.1.\nIn Exhibit C.1, the last row of the exhibit shows the number of items (score points) identi\ufb01ed as appropriate in each country.3 At the eighth grade, the percentage of score points ranged from 100 percent (206 score points) in Israel and Saudi Arabia to 31 percent (63 score points) in Belgium (Flemish). Generally, the proportion of items judged\n2 Because there may also be curriculum areas covered in some countries that are not covered by the TIMSS 2003 tests, the TCMA does not provide complete information about how well the tests cover the curricula of the countries.\n3 Some items were assigned more score points than others. In particular, some items had two parts, and some extended-response items were scored on a two-point scale. The TCMA uses score points in order to give the same weight to items given them in test scoring.\n\n412\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fAPPENDIX C: THE TEST-CURRICULUM MATCHING ANALYSIS: SCIENCE\nappropriate was high, with 40 of the 50 participants indicating that items representing three-quarters or more of the score points (154 out of a possible 206) were appropriate. Only Belgium (Flemish) and Chile considered less than 50 percent of the score points appropriate. At the fourth grade, the percentage of score points ranged from 98 percent (161 score points) in Hungary, the United States, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, and Armenia to 27 percent (44 score points) in Japan. Eighteen of the 28 fourth-grade participants indicated that items representing three-quarters or more of the score points (124 out of a possible 165) were appropriate.\nSince most countries indicated that some items were not included in their intended curriculum at the grade tested, the data were analyzed to determine whether the inclusion of these items had any effect on the international performance comparisons.4\nThe first column in Exhibit C.1 shows the average percent correct on all test items for each participant. Subsequent columns show the performance of each participant on those items judged appropriate by the participant listed at the head of the column. Participants are presented in order of their performance based on average percent correct on all items, from highest to lowest. To interpret this exhibit, reading across a row provides the average percent correct for the students in that country on the items selected by each of the countries listed across the top of the exhibit. For example, at the eighth-grade, Singapore, where the average percent correct was 65 percent on its own set of items, had 63 percent correct for the items selected by Chinese Taipei, 63 percent for the items selected by Estonia, 62 percent for the items selected by Korea, and so forth. The column for a country listed across the top shows how each of the other participants performed on the subset of items selected as appropriate for that country\u2019s students. Using the set of items selected by Bulgaria as an example, on average, 63 percent of these items were answered correctly by students in Singapore, 62 percent by students in Chinese Taipei, 58 percent by students in Estonia, 58 percent by those in Korea, and so forth.

They show that the selection of items for the participating countries varied somewhat in average dif\ufb01culty, ranging from 42 percent for those chosen by Scotland and Jordan at the eighth grade to 48 percent for those chosen by Belgium (Flemish). Similarly at the fourth grade, the average percent correct ranged from 52 percent for those items chosen by Japan to 59 percent for those chosen by Chinese Taipei, Italy, Russian Federation, and Indiana State. Despite these differences in the dif\ufb01culty of the selected items, the overall message of Exhibit C.1 is that different item selections do not make a major difference in how well countries perform relative to one another. The items selected by some countries were more dif\ufb01cult than those selected by others. The relative performance of countries on various item selections did vary somewhat, but generally not in a statistically signi\ufb01cant manner.5\nComparing the diagonal element for a country with the overall average percent correct shows the difference between performance on the subset of items chosen as appropriate and performance on the test as a whole. In general, there were only small increases in each country\u2019s performance on its own subset of items. To illustrate, the average percent correct for Singapore across all eighth-grade science items was 62 percent. The diagonal element shows that Singaporean students had a slightly greater average percent correct (65 percent) across the set of items selected as appropriate for Singapore than they did overall. Almost all participants had a difference of one or two percentage points between the two performance measures, with the largest difference \u2013 seven percent \u2013 for Belgium (Flemish) (49 percent compared with 56 percent).\n5 Small differences in performance shown in this exhibit are not statistically signi\ufb01cant. The standard errors for the estimated average percent correct statistics are in Exhibit C.2. It can be said with 95 percent con\ufb01dence that the value for the entire population falls between the sample estimate plus or minus two standard errors.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n417\n\n\fAPPENDIX C: THE TEST-CURRICULUM MATCHING ANALYSIS: SCIENCE\nExhibit C.2: Standard Errors for the Test-Curriculum Matching Analysis \u2013 Science\n\nTIMSS2003\n8 SCIENCE\nGrade\n\nInstructions: Read across the row to compare that country's performance based on the test items included by each of the countries across the top.

Countries that had relatively high or low performance across all the science items also had relatively high or low performance on each of the various sets of items selected for the TCMA. For example, at the eighth grade, Singapore had the highest average percent correct on the test as a whole and on all of the different item selections, with Chinese Taipei, Estonia, and Korea next in order of performance on practically all selections of items. Although there are some changes in the ordering of countries based on the items selected for the TCMA, most of these differences are within the boundaries of sampling error. As an example, consider the 195 score points selected by Armenia. The students in Armenia did a little better on these items than on the test as a whole, with 39 percent correct on these items, on average, compared with 38 percent correct on all items. However, most other countries also did better on these particular items, with an international average of 44 percent correct on the items selected by Armenia. All 29 participants that performed better than Armenia on the overall test also performed better on the items selected by Armenia.\nThe TCMA results provide evidence that the TIMSS 2003 science test provides a reasonable basis for comparing achievement of the participating countries and benchmarking entities. This result is not unexpected, since making the test as fair as possible was a major consideration in test development. The fact that the majority of countries indicated that most items were appropriate for their students means that the different average percent correct estimates were based on essentially the same items. Insofar as countries rejected items that would be dif\ufb01cult for their students, these items tended to be dif\ufb01cult for students in other countries as well. The analysis shows that omitting such items tends to improve the results for that country, but also tends to improve the results for all other countries, so that the overall pattern of results is largely unaffected.\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n421\n\n\fAPPENDIX D: PERCENTILES AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT\n\n422\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fAPPENDIX D: PERCENTILES AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT\nAppendix D\nPercentiles and Standard Deviations of Science Achievement\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n423\n\n\fSOURCE: IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003\n\nAPPENDIX D: PERCENTILES AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT\nExhibit D.1: Percentiles of Achievement in Science\n\nCountries\nArmenia Australia Bahrain Belgium (Flemish) Botswana Bulgaria Chile Chinese Taipei Cyprus Egypt England Estonia Ghana Hong Kong, SAR Hungary Indonesia Iran, Islamic Rep. of Israel Italy Japan Jordan Korea, Rep. of Latvia Lebanon Lithuania Macedonia, Rep. of Malaysia Moldova, Rep. of Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Norway Palestinian Nat'l Auth.

Staff from the national research centers in each participating country, the International Association for the Evaluation for Educational Achievement (IEA), the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center (ISC) at Boston College, advisors, and funding agencies worked closely to develop and implement TIMSS 2003. The project would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of all involved. Below, the individuals and organizations are acknowledged for their contributions. Given that implementing TIMSS 2003 has spanned approximately four years and involved so many people and organizations, this list may not pay heed to all who contributed throughout the life of the project. Any omission is inadvertent. TIMSS 2003 also acknowledges the students, teachers, and school principals who contributed their time and effort to the study. This report would not be possible without them.\nFunding Agencies Funding for the international coordination of TIMSS 2003 was provided by the National Center for Education Statistics of the US Department of Education, the US National Science Foundation, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Boston College and participating countries. Valena Plisko, Patrick Gonzales,\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n449\n\n\fAPPENDIX G: ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nElois Scott, and Eugene Owen of the National Center for Education Statistics; Janice Earle, Larry Suter, Finbarr Sloane, and Elizabeth VanderPutten of the National Science Foundation; Marlaine Lockheed of the World Bank; and Maen Nsour of the UNDP each played a crucial role in making TIMSS 2003 possible and for ensuring the quality of the study. Each participating country was responsible for funding national project costs and implementing TIMSS 2003 in accordance with the international procedures.\nManagement and Operations\nTIMSS 2003 was conducted under the auspices of the IEA. The study was directed by Michael O. Martin and Ina V.S. Mullis, and managed centrally by the staff of the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, Lynch School of Education. Although the study was directed by the International Study Center and its staff members implemented various parts of TIMSS 2003, important activities also were carried out in centers around the world. In the IEA Secretariat, Hans Wagemaker, Executive Director, was responsible for overseeing fundraising and country participation. The IEA Secretariat also managed the ambitious translation veri\ufb01cation effort conducted for the \ufb01eld test and main assessment and recruited international quality control monitors in each country. The IEA Data Processing Center was responsible for processing and verifying the data from the participating countries and for constructing the international database. Statistics Canada was responsible for collecting and evaluating the sampling documentation from each country and for calculating the sampling weights. Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey provided consultation on psychometric issues as well as technical support and software for scaling the achievement data. The Project Management Team, comprising the study directors and representatives from the International Study Center, IEA, Statistics Canada, and Educational Testing Service, met regularly throughout the study to discuss the study\u2019s progress, procedures, and schedule.\n\n450\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fAPPENDIX G: ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nIEA SECRETARIAT\nAlejandro Tiana, IEA Chair Hans Wagemaker, Executive Director Barbara Malak-Minkiewicz, Manager Membership Relations Juriaan Hartenberg, Financial Manager Isabelle Braun-Gemin, Financial Manager Assistant Katazyna Krohn, Management Assistant\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER AT BOSTON COLLEGE\nMichael O.

This involved obtaining funding for the project; participating in the development of the instruments and procedures; conducting \ufb01eld tests; participating in and conducting training sessions; translating the instruments and procedural manuals into the local language; selecting the sample of schools and students; working with the schools to arrange for the testing; arranging for data collection, coding, and data entry; preparing the data \ufb01les for submission to the IEA Data Processing Center; contributing to the development of the international reports; and preparing national reports. The way in which the national centers operated and the resources that were available varied considerably across the TIMSS 2003 countries. In some countries, the tasks were conducted centrally, while in others, various components were subcontracted to other organizations. In some countries, resources were more than adequate, while in some cases, the national centers were operating with limited resources. All of the TIMSS 2003 National Research Coordinators and their staff members are to be commended for their professionalism and their dedication in conducting all aspects of TIMSS.\nARGENTINA\nMargarita Poggi Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Informaci\u00f3n y Evaluaci\u00f3n Paraguay 1657, 2er Piso \u2013 Of 201 Buenos Aires C1062ACA\n\n456\n\nTIMSS & PIRLS INTERNATIONAL STUDY CENTER, LYNCH SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, BOSTON COLLEGE\n\n\fARMENIA, REPUBLIC OF\nArsen Baghdasaryan Yerevan State University 26 Halabyan Str Apt 31 Yerevan 375036\nAUSTRALIA\nSue Thomson Australian Council for Educational Research(ACER) 19 Prospect Hill Rd.
