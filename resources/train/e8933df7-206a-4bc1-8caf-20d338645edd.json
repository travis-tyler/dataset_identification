[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Habitat loss is a major source of biodiversity decline and extinction worldwide and is continuing at a rapid pace (Morcatty et al., 2013). In the U.S., private land accounts for approximately 60% of land area and harbors high levels of biodiversity due to historical homesteading patterns where land with more productive natural resources was settled and privatized first (Scott et al., 2001). These lands, which are integral to the conservation of biodiversity, are often the most vulnerable to habitat degradation and loss through land-use conversion and fragmentation (Knight, 1999;Maestas et al., 2003). One of the most significant innovations for protecting private land in recent decades has come in the form of conservation easements, which have culminated in placing 47 million acres under protection as of 2011 (Land Trust Alliance, 2011). Although a major achievement, this land area represents only 3.6% of private land in the U.S., suggesting that additional mechanisms to incentivize conservation of private land are warranted. This study examines recreation as one such possible mechanism, with a focus on wildlife-associated recreation, defined here as fishing, hunting, and wildlife-watching. Since at least 1930, recreation has been highlighted as an incentive to better conserve U.S. private lands (Leopold, 1930). Leopold suggested that a private landowner who is able to earn revenue from hunting wildlife would be motivated to manage the land to support wildlife habitat and game populations. Since then, studies in various locales have shown that under the correct governance structures, payments for wildlife-associated recreation can improve habitat conservation (Dickson et al., 2009;Lindsey et al., 2007). For example, in England, landowners with hunting on their property maintained and planted more woodland and hedgerows than those who did not have hunting (Oldfield et al., 2003). These studies illustrate the potential of recreation to enhance conservation outcomes, but a good understanding of the scale, distribution, and conservation effect of recreational use on private land across the entire U.S. remains an important research need. National estimates of wildlife-associated recreation released every five years by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) suffer from unreported and relatively large standard error estimates as well as lack of detail on private land estimates (USFWS, 2011(USFWS, , 2006(USFWS, , 2001. Additional studies have evaluated nationwide recreational use on agricultural lands but those studies exclude vast areas of forestland in the U.S. and don't evaluate the connection of recreation to conservation (Bagi and Reeder, 2012;Brown and Reeder, 2007). Drawing upon multiple years and multiple sources of surveys, this study remedies many of these problems and provides the most detailed and precise estimates available of private land recreation in the U.S. This study assesses the land area, land use, property size, spending, regional variation, and conservation practices of private properties utilized for recreation in the U.S. In addition to evaluating habitat conservation practices, this study seeks to shed light on the anticipated effect of recreation on land fragmentation, which is a major threat to ecosystems (Saunders et al., 1991). For example, if the economic return from certain types of recreation is higher on large properties compared to smaller properties, then they could provide an economic incentive to reduce fragmentation of land."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Data from three independently conducted national surveys is used to assess recreational use on private land in the U.S.: 1) the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service National Survey on Fishing, Hunting & Wildlife Associated Recreation (referred to in the text as the \"National Survey\"), 2) the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), and 3) the U.S. Forest Service National Woodland Owners Survey (NWOS). The National Survey is used for most of the estimates in this study, and is supplemented with data from the ARMS and NWOS to shed light on the primary land use associated with recreation, the conservation practices associated with recreation, and the motivation of owning forestland (Table   1). For this study, private land is defined as land that is not owned by federal, state or local governments, and includes land under conservation easements and land in federal land retirement programs. The National Survey evaluates only the subset of recreation that refers to fishing, hunting and wildlife-watching, which is referred to as \"wildlife-associated recreation.\" The ARMS uses a broad definition of recreation, which includes activities such as horseback riding or farm tours, which may not require wildlife or be dependent on wildlife. Throughout the paper, recreational use estimates from the ARMS data that includes all recreational activities is generally referred to as \"recreation broadly defined\" or \"all types of recreation.\" The NWOS gathers information on two recreational categories: 1) hunting and 2) recreation other than hunting, which could include any recreation activities such as horseback riding, driving all-terrain-vehicles, and fishing. Section 3.2 evaluates land uses associated with recreation, focusing on forestland, grazing land and cropland. The ARMS data, which surveys grazing land and cropland operators, requires respondents to choose a primary use based on revenue, meaning these land use categories are mutually exclusive, even though some cropland could be grazed as a secondary use (and vice versa). In contrast, forestland and grazing land estimates come from separate surveys (NWOS and ARMS) and likely contain some overlap, as grazing can occur on forestland. The USDA estimates that approximately 10% of forestland is grazed, with remaining grazing land primarily occurring on rangelands (USDA NRCS, 2003). To take this into account, when combining the land use area estimates as a comparison to wildlife-associated recreation, grazing land area is reduced by the 10% of forestland area that is estimated to be grazed in order to avoid doublecounting. Although overlap between cropland and forestland is possible, these land uses tend to be less compatible and overlap is likely to be small. "}, {"section_title": "The National Survey", "text": "The National Survey gathers information every five years about participation in and spending for fishing, hunting, and wildlife-watching in the U.S. It is a multistage probability sample with coverage in all 50 states that was conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each survey year the population was independently sampled and asked identical questions about what recreationists pay to access or own private land. This study uses the National Survey datasets collected in 2001, 2006, and 2011. The three survey years were pooled to improve the precision of estimates, increasing the sample size to a total of 93,725 observations with 4,957 observations of individuals who leased, owned or paid fees to access private land for wildlife-associated recreation. Prior to pooling, some subsets of the data had fewer than 200 observations in a single year resulting in large standard error estimates for many of the estimated parameters (for example in 2011, there were only 175 respondents with hunting leases). Pooling across time sacrifices temporal detail in order to improve geographical understanding (Verma et al., 2009). An analysis of variables of interest revealed few significant differences over time. As such, pooling the data resulted in improved geographical precision with minimal loss of detail about changes over time. As a result, the results reported are estimates for an average year over the course of 2001-2011. The USFWS reports written every five years on the National Survey contain some similar estimates as calculated in this study. However, the analyses in those reports and in this article differ in several ways: 1) the estimates in this manuscript are much more precise due to the pooling of three survey years, 2) the estimates in this article treat missing data by omitting missing values from calculations (generally a more supported method of dealing with missing data (Allison, 2002)), 3) the estimates in this manuscript report standard error estimates that are not provided in the reports, and 4) this manuscript contains numerous calculations that are not provided in the public reports, such as how spending varies with size of property used, and an analysis of regional variation in private land recreation (Appendix A)."}, {"section_title": "Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)", "text": "Fourteen years (1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012) of ARMS data was used to provide insight about grazing land and cropland earning income from recreation, the conservation practices associated with recreational income earners, and to corroborate the National Survey lease estimates. The ARMS is an annual survey of farm businesses and operators that is independently sampled every year and designed to be representative of the continental U.S. The farm population includes all establishments that produced and sold, or would normally have sold, at least $1,000 of agricultural products during the previous year. This survey asks farmers and ranchers about the total income from all types of recreational activities such as hunting, fishing, and horseback riding. Similar to the National Survey, the 14 years of data were pooled to improve precision, obtaining an overall sample of 242,600 farms and ranches, with 6,417 of those farms and ranches earning income from recreation. This ARMS survey has important differences from the National Survey in that it excludes any of the approximately 422 million acres of private forestlands in the U.S. that do not sell at least $1,000 of agricultural products (Nickerson et al. 2011). Estimates of land area earning income from recreation by livestock and cropland operators are based on a broader definition of recreation than that used in the National Survey, which evaluates only fishing, hunting and wildlife-watching.

These data were used to assess the leasing of forestland for both hunting and non-hunting (fishing, horseback riding or camping) recreation, as well as to assess recreation as a motivation for owning private forestland."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "The National Survey and ARMS administrators calculated the survey sampling weights that are used to estimate population totals. The concept behind sampling weights is that an individual surveyed with a sampling probability of represents 1/ individuals in the population, where 1/ is the sampling weight. If Xi is a measurement of variable X on person i, the following equation is used to estimate the total for the population, \u0302, which is known as the Horvitz-Thompson estimator (Horvitz and Thompson, 1952): The variance calculation of the Horvitz-Thompson estimate of the total is: With \u03c0ij being the joint inclusion probability of two individuals i and j, which is the probability that both individuals i and j are eventually in the sample. Xj is the measurement of variable X on individual j, and is the sampling probability of individual j. Mean estimates are derived by dividing the estimated total, \u0302 (eq.1), by the population size, \u0302, which is the sum of the sampling weights or: Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for estimates were calculated by using a normal distribution for the estimate, i.e. by adding and subtracting 1.96 standard errors (Lumley, 2011). The sampling weight variables were originally developed to calculate national estimates of variables for an individual survey year. In order to obtain an average annual estimate from 1(2) multiple survey years in a pooled data analysis, the sampling weights were divided by the number of survey years pooled (Lumley, 2011). Regression results were obtained by fitting a generalized linear model that accounts for complex survey data with sampling weights. The variables used for these regressions exhibited characteristics of the Poisson distribution and a quasi-Poisson link function was used in these regressions. These calculations were performed using the R statistical computing language using the 'survey' package (Lumley, 2014(Lumley, , 2004; R Core Team, 2015). The National Survey includes two separate datasets for each survey year, one for sportspersons and one for wildlife-watchers. Calculating the overall totals across both surveys required summing the Horvitz-Thompson estimated totals and the associated standard error estimates. To calculate means across the two surveys, the Graybill-Deal estimator was used to create an unbiased composite mean between the two estimates while assuming independence of the mean estimates (Graybill and Deal, 1959). Using estimated means of the wildlife-watcher survey, \u00b51, and sportsperson survey, \u00b52, a weight, b, was calculated based on the estimated variance, S 2 , of each mean using the following formula b=S1 2 / (S1 2 + S2 2 ). This weight was used to estimate the composite mean, \u00b5*, using the equation \u00b5* = (1-b) \u00b51 + b \u00b52. Nominal U.S. Dollar amounts obtained from the National Survey were adjusted for inflation using the U.S. Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index. All dollar amounts in this manuscript are presented as 2011 real dollars. Regional estimates were broken down by U.S. Census Region (Fig. 1)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Land Area", "text": "Approximately 32.7% of the private land in the U.S. (440.1 million acres) is either leased or owned for wildlife-associated recreation. Hunting land is the primary contributor to the land area, accounting 80.9% (355.9 million acres) of the total, followed by wildlife-watching at 11.3% (49.9 million acres) and fishing at 7.8% (34.3 million acres). The total land area is divided into two categories for each type of recreation, leased and owned, which respectively account for 54% and 46% of the total. The majority of land used for fishing and wildlife-watching is owned primarily for that purpose accounting for 80.2% and 82.6% of that land area. Hunting was distinctive in that only 38.2% of its land area was owned primarily for that purpose, while the majority of hunting land (61.8%) was leased. Leased properties on average are significantly larger than owned properties across fishing, hunting and wildlife-watching (p < 0.05). However, a greater number of people who lease land do so as members of clubs compared to those who own land (p < 0.05). To control for this, the density of use, or mean number of acres used per-person, was compared across activity types. Density of use for fishing and wildlife-watching properties was relatively high and statistically similar ( (Table 3). Owners with larger than average properties are more likely to earn revenue from recreation than landowners with smaller properties. For example, only 7.3% of forest landowners earn income from recreation, yet those individuals own 33.5% of all forestland, with similar patterns occurring in grazing land and cropland (Table 3). Hunting is \"very important\" or \"important\" to individuals who own 44.4% of private forestland (212 million acres). Non-hunting recreation is \"very important\" or \"important\" to people who own 37% of forestland (178 million acres). These estimates suggest that forestlands are a significant contributor to the total amount of private land owned primarily for wildlifeassociated recreation (section 3.1 above). Because forestland, rangeland, and cropland together make up almost 90% of all private land in the U.S (Nickerson et al., 2011), the leased land area estimates from this section can be used as a comparison of estimates from the National Survey (section 3.1 above). After reducing grazing land area by an estimated 10% of forestland that is grazed (USDA NRCS, 2003), the combined estimates of forestland, grazing land, and cropland results in an estimated 257.9 million acres earning income from recreation broadly defined. These estimates align with the findings of the National Survey analysis, which estimates 235.6 million acres leased for the more narrowly defined subset of wildlife-associated recreation, which excludes activities such as horseback riding, farm tours, etc."}, {"section_title": "Property Size", "text": "Analysis of the National Survey reveals distinctive patterns in property size classes that are used for wildlife-associated recreation. Hunters spend more to lease or own land of larger size classes compared to anglers or wildlife-watchers (Fig 2). The majority of spending by hunters for leasing or owning land goes to properties greater than 50 acres, while the majority of spending by anglers and wildlife-watchers is on properties smaller than 50 acres ( Fig. 2a & 2b). A similar pattern emerges when evaluating total land area leased in different size classes. Hunting leases greater than 1,000 acres make up an estimated 40% of all land used for all types of wildlife-associated recreation (176 million acres SE 39.0 million acres) (Fig. 2c). In terms of land area owned primarily for fishing, hunting and wildlife-watching ( Fig. 2d), each recreation type has the majority of its land in the 50-1,000 acre size class, but hunters own more land in all three size classes (p < 0.05), with the greatest differences in the two largest size classes (Fig. 2d).

(Data source: USFWS National Survey 2001 The ARMS data, which measures income from all types of recreation, shows a pattern of increasing percentage of landowners earning income from recreation as the size of the property increases (Fig. 3). This further illustrates how low overall participation rates (i.e. 2.3% of livestock operators) belie a much larger area of land (18.2% of all grazing land) that is used to earn income from recreation. In order to evaluate how price paid per acre responded to increasing property size, a generalized linear model applied to the National Survey revealed that recreationists is most categories pay less per acre as property size increases (fishing and wildlife-watching leases had small sample sizes with no significant differences and are not reported). Properties owned for fishing and wildlife-watching exhibited the strongest decline in price paid per acre with increasing property size (coefficients = -0.49 and -0.32 respectively), while properties owned and leased for hunting exhibit much slower declines in price paid per acre (coefficients = -0.04 and - 0.003 respectively). This suggests that while land area used for wildlife-associated recreation exhibits the characteristic of diminishing returns with increasing property size, the pattern is least pronounced for hunting properties-especially hunting leases (Fig. 4)."}, {"section_title": "Expenditures and Participation", "text": "According to the National Survey, hunters, anglers, and wildlife-watchers in the U.S. spend $17.1 billion annually to lease, access, and own private land for recreation.

The decline in price paid for hunting leases is the slowest, while mean price paid per person per acre to own wildlife watching and fishing properties declines substantially after approximately 25 acres. This suggests hunters are willing to pay higher prices than anglers and wildlife-watchers for larger properties.

In contrast, the higher overall spending for day-use fees by hunters, is driven by the average amount of money paid for access-hunters spend an average of $591, while anglers and wildlife-watchers pay on average $128.3 and $73.3 respectively (Table 4). Individuals on average pay significantly more to own properties for wildlifeassociated recreation than they do to lease property, likely due to the greater variety of costs (mortgage payments, taxes, maintenance, etc.) and benefits (exclusive control, investment benefits, etc.) associated with owning land versus leasing land. There are no large regional differences in mean payments within the same activity and form of access, however, participation rates vary regionally, but only for hunting. The South has significantly higher participation rates of hunters leasing land (16.4% vs. \u2264 6.0% for other regions) and paying day-use fees (10.6% vs \u2264 3.6% for other regions), resulting in much greater total spending in that region.

This analysis reveals that livestock and cropland operators who earn recreational income (recreation broadly defined) are significantly more likely to participate in government cost-share programs and land retirement programs (p < 0.01) ( Table 6). Landowners who earn recreational income are also more likely to pay for private professional conservation practices at the 10% significance level (p = 0.08). The significant differences in mean amounts spent/received remain even after controlling for the size of property in a generalized linear model.

Significance codes: \".\" = 0.1, \"*\" = 0.05, \"**\" = 0.01, \"***\" = 0.001. USDA, 2012). The scale of recreational use compared to these programs illustrates the enormous influence that recreational use has on private land and wildlife habitat in the U.S. Furthermore, because hunting is the largest contributor to the land area used for recreation, these findings suggests that hunters, particularly big game hunters, can be especially influential in affecting management practices on significant areas of wildlife habitat in the U.S. The type of land used for wildlife-associated recreation also points to its impact on conservation. Private grazing lands and forestlands maintain relatively intact ecosystems and provide habitat for wildlife and support biodiversity (Brunson and Huntsinger, 2008;Goldstein et al., 2006). These lands are utilized heavily for recreation, with 18% of grazing lands and 33% of forestlands generating income from recreation (broadly defined), not including a substantial area of land that is used or owned for recreation that does not generate income (Table 2. d.;Butler and Workman, 1993). Freshwater resources and wetlands associated with the 34 million acres used for fishing, while small in comparison with hunting lands, are critical for conservation as freshwater resources host increased biodiversity, many rare and endangered species, and often entirely different species pools than surrounding habitats (Dudgeon et al., 2006). The 50 million acres of land owned and leased for the primary purpose of wildlife-watching may also have important conservation value, due to high amenity values that often correlate with other important natural resource features, such as designated wilderness areas and increased environmental quality (Smith and Krannich, 2000). This study uncovered a positive correlation between conservation practices and recreation, with recreational income earners on grazing land and cropland more likely to participate in government conservation programs and to pay for private conservation practices (Table 6). The economics of recreational use, with distinct preferences for land sizes for different activities, could also influence fragmentation patterns. Because fragmentation is a major threat to ecosystems (Saunders et al., 1991), hunters, with their preference for larger properties, could provide a conservation benefit as they may help to reduce subdivision of large tracts of land ( Fig.   2 & Fig. 4). Previous research has found a saturation effect of property size on landowner's willingness to pay for amenity values such as recreation or personal enjoyment of a property. One study found that as the size of property increased beyond a certain threshold, landowners obtained few additional personal benefits from amenity values (Oviedo et al., 2012). The findings of this study provide support for such an effect with recreation, but uncovers an important distinction between hunters and other types of recreational users, i.e. hunters appear to have a much higher threshold property size than wildlife watchers or anglers. The lower threshold for wildlife-watchers or anglers could result in higher densities of development and increased land fragmentation for prime fishing and wildlife-watching areas compared to hunting areas. Diversified revenue streams are another mechanism to enhance conservation of working lands by encouraging a more heterogeneous landscape and reducing the volatility of cash flows associated with activities such as livestock operations (Bowman and Zilberman, 2013;Goldstein et al., 2006;Macaulay, 2015;Wetzel et al., 2012). Recreational income has been shown to provide a stable and complementary income source for ranchers (DeLaney, 2011). Because financial stress from drought or fluctuations in agricultural or forestry markets could drive negative environmental impacts (such as overgrazing or subdivision of properties), recreational income could provide financial stability to reduce these impacts. Data from the NWOS suggests that hunting is quite compatible with other recreational pursuits given that 92% of non-hunting leases co-occur with hunting leases. However, additional research on the compatibility of recreation with agricultural or forestry operations, as well as compatibility of specific intrarecreational pursuits such as hunting and wildlife-watching is warranted to further evaluate the potential of recreation to contribute to diversified revenue streams (Clawson and Stewart, 1966). Regional differences in wildlife-associated recreation appear to be affected by state policies and regional social mores. In terms of state policy, several states in the Midwest have implemented programs to incentivize free public access on private land, which could drive low leasing participation in that region. For example, Wisconsin's Forest Tax law and Michigan's Commercial Forest Act together give tax breaks on 5.2 million acres of forestland under the condition of providing free access for recreation (Michigan DNR, 2011;Rickenbach, 2011). With respect to culture, Gentle et al. (1999) suggested that the predominant ancestry of the European immigrants who settled each region of the U.S. could be a driver of regional differences. Although the expansive areas of public land in the West that are open to free recreation may reduce demand for private recreation, recent research on private land hunting in California (a state that is about 50% public land) did not find a lack of demand by hunters as a reason for not leasing (Macaulay, 2015). Instead, landowner's lack of trust of hunters and the perceived potential to interfere with ranching operations appeared to be of greater concern. Additional research into regional variation could yield insights into the effect of policy, culture and availability of public land on recreational use. Despite the positive conservation potential of wildlife-associated recreation, it is important to note that conservation impacts can vary depending on governance, the intensity of use, and land management practices (Macaulay et al., 2013;Reed and Merenlender, 2008). The conservation benefits of hunting depend on a system of scientifically-developed game laws and effective enforcement, which curtails problems of over-harvesting and poaching. Some land managers oriented towards recreation are careful to maintain and improve ecological conditions for wildlife through practices like protecting riparian zones to enhance habitat for wildlife (DeLaney, 2011). On the other hand, game managers who breed deer in containment fences for larger antlers or who plow native grasslands to plant food plots can create a host of conservation problems ranging from spread of disease to introduction of invasive species. In a similar way, anglers may work to enhance stream habitat, but they may also introduce exotic fish species that can disrupt the aquatic ecosystem. Individual wildlife-watchers who build homes in areas with abundant wildlife may work to improve wildlife habitat, but because they tend to own relatively small properties (Fig. 2), land subdivision and increased housing density in these areas may result in a cumulative loss of habitat and wildlife. Finally, land that is used for wildlifeassociated recreation may not be permanently conserved or managed to benefit threatened & endangered species. Because of the possibility of negative impacts associated with recreation, policy mechanisms can be an important way to enhance the positive conservation outcomes of recreation, while minimizing the negative ones."}, {"section_title": "Policy Implications", "text": "Three policy mechanisms to incentivize positive conservation practices and discourage problematic practices are currently in place in particular states and are relevant for discussion: 1) state incentive programs that provide regulatory flexibility in exchange for conservation practices, 2) use-value property tax policies, and 3) recreational use statues. State incentive programs are generally voluntary programs that provide landowners with increased flexibility of timing and amount of hunting harvest in exchange for implementing wildlife habitat improvement (CDFW, 2015;TPWD, 2015). Evaluating the successes and challenges of these state programs could be an important step in identifying sound policies that can then be expanded to other states and to recreational uses besides hunting. Secondly, use-value property tax policies could provide additional conservation benefits if tailored to recreational use. Use-value property tax assessment is a widespread policy tool that is used to maintain open space usually by appraising property at the value of its agricultural or forestland use rather than at its highest and best use (Anderson, 1993). This tool is used to reduce tax burdens on agricultural producers who keep their land in agricultural production instead of developing it into more intensive land uses. In some states, land devoted to wildlife management purposes is eligible for use-value assessment (Oklahoma, 2014;TPWD, 2014), and Texas explicitly requires landowners to perform specific wildlife management practices on their property to qualify for the assessment. However, in other states, land used for recreation or wildlife management instead of agriculture is not eligible for the use-value assessment (Kansas, 2014;New York State, 2014). Making wildlife-associated recreation eligible for use-value property tax benefits has the potential to discourage conversion of these lands to other uses, to reduce the intensity of agricultural production, and yield improved conservation practices by tying the assessment to implementation of conservation practices. Thirdly, state recreational-use statutes redefine the duty of care that landowners owe recreational users, often providing some form of liability protection for allowing recreational use. This reduces risk to landowners for having recreational users on their property. All states have implemented these statutes with details varying among them (Centner, 2001), however, few if any tie conservation practices or land protection to the benefits provided. These statutes could be modified to encourage implementation of conservation practices for wildlife and discourage practices that can have negative environmental consequences. Finally, given the major role of hunting in private land recreation, regulatory proposals to limit or ban hunting should consider the potential unintended environmental consequences that could result from such regulations. These include changes to the conservation practices that are correlated with recreational use as well as the reduction in revenue and value of land used for hunting that could make it more vulnerable to subdivision or development to alternative uses."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The results of this study suggest that recreation on private land can be a win-win for landowners and conservationists by providing revenue while encouraging conservation practices. It also illustrates an enormous private sector recreation market that can be harnessed to encourage positive conservation outcomes and reduce negative impacts. This analysis shows that private land recreation warrants consideration in land use planning and conservation agendas due to both economic impact (over $17.1 billion annually) and land area utilized (440.1 million acres). Landowners with recreational income implement conservation practices at higher rates than those without, giving support to the concept that recreation incentivizes conservation. The economic benefits of recreation disproportionately goes to forest and grazing land, which are particularly important for maintaining wildlife habitat and biodiversity. Hunting dominates the land area used for recreation, and is unique from other types of recreation in that spending goes to larger properties, which may reduce economic pressures to fragment land. Expanding efforts to work with hunters and other recreational users to implement sustainable management practices and ecosystem enhancement could yield conservation benefits on millions of acres of wildlife habitat."}]
