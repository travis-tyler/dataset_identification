The biomarkers amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or amyloid and tau load via positron emission tomography (PET) have become indispensable in the AD research field, especially as part of clinical trials for disease modification and secondary prevention [3] [4] [5] [6] . Nonetheless, a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological disease mechanisms as well as the discovery of diagnostic and prognostic markers that are inexpensive and minimally invasive to obtain would enhance the development of therapeutic interventions.\nCurrently, CSF and PET biomarkers are commonly used for the early diagnosis and prognosis of AD [7] [8] [9] . However PET imaging is fairly expensive and not universally available and the procedure for obtaining a PET scan as well as CSF data are relatively invasive. Given this, complementing these highly specific biomarker modalities with markers in more readily accessible biofluids would mark an important step forward. Consequently, many initiatives have been undertaken to discover and validate blood-based biomarkers for AD pathology [10, 11] , but so far results have been limited, due to small sample sizes, single modality analyses or other methodological issues [12] . One critical issue so far has been the design (comparing individuals with AD-type dementia with controls), which made the studies unsuitable for discovery of markers for the preclinical disease phase. To seek markers for the preclinical phase, a more sensitive and gradual approach has been proposed, described as the \"endophenotype approach\" where discovery is predicted on a measure of pathology [13] . Therefore, we designed the current study to enhance blood-based biomarker discovery by performing a series of omics techniques (e.g., proteomics, metabolomics, genomics) in a large cohort across the AD clinical disease spectrum, using an endophenotype approach.\nThis study was performed as a part of the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's disease (EMIF-AD; http://www.emif.eu). Funded through the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), the EMIF project was established to facilitate the process of reusing and combining existing healthcare data with a focus on two therapeutic areas in the first instance: metabolic diseases and AD. One of the main aims of the EMIF-AD project is to accelerate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AD and to unravel the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, using existing data and existing samples, that would otherwise be inaccessible to research beyond the project teams responsible for the collection. In this report, we will describe the set-up of the EMIF-AD Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) study, the methods as well as the characteristics of the included subjects. The results of the single and multimodal analyses will be described in future publications."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "General outline", "text": "In the EMIF-AD MBD study we retrospectively combined and reused clinical data, samples and scans that had already been collected as part of existing prospective cohort studies. We aimed to include a total of 1000 subjects across the clinical AD spectrum: 400 subjects with normal cognition (NC), 400 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 200 subjects with mild AD-type dementia. To create a balanced design in terms of progression and to enable endophenotype designed biomarker studies, we intended to include 50% A\u03b2-positive (A\u03b2+) individuals and 50% A\u03b2-negative (A\u03b2-) individuals in the groups with NC and MCI. To conduct multimodal analyses, we initially aimed to include subjects who had material from MRI, plasma, DNA and CSF. Later, we adjusted this to subjects with material available in at least two of the modalities listed."}, {"section_title": "Selection of cohorts", "text": "We used the EMIF-AD Catalog (https://emif-catalogue.eu), established as part of the objective of the EMIF which seeks to enable the finding, assessment and reutilization of preexisting data. The EMIF-AD Catalog contains metadata about European AD cohorts, enabling the selection of studies that included subjects who, in this instance, met the following inclusion criteria: data on A\u03b2 status, measured in CSF or by amyloid positron emission tomography (PET); age above 50 years at baseline; and availability of MRI scans, plasma and DNA samples. We identified 16 suitable cohorts. Two cohorts declined due to other research interests. Three cohorts were interested to collaborate, but unable because of legal and/or ethical restrictions, or unavailability of sufficient sample volumes. The 11 selected cohorts included three multicenter studies-EDAR (n = 204) [14] , PharmaCog (n = 147) [15] and DESCRIPA (n = 29) [16] -and eight single centers: Antwerp (n = 149) [17] , Amsterdam (n = 172) [18] , Barcelona Sant Pau (n = 45) [19] , Barcelona IDIBAPS (n = 120) [20] , Leuven (n = 180) [21] , San Sebastian GAP (n = 40) [22] , Gothenburg (n = 95) [23] and Lausanne (n = 40) [24] . Of these 11 cohorts, DESCRIPA, EDAR, PharmaCog, Amsterdam, Antwerp and Gothenburg were linked to partners in the EMIF-AD, while the other five cohorts participated as affiliated data providers (ADP). All cohorts (e.g., partners and ADP) signed a material transfer agreement. The ADP also agreed to the EMIF project agreement. Study managers from each cohort selected the subjects based on the following criteria: age above 50 years at baseline; availability of A\u03b2 status at baseline measured in CSF or via PET; availability of neuropsychological and clinical data; availability of at least two of the following materials: MRI scan, plasma sample, DNA samples or CSF sample; and absence of neurological, psychiatric or somatic disorders that could cause cognitive impairment. The local medical ethical committee in each center approved the study. Subjects had already provided written informed consent at the time of inclusion in the cohort for use of data, samples and scans. Figure 1 shows a timeline of the different events in establishing this cohort, from the search in the EMIF Catalog to the wet-lab analyses."}, {"section_title": "Baseline diagnoses", "text": "In all cohorts, the definition for NC was a normal performance on neuropsychological assessment (within 1.5 SD of the average for age, gender and education). Five cohorts also used a score of 0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [25] and a single cohort used a cutoff value < 3 on the Global Deterioration Scale [26] to determine NC. Diagnosis of MCI was made according to the criteria of Petersen [27] in nine cohorts. Two cohorts used the Winblad et al. criteria [28] to diagnose MCI. All cohorts used the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria [29] to diagnose AD-type dementia.

Medication use and comorbidities were classified into a number of categories, for which we created dichotomous variables (Table 1) .\nCognitive data were collected in all cohorts. The cognitive tests used varied across centers. Only the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered in all centers and was available for nearly all subjects (n = 1216). We requested at least one test from the following cognitive domains: memory, language, attention, executive functioning and visuoconstruction [16] . For each cognitive domain, we selected a primary test (Table 1) . If the preferred tests were not available, we selected an alternative priority test from the same cognitive domain. Additional file 2: Table S2 provides an overview of the different tests used for each cognitive domain. For each test, we requested the raw scores and, if available, z-scores calculated based on local normative data. If local normative data were unavailable, we calculated z-scores based on published normative data from healthy controls for that test. Per cognitive domain, we combined z-scores which Fig. 1 Timeline of events related to the EMIF-AD MBD study we used as a continuous variable, and we used a cutoff value of z-score < \u2212 1.5 to define abnormality.\nClinical data were harmonized, pooled and stored on an online data platform using tranSMART [30] , now enriched for dementia research purposes through the EMIF-AD project."}, {"section_title": "Plasma analyses", "text": "Initially, the minimum requested amount of plasma was 0.7 ml.

Prior to the analyses, samples were checked visually for consistency and volume. Results of analyses were also quality checked by inspecting patterns of outliers, and excluding consistent outliers across analyses. Analyses conducted on these samples include: targeted analyses of plasma proteins identified previously [31] and confirmed in at least one replication study, a panel of complement proteins nominated because of increasing evidence from genomics of the role of innate immunity in AD and analysis of plasma neurofilament light (NFL) chain; untargeted proteomic analyses using aptamer capture approaches; and untargeted and targeted metabolic analyses using a 883-metabolite panel for the targeted assay."}, {"section_title": "Genetic analyses", "text": "A total amount of 2.6 \u03bcg DNA or 1 ml whole blood, from which DNA was to be extracted, was requested for the genetic analyses.

However, because not all studies could contribute data for all modalities, we included more participants to meet the aimed number of individuals for each modality. In total, 1221 subjects were included in the study, with a mean age of 67.9 (SD 8.3) years. Six hundred and sixty-seven (54%) were female and the average education level was 11.7 (SD 4.1) years. At baseline, 492 (40%) subjects had NC, 527 (43%) subjects had a diagnosis of MCI and 202 (17%) subjects had a clinical diagnosis of AD-type dementia. For 758 (62%) individuals there were follow-up data available (e.g., at least a clinical diagnosis or MMSE at follow-up): 217 (44%) NC subjects, 398 (76%) MCI subjects and 143 (71%) demented subjects. The average follow-up time for all 758 individuals was 2.3 (SD 1.2) years. Per diagnostic groups, the average clinical follow-up time was: NC 2.4 (SD 0.9) years, MCI 2.2 (SD 1.3) years and AD 2.2 (SD 1.4) years. Table 2 presents the baseline characteristics of the sample by A\u03b2 status and by baseline diagnosis. In the NC and MCI groups, the A\u03b2+ subjects were older than the A\u03b2-subjects (NC, p = 0.002; MCI, p < 0.001). In all diagnostic groups, A\u03b2+ subjects were more likely to be an APOE \u03b54 carrier (all p < 0.001). In the MCI subjects only, there was a difference in baseline MMSE score between the A\u03b2 groups (p = 0.001). Regarding cognitive domains, we found differences in memory (p < 0.001) and executive functioning (p = 0.042) z-scores in individuals with MCI. In individuals with AD-type dementia we found that A\u03b2+ individuals performed worse on an executive functioning task (p = 0.013).

For the EMIF-AD component, a major use-case objective has been to use the processes and tools established in the consortium to generate a novel cross-cohort data and sample collection for the discovery and validation of biomarkers for use in clinical trials using a multimodal and endophenotype design. The first results presented in this report confirm the central roles of A\u03b2 and APOE \u03b54 in the pathogenesis of AD, which is consistent with findings from other large cohorts [36, 37] . The molecular studies are ongoing and will be reported in future publications.\nAD is a complex and multifactorial disorder, which underscores the need for multimodal studies with sufficient statistical power [38] . To date these large studies are scarce, especially those including subjects across the whole clinical AD spectrum. To our knowledge, the only other large-scale studies that collected plasma, DNA, CSF and imaging material from individuals in various cognitive stages are the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [36] and the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging [37] studies. Since these datasets are so unique, findings from these studies are difficult to validate. The current study will not only be of great additional value due to its explorative nature and complementary laboaratory analyses, but also because previous findings can be validated in a large-size cohort with multimodal data. We collected a wide variety of clinical variables including neuropsychological tests, comorbidities, medication use and psychiatric questionnaires. All of the clinical data and results from the multimodal wet-lab analyses will be stored on an online, secure data platform (tranSMART). Research proposals can be submitted via the EMIF-AD Catalog (https://emif-catalogue.eu) to work with these data, which require approval from the EMIF-AD team and the data-owners.\nBesides the major advantages, this study also has some limitations. Currently, we do not have clinical follow-up data for all subjects, as some centers are still in the process of collecting these. However, these data may be added to the database in the future. Also, the data, samples and scans contributed to this study were collected at different centers and were not collected using the same protocol, which will lead to preanalytical variability. To limit this variability, the samples were analyzed centrally and the clinical data were harmonized using standardized values and dichotomous variables.
