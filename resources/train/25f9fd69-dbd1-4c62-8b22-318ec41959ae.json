Our goal here is to provide enough detail to explain the key choices made in developing the AM4.0/LM4.0 atmosphere/land model that will serve as a base for a new set of climate and Earth system models at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). We focus specifically on model performance in AMIP mode. We mention but do not emphasize the various features that this model shares with previous GFDL models AM2 (GFDL-GAMDT, 2004) , AM3 (Donner et al., 2011) , HiRAM (Zhao et al., 2009) , and LM3 (Milly et al., 2014) . We have extensively studied a version of this model coupled to both 0.58 and 0.258 versions of the new MOM6 ocean model and the new SIS2 sea-ice model. These coupled simulations will be described elsewhere, but reference to our experience with the coupled model will be needed to motivate some of the choices made in the atmospheric model.\nThe atmospheric model grid has cubed-sphere topology with 96 3 96 grid boxes per cube face (approximately 100 km grid size); hence, it is referred to as having C96 horizontal resolution. This represents an increased horizontal resolution compared to AM2 and AM3, which have horizontal grid-spacing of 200 km. The number of vertical levels is set at 33, with relatively crude resolution of the stratosphere with model top at 1 hPa, but with a sponge layer extending down to 8 hPa. The vertical level structure in the model is provided in supporting information S1. The vertical resolution is similar to HIRAM and AM3 in the troposphere except an additional layer is placed near the surface so that the model's lowest layer is closer to surface. We have also studied versions of the model with an increased horizontal (50 km) or vertical (49 and 63 levels) resolution and they will be documented in a separate paper.\nThe model described here has aerosol physics based in large part on that in AM3, but with a simplified chemistry, retaining a minimal chemical mechanism designed to simulate aerosols from emissions while prescribing ozone concentrations. We have also studied a version of this model with a level structure and a more comprehensive troposphere/stratosphere chemistry mechanism following that in AM3 that predicts ozone concentrations. We refer to the latter chemistry mechanism as the ''full'' chemistry module and the truncated chemical mechanism utilized in the model described here as ''light'' chemistry. In addition to the prognostic variables horizontal velocity, temperature, specific humidity, liquid and frozen water, cloud fraction, and surface pressure, AM4.0 also includes a subset of the tracers in AM3-water droplet number plus 17 aerosol and 4 gas phase tracers. As in AM3, the model simulates the indirect aerosol effect through a predictive model for cloud droplet numbers. To avoid the need for long spin-ups needed to equilibrate the vegetation state, the land model utilized here is run with static rather than dynamic vegetation.\nWe start in Part 1 by providing an overview of the model performance in AMIP (1980 AMIP ( -2014 mode after a brief introduction to the model formulation. This paper highlights some improvements from previous efforts and some more recalcitrant problems. In some cases, we compare to the quality of all available CMIP5 AMIP simulations, as well as to past GFDL model simulations. We include some discussion of climate sensitivity as measured by the ''Cess sensitivity''-increasing SSTs everywhere by 2K and examining the response in the top-ofatmosphere (TOA) fluxes. We also refer to computations of the ''effective radiative forcing'' or ''radiative flux perturbation,'' RFP, computed by holding SSTs and sea ice fixed and comparing TOA fluxes given preindustrial and present-day forcing agents.\nThe formulation of key model components is discussed much more fully in Zhao et al. (2018) (below referred to as Part 2), where the sensitivity of the simulation to some of the choices within these model components is also discussed, with particular attention to the choices in the convection, cloud, and orographic gravity wave drag schemes. In Part 2, we also make a special effort to describe our optimization strategy for the simulation of clouds and TOA fluxes. And we try to make clear the extent to which we have tuned toward values of RFP and Cess sensitivity.\nIn AMIP mode, the model is driven by time-varying boundary conditions, and natural and anthropogenic forcings developed in support of CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016) which are archived by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and served by the Earth System Grid Federation (https:// esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/input4mips/). Details are provided in Appendix A.\nWe have utilized a variety of observational and reanalysis data sets for evaluating AM4.0/LM4.0 performance in simulating the observed long-term mean climate as well as statistics of atmospheric transients. Table 1 provides a detailed description of the data sets, including their short and full names, references, URL as well as the period used for computing observed mean climatology and transients statistics. The short-names of the data sets will be used throughout the paper when referring to the data."}, {"section_title": "Brief Introduction to the Model Formulation", "text": "Each of the following topics is discussed in substantial detail in Part 2. We include this list here to provide some context for the following description of the AMIP simulation. The AM4.0 atmospheric model includes the following:\n1. the hydrostatic version of the FV3 finite-volume cubed-sphere dynamical core, with minor modifications from the version used in AM3; Figure 1 . Comparison of AM4.0 AMIP simulation with the previous GFDL models using the PCMDI metrics package version 1.1.1 portrait plot (Gleckler et al., 2016) . The color scale portrays a model's RMSE as a relative error (unitless) by normalizing the result by the median error of all models results shown in the figure. For example, a value of 0.20 indicates that a model's RMSE is 20% larger than the median error for that variable across all simulations on the figure. The triangles in each grid square show results for four individual seasons (from left rotating clockwise are respectively for JJA, SON, DJF, and MAM seasons) from multiple global fields (PR, precipitation; PSL, sea level pressure; TAS, surface air temperature; RLUT, outgoing LW radiation at TOA; RSUT, reflected SW radiation at TOA; UA-850, 850 hPa zonal wind; VA-850, 850 hPa meridional wind; UA-200, 200 hPa zonal wind; VA-200, 200 hPa meridional wind; ZG500, 500 hPa geopotential height)."}, {"section_title": "Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS001208", "text": "2. a substantially updated version of the GFDL radiative transfer code, with refitting to line-by-line simulations using the latest spectroscopy and adding 10 lm CO 2 band among other changes; this increases the TOA radiative forcing due to quadrupling of CO 2 by 10%; 3. an alternate topographic gravity wave drag formulation that handles the anisotropy of the subgrid topography naturally and treats the blocked versus wave components of the drag in a distinctive way; 4. a double-plume model representing shallow and deep convection, with stronger/weaker lateral mixing rate for the shallow/deep plume, with convective inhibition closure for the shallow plume mass flux and cloud work function relaxation closure for the deep plume, and with the deep plume strongly constrained by the environmental relative humidity; 5. a ''light'' chemistry mechanism using AM3's chemistry as a starting point, retaining the ability to generate aerosol distributions from emissions, but with ozone and other oxidants prescribed; 6. an aerosol module similar in structure to that in AM3, but with significant modification to wet removal by convection and by frozen precipitation; 7. single-moment cloud microphysics as in AM3 but with substantial changes in the droplet simulation and strongly reduced aerosol indirect effect; 8. updated surface flux formulation over oceans; 9. cloud fraction prediction, boundary layer formulation, and nonorographic gravity wave scheme essentially as in AM3, with minor retuning. \nIn addition, the land model LM4.0 is only incrementally modified from LM3.0, when run with static vegetation (representative of 1981 conditions) as in the simulations described here.\nset is small relative to that of the other models in the comparison set, while red colors indicate larger RMS errors. AM4.0 compares well overall with previous GFDL models, especially AM2.1 and AM3, but with a few circulation metrics comparable to or inferior to the higher resolution HiRAM models. The comparison with the CMIP5 models is also favorable overall, with the high resolution (20-60 km) MRI AGCMs (Mizuta et al., 2012) evidently being the best examples of CMIP5 AMIP simulations of comparable overall quality to AM4.0. Fields in which AM4.0 has larger biases than the best of these CMIP5 models include sea level pressure and 500 hPa geopotential. The latter is in part due to an overall tropical tropospheric cold bias (discussed below) rather than circulation-related features.\nThe corresponding annual mean spatial bias plot for the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is shown in Figure 5 . The OLR pattern is clearly improved as compared to previous GFDL models: global RMS error is reduced by nearly half from AM2 and AM3 to AM4.0. Much of the reduction in OLR error is due to the improvement in AM4.0 simulated precipitation climatology (described in the following) and associated high cloud cover. For example, the reduction of OLR error over much of the south-east Pacific in AM4.0 as compared to AM2.1 is due to less precipitation in that region (less of a double ITCZ; see Figure 11 ). The improvement in OLR over the Amazonian region seems to be due to a reduction of the Amazon dry bias in AM2.1. However, the picture is not consistent between the African tropics and the Amazon, with the OLR in the former region improving with little reduction in precipitation bias. Comparing AM4.0 with both AM2.1 and AM3, the reduction in OLR bias in the tropics is due to a mix of reduced bias in precipitation and in the OLR response to precipitation. We emphasize especially that the reduction of global mean bias in OLR from AM2. in AM4.0. Regionally, the improvement includes the Southern Ocean, the ITCZ, the broad subtropical and middle latitude ocean as well as modest improvements in the coastal stratocumulus regions.\nMotivated by Tsushima and Manabe (2013) , we show in Figure 7 the seasonal cycle of global mean TOA fluxes in AM4.0 and in observations for the total sky, clear sky, and the difference between total sky and Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS001208 clear sky, the cloud radiative effect (CRE). The amplitudes of net, shortwave (SW), and longwave (LW) totalsky fluxes are well simulated overall, but there is a modest but significant bias in Northern summer and autumn, with the model producing more SW reflection in July, August, and September, but less reflection from November to December compared to the observations. This error is partly due to the clear-sky component and partly to clouds. In particular, the model produces roughly 1:5 W m 22 more negative SW CRE in July and August and 1:5 W m 22 less negative SW CRE in November-December compared to the CERES observations. The geographical pattern of this bias, as can be seen in supporting information Figure S2 , is not straightforward, as there is cancellation of errors in the global mean from biases in the subtropical stratus deck regions and the regions of deep convection.\nTo evaluate the model's ability in simulating interannual variability of global TOA radiative fluxes, Figure  8 compares deseasonalized 12 month running mean time series of the global mean TOA net radiative fluxes between the AM4.0 simulation and the CERES observations for the 2000-2014 period. The model captures reasonably well the temporal evolution of the global mean TOA flux with a correlation coefficient of roughly 0.8. We have generated eight AMIP simulations of this period and the shading in the figure indicates the total spread of this ensemble. One would expect the single observational realization to be outside the spread of an eight-member ensemble about 23% of the time for a perfect model, so there is little evidence here of systematic bias. The strong correlation comes from both LW and SW components. The correlation in the LW component comes primarily from the clear sky while the correlation in the SW component results Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS001208 from the SW CRE as shown in Figure 8d . Compared to the SW CRE, the model simulated LW CRE shows significantly lower correlation (0.33) with the CERES observations.\nThe simulated in-cloud liquid droplet number concentrations are compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals (Bennartz & Rausch, 2017) in Figure 9 . To facilitate the comparison, the model results are averages between 850 hPa and the surface as the retrievals are weighted toward low-level clouds (R. Bennartz, personal communication, 2017) . AM4.0 simulated cloud droplet number concentrations are respectively 66.3, 60.5, 80.4, 74.6, and 59.6 cm 23 averaged over the entire globe, the global ocean, the global land, the northern and Southern Hemisphere. Compared to the MODIS retrieval, AM4.0 appears to significantly underestimate the averaged droplet number over the ocean (20%) although the observational uncertainty is quite large (Bennartz & Rausch, 2017 Figures 10c and 10d , respectively. The two satellite products differ significantly especially for the optically thin (0.3<s <3.6) clouds due to their differences in cloud masking and retrieving methods (Pincus et al., 2012) . The pattern correlation between the two products is 0.47 for s > 0:3. We ignore clouds with optical thickness smaller than 0.3 for the correlation calculation here and below because it is not detectable by ISCCP and MODIS remote sensors. Despite the large differences there are also some similarities between the two satellite products such as the peak of low cloud fraction at cloud top below 680 hPa and 3.6<s <23. In contrast to the observations, the model results from the two simulators tend to show more agreement with a pattern correlation about 0.74.\nCompared to both ISCCP and MODIS observations, AM4.0 reasonably well captures the low cloud fraction peak below 680 hPa with intermediate optical thickness (3.6<s <23). However, AM4.0 tends to underestimate the optically thin low clouds and overestimate the optically thick low clouds especially when compared to ISCCP. This is consistent with the ''too-few too-bright'' low cloud bias typically seen in a global climate model (GCM). In addition, AM4.0 tends to produce less mid-top clouds (310 hPa<p t <680 hPa) for most intermediate cloud optical thickness (1.3<s <23). The lack of midlevel cloudiness is also a typical bias seen in most GCMs. Thus, the ISCCP and MODIS observations indicate fewer low-level and middle level \nclouds in AM4.0. Globally, AM4.0 appears to underestimate the total cloud fraction by roughly 5% for both simulators. The MODIS observation has 14% lower total cloud fraction than the ISCCP because of a more stringent test for cloudy pixels (Pincus et al., 2012) . In general, the large differences between ISCCP and MODIS products also make it difficult to constrain cloud biases quantitatively. For example, compared to the ISCCP, AM4.0 appears to underestimate the optically thin (0.3<s <3.6) clouds at most levels. But this bias does not show up clearly in the MODIS results. The pattern correlations between AM4.0 and the observations are respectively 0.56 and 0.74 for the ISCCP and MODIS, which are higher than the correlation between the two satellite observations (0.47). As discussed in Part 2, because of the large observational uncertainty in individual cloud properties (i.e., cloud amount, liquid/ice water content, and cloud droplet number), we have considered an improvement of the TOA radiative flux as a higher priority during the AM4.0 development. Nevertheless, limited observational evaluations of the individual cloud properties suggest AM4.0 performs at least as well as the previous GFDL models.\nhydrological cycle without major changes in the net TOA balance is to increase atmospheric absorption of solar radiation at the expense of surface absorption, but we have no observational justification or plausible physical mechanism for doing so.\nIf we normalize AM4.0's precipitation to equal that of GPCP-v2.3, in the global mean, it would still have excessive precipitation in the West Pacific, sometimes referred to as the ''Philippines hotspot'' bias. This bias is sensitive to the model's convective parameterization. Reducing the lateral mixing of the parameterized convection can ameliorate this bias, but with consequences for other aspects of the model simulation, as described in Part 2. In some cases at least, this bias is reduced when the model is coupled to a dynamic ocean (as in, e.g., Stan & Xu, 2014) . We also have suggestions that coupled versions of this model can be negatively affected if too much precipitation is moved from the West Pacific into the eastern Pacific ITCZ in AMIP simulations. Therefore we have not made it a priority to reduce this bias. AM4.0's precipitation biases are still modest compared to that in the bulk of the CMIP5 AMIP models (see PR column in Figure 2 ). In particular, AM4.0 simulated climatological PAI discussed in section 4 is 0.23, which is very close to the observed value 0.2 (Xiang et al., 2017) .\nThe DJF and JJA seasonal mean precipitation corresponding to this annual mean plot are provided in supporting information Figures S9 and S10. The positive global mean bias compared to GPCP-v2.3 is present in all seasons. An interesting bias in DJF is excess precipitation in the North Pacific storm track, which is present in AM3 as well. We do not have a diagnosis of the cause of this bias. The western Pacific rain bias, \nespecially the Philippines hotspot, is most apparent in JJA, and there is no obvious improvement over AM3 in monsoonal rainfall. The Eastern Pacific precipitation is improved (e.g., less double ITCZ) in both DJF and JJA seasons in AM4.0, while a bias toward too wet a winter season in Western North America (more apparent with a different choice of contour interval) persists.\nIn the tropical Atlantic and south America sector, AM4.0 significantly improves the precipitation dry bias over the South America Amazonian region as well as the summertime Atlantic ITCZ location and intensity compared to AM2.1 and AM3. During boreal summer, most GCMs tend to underestimate the northward shift of the tropical Atlantic rain belt, leading to deficient precipitation over land and an anomalous precipitation maximum over the west Atlantic ocean (Siongco et al., 2015) . AM4.0 performs quite well in this aspect with little west Atlantic precipitation biases. The dry bias in central North America, which improved in AM3 over AM2, is somewhat more severe in AM4.0 for reasons that are unclear at present. When AM4.0 is coupled with an ocean, this central North America dry bias tends to be largely reduced, while the Amazonian region gets drier.\nRunoff is an informative indicator of water and energy balances of both land and atmosphere. In the absence of long-term storage change, runoff equals the long-term difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration. The global pattern of basin-average runoff, as inferred from long-term discharge measurements, is reproduced by the model (Figure 12 ). Errors in the large tropical basins (Amazon, Parana, and \nCongo) appear generally consistent with annual precipitation errors (Figure 11 ) in the model. In the northern high latitudes, however, the partitioning of precipitation appears to be biased away from runoff toward evapotranspiration. This has been a persistent bias in the model and is the subject of ongoing investigation. Note that runoff provides a particularly sensitive measure of water-balance error, since it is often the small difference between relatively large values of precipitation and evapotranspiration.\nA persistent bias in the diurnal cycle of precipitation over land remains in AM4.0, with convection peaking near local noon, much earlier than the observations. Figure 13 shows an example of this bias over the United States. While the observed precipitation often peaks in late afternoon or early evening, AM4.0 produces a precipitation peak near local noon. This phase-lock of convective rainfall to local noon has been a longstanding problem in GCMs (e.g., Dai, 2006) . Global high (mesoscale) resolution models with explicit convection and GCMs with superparameterized convection often show significant improvement in the phase of the diurnal cycle of precipitation, but biases in other aspects of the precipitation simulation can remain large in such models, including the mean rainfall distribution and the magnitude of the diurnal cycle (e.g., Dirmeyer et al., 2012) . So it is unclear what the ramifications of this bias are for other aspects of the simulation. One can speculate, however, that SW cloud feedbacks could be affected by diurnal biases. We \nhave postponed attempts to create a better diurnal cycle while maintaining a high quality mean precipitation distribution to future development, likely starting with higher resolution models.\ntemperature tends to increase as the model's horizontal resolution increases. The warm spot in DJF near 200 hPa in AM2.1 and AM3 is related to the vertical distribution of the orographic gravity wave drag.\n(International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship) data set (Knapp et al., 2010) are also plotted. AM4.0 captures the broad geographical distribution of TC genesis frequency over different ocean basins. Compared to the IBTRACS, AM4.0 tends to overproduce TC frequency over the western Pacific and underestimate storms in the eastern Pacific and North Atlantic basins, a bias typical to most low resolution (i.e., 100 km) GCMs (Walsh et al., 2015) . AM4.0 captures the TC frequency over the Indian Ocean and South Pacific rather well.\nAM4.0 also captures the seasonal cycle of TC frequency over each ocean basin reasonably well, as can be seen in Figure 25 . In this figure the results are normalized to 1 for both the model and the observations in the annual mean in each basin. In the NH ocean basins, AM4.0 tends to produce a phase shift with excessive late season storm frequency and insufficient genesis in the early and peak seasons. The problem appears to be more severe over the West Pacific and the North Atlantic. The cause of the phase shift in NH tropical cyclone seasonal cycle is not yet clear. Our overall impression is that the TCs in this model are physically meaningful and may provide useful input into questions regarding responses of TC genesis frequency to climate variability and change, despite the model's limited resolution. However, our impression is also that the TCs are too weak for there to be much useful information in the model's intensity distribution (unlike the 50 km HiRAM model for example, in which it does appear to be possible to partially adjust for the model intensity biases with quantile-quantile regression; Zhao & Held, 2010) . Higher resolution versions of AM4.0 under development will hopefully be more suitable in this regard.\nWe evaluate the AM4.0 tropical wave spectrum in the format of Wheeler and Kiladis (1999) . We show the tropical symmetric (158S-158N) power spectrum, with background removed following Wheeler and Kiladis (1999) , from both the upper (200 hPa) troposphere zonal wind (U200) and OLR. We analyze both the AMIP in the model. Whether there is any sensitivity to the near-surface mixing within the ocean model is not yet determined, but because this enhancement is found in all of our coupled simulations, we feel it is useful to show a coupled version here as well, as we do not feel that AMIP simulations alone are a reliable measure of the simulation of the MJO. Figure 27 shows that AM4.0 captures very well the observed U200 power spectrum based on the ERAInterim, including the Kelvin wave, the MJO and the westward moving variance, including some westward propagating inertial gravity waves. However, AM4.0 produces much weaker Kelvin wave signal and misses entirely the inertial gravity wave in the OLR spectrum, suggesting deficiency in coupling convective clouds and precipitation with the wind field for these waves. The coupled model enhances the OLR signal more than that in U200. In particular, the coupled version of AM4.0 captures quite well the observed MJO in the \nOLR spectrum. In addition, Figure 27 also shows that AM4.0 reasonably well reproduces the westward equatorial Rossby wave and the Rossby-Haurwitz wave signals which appear only in the wind field.\nTo illustrate the models' MJO further, Figure 28 shows the lag correlation between time series of central Indian ocean upper level zonal wind and OLR and the corresponding winds or OLR at all other longitudes. Propagation is clearly enhanced in the coupled simulation. In the zonal winds, AM4.0 shows well-defined rapid propagation east of the dateline, indicative of the excitation of dry Kelvin waves. Compared to the observation, the eastward propagation of the OLR signal is weaker as it passes through the Maritime continent even in the coupled simulation, suggesting a stronger barrier effect from the Maritime continent in \nAM4.0 than in reality. In general, the coupled simulation tends to enhance the eastward propagation of the OLR signal more than that in U200, consistent with Figure 27 .\n29d). AM2.1's eastward shift of Pacific convection also falls short of the observed shift, giving less of a rainfall increase over the far eastern equatorial Pacific. Compared to AM2.1, AM3 shows improved eastward and equatorward penetration of the Pacific convective zones during El Ni\u00f1o but fails to sufficiently dry the west Pacific region near the Maritime continent and Philippines (Figure 29e ). AM4.0, however, shows a much better rainfall response during El Ni\u00f1o-with more realistic eastward and equatorward penetration of Pacific convection, and realistic drying over Indonesia and South America (Figures 29a and 29c ). This improved pattern of anomalous atmospheric latent heating would be expected to improve ENSO's remote teleconnections, particularly over Asia, the Pacific, and North America (Delworth et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2015; Krishnamurthy et al., 2015) . AM4.0's rainfall response to ENSO does remain slightly too strong; this is likely due to the excessive rainfall in the model's climatological convective regimes (ITCZ and SPCZ), which when shifted then produce excessive local rainfall anomalies. Figure 30 shows the observed and simulated surface zonal wind stress response to ENSO, which is a critical control on both the amplitude and period of ENSO in coupled models (Capotondi et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008) . Simulating the spatial structure of the zonal wind stress response to ENSO has long been a challenge for atmospheric and especially coupled GCMs, due to biases in the simulated climatological patterns of tropical Pacific convection (Capotondi et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2015) . Figure 30d shows that in AM2.1, the equatorial westerly wind stress response to El Ni\u00f1o is too strong and too far west, reflecting a similar \nexcessive intensity and westward displacement of its rainfall and tropospheric latent heating anomalies (Figure 29d ). AM2.1's off-equatorial easterly anomalies are also excessive poleward of 108S and 58SN, giving too much cyclonic curl and poleward Sverdrup discharge within the upper ocean near the equator. Compared to AM2.1, AM3 reduces these equatorial biases in the strength and zonal position of the westerly anomalies; yet its off-equatorial easterlies and cyclonic curl remain too strong (Figure 30e ).\n(AM4.0's shortwave response pattern is also improved, though not as dramatically as for the evaporative cooling.) If AM4.0's stronger and more realistic surface heat flux response pattern were retained in coupled mode, it would likely help to weaken ENSO. And given the overly strong ENSO in both the AM2.1-based CM2.1 and ESM2M coupled models (Dunne et al., 2012; Wittenberg, 2009; Wittenberg et al., 2006 ) and the AM3-based CM3 coupled model (Chen et al., 2017) , this would be a welcome change in CM4.\nTo the extent that these improved patterns in AM4.0 are retained upon coupling, they may improve the amplitude, period, dynamics, and remote impacts of the simulated ENSO in CM4. However, as a note of caution, our early experience to date with ENSO simulations in coupled models using AM4.0 is that a range of different ENSO behavior can be generated, depending on the oceanic resolution and physics.\nvariability in the low-top models such as AM4.0 (Charlton-Perez et al., 2013; Hardiman et al., 2012; Shaw & Perlwitz, 2010) , it is of interest to see the extent to which this choice has compromised model performance in this regard. These results also serve as a benchmark for versions of AM4 with higher tops and finer stratospheric resolution. Here, we evaluate the key characteristics of SSWs in the AM4.0 long (1870-2014) AMIP simulation, and compare them to ERA40 reanalysis. Despite the low model top, we find that AM4.0 simulates fairly realistic SSW frequencies, but biased toward occurring later in the winter season, and with relatively weak tropospheric signatures following SSW events. Figure 32 shows the frequency of SSWs per year as well as its distribution by month. The SSW events are diagnosed as the reversal of stratospheric zonal wind at 10 hPa following . The annual mean SSW frequency of AM4.0 is statistically indistinguishable from that of ERA40 at the 95% confidence level, though the distribution of SSWs in AM4.0 is skewed toward late winter compared to observations. We find that the annual mean SSW frequency is sensitive to the parameterization for the convective gravity wave drag, with more SSWs when the drag is increased. (The strength of polar vortex jet is weakened with increased convective gravity wave drag. Convective gravity wave drag is tuned to provide a better agreement of the polar jet with the ERA-Interim data compared to AM2.1 and AM3, see supporting information Figure  S15 .) However, the monthly distribution is relatively insensitive to the parameterized drag.\nThe amplitude of SSW is measured by the polar cap temperature anomalies at 10 hPa during SSW and the change in zonal wind at 608N 10 hPa following the SSW onset . On average, \nAM4.0 simulates 7.2 K warming at the polar cap and 27.7 m s 21 decrease in zonal wind, which agree well with the benchmark values suggested by . We also compare the simulated influence of SSW at the surface with reanalysis following Hardiman et al. (2012) . Figure 33 shows the mean sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies in the month following a SSW from AM4.0 and ERA40. Both model and reanalysis show an anomalously negative Northern Annular Mode (NAM)-like pattern following SSW, though the anomalies are weaker in the model by more than a factor of two, a bias that we estimate to be statistically significant at the 95% level. While this bias could be directly related to the inability of a model with low stratospheric resolution to transmit this signal, it could also be related to the fact that most of the model SSWs occur late in the season, providing little time to set up a tropospheric response before the seasonal wind conditions favorable for coupling disappear.\nA related and important consequence of stratospheric-tropospheric coupling is the response of the SH summertime near-surface winds to the development of the Antarctic ozone hole. Figure 34 shows the evolution in time of the latitude of the maximum of the westerlies in the SH summer at 850 hPa, comparing the ERAInterim data with AM4.0 simulations. The spread across eight AMIP simulations is shown along with the ensemble mean. In addition to showing that AM4.0 has very modest bias in the mean, one can compare the trends toward a more poleward position in the westerlies over this period. This trend has generally \nbeen attributed to the stratospheric ozone hole, since Thompson and Solomon (2002) , but recent work, such as Garfinkel et al. (2015) and Seviour et al. (2017) have emphasized the difficulty in quantitative attribution due to large internal variability. While the modeled trend appears by eye to be on the weak side compared to the reanalysis, computing trends over the 1980-2000 period during which ozone depletion is the strongest, the reanalysis trend and the trend averaged over an eight-member AMIP ensemble are nearly identical (model ensemble mean is 20.0638/yr while ERA-Interim is 20.0788/yr). The reanalysis trend lies within the envelope of the eight model realizations, with four out of the eight model realizations having larger poleward trends than the reanalysis (trends computed with the nonparametric Theil-Sen algorithm; Theil, 1950a Theil, , 1950b Theil, , 1950c .\nAM4.0 has no QBO (Quasi-Biennial Oscillation) in the tropical stratosphere. A QBO-like oscillation does appear when the vertical resolution of the model is increased in the lower stratosphere.\nRFPs is derived as a residue, roughly accounting for the effects of model difference in volcanoes and total solar irradiance.\nTo assess AM4.0 feedbacks to changes in global mean SST, we also conducted an idealized global warming experiment based on 2010RAD except with SSTs uniformly increased by 2K (P2K below) following Cess et al. (1990) . The change in TOA net flux measures the total feedback to warming; a Cess climate sensitivity can be derived by dividing the global mean surface temperature increase by this total TOA change (Cess et al., 1990 ). Here we define Cess sensitivity from these simulations using the 2K ocean warming in the numerator rather than the global mean surface air temperature, to be consistent with the published AM2 and AM3 results (Zhao, 2014; Zhao et al., 2016) . Using the global mean in AM4.0 results in a sensitivity 11% higher. A point of confusion when comparing these numbers to those quoted for AM2.1 and AM3 in the literature is that the AM2.1 and AM3 values were derived previously based on a different set of experiments where the present-day conditions were specified at 1990 conditions (using CMIP3 specifications for AM2.1 and CMIP5 for AM3; but the differences in specification of GHGs and aerosol emissions for the same year are not key to these differences) and with volcanoes turned off in both the control and the perturbation experiments. To provide a clean comparison, we conducted an additional set of AM4.0 simulations using the 1990 GHGs and aerosol emissions for the ''present-day'' control simulation (1990RAD) . In addition, both the 1990 control and its corresponding perturbation runs used the same volcanoes. The RFPs derived from this 1990RAD-based set of experiments are also shown in Figure 38 along with the results from AM2.1 and AM3. Table 4 provides the numbers shown in Figure 38 .\nWith the 1990 conditions, AM4.0 produces a total RFP of roughly 1:64 W m 22 , which is smaller than AM2.1 \nPart 2, and the other is due to changes in ozone specification. In contrast, the increase of GHG RFP from AM2.1 to AM3 is primarily due to the interactive ozone in AM3. To summarize, when evaluated with 1990 conditions, AM4.0/CMIP6 produces a larger magnitude in both GHG and aerosol RFPs than AM2.1/CMIP3 with a modest (-0:3 W m 22 ) decrease of total RFP. In contrast, compared to AM3/CMIP5, AM4.0/CMIP6 produces a substantially smaller aerosol RFP with a similar GHG RFP so that the total RFP increases by \n0:7 W m 22 . The aerosol RFP in AM4 and AM3 contains both the direct effect and the indirect effects due to aerosol cloud interactions while AM2.1 contains only the aerosol direct effect. The reduction of aerosol RFP from AM3 to AM4 is mostly due to the reduction of aerosol indirect effect while the smaller aerosol RFP in AM2.1 is mostly due to its lack of aerosol indirect effects.\nThe smaller aerosol RFP in AM4.0 compared to AM3 is an important feature of this model, and requires closer examination. More information can be inferred from the time evolution of aerosol RFP obtained by Note. The numbers are averaged respectively over the entire globe, the global ocean and land surface, the Northern Hemisphere (NH), and the Southern Hemisphere (SH). \ndifferencing the TOA fluxes in a pair of long (1870-2014) AMIP simulations, both with observed timeevolving SSTs and sea ice using CMIP6 specifications for the boundary conditions. In the control simulation preindustrial forcing agents are fixed through time, while the perturbed simulation includes time-evolving aerosol and aerosol-precursor emissions with all other forcings held at preindustrial values. The AM3 simulations here use CMIP5 emissions while AM4.0 uses CMIP6. The result is shown for both AM3 and AM4.0 in Figure 39 and indicates a difference in the relationship between the two models prior to and after 1980. Note. The total RFP and RFPs due to aerosols, GHGs, and other changes can be derived from the differences between the corresponding experiments. The differences between P2K and 2010RAD are also listed as Cess feedback to show the TOA radiative feedback to idealized 2K uniform SST warming. See text for a description of the experiments. TAS, surface air temperature; OLR, TOA outgoing LW radiation; SWABS, TOA net downward SW radiation; NETRAD, TOA net radiation (positive: downward). LW, SW, and total CREs are respectively for the LW, SW, and total cloud radiative effects.\nThere is a ratio of 0.72 between the global RFPs in the two models that is nearly constant in time before 1980. After this date, the two RFPs diverge further, with the magnitude of the aerosol forcing in AM4.0 decreasing rapidly, unlike the stationary value in AM3. As addressed in Part 2, this appears to be related to the shift in emissions from the NH midlatitudes to the tropics after 1980. Our understanding of this behavior is described in Part 2. Most of the difference is due to different cloud feedbacks, which can be traced to the models' representation of convective clouds (Zhao, 2014; Zhao et al., 2016) .\nThe implications of these values of Cess sensitivity and aerosol RFP for coupled simulations, and the extent to which these values have been tuned in the development process, are discussed in Part 2. '' and ''GHG'' show respectively the total, aerosol, and GHG RFPs. ''Residual'' shows the difference between total and the sum of aerosol and GHG RFPs. P2K denotes the difference in TOA net radiative flux between a PD control climatological simulation and its corresponding P2K (uniform 2K increase of SSTs) simulation. For comparison, the RFP values (derived using 1990 GHGs and aerosols specified from previous CMIPs) from AM2.1 and AM3 are also shown. The climatological SSTs and sea-ice concentration used for AM2.1 and AM3 are also based on previous CMIP specifications and averaged for the 1981-2000 period. \nfuture, we hope to document a version of AM4.0 with 49 levels, with a higher top and more complete stratospheric and tropospheric chemistry (with predictive ozone).\nWe also have C192 (roughly 50 km) simulations in hand which produce superior tropical cyclone climatology, and coastal wind and cloud biases are somewhat muted when coupled to an ocean model, as compared to C96. In preliminary results we find, however, that Cess sensitivity, aerosol RFP, precipitation biases, and MJO variability are similar to first order to those of the C96 model. All of these features are strongly affected by the model convection and cloud parameterizations, justifying a strategy of starting the development process at the lower resolution, given that the design of the convection scheme and cloud optimization are a major focus.\nThe value of this new atmosphere/land model, and these other extensions of the model, will only emerge as it is used in attempts to improve our understanding of climate variability and change and when its simulations are compared to other models. To this end, we provide the AM4.0/LM4.0 code and selected model results for an AMIP simulation at http://data1.gfdl.noaa.gov/nomads/forms/am4.0/."}, {"section_title": "Portrait Plot Overview", "text": "During the model development, we have routinely used a variety of automatic analysis packages to evaluate model performance against the observations and reanalysis (see Table 1 for some of the data sets).\nMost of the analysis focused on spatial distribution of meteorological fields such as winds, temperature, humidity, clouds, atmospheric tracers as well as the energy fluxes. In addition, we have also recently utilized the portrait plots described by Gleckler et al. (2008 Gleckler et al. ( , 2016 to monitor aspects of simulation quality along our development trajectory. In Figures 1 and 2 , we compare features of the seasonal mean large-scale climate of AM4.0/LM4.0 to that of other GFDL models and to the AMIP simulations in the CMIP5 archive.

One is that they are among the best observed climate fields. More importantly, we consider the quality of the simulation of the TOA radiative fluxes as especially important for coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations. These portrait plots indicate that AM4.0's bias in TOA fluxes is particularly small compared to the biases in other models, especially in the reflected solar. Figure 3 shows the bias pattern in the annual mean net downward shortwave flux at the TOA in AM4.0 compared with two other recent GFDL models, AM2.1 and AM3. (Similar plots for the four different seasons are provided in supporting information Figures S1-S4 ). The observational estimate of the TOA radiative fluxes is based on CERES-EBAF-ed2.8. This data set is used for observational estimates of TOA and surface radiative flux throughout the paper unless otherwise noted. A bias toward excessive reflection over most ocean regions in earlier models is largely ameliorated. The excessive SW absorption over the southern ocean (608S) in AM2.1 is greatly reduced in both AM3 and AM4.0 with AM4.0 in particular producing the least overall bias over the Southern Hemisphere oceans, both north and south of 608S. Remaining biases are due to insufficient low cloud cover in the subtropical stratocumulus regions off the west coasts of North and South America and Africa, and excessive reflection from convective cloudiness over sub-Saharan Africa, North Indian Ocean, and the western tropical Pacific.\nWe consider the quality of the simulation of this field as especially important for coupled atmosphereocean simulations. For example, coupled models are typically biased toward excessive tropical precipitation in the Southern Hemisphere, associated with the well-known double ITCZ bias. A quantitative measure of this bias is the tropical precipitation asymmetry index (PAI), defined as difference in climatological precipitation between 08N-208N and 08S-208S (e.g., Hwang & Frierson, 2013; Xiang et al., 2017) . Xiang et al. (2017) has shown, using the CMIP5 archive, that the PAI in an AMIP simulation is not a good predictor of the PAI in the corresponding coupled model; however, the north-south asymmetry in the reflected shortwave at TOA is a very good predictor of the change in the PAI from its value in an AMIP simulation to its value in the corresponding coupled model. Following Xiang et al. (2017) , Figure 4 shows this relationship across 19 CMIP5 models. This TOA SW asymmetry is computed as the difference between the average over the Northern tropics/subtropics (08N-388N) and the value for the corresponding region in the Southern Hemisphere (08S-388S); (See Xiang et al., 2017 for the rationale for this choice of averaging region.) The observational estimate of the TOA SW asymmetry is also indicated along with the results from AM4.0, AM3, and AM2 simulations.\nAM4.0 produces a TOA SW asymmetry very close to the observations, suggesting that development of a PAI bias in coupled mode from unrealistic asymmetry in the SW forcing provided by AM4.0 should be minimal. But there are evidently other sources of this bias, possibly oceanic, shared by most models, since the CMIP5 model regression line has a negative value where it intersects the observational estimate. .

Annual mean precipitation in AM4.0 is compared to the observational estimates based on the GPCP-v2.3 and to the corresponding AM2.1 and AM3 simulations in Figure 11 . The global mean precipitation in all of the models is higher than in GPCP-v2.3 by about 10%. The reliability of this observational estimate remains a subject of controversy (e.g., Gehne et al., 2016 "}, {"section_title": "Temperature", "text": "Since the annual mean surface air temperature tends to obscure important seasonal biases, we show the DJF and JJA seasonal mean 2 m temperature biases in Figures 14 and 15 , using CRU-TS-v4.01 for the observations. (The annual mean figure can be found in supporting information Figure S11 .) The RMS bias has improved somewhat in AM4.0 compared to the earlier models in both seasons, but the geographical pattern of bias is quite similar in all three models. In particular, in winter there is a large warm bias in Siberia and a warm bias in North America in a region arcing from Alaska to the U.S. upper midwest. Some aspects of these biases have been found to be sensitive to the details of the masking of vegetation by snow and to the choice of static vegetation and land use in these runs.\nAssumptions concerning snow masking of vegetation and the associated albedo prescription for snow covered land areas can be important for albedo feedback in global warming simulations. In particular, Hall and Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS001208 Qu (2006) have suggested that aspects of the seasonal cycle of land albedo and temperatures can be used as an ''emergent constraint,'' a feature of the observed climate that is predictive of an aspect of climate change of interest-in this case, the strength of future albedo feedback over land. In particular, they define the constraint to be the difference between April and May in land surface albedo divided by the same difference in near-surface air temperature, both averaged from 308N to 908N, and find model values ranging over a factor of 3. The value in AM4.0 is 21.01%/K, as compared to the 95% confidence interval on the observational estimate of 21.01 to 21.13%/K in Hall and Qu (2006) . The value in AM2.1 is very similar to that in AM4.0. (We caution that the Hall and Qu (2006) results [their Figure 3] are obtained from coupled model values for this albedo-temperature ratio, while we are using an AMIP simulation.) Accepting the value of this constraint, we would not expect the land albedo feedback in this model to be strongly biased.\nThe model has a relatively uniform cold bias at 2 m over the oceans of about 0.3 K, compared to ERA-Interim reanalyses, that is sensitive to the placement of the lowest level on which temperature is a prognostic variable (18 m in AM4.0, see supporting information Table S1 for AM4.0 vertical levels). The interpolation from this lowest model level to 2 m uses Monin-Obukhov similarity which assumes that this layer is embedded in the constant flux layer-the lower the first model level the better is this approximation. The height of this lowest model level was reduced during the development process, adding one additional layer and adjusting the remaining layer heights, to help ameliorate this bias.\nThe zonal mean temperature as a function of pressure and latitude is displayed in Figures 16 and 17 for DJF and JJA season. The observational estimates of the zonal mean atmospheric temperature are based on the ERA-Interim. There are smaller cold biases in the subpolar upper troposphere and lower stratosphere in all seasons in AM4.0 compared to AM2.1 and AM3, both of which have lower horizontal resolution. However, there is more of a cold bias in the tropical upper troposphere than in earlier models. This bias is sensitive to the convection parameterization; as described in Part 2, attempts to ameliorate this bias produce other problems in the model. It is also worth noting that for a fixed model physics, the tropical upper tropospheric "}, {"section_title": "Mean Circulation", "text": "Similar to the temperature field, we show DJF and JJA seasonal mean zonal mean zonal wind in Figures 18  and 19 . (Annual mean zonal mean zonal wind is shown in supporting information Figure S14 .) Some of the improvements over recent GFDL models are presumably due to horizontal resolution. A common deficiency in GCMs is equatorward displacement of midlatitude westerlies, specifically in austral summer. We see no significant deficiency of this type in AM4.0, although it can recur in coupled versions of the model due to SST drifts.\nA resilient bias in GFDL models has been excessive easterlies in the lower troposphere (800-900 hPa) over the equator, especially in JJA. Regionally, this bias occurs predominately in the central Pacific. In AM4.0, this bias does not strongly impact the surface stresses and, it is hoped, has little effect on ENSO dynamics in the coupled model. The bias is sensitive to the parameterized convective momentum transport, but alternative formulations of the convective momentum transport have not removed this bias, and can make it worse by extending the bias to the surface. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS001208 AM4.0 also has a modest bias immediately above the midlatitude jet maximum in DJF, associated with the gravity wave drag, implying that the decomposition between low-level deposition due to blocked flow and the deposition immediately above the jet due to critical level absorption of mountain waves may be too heavily weighted to the latter. We did not further reduce the linear mountain drag in AM4.0 because it tends to increase the tropical lower tropospheric easterlies which are already too strong. The simulations of stratospheric wind and temperature can be found in supporting information Figures S15-S22 . Figure 20 compares the annual mean zonal wind stress exerted by the atmosphere on the surface over the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the land in AM4.0 with two reanalyses and with the spread of AMIP simulations in CMIP5. The bias and large spread in the CMIP5 ensemble in the location of the maximum positive stress over the Southern Hemisphere oceans is most evident in the Pacific sector, where AM4.0 agrees well with the reanalyses. Larger differences with the reanalyses appear in individual seasons (see supporting information Figures S23-S26) , especially a bias toward too strong stress below the easterlies in the winter hemisphere. Despite this bias, in the annual mean the stress due to the trade winds is weaker than most of the CMIP5 models in the Pacific, and in good agreement with the reanalysis. The Northern Hemisphere wintertime sea level pressure field is shown in Figure 21 , and is one field in which AM4.0 shows little improvement over AM3. The figure is drawn to avoid regions in which a significant extrapolation to sea level from an elevated surface is required. Similar figures for other seasons (JJA, MAM, and SON) do show significant improvement (especially MAM and SON, see supporting information Figures  S27-S29 ).

Our interpretation of the DJF bias is that it is in part related to the teleconnections from tropical precipitation "}, {"section_title": "Journal of Advances in", "text": "biases. In coupled simulations performed as part of the development process, the DJF sea level pressure simulation often improves, at least marginally, as does the precipitation bias in the western Pacific, consistent with the effects of tropical precipitation biases teleconnecting most strongly to the extratropical stationary wave pattern in winter.\nA consistent picture also emerges from inspection of the Northern Hemisphere 500 hPa stationary wave patterns in the different seasons (see supporting information Figures S30-S33 ). AM4.0's 500 mb stationary wave patterns improve in all seasons compared to earlier GFDL models, except in winter. While this pattern is consistent across different realizations of AMIP runs of AM4.0, given the large interannual variability of stationary waves in winter we must keep in mind that the observations provide only a single realization.\nModeling Earth Systems 10.1002/2017MS001208"}, {"section_title": "Midlatitude Storm-Track Transients", "text": "Given the prominent role of the midlatitude baroclinic eddies to meridional transport of momentum, heat, and moisture and their tight interactions with climate variability and changes, we evaluate AM4.0's The velocities and temperatures are band passed using a Lanczos filter with half-power points at roughly 2 and 7 days, as is traditional when displaying storm-track eddies (e.g., Blackmon, 1976) .

The fluxes are displayed at the pressure level near which they take on maximum values (250 hPa for the momentum fluxes and 850 hPa for the heat fluxes).\nThe basic pattern of the eddy momentum fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter is accurately simulated, with the poleward flux overestimated somewhat over the central North Atlantic and underestimated in Northern Europe. The strength of this band-passed poleward flux in DJF in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is overestimated by as much as 10% as compared to the reanalyses. Biases in JJA are more subtle.\nThe eddy heat fluxes show a subtle equatorward shift in the North Atlantic in DJF, and once again no obvious systematic biases in JJA. Comparison with Southern Hemisphere reanalysis requires more detailed study to isolate any robust biases. We are hoping to examine these storm-track statistics, and other higher order moments and extremes, as a function of horizontal resolution in a follow-up paper. Our initial indications are that the improvements in these variance fields as one moves to higher resolution are smaller than the deterioration as one moves to lower resolution.

We modified this wind speed threshold to be 14 m s 21 .\nIn addition, the maximum surface wind speed over the entire trajectory must exceed 16 m s 21 to qualify as a model storm. The use of a lower wind speed threshold is recommended for this low resolution GCM by Walsh et al.

AM4.0 does, however, still show excessive easterly wind anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific. In a coupled system, this remaining wind stress bias would likely weaken SSTAs in the cold tongue region during El Ni\u00f1o-both by boosting the evaporative damping of local SSTAs, and by weakening the local SSTA growth due to Bjerknes feedbacks (associated with local anomalous downwelling, and an anomalously depressed equatorial thermocline in the east).

East of 1708W, AM2.1's anomalous easterly wind bias actually leads to an excessive evaporative response and SSTA damping; but this is trumped by too little shortwave damping of SSTAs in the eastern equatorial Pacific, due to an insufficient eastward and equatorward shift of deep convective cloud during El Ni\u00f1o.

Sensitivities to Greenhouse Gases, Aerosols, and SST Perturbations\nGiven fixed preindustrial (PI) and present-day (PD) forcing agents we can utilize a set of atmospheric only experiments to derive important model properties which measure a model's effective radiative forcing and/or feedbacks (e.g., Andrews, 2014; Pincus et al., 2016; Sherwood et al., 2015) . These properties are important to the model's simulation of historical temperature trend as well as future projections of various climate change scenarios. For this purpose, we have conducted a set of idealized experiments to assess AM4.0 sensitivity to perturbations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs, including ozone) and aerosol emissions. The control experiment is forced by monthly varying climatological SSTs and sea-ice concentration averaged for the 1981-2014 period using the data recommended for the CMIP6 AMIP simulations. The GHG concentrations and aerosol emissions are fixed at 2010 conditions while the volcanic aerosols are prescribed at the average value of the 2000-2014 period. The CO 2 concentration for vegetation photosynthesis is also specified at the 2010 value. This specification of GHGs and aerosol emissions corresponds to that used in the CMIP6 PD control simulations. Below we refer to this experiment as 2010RAD.\nThe first perturbation experiment is based on 2010RAD except using 1850 GHGs, aerosol emissions, CO 2 concentration for photosynthesis, and the volcanic aerosols averaged over the 1850 . This specification of GHGs and aerosols corresponds to that used in the CMIP6 PI control simulations. The change in global TOA net radiative flux between 2010RAD and 1850RAD provides an estimate of the total TOA radiative flux perturbation (RFP) or effective radiative forcing, due to changes in GHGs, aerosols and volcanoes from PI to 2010 conditions. The second perturbation is based on 1850RAD except that only the aerosol emissions are replaced by 2010 conditions (called 2010AER). The difference in TOA flux between 2010AER and 1850RAD provides an estimate of total (nonvolcanic) aerosol RFP.

This component of the model is certainly not constructed entirely from first principles but is a mix of basic physics and empiricism, as well as experience regarding which parameters influence which aspects of model behavior, experience gained not only in this cycle of model development but in previous cycles with related models. Our confidence in this aspect of the resulting model is based on the low spatial biases throughout the seasonal cycle, but also the simulation of the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of global means of the TOA fluxes (Figures 7 and 8) .\nThe precipitation has important biases, especially regarding the excessive precipitation maximum in the West Pacific (the Philippines hotspot) but biases throughout the seasonal cycle are still comparable to the best AMIP simulations in the CMIP5 archive. AM4.0 significantly improves the precipitation dry bias over the south America Amazonian region as well as the summertime Atlantic ITCZ location and intensity compared to AM2.1 and AM3. Importantly, the response to ENSO SSTs in precipitation, wind stresses, and surface fluxes agree well with observations and recent reanalyses (Figures 29-31 ). Despite the relatively low resolution, the spatial distribution and frequency of tropical storms is realistic though not quite of the quality we have seen in higher resolution models, especially regarding the simulation of the interannual variability of genesis in the North Atlantic. In addition, the simulated MJO has reasonable amplitude and propagation characteristics, but only when coupled to an ocean model. A clear weakness of the convection scheme is evident in the diurnal cycle over land, which has the common bias of peaking too close to local noon.\nThe more complete chemistry mechanism in AM3 has been replaced by a light chemistry primarily meant to provide a minimal framework needed to generate sulfate and secondary organic aerosol from emission. The aerosol simulation in the model is substantially improved over that in AM3, particularly for the seasonal variations in Northern high latitudes and in highly polluted midlatitude regions (Figures 36 and 37 ).\nThe aerosol RFP is substantially lower in AM4.0 than in AM3, and the Cess sensitivity is lower as well. When the aerosol RFP is examined over the full twentieth century, we see a uniform in time reduction in RFP moving from AM3 to AM4.0 of 28% until roughly 1980, after which AM4 aerosol forcing, using CMIP6 emissions, weakens more rapidly than AM3 with CMIP5 emissions. The important question of the extent of tuning that resulting in these sensitivities will also be described in Part 2.\nWe have chosen to start with the C96 (roughly 100 km) horizontal resolution model and a vertical grid with 33 levels with a low top (and prescribed ozone), thereby putting aside model development focusing on the stratosphere in this initial stage. We do see a reasonable tropospheric wind response to the stratospheric ozone hole in the Southern Hemisphere summer, and sudden warmings have a realistic frequency, although the tropospheric response following stratospheric sudden warmings is relatively weak.
