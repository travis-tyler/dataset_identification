A\u03b242 did not predict change in cognitive scores, while increased YKL-40 was associated with less memory preservation in the total sample (r=-0.28, p=0.012) and less preservation of global cognition for amyloid positive participants (r=-.58, p=0.004). Our results suggest a role of inflammation in brain structure and cognitive changes in healthy aging, which may be partly dependent on amyloid status."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION:", "text": "Low level of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 represents a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Blennow et al., 2010) but is also a commonly described feature within clinically normal aging populations (Mormino, 2014) . We still do not understand why A\u03b2 is related to the development of disease in some persons, while others seem able to cope with substantial amyloid burden. Therefore, many studies point to an inconsistent relationship between A\u03b2, brain atrophy and cognition in aging, which can be caused by other factors that interact with amyloid (Ch\u00e9telat et al., 2016) . In this sense, neuroinflammation has been proposed as one critical factor. Similar to amyloid, neuroinflammation occurs in both AD and normal aging (Fleischman et al., 2010; Heneka et al., 2015) . Although neuroinflammation is observed in pathologically vulnerable brain regions in AD, it remains unclear whether insoluble A\u03b2 deposits or neurofibrillary tangles are causing inflammation (Akiyama et al., 2000) or whether inflammation may actually promote or accelerate deposition of A\u03b2 (Lee et al., 2008) . In addition, by means of neuropathological studies, we know that increasing age is associated with increased microglial activation accompanied by production of inflammatory cytokines and compromised neuronal function, including synaptic dysfunction (Costello et al., 2016) . The chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) is a CSF biomarker reflecting neuroinflammation (Craig-Schapiro et al., 2010) . Some studies have reported increased YKL-40 in AD (Ros\u00e9n et al., 2014) , predicting conversion to dementia (Antonell et al., 2014; Craig-Schapiro et al., 2010; Janelidze et al., 2016) . YKL-40 has also been related to brain atrophy in AD (Alcolea et al., 2015; Gispert et al., 2016) . However, the capabilities of YKL-40 to distinguish AD from controls have so far been found to be moderate in comparison with other CSFmarkers such as T-tau, P-tau and A\u03b242 (Olsson et al., 2016) , and some report no relationship with AD (Hellwig et al., 2015; Mattsson et al., 2011) . This may suggest that YKL-40 levels correlate with brain and cognitive processes just as much in normal aging as in AD.\nIn the present study, we tested the role of neuroinflammation in cortical atrophy and cognitive reductions in older adults without cognitive symptoms with either abnormal or normal amyloid status. Baseline measures of A\u03b242 and YKL-40 were used to predict cortical thinning and change in cognitive test scores over time. Although there are reasons to expect a relationship between amyloid levels and neuroinflammation, no previous study has directly tested how these biomarkers interact in predicting brain and cognitive decline in aging. While the role of YKL-40 in normal aging is almost unexplored, previous research on amyloid-related changes in the aging brain are conflicting, with some reporting more atrophy (Fagan et al., 2009; Schott et al., 2010; Tosun et al., 2010) in subjects with lower CSF A\u03b242 levels and others larger volumes (Ch\u00e9telat et al., 2010) , or non-linear relationships (Fortea et al., 2011) . It has also been suggested that the correlations between A\u03b242 and atrophy can be different for A\u03b2 positive vs. negative individuals. This has been described in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (Becker et al., 2011; Fjell et al., 2010 ), but has not to our knowledge been tested in other independent samples. With regard to cognitive changes, studies indicate that amyloid levels correlate, albeit not strongly, with cognitive function in normal populations (Hedden et al., 2013) .\nBecause of these controversies, it is necessary to study other factors that may show either amyloid-independent or amyloid-dependent relationships to atrophy and cognitive changes."}, {"section_title": "METHODS:", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The sample consisted of cognitively healthy older adults.

Intriguingly, no relationship was observed for A\u03b2 negative participants. As CSF levels of A\u03b242 and YKL40 were not related, this could indicate that these biomarkers are indicators of distinct processes in the brain that have additive detrimental effects on cognitive function in older adults at risk for AD. In addition, we found that CSF A\u03b242 levels predicted cortical atrophy only in amyloid positive participants. Seen together, these results indicate that mechanisms for brain atrophy and cognitive decline might be different in older adults that are positive in comparison with those negative for amyloid, underscoring the need to understand how amyloid relates to brain atrophy in cognitively normal older adults.\nThe implications of the results are discussed below."}, {"section_title": "Neuroinflammation and cortical thinning in A\u03b2 positive older adults", "text": "Here we used CSF YKL-40 levels as a measure of neuroinflammation and we found that increased levels of this biomarker predicted global changes in cognition in the A\u03b2+ group, indicating that neuroinflammation might play an important role for cognitive changes in older adults with altered amyloid status. In addition, increasing age has been associated with increased microglial activation (Costello et al., 2016) .\nAbnormal, increased levels of CSF YKL-40 are observed in AD patients (Craig-Schapiro et al., 2010; Janelidze et al., 2016; Olsson et al., 2016) , but this is not invariably found (Hellwig et al., 2015; Mattsson et al., 2011) . However, no studies have previously tested whether this biomarker is increased also in healthy older adults with altered amyloid levels. Intriguingly, our result suggests that even if the level of neuroinflammation as indexed by YKL-40 does not vary as a function of amyloid accumulation, the ability of the brain to cope with the inflammation is different depending on the subject amyloid status. Thus, inflammation predicts cognitive reduction over time in the presence of higher amyloid levels only, with the lower risk older adults probably being able to better cope with the burden of neuroinflammation.\nThis is not an on-off mechanism, however, as we found that changes in verbal memory correlated with YKL-40 levels also within the full sample. Thus, the present results indicate that YKL-40 indexes neuroinflammatory processes that have mild but nevertheless detrimental effects on cognitive function in older adults, and that these detrimental effects are significantly larger in participants with increased A\u03b242 levels."}, {"section_title": "Cortical thinning at the different CSF A\u03b242 levels", "text": "In addition to the A\u03b2-dependent effects of neuroinflammation on cognition, we found that decreased CSF A\u03b242 correlated with cortical thinning in the A\u03b2+ participants.\nThis further indicate that there might be degenerative processes occurring at this narrow range of A\u03b242 levels even in individuals free from clinical symptoms. This pattern has previously been described within the ADNI cohort of normal older adults (Becker et al., 2011; Fjell et al., 2010) . These two studies found that only under a certain threshold of A\u03b242 levels in CSF, A\u03b242 correlated with accelerated brain atrophy. The present study demonstrates this pattern in a different sample than the ADNI database. Taken together, these findings indicate that amyloid positive older adults are less able to cope with processes in the brain that might otherwise not be as harmful in older adults without evidence of brain amyloid accumulation."}, {"section_title": "Neuroinflammation, amyloid and changes in cognition", "text": "Previous literature has described null or relatively weak relationships between common CSF AD biomarkers such as A\u03b242 and memory/cognition in healthy elderly participants (Aschenbrenner et al., 2015; Fjell et al., 2014; Hedden et al., 2013) . This has encouraged the community to study the roles of alternative markers in addition to amyloid to better explain cognitive reductions and brain atrophy in aging. Our results, though being moderate in strength, indicate that YKL-40 is one such marker, primarily when seen in coexistence with altered levels of established risk markers such as A\u03b242. This fits with theories of amyloid and neuroinflammation working together to cause decline in older adults with neurodegenerative conditions such as AD (Heneka et al., 2015) , even if the evidence for these theories in humans is scarce and to a large extent based on genetic studies. Further, additive roles of amyloid accumulation and neuroinflammation have not been tested in cognitively normal older adults. The results of the present study suggest that effects of inflammation on cognitive decline in non-demented may partly depend on amyloid status. Adding to this, we found that the same cognitive test also correlated with longitudinal changes in cortical thickness. Participants with less capability to maintain or improve performance on the animal naming test showed more decreases in cortical thickness.\nThese results are in accordance with previous studies showing correlations between longitudinal changes in brain structure and changes in cognition (Fjell et al., 2013; Persson et al., 2016; Rodrigue and Raz, 2004) .\nAlthough being predictive of cognitive reductions, CSF YKL-40 levels did not correlate with cortical thinning. Some previous studies have reported correlations between thinner cortex and higher YKL-40 levels (Alcolea et al., 2015; Gispert et al., 2016) or other markers of inflammation (Fleischman et al., 2010) , while others did not find relationships with measures of brain structures such as hippocampal volume (Melah et al., 2015) . The studies mentioned above were all cross-sectional, in contrast to the present longitudinal design. Further, these former studies included patients with MCI or AD, thus not being fully comparable. Still, when the present results are seen in contrast to the identified relationship between amyloid levels and cortical thinning in the amyloid positive participants, it is evident that the relationship between amyloid levels, neuroinflammation and brain atrophy is complex. To get a deeper understanding of the mechanisms at play, we will likely also need to include additional biomarkers as well as genetic factors in the analyses."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion:", "text": "One important theory holds that sustained inflammatory responses to amyloid accumulation increase brain atrophy in AD (Gouwens et al., 2016; Heneka et al., 2015) , and the increased levels of neuroinflammation observed also in cognitively normal older adults make it important to investigate amyloidinflammation relationships also in non-demented. Here we found that YKL-40, as a measure of neuroinflammation, correlated with cognitive reductions in amyloid positive older adults only. In contrast, CSF A\u03b242 levels per se did not predict cognitive decline, but still were related to brain atrophy in amyloid positive participants. Put together, these findings highlight the need for considering how newer biomarkers interact with the established ones in predicting cognitive and brain changes in aging. This may provide better understanding of the processes that are crucial in the transitional phase between normal aging and neurodegeneration."}, {"section_title": "REFERENCES", "text": ""}]
