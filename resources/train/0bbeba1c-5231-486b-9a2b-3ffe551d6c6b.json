In PA, the problem-solving process involves identifying and confirming production issues facing producers, and then creating either specifically applied solutions (to address issues in specific locations) or uniform solutions (to address widespread problems.) Production yield issues can range from variable rate N application and pesticide application rates to determining variable plant populations based on intra-field variability in soil fertility. When finding solutions to these problems, PA merges agronomic comprehension (taught in agronomic classes) with advanced technologies applications (often taught in agricultural engineering or engineering classes) (Shannon, 2017). These fields of study often require employees possessing distinct knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to competently perform specific tasks and to find successful solutions for specific PA application issues. 1 In addition, because producers want to know the \"bottom line\" for their economic sustainability, PA providers must also have an understanding of the financial implications of PA decisions. The adoption of PA and the extent of its value is dependent upon farmers and their service providers having knowledge about agronomic issues affecting their location. Knowledge of available technologies, as well as having qualified and competent support to manage and troubleshoot technologically advanced machines, is critical to successful PA adoption. Anecdotal evidence suggests that farmers often lack the knowledge, time, and equipment to capitalize fully on PA. On the other hand, agricultural equipment and chemical supply retailers and other advisers, who can be key in helping to drive PA adoption, often struggle to find competent individuals to fill their sales, service, and support roles. Smith et al. (2013) investigated the role of PA adoption on a farm's cost structure, focusing on PA cost efficiency issues associated with economies of scale effect. A recent study by Schimmelpfennig (2016), based on U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Resource Management Survey data, investigated the issue of profitability associated with adopting PA technology (mapping, guidance, and variable rate technology.) He provides data illustrating increased use of PA technology across six major U.S. field crops over the last two decades. Schimmelpfennig indicates that PA adoption varies widely across PA technologies. However, he finds there is a positive relationship between farm scale and adoption rates. He also reports that the effect of PA adoption on profitability is dependent on farm scale effects. His results are consistent with Smith et al. (2013). These recent economic studies provide an empirical linkage between PA adoption rates and farm economies of scale. Given the long-run trend in farm size (acreage per farm increasing) and the economic benefits of PA technology to enhance scale economies, the positive trend in PA adoption rates across major U.S. field crops is likely to continue in the future. Thus, the development of a skilled workforce for the PA sector is a critical factor to support growth in the PA industry and an increase in future PA adoption rates. The literature indicates that universities and community colleges find it hard to stay ahead of the rapid advances in both the technology and agronomic solutions associated with PA adoption (for additional discussion see Skouby, 2017). However, industry views educational training as crucial to maximize PA workforce development (Erickson and Widmar, 2015). The importance of continuing to develop a knowledgeable agricultural workforce has been highlighted in many venues. These include: meeting. Numerous subgroups attending the community sessions at this meeting were invited to attend the planning session (focus group) for discussion on key aspects needed in PA curricula. Volunteers were split into areas of interest. e.

The education survey is part of an ongoing multistate research initiative focused on improving methods and materials taught in PA classes across the United States. The survey was conducted during the summer and early fall of 2015, targeting teaching faculty associated with PA courses. Instructors from two-year and four-year institutions participated. The education survey was designed to complement a survey of retail dealerships providing PA services. The retail dealership survey was also web-based and conducted at the national level by the same survey team. The dealer survey provides insight on the current views and future needs of the retail sector with respect to workforce PA educational training in technical skill areas (Erickson et al., 2017). The survey design allows the structure of PA education in the United States to be assessed. Specific areas of interest include: a) type of institutions offering PA instruction; b) structure of PA curriculum; c) instructor views on which PA occupational categories students are targeting for employment after graduation; d) instructor perspectives of the KSAs a student must have for different PA occupational categories; e) a comparison across educational institution categories; f) a comparison of education versus retail survey expectations on PA training; and g) instructor views on types of PA KSAs that are in need of expansion in their current PA curriculum, as well as the alignment of said views with those of retail dealer survey respondents."}, {"section_title": "Survey Methods", "text": "Both the education and retail dealer (Erickson et al., 2017) surveys were web-based. Ninety institutions offering PA courses were initially identified, using personal contacts, the USDA National Agricultural Library, and other internet sources. A letter describing survey goals was sent to selected institutions via the U.S. Postal Service. Subjects were asked to return a stamped postcard indicting their willingness to participate in the survey. After two mailings, 58 postcards indicating a willingness to participate were returned, a 64% return rate. These 58 subjects were then sent a letter with instructions for accessing the online survey.

The survey includes three components: a) a General Institutional Information section, b) Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities section, and c) a section of short course offerings and traditional semester courses. Respondents answer specific questions eliciting their opinions on which KSAs are most important with respect to five diverse PA occupational categories (KSA list and importance by occupational category provided in Table 2). The types of PA occupational categories selected are Equipment Operator, Agronomist, Precision Ag Equipment Technician, Technical Support, and Precision Agricultural Sales Specialist.

According to Boone and Boone (2012), statistical analysis of 'Likert-Type Data' requires the use of a nonparametric statistical method. A widely used nonparametric test for location (median) is the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) (Daniel, 1978: p. 82). Likert-Type data reported in the paper are the average responses to survey questions. However, for the discussion of statistical differences, it was decided to include nonparametric analysis to investigate two issues. The first issue draws exclusively on the educational survey to investigate the following question, \"Is there a difference between 2and 4-year institutions with respect to the ranking of importance of a specific KSA within a precision agricultural occupational category?\" Next, the data collected from a PA retail dealership survey on KSA importance by occupational category is merged with the data collected in the educational survey. The merging of the data sets allows an examination of whether there is a difference between educators' and retail dealership employers' and supervisors' rankings of the importance of a specific KSA within a specific PA occupational category. This second issue contains two subsequent questions to which insight from the combined survey data can provide answers. First, how effective is current PA educational programming in meeting the needs of the industry? Second, is there consistency in the views of educators and employers concerning the effectiveness of educational programming to meet the labor force needs of the retail PA industry? Statistical analysis of the combined educational and retail survey data relied on nonparametric statistical methods. Discussion of statistical results with respect to location differences between two-year and four-year institutions is provided, where *,**,*** denote p-values of 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. The same methodology was used to analyze educator versus retail industry responses. All statistical results reported used the SAS 'Exact Test Procedure' to determine the p-values for the WMW hypothesis tests generated using SAS \"NPAR1Way\" procedure."}, {"section_title": "Survey Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Two-year versus Four-year PA Curriculum Structures", "text": "Currently, the number of institutions offering degrees is sparse. There are institutions that offer two-year degrees (Ivy Tech) and others that offer graduate degrees in PA including the University of Georgia and Colorado State University. Currently, only one U.S. institution (South Dakota State University) offers an undergraduate Precision Ag major, but this has only been in place since Fall 2016. Eighty-eight percent of PA instructors who responded to the survey indicated they were extremely familiar with the PA curriculum at their respective institution. The average number of unique PA class offerings per institution was 2.4, with a range of 1 to 7, with average class size of 31 students and average credits per class at 2.8. The average amount of class time students spent engaged in lab activities was 55%. Forty percent of PA classes were taught strictly in the classroom, while the remaining courses were a mix of in-classroom, lab, and internet instruction. Regarding degrees and certificates, 68% of the respondents indicated their respective institution does not offer any type of PA degree or certificate. No WMW statistical differences occurred between two-year and four-year institutions with respect to curriculum structure. 6 Respondents provided rankings for educational delivery methods used in PA classes. Rankings addressed the usefulness of specific information resources for students (e.g., textbook, lab manual, e-module) on a Likert Scale with 3 indicating the most educational value and 1 the least. On average, respondent rankings from most to least value were textbook, lab manual, e-module, YouTube, and other educational delivery methods ( Figure 1). The WMW test showed a median ranking difference that indicates two-year schools placed a higher ranking on textbooks (2.6 vs 2.1 * ), lab manuals (2.3 vs. 1.8 * ), and other methods (0.7 vs. 0.4 * ), with no statistical difference with respect to e-modules. For the use of YouTube videos, the WMW test indicates that four-year institutions valued this educational material delivery mechanism higher than two-year institutions (2.1 vs. 1.5 ** ). "}, {"section_title": "Respondent Views on PA Student Preferences and Outcomes", "text": "Educators were asked to estimate the eventual occupational categories of their graduates (Figure 2). Agronomist ranked highest (24%) followed by farmer/farmmanager with a combined ranking of 22%, equipment operator (20%), equipment tech (14%), precision sales (9%), and tech support (9%). Only the agronomist category differed between institutions (10% level of significance). Four-year institutions indicated a higher percentage of graduates working as agronomists (27%) compared with two-year institutions (15%). Educators were asked to estimate the starting salary for each of the PA occupation classifications discussed above. Figure 3 provides the estimated average salary. Two-tailed hypothesis tests indicated no statistical difference in graduate starting salaries between two-and four-year institutions across all five PA occupation categories. However, if one assumes that employees with four-year degrees earn a higher salary than those with two-year degrees, then at the 10% level of significance, four-year intuitions report higher expected salaries for graduating students in the occupation areas of equipment and support technicians.   The next issue addressed is the educator's view on how student enrollment has changed with respect to the occupational category during the last three years ( Figure  4). Student enrollment has been increasing for the core PA occupational roles requiring technical training. Educators indicate that student demand is strongest in training for precision equipment technicians, followed by agronomist, technology support, and precision sales. Statistical analysis indicated there is a difference in enrollment changes between two-and four-year institutions in a subset of occupational category areas. This Likert Scale question is defined as 1=increasing rapidly to 5=declining rapidly. For equipment operator, agronomy, and PA sales, two-year institutions averaged a Likert ranking of 2.5, 2.9, and 3.4, respectively, while the four-year institutional rankings were 2.8, 1.8, and 1.9, respectively. However, WMW statistical tests indicated no statistical differences between these institution categories. While not statistically significant, the data does suggest that four-year institutions are seeing greater student demand for higher-skilled occupations like agronomy and sales. The survey data does provide statistical evidence of increased student demand for precision equipment technical education. Perceived student demand for this PA occupation is statistically higher at four-year institutions. The average enrollmentchange Likert Scale value reported by two-year institutions was 3.3. For four-year institutional respondents, it is 1.6 ** . Additionally, for the precision ag technical support occupational category, the average ranking for two-year institutions was 3.4 (little or no change, or declining slowly) compared with 2.0 * (increasing modestly) for four-year institutions. The data from this set of questions suggests that, while four-year institutions are expecting an increase in student demand in all areas of PA education except the area of equipment operator, two-year schools are expecting demand to remain stable, relative to past enrollment levels. Again, the caveat is reiterated that these results reflect the views of faculty respondents associated with institutions of higher education. The next issue the survey addresses is the identification of the type of student enrolling in PA classes. Educators provided an accounting of enrolled students by their academic major in PA courses. Survey respondents ( Figure 5) indicated that 38% were agronomy majors, 18% agricultural system majors, 17% business majors, and 19% are from a broad spectrum of majors (excluding engineering and technology.) This result suggests there is broad interest in PA education opportunities across a wide array of student majors and interests. However, this also indicates that students \"specializing\" in PA may not receive some of the essential KSA training needed in the workplace, especially since most institutions do not offer a formal PA option program."}, {"section_title": "Perception of the Importance of KSAs by Occupational Category", "text": "Tables 2 and 3 provide summary ranking data for educational and retail industry respondents with respect to the importance of KSAs by occupational category.

In both cases, four-year institutions placed greater emphasis on developing each of these KSA areas relative to two-year institutions (2.4 vs. 3.0* and 1.4 vs. 2.2***, respectively). It appears that four-year institutions view business skills and precision agricultural software as areas of deficiency in their programs, but two-year institutions do not (Table 2). One interesting trend in the reported data that needs to be highlighted is the divergence in survey respondent views on the importance of a particular KSA to an occupation and the respondent view whether PA student exposure to a particular KSA skill needs to be expanded in the curriculum. Both two-year and four-year schools indicated that KSA 7 (communication) was very important across all five occupation categories (2.73), but educator response on the issue of the need to expand communication courses in PA curriculum ranked very low (two-year at 1.5 and four-year at 1.9).

The statistical significant difference between rankings are in the following KSA categories: KSA 3, KSA 8, and KSA 9. The retail industry ranked all three of these KSA areas higher than educators.

Educator rankings are consistent in level and order of rankings. Educators ranked tech support (2.46) as the occupation needing the most intensive level of general training, followed by sales specialist and agronomist (tied at 2.42), equipment operator (2.25), and equipment tech (2.21).

This also suggests that additional work is needed to refine educational materials across PA occupational categories. It does appear, from the industry's viewpoint, that a single educational curriculum model will not meet the industry's needs across PA occupational categories. Another interesting pattern emerges from the comparison of educator versus retailer views on the relative importance of KSA by occupation. Retailers, with the exception of the equipment operator category, statistically ranked KSA 8 higher. The same is true for KSA 9, except that technical support was ranked higher but not statistically significant.
