This study examined relationships between AD biomarkers of A\u2424 and neurodegeneration as well as cognitive performance in cognitively normal older individuals. A\u2424 burden was quantified in 72 normal older human subjects from the Berkeley Aging Cohort (BAC) using [\n11 C] Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography. In the same individuals, we measured hippocampal volume, as well as glucose metabolism and cortical thickness, which were extracted from a template of cortical AD-affected regions. The three functional and structural biomarkers were merged into a highly AD-sensitive multimodality biomarker reflecting neural integrity. In the normal older individuals, there was no association between elevated PIB uptake and either the single-modality or the multimodality neurodegenerative biomarkers. Lower neural integrity within the AD-affected regions and a control area (the visual cortex) was related to lower scores on memory and executive function tests; the same association was not found with PIB retention. The relationship between cognition and the multimodality AD biomarker was stronger in individuals with the highest PIB uptake. The findings indicate that neurodegeneration occurs within AD regions regardless of A\u2424 deposition and accounts for worse cognition in cognitively normal older people. The impact of neural integrity on cognitive functions is, however, enhanced in the presence of high A\u2424 burden for brain regions that are most affected in AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is great interest in detecting and characterizing cognitively normal older individuals with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hallmark AD pathology of \u2424-amyloid (A\u2424) plaque burden and neurodegeneration is seen in a substantial proportion of cognitively normal older people Dickerson et al., 2011) , suggesting a preclinical stage of AD. Cortical A\u2424 deposition has been proposed as the initiating factor in AD progression ; however, this view is hypothetical and other models have been suggested (Herrup, 2010) .\nAlthough preclinical AD criteria include biomarkers of A\u2424 burden and neurodegeneration , the relationships between A\u2424, neuronal damage, and cognition in the normal elderly remain unclear.\nImaged in vivo with [11C] Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) (Klunk et al., 2004) , A\u2424 deposition is found in 20 -30% of cognitively normal older people Quigley et al., 2011) . Neurodegenerative AD pathology is known to target circumscribed posterior cortical and hippocampal regions (Perrin et al., 2009 ). There it can be de-tected using biomarkers of neuronal function and structure, such as glucose metabolism measured by [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET (Landau et al., 2011) , as well as cortical thickness (Dickerson et al., 2009 ) and hippocampal volume, both delineated from structural magnetic resonance images (MRIs).\nIn cognitively normal older individuals, the relationship between A\u2424 and cognitive functioning is inconsistent and weak (Aizenstein et al., 2008; Mormino et al., 2009) . By contrast, neurodegeneration (as reflected in MRI, FDG PET, and tau biomarkers) seems to be more closely tied to cognitive ability (den Heijer et al., 2006; Dickerson et al., 2011; Desikan et al., 2012) . Although atrophy within the hippocampus (Storandt et al., 2009; Rowe et al., 2010) and cortical AD-affected regions (Becker et al., 2011; Ch\u00e9telat et al., 2012) may be related to fibrillar A\u2424 plaques, other reports have failed to show such associations (Storandt et al., 2012) . In previous studies, AD-like neurodegeneration was found in individuals without evidence of cortical A\u2424 deposition (Dickerson and Wolk, 2012; Jack et al., 2012) . These results imply that neurodegenerative abnormalities in AD-affected regions may not be invariably associated with A\u2424.\nReductions in neural integrity may also be attributed to ageassociated degeneration (Raz and Rodrigue, 2006) . This is because AD-related and age-related gray matter atrophy converges on hetero-modal regions Fjell et al., 2009) . One approach to examine the AD biomarker model in cognitively normal older adults is therefore the definition of biomarkers that have a high enough power to discriminate abnormal (ADrelated) from normal (age-related) neuronal properties on an individual basis.\nThis study quantified neurodegeneration in cognitively normal older adults using highly sensitive AD biomarkers. First, in a sample of AD patients and A\u2424-negative healthy controls, a multimodality parameter (reflecting neural integrity) was established from single-modality biomarkers (cortical thickness, glucose metabolism, and hippocampal volume) as extracted within ADaffected regions. Second, we assessed whether neurodegeneration within the AD regions would be associated with both poorer cognitive functions and cortical A\u2424 deposition."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "The design of the study entailed deriving AD neurodegenerative biomarkers in one group of subjects, and validating them in another.

In step 1, domain-sensitive cognitive tests were defined, which were then averaged using z scores in step 2.\nThe domain-sensitive tests of memory and executive functions were selected in a procedure that optimized conceptual relevance and suitable measurement characteristics (minimum data loss and mid-range test scores). Domain sensitivity of the cognitive tests was corroborated using a principal component analysis (PCA) with orthogonal (varimax) rotation. The analysis was performed for the test scores of the first neuropsychological test session using a larger sample of the cognitively normal older BAC participants (N \u03ed 303 at the time of analysis, mean age \u03ed 71.5 (9.0) years, age span 50 -96 years, N of women \u03ed 205 (68%), education \u03ed 16.9 (2.1) years, education span 12-20 years, MMSE \u03ed 28.8 (1.3), MMSE span 25-30). Bartlett's test of sphericity indicated that the intercorrelations between cognitive tests were sufficiently large for the PCA. Two factor components were confirmed using Kaiser's criterion of an eigenvalue \u03fe1 and explained 60.3% of the total variance in combination.\nThe memory factor was composed of episodic memory tests, specifically the free recall trials 1-5 of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) II (Delis et al., 2000) , the Logical Memory recall of story A and B (Wechsler, 1997a) , and the Visual Reproduction Delayed Recall as well as Recognition (Wechsler, 1997a) .

The cognitive tests were combined into the composite measures by converting each test to z scores using the mean and SD of the overall BAC cohort (see above) and averaging them.\nCognitive data used to describe the ADNI participants and the UCSF AD patients were limited to the MMSE and CDR (Table 1) .\nNeuroimaging data acquisition and preprocessing MRI ADNI NC and AD samples. The high-resolution T1-weighted magnetizationprepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) were obtained at multiple ADNI sites using a standardized acquisition protocol (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/ research/protocols/mri-protocols/) on General Electric (GE), Siemens, or Philips 1.5T systems. For this study, we used preprocessed MPRAGE scans that had undergone a full set of image correction steps at the time of analysis, including gradient warping (except Philips Scanner), intensity correction, and scaling (available in 33/39 cases) .\nBAC NC samples. MRI scans were acquired at LBNL on a 1.5T Magnetom Avanto system (Siemens) using a 12 channel head coil run in triple mode.

The \"raw\" FDG PET frames were averaged and processed to yield images with standard orientation, voxel size, and 8 mm isotropic full-width/ half-maximum (FWHM) resolution (Joshi et al., 2009; Jagust et al., 2010) . The preprocessed FDG PET images (standardized orientation, intensity correction, and resolution) were normalized using the pons as the reference region.\nBAC NC and UCSF AD samples. FDG PET imaging was performed at LBNL with an ECAT EXACT HR PET scanner (Siemens), \u03f32 h after PIB tracer injection. Following 6 -10 mCi of tracer injection, 6 \u03eb 5 min frames of emission data were collected starting 30 min after injection. All FDG PET data were reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with weighted attenuation. Images were smoothed applying a 4 \u03eb 4 \u03eb 4 mm Gaussian kernel with scatter correction.\nThe six \"raw\" FDG PET frames were aligned to the first frame and averaged using Statistical Parametric Mapping version 8 (SPM8; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Individual FDG frames were then realigned to the resultant average image and combined to create a singleframe average image. To enhance comparability with the ADNI FDG scans, each subject's average FDG PET image was smoothed to a resolution of 8 mm FWHM using a Gaussian kernel of 5.5 mm in plane and 4.0 mm in the slice direction. The kernel was determined with the same protocol used to create standard resolution images in ADNI (Joshi et al., 2009) . The smoothed FDG PET scans were intensity normalized to the pons, as edited from the subcortical FreeSurfer 5.1. parcellation of the native-space MRI scans (Fischl et al., 2002) . The choice of reference region was based on evidence indicating preservation of pontine glucose metabolism in AD patients (Minoshima et al., 1995) . There was no partial volume correction performed.\nWe adopted a procedure previously described (Park et al., 2006) . Each subject's preprocessed FDG PET image was coregistered to the MRI scan using an SPM-based coregistration algorithm (Ashburner and Friston, 1997) . The coregistered volumetric FDG image was then sampled onto the cortical surface by means of maximum projection. Namely, an intensity profile was created by sampling 10 equal proportions of the FDG PET intensity values between white matter and pial surface at each vertex. The FDG surface maps were created by mapping the maximum intensity value derived from the vertex-wise intensity profile to the reconstructed surface. Maximum projection was chosen because it is more robust to minor registration and MRI segmentation errors (Park et al., 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "PIB PET", "text": "For the BAC NCs, PIB PET scans were collected at LBNL.

The realigned frames corresponding to the first 20 min of acquisition were averaged and used to coregister the structural MRI to the nativespace PIB PET image. Distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were generated with Logan graphical analysis on the aligned PIB frames using the native-space gray matter cerebellum as a reference region (Logan et al., 1996; Klunk et al., 2004; Price et al., 2005) , fitting 35-90 min after injection.\nFor each subject, a global cortical PIB index was derived from the native-space DVR image over frontal (cortical regions anterior to the precentral sulcus), temporal (middle and superior temporal regions), parietal (supramarginal gyrus, inferior/superior parietal lobules, and precuneus), and anterior/posterior cingulate regions-of-interest (ROIs), previously demonstrated to exhibit higher PIB retention in AD subjects compared with cognitively normal controls (Price et al., 2005) .

In an automated procedure each MPRAGE scan was bias-field corrected, intensity normalized, and skull stripped using a watershed algorithm (Dale et al., 1999; Segonne et al., 2004) . The resulting image was subjected to a white matter segmentation algorithm to define the white/gray matter boundary. After topology correction of the reconstructed white/gray matter border surfaces (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 2002; Segonne et al., 2004) , the pial surfaces were estimated (Fischl and Dale, 2000) . A triangular mesh represented the structures of white and gray matter (or pial) surfaces, such that image properties could be mapped to each node (or vertex) of the triangular mesh. Cortical thickness surface maps were derived by calculating the distance between the two surfaces at each vertex across the entire cortex (Fischl and Dale, 2000) .

To examine whether biomarker effects were stronger within AD-affected regions, a non-AD \"control\" region was chosen.

The resulting registration also mapped the FDG surface maps into a common surface space. All surface maps were smoothed by an iterative nearest-neighbor averaging procedure (Fischl et al., 1999b ) with a FWHM Gaussian kernel of 15 mm for cortical thickness and 10 mm for FDG PET. To validate data quality, we first generated statistical surface maps for FDG PET and cortical thickness using general linear models (GLMs) with the predictors of diagnosis (ADNI NC, ADNI AD) and demeaned covariates of no interest (education and age). The single-modality group contrasts (ADNI NC \u03fe ADNI AD) produced maps of AD-related cortical thinning and hypometabolism.\nTo limit neurodegenerative biomarkers to regions that were affected by both AD-related cortical thinning and hypometabolism, we defined the convergence of cortical thinning and hypometabolism maps. This was done, because our preliminary data analyses indicated that the convergence map comprised a minimum set of cortical regions without reductions in AD-sensitivity and specificity compared with the singlemodality (FDG PET or cortical thickness) statistical surface maps. To extract the convergence map, a binary mask was created from the statistical hypometabolic surface map to spatially restrict the computation of the statistical thinning map using an equivalent GLM. Within each hemisphere, ROIs with an area larger than 300 mm 2 were defined in the statistical thinning map and converted to an ROI template of cortical AD regions (or cortical AD template). For all analyses, the statistical threshold was set to p \u03fd 0.00005 (uncorrected); the equivalent false discovery rate (FDR) threshold is provided.\nUsing the cortical AD and control templates, cortical thickness and FDG PET were derived for each subject of each sample (ADNI NC, ADNI AD, BAC NC, UCSF AD). The templates were mapped onto each subject's native-space cortical thickness and FDG PET surface image using the spherical registration of the MRI scan to the standard brain. For each ROI, mean cortical thickness and FDG PET were estimated. ROI-specific values were averaged and weighted by the number of vertices.\nHippocampal volume was obtained within each hemisphere of the native-space MRI scan using the automated subcortical FreeSurfer 5.1 parcellation and averaged across hemispheres. The HV was adjusted for head size (abbreviated as HVicv) via a regression model including all available subjects.

Current criteria for preclinical AD propose that cognitively normal older people, who harbor both amyloid burden and associated neuronal injury, are at an advanced preclinical stage . This study therefore assessed relationships between AD biomarkers of A\u2424 and neurodegeneration and their relation to cross-sectional cognitive performance in cognitively normal older adults.\nThere were four important findings: Using an optimized combination of cortical thickness, FDG PET and hippocampal volume, we created a multimodality biomarker with high power to differentiate AD patients from healthy (A\u2424-negative) older individuals. This AD-sensitive biomarker can be interpreted to capture the presence or loss of neural integrity within regions that are severely affected by AD pathology. Sampled from cognitively normal older individuals (BAC NC sample), there was no association between the biomarkers of A\u2424 burden (measured by the PIB uptake status) and neurodegeneration (measured by the multimodality biomarker). Lower levels of neural integrity within the AD-affected and the control region (visual cortex) were related to poorer cognitive abilities. For the AD regions, this biomarker-cognition relationship was stronger for individuals with the highest A\u2424 burden.\nThe amyloid cascade model postulates that abnormal A\u2424-plaque accumulation is a necessary trigger of AD-typical neurodegeneration . One can therefore reason that individuals with abnormal neurodegenerative biomarkers would be A\u2424-positive. Using a hypothesis-driven approach that defined neural properties within AD-affected regions, we found considerable variability in neural integrity among our normal older individuals, regardless of A\u2424 burden. The finding conflicts with the biomarker model, but is consistent with emerging data. A recent study classified the A\u2424 and the neurodegenerative biomarker status of normal older people according to criteria for preclinical AD (Jack et al., 2012) . In this sample, neurodegenerative AD biomarker abnormalities were found in a substantial proportion (23%) of A\u2424-negative individuals. In another study, the presence of cortical thinning in AD signature regions was associated with AD-like CSF A\u2424 in 60% of subjects, leaving the high proportion of 40% of such individuals exhibiting normal CSF A\u2424 (Dickerson and Wolk, 2012) .\nOur data and others (Fjell et al., 2010a; Jack et al., 2012 ) thus converge on the fact that neuronal damage within AD target regions is non-specific for A\u2424 pathology in normal older adults. This suggests that biomarker models and preclinical AD stages proposing A\u2424-plaque burden as the initiating factor of ADtypical neurodegeneration could be incorrect . In older people, reductions of neural integrity may be the result of non-AD (pathological) factors that modulate neuronal structure and function over the lifespan. Further, recent demonstrations of trans-neuronal propagation of tau pathology (de Calignon et al., 2012) raise the possibility that the early appearance of entorhinal cortical neurofibrillary tangles could be associated with alterations of function in neocortical neurons projecting to the medial temporal lobe. Thus, in an alternative model to that which proposes A\u2424 as the initiating event, tau-related neurodegeneration may arise independently from A\u2424 deposition (Mesulam, 1999; Small and Duff, 2008) . Scenarios where neurodegenerative abnormalities emerge before or in parallel with A\u2424 may converge with theoretical models that posit an initiating role of neuronal injury in the development of AD (Herrup, 2010) .\nIn our study, lower neural integrity within (but not limited to) AD-affected regions was a close predictor of decreased cognitive abilities. The observation mirrors earlier findings that documented a positive relationship between cognitive abilities and cortical thickness in distributed brain areas (Fjell et al., 2006) . A\u2424 burden itself was a poor predictor of cognitive performance in the same individuals corroborating previous inconsistent effects in cross-sectional data (Pike et al., 2007; Aizenstein et al., 2008; Mormino et al., 2009; Oh et al., , 2012 . Other studies have highlighted the notion that neuronal injury within AD-affected regions is not benign and may increase the risk for timedependent cognitive decline and AD conversion in normal older adults (den Heijer et al., 2006; Dickerson et al., 2011) . Moreover, in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), medial temporal lobe degeneration without A\u2424 abnormalities yielded almost as high risk of AD conversion than having both A\u2424 and neurodegenerative abnormalities (Heister et al., 2011) . Our results contribute to these findings by showing that neurodegeneration is associated with poorer cognition regardless of A\u2424 burden in cognitively intact older adults. Neuronal injury in AD-affected regions seemed to increase the vulnerability of the brain to late-life A\u2424 pathology. This was supported by the interaction between the biomarkers of A\u2424 deposition and neurodegeneration. Specifically, although A\u2424 burden itself was unrelated to the neurodegenerative biomarker and cognitive abilities, worse cognition occurred when A\u2424 deposits coincided with lower neural integrity, specifically within the AD regions. The observation agrees with theoretical conceptualizations and empirical data (Knopman et al., 2012 ) that denote heightened risk for poor cognitive functions in those individuals that harbor A\u2424 burden and neurodegeneration. However, the presence of neurodegeneration without A\u2424, and the potentiation of neurodegenerative effects by A\u2424, are not consistent with these models. The observation that neurodegeneration and A\u2424 are not simply additive suggests that these two processes interact through mechanisms that remain unclear. Similar to our present findings, deleterious A\u2424 effects on longitudinal cognition change were previously moderated by the presence of tau (Desikan et al., 2012) and signs of neuronal damage within the hippocampus as well as cortical AD regions (Wirth et al., 2013) . At the same time, cognitive functioning was maintained in our high A\u2424 burden individuals with normal neural integrity, suggesting that A\u2424 burden per se might not be detrimental (Desikan et al., 2012) . The data convey that AD-like neurodegeneration, as emerging from A\u2424-independent pathways, could act as a catalyst of A\u2424-associated effects.\nIn a broader view, the present findings imply that different (other than A\u2424) neurodestructive and/or neuroprotective factors cause intersubject variability in neural structure and function, which is relevant to cognitive abilities in advanced age. In particular, age (or aging) itself is associated with cognitive worsening (Hedden and Gabrieli, 2004) and gray matter shrinkage within heteromodal cortices Fjell et al., 2009 Fjell et al., , 2010b . Although the present neurodegenerative biomarkers were adjusted for chronological age, it could be possible that there were residual effects of age that remained. Alternatively, non-AD vascular pathology, even subclinical cerebrovascular risk factors, may cause brain atrophy in normal elderly adults in distributed brain areas Leritz et al., 2011) . In addition, tau pathology could arise independently from A\u2424 in advanced ages, affect neural integrity and interact with A\u2424 in producing cognitive decline (Small and Duff, 2008) . Finally, as a developmental modifier of brain properties, a person's intellectual \"baseline\" needs to be considered. Intellectual ability in old age is related to intelligence in early life stages (Deary, 2000) , where it is associated with enhanced gray matter structure (Hulshoff Pol et Our study has several strengths. We created highly sensitive neurodegenerative biomarkers using an independent sample of AD patients and A\u2424-negative, carefully screened cognitively normal older individuals. We further combined single-into multimodality biomarkers using a linear function. Although we had only a small and variable clinical validation group, the results of the validation process coincided with previous observations that multimodality biomarker fusion can increase diagnostic accuracy (Oishi et al., 2011; ). An optimized combination of functional and structural biomarkers has been suggested to increase the power to capture different neuropathological processes in different brain areas. This can be used to improve the differentiation of normal and pathological neuronal properties (Knopman et al., 2012) . However, it is important to note that the cross-sectional nature of our study limits interpretation regarding biomarker causality as well as AD progression.\nTogether, our data concur with some aspects of the amyloid hypothesis of AD but conflict with others. In agreement with the amyloid hypothesis, we find that neurodegeneration is more strongly associated with cognition than is A\u2424. However, the interaction between the two processes suggests that neurodegeneration does not simply mediate the effects of A\u2424 on the brain. The data further conflict with the amyloid hypothesis by showing that A\u2424 is not required to develop neurodegeneration within AD-affected regions. The present findings have major bearings on current conceptualizations of aging and preclinical AD."}]
