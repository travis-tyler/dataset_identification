[{"section_title": "", "text": "and descriptors. While several marine habitat classification schemes are available and used by various researchers and resource management agencies, none are universally accepted because each scheme has unique benefits and challenges. For example, the most widely used habitat classification system was developed for wetlands by Cowardin et al. (1979), which does not adequately address subtidal marine habitats. Therefore, other classification schemes were developed to meet local needs and incorporate a wider range of coastal and marine habitats. Habitat classification frameworks are typically designed to organize geospatial data in a nested hierarchy. Nested hierarchical classification divides major groups or classes into subordinate groups or classes and allows the necessary flexibility required for decision making and/or use of available data. However, existing classification schemes were developed with different goals, data organization structure and intended application. The differences in schemes result in particular frameworks suitable for defining broad scale (>km) systems or zones, such as estuary or deepwater basin, compared to other approaches more effective at delineating and describing specific fine-scale (cm to mm) habitat attributes (e.g., eelgrass bed and shellfish reef). The Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) initiated this study to better understand published approaches to classify coastal and ocean habitats to facilitate mapping the state-wide distribution of habitats. CZM, in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey (USGS), initiated a seafloor mapping program in 2003 to produce high-resolution maps and geospatial data of seafloor topography and surficial sediments. These maps provide the foundation for a better understanding of oceanic benthic habitats. This study is the beginning of a process to identify appropriate habitat classification approaches for Massachusetts and evaluate the feasibility of applying the habitat classification approaches to the coastal and marine environments in Massachusetts. An important resource for this study was the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS; Madden et al. 2005), since CMECS included reviews and summaries of many habitat classification studies. CMECS was recently developed by NatureServe, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and other partners to provide a national framework to classify estuarine, coastal and ocean environments of North America. CMECS and additional studies were reviewed during this study to identify and describe habitat classification schemes most pertinent for coastal and marine environments in Massachusetts.

This report summarizes the goal, geographic focus, hierarchical or classification organization, classification coding system and data sources and scale for the four classification studies. The advantages and disadvantages of each classification were also evaluated in relation to determining the most suitable framework or combination of frameworks for classifying coastal and marine habitats in Massachusetts. In addition to summarizing the four recommended classification frameworks, this study outlines the role of habitat classification in resource management, considerations for application to GIS (geographic information systems) and other related habitat classification activities in the region. Staff at the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF), USGS, National Estuary Programs, US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System not only informed this project, but could also be considered as future sources of technical advice. It is important to identify potential collaborations and overlapping efforts of these organizations and agencies. The study also raises questions and recommends steps to consider before choosing a classification scheme, determining a pilot area to test classification schemes and after evaluating classification schemes. The application and examination of the four recommended schemes in the coastal and marine environments of Massachusetts is a particularly important step. The results of the pilot study will guide the process to ultimately identify an appropriate framework or hybrid of frameworks to create a singular and flexible classification system to classify coastal and marine habitats in Massachusetts."}, {"section_title": "OBJECTIVES", "text": "The goals of this feasibility study are to (1) identify and describe habitat classification schemes most pertinent for coastal, estuarine and marine environments in Massachusetts and (2) assess benefits, limitations, similarities and differences of select classification schemes recommended for consideration in Massachusetts.

This report will also help inform the ocean management planning efforts in Massachusetts by identifying recommendations and next steps to ultimately produce a single classification framework for Massachusetts.

The types and functions of habitats are largely influenced by the position of Massachusetts at the intersection of northern waters of the Gulf of Maine and southern waters of the mid-Atlantic Bight. Managing coastal and marine resources requires a common understanding of the types of habitats within Massachusetts and a comprehension of terminology used to study and describe habitats. Habitat classification is a forthcoming and evolving tool to standardize technical jargon and organize habitat information to facilitate habitat management."}, {"section_title": "Estuarine and Marine Habitats in Massachusetts", "text": "Two biogeographic regions encompass Massachusetts, with Cape Cod marking the boundary between the Acadian and Virginian provinces ( Figure 1). The provinces are distinguished by substantial differences in physical characteristics, weather patterns and biological communities. This variation exerts a strong influence on habitat abundance and function. Managing, mapping and classifying resources and habitats across biogeographic zones requires recognition of the variability in ecological features and human influences of each region. During the last major glacial period in New England, 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, glaciers advanced to Cape Cod. Glaciers scoured landforms and deposited sediments, leaving markedly distinct environments in northern and southern Massachusetts. The coastline in northern Massachusetts is recognized for rocky shores, while southern Massachusetts is dominated by sandy beaches. These coastal features, with a mosaic of other bottom types such as mud, are largely mirrored in the underwater environment. While the ocean environment in northern and southern Massachusetts share many characteristics and habitats, the differences in geologic framework and species assemblages influence the type and function of marine habitat supported in each region. Tyrrell (2005) and Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (2004)(2005) provide a summary of physical and biogenic habitats and ecological relationships found in Massachusetts. "}, {"section_title": "Habitat Management", "text": "Coastal and fishery resource managers are frequently tasked with making decisions about uses of the coastal zone and ocean environment without sufficient knowledge of the habitat types that may be impacted by proposed projects. Massachusetts faces strong development pressures in the coastal zone from existing and proposed projects such as aquaculture, wind farms, pipeline and cable installations, deepwater ports, construction of docks and piers and sewage outfalls. Pollutants, such as excessive nutrients and heavy metals, also enter coastal and ocean waters from a variety of sources (e.g., atmospheric deposition, groundwater, stormwater, etc.). The combination of anthropogenic influences and natural disturbances potentially disrupt and degrade habitat functions and values (see Wilbur and Pentony 1998 for review of humaninduced impacts to marine habitat). Without comprehensive maps of the ocean environment and standardized classification of habitats, resource management is hindered and the assessment of the relative abundance of various habitat types is impossible. The advent of technology to map seafloor topography and surficial geology is, however, providing a fundamental information base for the ocean environment in Massachusetts. Acoustic -or sonar -mapping (e.g., sidescan, multibeam and seismic reflection) in combination with underwater imagery and benthic sampling provides accurate views of the seafloor landscape and supports efforts to classify benthic environments. By acquiring these types of data and being better able to identify and classify habitats in a standardized way, resource managers can enhance their ability to protect particularly sensitive or productive habitat types (Tyrrell 2004). Many steps go into mapping a habitat, including collecting and analyzing physical, chemical and biological data, applying a classification system to identify and classify habitat types and analyzing data to depict habitat boundaries. Terminology to describe habitat management activities is often confusing. The following key terms are defined to provide a basis for the remainder of this study (Valentine et al. 2005): \u2022 Habitat characterization produces narrative and illustrative descriptions of habitats based on geological, biological, chemical and oceanographic observations and sampling. \u2022 Habitat classification is the process of identifying habitat types based on a set of standard terms."}, {"section_title": "\u2022", "text": "Habitat mapping is the spatial representation of described and classified habitat units. Many different data types are used to characterize, classify and map ocean habitats. Data applied to habitat studies range from previously published seafloor geologic, biologic and bathymetric maps to newly collected remote sensing images (e.g., multibeam bathymetry, sidescan sonar and LIDAR -Light Detection And Ranging) and in situ observation such as video, still photographs, benthic grabs and trawls (Greene et al. 2005). Figure 2 shows imagery and a map illustrating habitat classes in southeast Alaska (Greene et al. In Press). In general, there are various approaches to study the seafloor, ranging from broad geologic framework research to species behavior and habitat requirements observations. The result of the variety of seafloor-related studies is a more comprehensive understanding of the types, distribution, abundance and ecological function of habitats in the estuarine and ocean environment. Furthermore, increasing the scientific knowledge of the marine environment guides the development of appropriate habitat classification frameworks. According to the \"Strategic Plan for Mapping Massachusetts' Benthic Marine Habitats,\" the first phase for a mapping program in Massachusetts should involve high-resolution acoustic or spectral sensor mapping of surficial geology (Tyrrell 2004). The second phase should integrate biological data gathered by groundtruth sampling or other biological sampling (e.g., stock assessment and benthic community monitoring) into the geological maps or targeted studies to produce seafloor habitat maps. However, \"one of the biggest obstacles to conducting large-scale benthic habitat mapping may be the lack of a commonly accepted marine habitat classification system\" (Tyrrell 2004). Therefore, closely coupled with the second phase is the need to identify and choose a habitat classification scheme so that mapping efforts begin using standardized terminology and methods to classify habitat types.

(1999;In Press). Images reproduced from Greene et al.

For example, seafloor topography and surficial sediments are fundamental to appropriately classify a seafloor habitat in all classification schemes. The number of habitats that will be recognized and classified in a region depends on the physical and biological heterogeneity of the seabed, data availability and scale (Valentine et al. 2005). An effective classification scheme is helpful to resource managers and scientists because it standardizes terminology, organizes data in a logical manner, allows habitat types to be coded for data management and facilitates communication among users. For example, a national agency seeking to identify and catalog all large estuaries in North America can restrict their analysis to the upper, coarse-scale levels of a classification hierarchy, while a local agency working within an estuary will use the lower, more detailed levels of a classification scheme. Using classification codes as a common standard, both agencies will be able to organize and compare results using a unified vocabulary within a common data framework. The differences in classification schemes reflect how designers choose to organize, understand and rank the structures and functions of natural systems (Valentine et al. 2005). The most effective classification schemes are organized in a nested hierarchy, which allows data to be organized at the level of detail desired by the user and aids data analysis and mapping. A nested hierarchy is structured in such a way that the top level class is subdivided into second level classes and each second level class into third level classes and so on (Kurtz et al. 2006;Figure 3). Each lower level describes the habitat at a higher degree of detail and spatial precision. When classifying habitat types, the level of classification achieved depends on the scale of data gathered for a particular area. For example, a map showing classified data developed from remotely sensed images without ground validation will often only be valid for less-detailed, higher (broad) classification levels. This highlights the need for groundtruthing remote sensing data and gathering more detailed information (e.g., grain size and composition, biota and water column properties) to classify habitat to the lowest and most-detailed levels in a classification hierarchy (Madden et al. 2004b). Thus, a habitat can be mapped as narrowly or as broadly as the data and purpose permit, and this flexibility of scale influences the development of habitat classification schemes (Valentine et al. 2005). Classified habitats require consistent names and coding systems to organize data to facilitate communication among the management, science and stakeholder communities. The coding or naming conventions typically include numeric or letter sequences (or both). Although habitat name codes can be cumbersome and require effort to decipher, they are necessary shorthand for communication in situations where long text descriptions are inappropriate and where the information needs to be incorporated into a database Valentine et al. 2005). In geographic information system (GIS) and spreadsheet formats, a coding system also facilitates data organization and queries ). Of particular interest in Massachusetts is classifying benthic habitat. A standard approach to classifying marine benthic habitats is not established and endorsed by the scientific and management communities, even though several schemes exist or are evolving (e.g., Valentine et. al. 2005 and Greene et al. In Press). The lack of a generally accepted habitat classification scheme, encompassing benthic, water column and coastal environments, leads resource managers to either modify existing approaches for their study site or develop new schemes."}, {"section_title": "ROLE OF HABITAT CLASSIFICATION IN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT", "text": "Habitat management is emerging as an important consideration for regulating coastal and fisheries resources. While aspects of habitat management, such as wetlands protection and restoration, are well-founded in resource management, the improved understanding of the ocean environment coupled with continued anthropogenic impacts highlights the need for a comprehensive strategy to manage coastal and ocean resources. New approaches to manage ocean resources (e.g., ecosystem-based management) require a solid information base, which includes identification and delineation of estuarine and marine habitat. Maps showing habitat characteristics, such as seafloor topography and surficial sediments, are expected to improve the efficiency of managing the ocean environment throughout Massachusetts (Tierney et al. 2004). Examples of processes that will improve as a result of habitat mapping include: resource managers referencing the maps when siting projects (e.g., docks and piers, mooring fields, dredged material disposal, cable and pipeline routes, aquaculture sites, no wake zones and other activities); scientists identifying monitoring locations based on specific habitat features; and GIS analysts quantifying the amount of different habitat types protected by various management options (Tyrrell 2004). In addition, habitat maps and classifications are important to the identification of essential fish habitat (EFH) and the facilitation of habitat-based fishery management. For example, a classification code created in the contiguous western U.S. for NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service was adopted and modified to produce EFH maps (Greene et al. In Press). Overall, coastal and fishery managers can benefit from adopting a classification scheme because it will: (1) provide a mechanism for identifying and mapping habitats in the ocean with standardized descriptions; (2) facilitate communication among scientists, managers and stakeholders; (3) help habitat mapping efforts by combining spatial information with a standardized coding system in GIS; and (4) better organize and communicate habitat information to help address a variety of management issues."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Zone Management Considerations", "text": "Since every classification approach is a tool to accomplish a given set of objectives , CZM needs to identify objectives for classifying habitats. The following questions are important to consider while studying classification approaches: \u2022 What are the specific management questions CZM hopes to address with a classification approach? Will a classification scheme be used to facilitate project review, organize habitat map products, help monitor habitat change through time, design restoration strategies and/or plan areas for zoning and conservation designation? The answer is most likely yes to all of these questions. Management needs should be clearly articulated to help define the type and level of classification required to achieve management objectives. Furthermore, identifying management objectives will assist in determining the resolution of data required to support a particular scheme and management strategy. Data requirements to support classification efforts intended to address management issues need a-priori decision-making. For example, preliminary planning efforts to site a submerged pipeline may use coarse resolution surveys (remote sensing technologies) to understand general sedimentary characteristics and distribution of seagrass, while finescale resolution of biological and physical characteristics are needed to assess potential environmental impacts and determine a final pipeline route. CZM would benefit from a scheme (or combination of schemes) that includes both detailed and broad habitat features. Nested hierarchal structures, beginning at the landscape level and succeeding into ecosystem function and habitats, lend utility to different needs of scale, data availability and management issues. Identifying key management questions will help ensure that the development and selection of a classification scheme will appropriately support management issues. \u2022 Does CZM want to adopt a system that has local, regional and/or national relevance? Madden et al. (2005) was developed at the national level and is in the process of being sanctioned by NOAA as a national approach. Future funding and resources may become available from national funding sources for projects using this scheme. In addition, the value of using a classification system may be enhanced if the scheme were congruent with a nationally accepted marine and estuarine habitat classification approach so that eventually a regional synthesis can be made between states and perhaps even Canadian provinces. It may be useful to link habitat classification and mapping efforts in Massachusetts to the wider region so that environmental problems at local scales can benefit from the ability to link to regional scale data. Classification schemes with a particular geographic focus, such as northeastern North America (Valentine et al. 2005) or zone (e.g., deep-sea; Greene et al. 1999), are seemingly effective in classify habitats in the intended focus areas. These types of studies are adaptable (see Greene et al. In Press) to other geographic areas and habitats and may provide a more-effective means of describing fine-scale elements of habitat. \u2022 Does CZM want to include nearshore and even terrestrial habitats in coastal watersheds (coastal wetlands, tidal rivers, etc) in a classification approach? Several schemes solely focus on the offshore, ocean environment, such as the Greene et al. (1999 and In Press), Brown (2002) and Valentine et al. (2005). For example, Brown (2002) includes a supratidal zone, but falls short of capturing the upland habitats or even habitats on the coastal plain influenced by the spray zone. Both Valentine et al. (2005) and Greene et al. (1999 and In Press) focus on seafloor habitats and do not detail the nearshore component. The National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS; ) and CMECS (Madden et al. 2005) approaches incorporate nearshore and upland habitat components within their classifications. However, the NERRS approach may not include the level of detail CZM needs for offshore areas that Valentine et al. (2005) and Greene et al. (In Press) achieve. If classification of wetland, estuarine and intertidal resources is desired, then a combination of the deepwater approaches with nearshore and upland approaches may be appropriate. Or otherwise, Madden et al. (2005), which includes a general overview of upland to offshore habitats, may be sufficient. These types of decisions cannot be made until CZM defines the spatial area where the classification scheme will be applied (and this may be related to management questions). These management questions are critical to answer before choosing a habitat classification scheme. This report better equips CZM to choose among classification approaches and will ultimately help future mapping and habitat-based management projects."}, {"section_title": "Geographic Information System Considerations", "text": "Classification studies typically use unique numerical and/or letter codes to organize data and classify habitats, which facilitate the use of a geographic information system (GIS). GIS also provides a consistent organizational tool for managing, analyzing and monitoring habitat mapping and classification products. For example, GIS is the primary tool used by the scientific community for the compilation, analysis and display of seafloor data and the creation of seafloor habitat maps (Greene et al. In Press). GIS eases the incorporation of maps and geospatial data from a variety of sources into a database and facilitates the use of historical and contemporary data sources in unison. GIS is also effective for updating maps and can be used to quantify and track changes in habitat types. However, without standard definitions for classifying and quantifying habitats, informative comparisons between areas cannot be easily made . Marine benthic habitat maps created with a GIS, for example, must be properly attributed (Greene et al. 2005) to accurately analyze and describe spatial and trends in seafloor conditions. Although GIS has increased the availability, and in certain circumstances the quality and quantity, of data, users are often unaware of data limitations. Data collection and interpretation protocols must be thoroughly described within robust metadata to facilitate appropriate use of data. Seafloor mapping technology is still in relatively early stages of development, so protocols must be established to clearly identify data type, quality and interpretive processes (Greene et al. 2005). Greene et al. (2005) describes how habitat classification map products have occasionally been misinterpreted and incorrectly used because the process and quality of the source data was not fully understood. See Greene et al. (2005) for a more thorough explanation of the advantages and disadvantages encountered and possible solutions in using GIS for mapping and classifying marine benthic habitats. GIS is a valuable tool in science, data management and resource management. A habitat classification scheme will ultimately result in the creation of spatial data. GIS is an effective means to analyze and display spatial data and facilitates effective use of data by multiple users. Metadata is critical to facilitate appropriate application of GIS data to management strategies. GIS will be used to facilitate the identification of an appropriate method to classify habitats."}, {"section_title": "HABITAT CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES -REVIEWED BUT NOT RECOMMENDED", "text": "Many classification schemes have a particular geographic focus, may not include habitat types common in Massachusetts or may be outdated.

This scheme was designed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in the late 1970s with the goal of inventorying wetland and deepwater habitats at a national scale. It became a very successful tool and provided the basis for many subsequent studies (e.g., Dethier 1992;Greene et al. 1999;Allee et al. 2000;and Greene et al. In Press). Each of these later classifications modified the original approach to address shortcomings in marine and estuarine descriptions, deepwater habitats, high-energy environments and upland and cultural habitats. Although inclusive of deepwater habitats, the Cowardin et al. (1979) system is mostly derived from a wetland-centric perspective and heavily emphasizes wetland habitat types, particularly coastal marshes. While the concept of a universally applicable coastal habitat classification could be construed as being initially tested and validated by the Cowardin system, CZM should focus on later-derived schemes to address its shortcomings (e.g., lack of detail for subtidal environments)."}, {"section_title": "Dethier (1992)", "text": "\"The Marine and Estuarine Habitat Classification System for Washington State\" is based on Cowardin et al.

The energy element incorporates concepts such as exposed, moderately exposed and sheltered designations for rocky substrates. This modification is an example of adapting a regional approach to reflect local features. Another example of modifying an existing scheme was the narrowing of the Dethier (1992) classification focus to marine and estuarine systems, eliminating rivers and lakes.

In addition, NERRS reviewers characterized the scheme at its lowest levels of habitat descriptions to be \"open-ended\" with choices being subjective and dependent on user knowledge and discretion rather that having standardized categories, which made it harder to compare across sites. In addition, marine and estuarine categories are classified together, which resulted in NERRS sites with the same classification for freshwater and brackish habitats, despite having completely different species composition due to the salinity gradient.

While the BIOMAR system has several useful components that CZM may want to consider (e.g., webbased), it only covers marine habitats from high tide seaward (excluding salt marshes) and does not extend to the deep ocean beyond 80m. Connor et al. (2004) focused on marine areas closely associated with the coastline, with little attention to estuarine systems and their connection to upstream watersheds. Important components of the BIOMAR scheme are incorporated in the CMECS classification (i.e., Madden et al. 2005). It is worth noting that the BIOMAR system is designed to be easy to use and is largely webbased (http://www.jncc.gov.uk/MarineHabitatClassification). Five levels of classification are identified on the website including: Level 1 -Marine Environment; Level 2 -Broad Habitats; Level 3 -Main Habitats; Level 4 -Biotope Complexes; Level 5 -Biotopes. The website contains a full listing of habitat types within these levels, a detailed description of each type, distribution maps and color photographs along with a glossary of terms. The web-based approach should be considered as a model for future data presentation. \u2022 The EUNIS (European Union Nature Information System) classification incorporates major themes of BIOMAR. EUNIS is a broader study that was developed for aquatic and terrestrial habitats for most of Europe. In addition to having a terrestrial focus, the EUNIS classification is also different from the BIOMAR because it includes deeper water column habitats. It also has a web application http://eunis.eea.europa.eu/index.jsp, which contains the full classification hierarchy with keys for identification of all habitat types along with a glossary of terms and background information on the classification's rationale. While the online EUNIS classification leads users through a useful series of logical questions to help identify classification levels (i.e., permanently water-covered? shelf? substrate type? characterized by macroalgae?), the marine and coastal component is only a small focus of the overall classification scheme that has eight other main levels devoted to terrestrial habitats. In addition, the habitat types represented range from Northeast Atlantic (England and Ireland) to the Mediterranean and Black Sea marine habitats (Davies et al. 2004).

This area encompasses estuaries, wetlands, rivers, shorelines, islands, intertidal and benthic zones and the entire water column from the shore to the deep ocean at scales of <1m to >10 6 m (Madden et al. 2005).\nBoundaries of NERRS typically include coastal watersheds and estuaries without an offshore, ocean environment component. This classification scheme was designed to facilitate objectives related to geospatial inventory and land cover change analyses of coastal uplands, wetlands and nearshore habitats.\nThe focus is on marine sublittoral environments, with particular focus on the seafloor, in the northwest Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Maine to the continental shelf off New Jersey. The classification includes subtidal areas of the continental shelf basins of the Gulf of Maine that reach depths of approximately 400m and submarine canyon heads that incise the continental shelf in depths of up to 800m (Valentine et al. 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Hierarchical Organization", "text": "The CMECS is organized into a nested hierarchy with the following six levels (Madden et al. 2005): \u2022 Regime (Level 1) -is differentiated by a combination of salinity, geomorphology and depth organized in five categories: estuarine, fresh water-influenced marine, nearshore marine, neritic and oceanic (10km 2 to > 1000km 2 ). \u2022 Formation (Level 2) -is relatively large physical structures formed by water (currents) or substrate (islands) (10,000m 2 to 100km 2 ). \u2022 Zone (Level 3) -distinguishes between water column, littoral or sea bottom (100m 2 to 10,000km 2 ). \u2022 Macrohabitat (Level 4) -is large physically complex structures that typically contain several habitats, such as a rocky shore (100m 2 to 1,000m 2 ). \u2022 Habitat (Level 5) -is a specific combination of physical (i.e., grain size) and energy characteristics that create a suitable place for colonization or use by biota (1 m 2 to 100m 2 ). \u2022 Biotope (Level 6) -is identified by characteristic biology associated with a specific habitat (1 m 2 to 100m 2 ). A key feature of the CMECS is the capacity to handle water column data in three dimensions with the use of the category Zone (water column, littoral, bottom). While users may see this complexity as a drawback if a simpler approach for mapping purposes is desired , others see this classification level as a decision point on the focus area (i.e., water column, littoral, bottom) before continuing to lower levels of the hierarchy (Wright personal communication 2006).\nThe NERRS scheme is organized in a five-level, nested hierarchy. The following hierarchy begins with a broad level and progresses to finer classes, designed to guide the user through progressively more detailed attributes: \u2022 System (Level 1) -is based on predominant water source (e.g., marine, estuarine). Modifiers -are used to describe habitats with additional natural features (e.g., salinity regime) and anthropogenic influences such as diked or excavated. Although recommended scale/units were not provided for each of the top four classification levels, Walker et al. (2005) suggests a mapping scale between 1:24,000 and 1:3,000 if the source data are based on aerial photography and using on-screen digitizing techniques, a consistent on-screen viewing scale (e.g., 1:3,000 to 1:5,000) and minimum mapping unit (e.g., 0.25 acre) are needed to ensure integrity. Descriptor and Modifiers are not within the hierarchical structure and are meant to be added as fields (columns) in the GIS attribute table. Descriptors and Modifiers are used to further describe habitats with qualitative information. For example, Modifiers describe habitat polygons like \"sandy ocean bottom\" with information such as circulation and tidal regime, water chemistry (salinity), anthropogenic pressures affecting habitats or percent cover of invasive species. Descriptors are common names and definitions chosen to standardize a particular habitat type such as \"New England Saltmarsh.\" These common names are important in helping local managers use the same terminology for a habitat type ). More background on descriptors, modifiers and how the Cowardin system was adapted to meet the needs of the NERRS is described in .\nPhysiography, depth, seafloor induration (hardness of substrate), geomorphology, texture and biology are used to classify seafloor habitats (Greene et al. In Press). Seafloor mapping datasets (e.g., multibeam bathymetry, backscatter intensity and groundtruth imagery) and analogous optical data, such as LIDAR, provide the foundation for applying this scheme. The hierarchy is largely based on spatial scale -in terms of mapping scale. Examples of the large geologic features mapped at small-scale (e.g., 1:1,000,000) are the continental shelf, abyssal plain and submarine canyons. Small characteristics such as biogenic structure (fauna forming observable features on the seafloor) and grain size require large-scale of 1:50,000 or less. The following classes progress from small-scale features to the larger-scale attributes (Greene et al. 1999): \u2022 Megahabitat -is a large feature (>kilometer) defined at a small scale (e.g., 1:1,000,000), such as abyssal plain."}, {"section_title": "Classification Coding System", "text": "Madden et al. (2005) developed a coding system based on a sequence of numbers and letters. Regime is represented by a capitol letter (X); Formation follows to two decimal points (X.00); Zone is represented by bottom (B), littoral (L) or water column (W) -X.00.B/L/W; Macrohabitat is distinguished by a lower case letter (X.00.B/L/Z.x); and Habitat is a series of numbers to two decimal points (X.00.B/L/Z.x.00). It is uncertain how Biotope is coded in this classification system. This classification scheme is evolving, and the coding system may change (Allee personal communication Estuarine embayment subtidal vegetated mud and mixed-fine sediments Habitat See also http://www.natureserve.org/getData/CMECS/app/classification/tree/pivot/browse and http://www.natureserve.org/getData/CMECS/ for more examples.\nKutcher et al. (2005) use a numeric code that follows Anderson et al. (1976) and Cowardin et al. (1979), with the addition of Level 5 (Descriptors) and the option for a narrative description of detailed features (Modifiers). The coding system is arranged by eight Systems (1,000-8,000), followed by progressively more detailed classes (Sub-System, Class and Sub-Class). Descriptors (Level 5) are added to Sub-Class and represented by two decimal places  \nThe attribute code associated with this scheme is adapted from Greene et al. (1999) and consists of seven primary letter and number characters (Greene et al. In Press). Codes represent (1) physiography and depth (i.e., Megahabitat -one of nine) -capital letter; (2) substrate induration -lower case letter; (3) geomorphology (i.e., Meso-and Macrohabitat)lower case letter; (4) modifiers for texture, lithology, bedform and biology -subscript letter preceded by an underline; (5) seafloor slope or inclination -represented by five slope categories (numbers 1 to 5), (6) seafloor complexity (e.g., rugosity, vertical relief) -represented by capital A to E as measure of rugosity, and (7) geologic units represented by standard geologic symbols (Greene et al. In Press). Codes for classes one to five are typically derived from high-resolution seafloor mapping data. Characters 5-7 are optional and included only when slope and complexity can be calculated and when the geology is known. \nValentine et al. 2005developed descriptive habitat codes (and names) that incorporate information on seabed substrate type, seabed substrate dynamics and the degree of physical and biological complexity on the seabed. The least descriptive habitat name is based on seabed substrate type only (e.g., mud; M). The most descriptive habitat name has a seabed dynamics term, substrate type term and structural complexity term (e.g., Immobile -I; mud -M; physical structural complexity low -ps5-10L; biological structural complexity very, very low -bs<1VVL; I_M_ps5-10L_bs<1VVL). The following are examples from Valentine et al. (2005) of the application of this coding convention: Example 1: Habitat code based on seabed type: Mud (M) Habitat code based on dynamic seabed type: Immobile; mud (I_M) Habitat code based on dynamic seabed type with physical structure (ps) and biological structure (bs): Immobile; mud; physical structural complexity low; biological structural complexity very, very low (I_M_ps5-10L_bs<1VVL) Explanation: Habitat name is based on seabed dynamics, seabed substrate type, and physical and biological structural complexity. The code is created as follows: Immobile (I); mud (M); physical structures cover 5-10% of the seabed (ps5-10), physical complexity is low (L); biological structures cover less than 1% of the seabed (bs<1), and biological complexity is very very low (VVL) Example 2: Habitat code based on seabed type: Sandy gravel (sG) Habitat code based on dynamic seabed type: Intermixed mobile/immobile; sandy gravel (IMI_sG) Habitat code based on dynamic seabed type with physical structure (ps) and biological structure (bs): Intermixed mobile/immobile; sandy gravel; physical structural complexity very high; biological structural complexity low (IMI_sG_ps>90VH_bs5-10L) Explanation: Habitat name is based on seabed dynamics, on seabed substrate type, and on physical and biological structural complexity. Intermixed mobile/immobile (IMI); sandy gravel (sG); physical structures cover more than 90% of the seabed (ps>90), physical structure complexity is very high (VH); biological structures cover 5-10% of the seabed (bs5-10), and biological structural complexity is low (L). Valentine et al. (2005) describes the coding and naming process in more detail."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Scale", "text": "The CMECS sets uniform classification rules that function at multiple scales across a diversity of environments. The hierarchy is conceptually divided into two parts based on data required for applying the classification. The upper levels (Regime through Zone) can be identified from maps, bathymetry, remote imagery and historical data. Lower levels (Macrohabitat through Biotope) are distinguished at local spatial scales and data are collected through direct observation and measurement. The lower, more-detailed four levels require the most work and are valuable for applying the classification for purposes of habitat conservation and management (Madden et al. 2004a). Data availability will -in most cases -prevent classification to the full (most-detailed) extent. Allee (personal communication), a primary contributor to CMECS, indicated that the Macrohabitat or Habitat levels are the most realistic levels to classify habitats because of data availability (not enough information exists to get at many Habitat or Biotope levels for regional assessments). The CMECS was, however, designed to partially identify classes at lower levels even if comprehensive data are not available. In other words, a user can skip levels where data are lacking, and as additional data in the area are gathered, the entire hierarchy will continue to grow and strengthen the understanding of the whole system (Madden et al. 2004a).\nThe NERRS classification scheme requires data to be collected at two geographic scales: 1) broad-scale, low resolution data for characterizing entire watersheds; and 2) detailed, fine-scale, high resolution data for characterizing specific properties (Walker et al. 2005). Watershed-level data are used to measure habitat and land-use change in the area of interest, assess the sensitivity of habitats to changes in adjacent uplands and analyze the relationship between land use and water quality over time. Broad-scale data are primarily derived from 30m Landsat TM imagery and classification is automated. Reserve-level, finer scale data identify species-habitat associations and landscape ecology features and are mostly interpreted from high resolution imagery (e.g., aerial photography) or field observations. The NERRS classification scheme provides the foundation to create a comprehensive GIS. The GIS data are capable of characterizing, organizing and displaying strictly defined land cover units (and associated attributes) that allow direct spatial analysis of all habitat and land-cover types. Each level or class represents a single column in an attribute data set, and each polygon is a single row in a GIS database. Point data (e.g., grab samples) can be assigned as Modifiers or Descriptors and organized in data columns, further characterizing each polygon with more information. Modifier or Descriptor data can also be organized as discrete GIS layers (Kutcher personal communication).\nThis scheme was developed to use acoustic (e.g., multibeam bathymetry and sidescan sonar) and/or optical (e.g., LIDAR and hyperspectral) mapping data to classify the seafloor environment. The classification approach pays particular attention to scale and emphasizes the need to groundtruth interpretations made from remotely sensed data (Greene et al. In Press). Greene et al. (1999;In Press) refer to scale in terms of mapping scale. Small-scale refers to mapping large or coarse-resolution features (e.g., continental shelf) and large-scale indicates smaller or fine resolution attributes, such as grain size, species assemblages and habitat associations. Megahabitat can often be delineated from existing, coarse-scale data (1:1,000,000 or greater), such as maps and satellite images. Classifying Mesohabitat (1:250,000 or less) and Macrohabitat (1:50,000 or less) require high frequency (e.g., 200 kHz) seafloor mapping systems. Imaging and classification of Microhabitat is best accomplished from in-situ observations, such as benthic grabs or underwater video (Greene et al. 2005). Classifying Microhabitats is generally more difficult and time consuming compared to the other habitat classes. While this approach is tested in relatively deeper waters using seafloor mapping data, bathymetric LIDAR, hyperspectral systems and other technologies (e.g., digital photography) are being used in shallow-water environments and provide data to apply Green et al. (1999;In Press).\nValentine et al. 2005is based on seafloor observations using multibeam and sidescan sonar, video and photographic transects and sediment and biological sampling (i.e., benthic grabs). Geophysical surveys, such as multibeam and sidescan sonar, depict broad geological environments and provide a framework for identifying and classifying habitats. Although modern seafloor imagery is a solid foundation for the study of habitats, classification often requires additional biological information such as underwater imagery and benthic sampling. Themes, Classes and Subclasses can generally be interpreted from seafloor mapping data. Identifying Categories and Attributes require underwater observations (e.g., video transects and/or benthic grabs). Since it is not always feasible to quantify the abundance of individual structures and organisms, this scheme allows for the inclusion of visual semi-quantitative estimates of habitat characteristics (Valentine et al. 2005). Data and imagery availability dictate mapping scale of classified habitat. Observations needed to classify habitats at the higher levels (i.e., Theme and Class) range from tens of meters to >1 km and can be defined using maps and seafloor images at a scale of 1:250,000-1:1,000,000. Lower classification levels require maps in the range of 1:25,000-1:100,000 (Valentine et al. 2005). While the level of mapping and classification depends in a large part on the data and imagery available, the Valentine et al. (2005) approach is flexible, allowing classification of large geologic features and fine-resolution attributes such as grain size (mmcm)."}, {"section_title": "Comments and Updates", "text": "The CMECS is a collaborative and ongoing process, with NOAA, USFWS, Census of Marine Life, The Nature Conservancy, several universities and NatureServe contributing to the development of the classification framework. Development of the scheme included a national workshop in 2003, numerous interviews with scientists and managers that map and study habitat and pilot testing (Madden et al. 2005). The most recent 2005 version is now available through the NatureServe website www.natureserve.org/getData/CMECS. This product is a revision of Madden et al. (2004a). NOAA's Coastal Service Center and partners are updating CMECS and actively advocating its use as a national standard. Numerous habitats are included in the CMECS, encompassing intertidal environments through oceanic areas. The online catalog, however, does not include a comprehensive list of all coastal and marine types. CMECS is not well developed for certain areas (e.g., nearshore nonestuarine benthic habitats). The upper three levels (Regime, System, and Zone) are fairly complete, while lower three levels are less complete. CZM should review the CMECS to make sure the scheme includes habitats in Massachusetts. An important stage in the development of the CMECS was piloting the classification. Pilot projects were undertaken in Florida, the south Atlantic Bight and the Columbia River to help make the classification more robust and populated with information from different ecological systems. The purpose of the Florida Keys project was to map shallow water seagrass and coral reef habitat; the purpose of the south Atlantic Bight project was to locate and map marine hardbottom habitat; a large-scale test of the classification in the Columbia River estuary was to examine suitability for mapping salmon habitat (Madden et al. 2004b). The pilot studies included examining data sources, scale, procedure, analysis and lessons learned along with tables and figures. The Columbia River study particularly provided insight to the strengths and challenges of CMECS as a national marine data structure. This 24 month pilot project implemented the scheme from Level 1 (Regime) through Level 3 (Zone) with limited use information at Level 4 (Macrohabitat). A manuscript is in development that outlines challenges, benefits and considerations of CMECS (Wright In Press). Nan Wright is the author of this study and expressed interest in providing training on the use of CMECS for those interested in applying it to their local waters. CZM should consider this opportunity since she has experience from piloting the CMECS. NatureServe is the primary developer of CMECS, with Chris Madden as principal investigator and major guidance and funding from NOAA. CMECS continues to evolve and NOAA's CSC is interested in testing CMECS in Massachusetts (Allee personal communication). NOAA intends to go on the road with the latest scheme for introduction to coastal managers and explain how it was developed and how it can be used (Wright personal communication). This local training could be an opportunity for CZM to gain an understanding of CMECS and applications in Massachusetts. As CZM proceeds with examining, developing and adopting a habitat classification framework for Massachusetts, NOAA's CSC should be actively engaged to ensure mutual objectives of CZM and CSC can be achieved while maintaining local research and management initiatives.\nA modified version of the NERRS classification scheme was recently approved, and a Habitat Mapping and Change Technical Advisory Panel is determining how best to implement the approach (Kutcher personal communication). The NERRS classification approach will continue to adapt and improve. The original CMECS scheme (derived from Allee et al. 2000) was piloted by several NERRS in 2000 and 2006. The major issue with the CMECS approach was that coastal uplands were not incorporated, which are crucial for analyzing processes that NERRS scientists wanted to consider (Kutcher personal communication).  was developed with particular focus on estuarine and upland habitats and does not cover deeper subtidal benthic areas. The NERRS scheme contains codes for offshore areas and altered habitats but are largely untested, as most reserves do not contain deepwater (Kutcher personal communication). The use of descriptors and modifiers are not clear and should be explained in more detail, if CZM decides to use . Emergent (and most submerged) habitats were recently mapped to a species assemblage level in the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (WBNERR; Annett personal communication). This mapping is more detailed than the NERRS classification system, but the NERRS approach allows flexibility in detail. WBNERR has not yet agreed to appropriate names to classify species assemblage polygons and has not populated the database for the mapped features. CZM could coordinate with WBNERR on these tasks and gain experience with the NERRS approach ).\nAlthough this scheme was based on earlier habitat classification studies by Cowardin et al. (1979) and Dethier (1992), it represents a departure from coastal habitat and moves into the relatively deep ocean. Greene et al. (1999; In Press) focus on geologic structure of the bottom, leaving the classification of estuarine and freshwater systems to existing classifications. Classifying habitats in the offshore environment is an important aspect of habitat classification in Massachusetts. However, estuarine and coastal habitats are also important to include in a singular classification framework for Massachusetts. Greene et al. (1999;In Press) is peer reviewed and is adopted by many organizations. Pilot mapping and classification is complete in Alaska, Washington and California, and new efforts are starting in the Pacific island areas, the Baltic and elsewhere using this scheme (Greene personal communication). Thus, the approach is becoming established, is field tested and can be applied in areas with seafloor mapping data.\nValentine et al. (2005) focuses on subtidal seafloor habitats and does not does not cover nearcoastal and estuarine benthic areas. Valentine (personal communication) believes most existing classification studies are weak on using geological attributes for characterizing habitats. This assertion is founded in the geologic-centric belief that habitats are \"for the most part composites of geological and oceanographic attributes and process\" (Valentine personal communication). Biological resources are also fundamental to habitat, since the attraction to an area (area described by physical or biological features) is based on the dispersal, behavior and/or life history requirements of a species. Valentine described how much of the Massachusetts sublittoral environment can be classified to the level of Subclass vs. Category vs. Attributes using his scheme: \"The goal should be to classify habitats to the \"attribute\" level, and this can be achieved with video imagery and sampling. The question is how much sampling (groundtruthing) is required, and that depends on an analysis of the sidescan and multibeam imagery and ultimately on the complexity of the seabed. Some areas will require more sampling than others. The attribute level quantifies a characteristic of the habitat (usually the percentage of some characteristic), and this kind of data can be estimated from video imagery.\" Therefore, it seems the amount of groundtruthing (video imagery and sediment sampling) will dictate the ability of classifying habitat to the Attribute level. However, locating groundtruth samples during a seafloor mapping cruise is determined by geological features and not biological resources. Groundtruth data are not randomly collected and using groundtruth data to classify large areas of the seafloor without sufficient sampling coverage should be approached cautiously. Groundtruthing data certainly allow classification and characterization of fine-detailed seafloor habitats in areas with data, but because biological resources, such as the relative abundance of flora or fauna, are often patchy and unpredictable, sampling requires a statistically random design to describe biological patterns through space or time. Regardless of this uncertainty, groundtruthing data are often the best available data on benthic resources and should be used to classify seafloor habitat to fine-detail, as appropriate. Additional sampling of the seafloor environment may, however, be required to extrapolate between samples and classify larger areas of the seafloor. The USGS is currently classifying habitats in the Stellwagen Bank region using Valentine et al. (2005). While this classification seems more complex with multiple choices in the Classes, Subclasses and Categories, it gets to a higher level of detail for sublittoral marine environments in New England than other schemes such as the NERRS or CMECS. Recent seafloor mapping and sampling in Massachusetts is generating detailed data and therefore, the more complex Valentine et al. (2005) approach may be appropriate. Valentine et al. (2005) is best described by reviewing the information and examples presented in Appendix 1-5 (in Valentine et al. 2005). Furthermore, results from Stellwagen Bank will help determine the detail and required data to implement the scheme. CZM should communicate with Valentine to ask about lessons learned."}, {"section_title": "Kutcher et al.

(1999; In Press) studies as using habitat as a major criterion, which the Valentine et al. (2005) does not. The Valentine et al. (2005) approach is based on describing habitats in terms of geology, oceanography, biology and related processes (e.g. sediment movement; current types; flora/fauna modifications of the seabed; etc.), designed with the idea that video imagery would be the basic data source for describing the seabed and flora/fauna (Valentine personal communication). While this commentary helps elucidate differences between the two approaches, more clarity is needed to fully describe differences between the two. This clarity can be gained by either inviting both authors to a meeting at CZM (an action identified in the recommendations) to discuss and provide examples of their approach in more detail, or by CZM independently, evaluating the two schemes by choosing a pilot area and implementing these two classification approaches with existing data."}, {"section_title": "RECOMMENDATIONS", "text": "The review of existing classification studies in this report is a valuable first step in determining which approach or aspects of approaches are appropriate for classifying habitats in coastal and marine environments of Massachusetts. This report also raises questions to consider when testing or adopting classification studies and offers suggestions to consider as next steps. As with any technical project plan, certain resources must be secured before work can begin. In particular, personnel, technical knowledge and supporting infrastructure need to be appropriately allocated before applying and evaluating habitat classification frameworks. The recommendations given below are organized by the stage of the project, as follows (1) before choosing a classification scheme, (2) identifying a pilot area and (3) after evaluating classification schemes. The following recommendations are based on this study and communications with habitat classification experts and are intended to inform next steps at CZM."}, {"section_title": "Before Choosing a Classification Scheme", "text": "\u2022 CZM should assemble a technical advisory group to provide input on the choice and implementation of a classification scheme. The advisory group should be composed of scientists and managers to ensure that the approach is valid and useful in a management context. Membership in this group should include a balance of expertise with knowledge of habitat ecology, fishery resources, natural resource management, mapping technology and GIS, including staff from DMF, USGS and USEPA, among others. \u2022 CZM and potential collaborators should become familiar with the four classification schemes recommended in this study and determine which scheme or combination of schemes include habitats that are most important to classify. This step will include identifying habitat types needed in a classification framework. \u2022 The classification scheme chosen should support a variety of data sources, since geospatial habitat data take many forms such as grab samples and sonar images. \u2022 The geographic coverage of a classification framework needs to be determined to facilitate the identification of appropriate studies or combination of studies needed to achieve objectives. That is -should a classification system encompass the coastal watershed and ocean environment? For example, Greene et al. (1999;In Press) and Valentine et al. (2005) do not adequately cover nearshore or coastal habitats and would need to be combined with a classification that includes these habitats (e.g., or Madden et al. 2005, if such coverage is necessary. \u2022 Experts involved in the creation and/or implementation of the four recommended classifications should be contacted and/or gathered to ask questions, discuss applicability, solicit advice on the selection of an appropriate scheme and possibly receive training on implementing an approach. Experts include: Nan Wright (University of Idaho), Becky Allee (NOAA's CSC), Mark Finkbeiner (NOAA's CSC) and Chris Madden (NatureServe) for CMECS (Madden et al. 2005); Tom Kutcher (Narragansett Bay NERR) and Brendan Annett (Waquoit Bay NERR) for NERRS ; Gary Greene (Moss Landing Marine Laboratories) for Green et al. (1999;In Press); and Page Valentine (USGS, Woods Hole) and Kathryn Ford (DMF) for Valentine et al. (2005). This meeting should have clear objectives to facilitate the identification of next steps. NOAA's CSC is intimately involved with CMECS (Madden et al. 2005), and CSC staff could provide assistance. Specifically, CSC can offer lessons learned from the Columbia River and other pilot projects, determine scales and data needed to populate different levels of the hierarchy, demonstrate the use of benthic data in the CMECS and train CZM and other staff on the use of the CMECS."}, {"section_title": "Evaluating a Pilot Area", "text": "\u2022 CZM should consider organizing a workshop with key partners to discuss existing habitat classification schemes, apply pre-selected classification scheme(s) to a pilot area and examine advantages and disadvantages of using one scheme over another in Massachusetts waters. Goals of this meeting could be to: 1) review existing classification schemes highlighted in this paper; 2) identify which scheme (or parts that need to be combined) best meets Massachusetts needs; 3) propose additional pilot areas to implement the classification scheme and discuss data requirements. \u2022 The pilot area should have sufficient existing data to evaluate classification schemes. Data such as bathymetry and sediment characteristics are primary habitat attributes and important for determining the distribution and abundance of sessile invertebrates as well as motile species such as crustaceans and fish (Auster et al. 1998; Peter Auster, University of Connecticut, could advise classification efforts by CZM). \u2022 The evaluation of habitat classification in Massachusetts should include a data gap analysis to determine data requirements to achieve specific levels of classification within each habitat classification framework."}, {"section_title": "After Evaluating Classification Schemes", "text": "\u2022 CZM should review \"Recommended Guidelines for Adoption and Implementation of the NERRS Habitat and Land Use Classification System\" (Walker et al. 2005) to provide a brief, practical set of guidelines for successful adoption and use of the chosen classification system. For example, Walker et al. (2005) describes the following steps: (1) identify and compile existing map resources and/or habitat description materials; (2) select appropriate scale for the habitat classification pilot; (3) design and document the GIS database structure; (4) develop a flow diagram for the implementation process; (5) document key \"areas of interest\" and habitats; (6) apply classification codes accordingly; and (7) generate metadata for the classification database. \u2022 Resource management considerations should be identified (e.g., application of a classification system to address project review) and explicitly considered in choosing a classification scheme or modifying existing schemes. \u2022 Incorporating biological and ecological characteristics into detailed, finer resolution habitat classes is not a strength in any of the four recommended classification schemes. Biotic characteristics such as the presence and relative abundance of epifaunal communities and macroalgae beds are temporally variable, as well as patchily distributed. Distributions of biological features are also greatly altered by human impacts, are a substantial part of the societal and resource value of habitats and are frequently the basis of regulatory strategies. More work is required to integrate biological data into a habitat classification framework, if resource management and/or scientific efforts require detailed, finer resolution habitat classification. The EUNIS approach to classifying biotopes (biological habitat class) may provide further guidance on incorporating biological resources into a habitat classification framework and could be reexamined while developing a classification system for Massachusetts. \u2022 If a hybrid or modification of existing studies is selected, nomenclature must be exact and clearly constrain the meaning of terms. An official glossary of terms must be agreed upon and implemented by all users to maintain consistency in the database. \u2022 CZM should designate one or more technical staff members to undertake future habitat classification exercises. Staff should familiarize themselves with classification schemes, mapping techniques, habitat structure and digital data management. Personnel consistency during database development is particularly important to develop and document approaches to classify habitat. \u2022 Habitat classification scheme results should be incorporated into an existing, searchable data management system to store and disseminate data and habitat maps. CZM developed the Massachusetts Ocean Resources Information System (MORIS; a GIS database containing coastal and marine data layers), which could be used to store, view and disseminate habitat mapping products. \u2022 CZM should consider hosting a workshop to evaluate and discuss the application of the recommended habitat classification frameworks to Massachusetts. Environmental managers, researchers, policy makers and other stakeholders involved with habitat characterization, classification and mapping should be invited to the workshop to guide identifying next steps needed to create a single habitat classification framework for Massachusetts. CZM should be mindful that revisions will most likely need to be made to the chosen classification system. \u2022 Since habitat classification is an evolving research and management topic, a list of emerging pilot projects and studies should be maintained and coordination with overlapping activities and partners should be an ongoing process. USGS, DMF, US EPA, Massachusetts Bay National Estuary Program, Waquoit Bay and Narragansett Bay NERR and NOAA's CSC are potential partners that could be involved in discussions about the choice, modification and implementation of a classification scheme in Massachusetts."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "There are many benefits of incorporating a standardized habitat classification scheme into mapping and characterization projects. This report describes 12 approaches to classify habitat, with four studies (i.e., Madden et al. 2005;Greene et al. In Press;and Valentine et al. 2005) highlighted for consideration by CZM. No one, standard classification approach is currently endorsed by the scientific and management community. In order for an approach to be successful and useful on local, regional or national scales, users need to accept a disciplined, standardized terminology to classify and describe habitats at various scales. The selection of a singular and flexible habitat classification framework for coastal and marine environments requires a clear identification of objectives for using a scheme and rigorous testing of chosen classification(s) with existing data in a pilot area. None of the four recommended schemes sufficiently classify habitats ranging from coastal areas to oceanic environments. Evaluating the application of the four recommended schemes in coastal and marine environments in Massachusetts will facilitate a process to augment or hybridize existing schemes to achieve management objectives in Massachusetts. Managers will ultimately benefit from a classification scheme that provides geographic representation of habitats on a map, standardized terminology for different habitat types, guidelines for organizing data, facilitation of mapping efforts, incorporation of the classification results and associated ancillary data into a well-designed GIS and improved communication. To ensure the use of a habitat classification approach, CZM must engage potential partners, including government agencies -particularly NOAA's CSC (a major partner in CMECS), academic institutions and other stakeholders.
