The bachelor's and master's degree data were obtained from universe institution surveys of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), U.S. Department of Education. Data on doctorates are from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, a universe survey of individual doctorate recipients that is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and four other Federal agencies, and were collected by the National Research Council. Estimates of population in the various age categories are based on data that were collected and published by the Bureau of the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce. The data in this report cover earned degrees conferred in the aggregate United States, which comprises the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Territories and Outlying Areas (American Samoa, the former Canal Zone, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands). Degree data are compiled for a 12-month period, July through June of the following year. For convenience, degrees in a given July-through-June period are referred to by the year in which the period ended; e.g., 1995 means the 12-month period ending June 1995. It is difficult to establish a completely consistent series of degree data over a long period of time because of changes in definitions, instructions, and field classifications, including the introduction of new specialties. The data for earlier years are presented as consistently as possible with the classifications used in the current Classification of Instructional Programs (Washington, DC, Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office). See the Technical Notes for further information on the field classifications used. The publication focuses on degrees in science and engineering fields, and, where appropriate, the data have been reclassified according to NSF field categories. This report supersedes previous editions, not only because it includes later data, but because fields classified as science and engineering differ slightly, especially in the social sciences at the doctorate level, from those of past editions. It should be noted that data on engineering technology degrees and degrees in the health/medical sciences are not included in the science and engineering totals here. The time series for this report begins in 1966. This report is based on final data from several Federal surveys. Two of them are the U.S. Department of Education's Survey of Degrees and Other Formal Awards Conferred, and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) Completions Survey conducted annually by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), earlier conducted as Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS). A third is the Survey of Earned Doctorates, conducted annually for the National Science Foundation (NSF) and four other Federal agencies. In addition, population data on various age groups for tables 56-58 were obtained from Current Population Surveys conducted by the Census Bureau. Each source is described in more detail in the following sections. Data from the Survey of Degrees and Other Formal Awards Conferred and from the Completions Survey were used to report the number of bachelor's and master's degrees. The data on doctoral degrees in this report were derived from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, which surveyed all individuals earning research doctorates, rather than from the Completions Survey, which surveyed the institutions awarding the doctorates. The Survey of Earned Doctorate data were preferred because the data provided by individuals are more specific with respect to the field of specialization and are less prone to errors in data reporting and data entry than are the data provided in aggregates by institutions. Furthermore, doctorate data provide 100 percent coverage for data by field and sex of individual recipients, whereas institutional data are subject to imputation for nonresponse. For a comparison of reporting on doctoral degrees in the Completions Survey and the Survey of Earned Doctorates, see National Science Foundation, Science andEngineering Doctorates: 1960-91, NSF 93-301, Detailed Statistical Tables (Washington, DC, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "BACHELOR'S AND MASTER' S DEGREE DATA", "text": "In the Survey of Degrees and Other Formal Awards Conferred and in the Completions Survey, data are collected on all degrees conferred between July 1 and June 30 from the universe of accredited institutions of higher education in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Territories and Outlying Areas. The survey forms are filled out by institution administrative personnel. The data are collected according to sex of recipient and field of study. In 1995, the final universe of institutions granting bachelor's or higher level degrees was 2,793. Each year between 1966 and 1995, institutional responses to these surveys exceeded 85 percent. Imputations for nonresponse were based on the previous year's response for an institution, if available. Because the data in this report include those for institutions in the U.S. territories, they may differ from numbers published by NCES that relate only to the 50 States and the District of Columbia and their field groupings. Data on degrees by field of study were collected according to the Classification of Instructional Programs, developed by NCES. Four field classification systems were used during the 1966-95 period. (See \"Current Classification Schemes.\") DOCTORAL DEGREE DATA In the Survey of Earned Doctorates, information is collected during the period of July 1 of one year to June 30 of the next from all persons who have fulfilled the requirements for a research doctorate. The survey is funded jointly by NSF and four other agencies: the U.S. Department of Education, the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The National Research Council sent the survey forms to all accredited doctorate-granting institutions for distribution by the graduate deans to all research doctorate recipients as they complete degree requirements. Information collected in the survey comprises demographic data, such as the student's sex, citizenship, and racial/ethnic group; education history, including field of degrees; sources of graduate student support; employment status during the year preceding receipt of the doctorate; postgraduation plans; and background on parents' education. Approximately 92-95 percent of the doctorate recipients complete and return the survey forms. For nonrespondents, commencement programs constituted a source of skeletal information that was added to the file. These variables were sex, field of study, institution, year of doctorate, and educational background. Consequently, for the variables used in this report, there is complete coverage. Data are updated annually from completed survey forms submitted belatedly by previous nonrespondents; therefore, data on doctorates are subject to revision and may differ very slightly from reports published earlier.
