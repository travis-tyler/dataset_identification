Cyclone intensity at each six-hour position is used as the weight at that location. Only named cyclones in the Indian Ocean since 1981 are considered for this study. The K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster Indian Ocean cyclones based on the five parameters: x-y coordinates of the mean center, variances along zonal and meridional directions, and covariance between zonal and meridional locations of the cyclone track. Four clusters are identified across the Indian Ocean; among them, only one cluster is in the North Indian Ocean (NIO) and the rest of them are in the South Indian Ocean (SIO). Other characteristics associated with each cluster, such as wind speed, lifespan, track length, track orientation, seasonality, landfall, category during landfall, total accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), and cyclone trend, are analyzed and discussed. Cyclone frequency and energy of Cluster 4 (in the NIO) have been following a linear increasing trend. Cluster 4 also has a higher number of landfall cyclones compared to other clusters. Cluster 2, located in the middle of the SIO, is characterized by the long track, high intensity, long lifespan, and high accumulated energy. Sea surface temperature (SST) and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) associated with genesis of TCs are also examined in each cluster. Cyclone genesis is co-located with the negative OLR anomaly and the positive SST anomaly. Localized SST anomalies are associated with clusters in the SIO; however, TC geneses of Cluster 4 are associated with SSTA all over the Indian Ocean (IO)."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The tropical cyclone (TC) is one of the most destructive natural disasters, which causes great losses to lives and property each year throughout subtropical regions of the world [1] . A cyclone has multiple hazard potentialities, since many disasters, such as storm surge, coastal flooding [2] , landslide [3] , and high wind, are accompanied by tropical cyclones [4] . TCs have a significant impact on the socio-economic condition of many coastal communities [5] [6] [7] . Recent examples from the North Indian Ocean (NIO) are Cyclone Sidr, which hit Bangladesh in 2007 and accounted for the loss of 3406 lives and US$1.7 billion in property damage [8, 9] , and Cyclone Nargis, which hit Myanmar in 2008 and accounted for the loss of about 140,000 lives and US$10 billion in property damage [10, 11] . Cyclone Enawo, which struck the coast of Madagascar in March 2017, claimed about 100 lives and US$80 million in property damage [12] , and Cyclone Rusty, which hit the Australian coast in February 2013, accounted for more than US$450 million in property damage [13] , are mentionable examples from the South Indian Ocean (SIO).

This archive is maintained by National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), formerly known as the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Various global and regional meteorological centers and cyclone warning centers are involved in the monitoring and predicting of tropical cyclones over different ocean basins. These organizations determine the best track based on the post-season analysis of cyclone positions, and the data are combined to produce the IBTrACS dataset. From this global dataset, only the best track of cyclones in the IO are extracted. Mohapatra et al. [46] divided the best track data into four periods, such as pre-1877, 1877-1890, 1890-1960, and post-1960, considering the collection method and quality of data. Although track data are available beginning in the 18th century, data after 1960 are of higher quality [16, 46] . However, many researchers pointed out that incomplete records and underestimated intensity make the TC intensity data prior to the early 1980s unreliable [16, 47] . Therefore, the current study focuses on data from 1981 to 2015 considering the accuracy of the satellite era. Only named storms are considered because of their impact and severity. Named storms (NS) are the cyclones that reach maximum sustained wind speeds of at least 34 knots (18 ms \u22121 ) based on the Saffir-Simpson scale [46, 48] . Considering the spatial and temporal limitations, a total of 592 named cyclones (51 in the NIO and 541 in the SIO) are selected for this study. All TC track data are projected to the WGS 1984 World Mercator projection system. The intensity at a given location of a cyclone varies due to multiple reporting from different agencies. Thus, the current study takes the maximum intensity among reported intensities at that location.\nWeekly mean sea surface temperature (SST) and weekly SST anomaly (SSTA) were extracted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The so-called optimum interpolation SST data are available for 1981-present [49] . This SST dataset is produced weekly on a one-degree grid using in situ and satellite SSTs plus simulated SSTs from sea-ice cover. The daily mean and long-term mean (1981-2010) of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) are obtained from the NOAA interpolated OLR dataset [50] . OLR data are gridded at 2.5-degree spatial resolution, and filled with the temporal and spatial interpolations of the original data from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) archives."}, {"section_title": "Clustering Process", "text": "The track data are mainly made of the 6-h positions of the recorded cyclones. The intensity of a TC is the maximum sustained wind speed. Therefore, a set of point observations are considered as the Climate 2018, 6, 39 4 of 26 entire track of a given cyclone. The first two moments of a cyclone track are calculated based on the spatial distribution of data points and their associated sustained wind. The first mass moment is the mean center of the data points of a cyclone. The second moment is the variance and covariance which, associated with mean center, can be expressed by an ellipse. Therefore, the ellipse center is represented by the centroid location (first moment) of the track and ellipse size and orientation are expressed by the second moments (variance and covariance). The ellipse of a cyclone track describes the shape and orientation of a cyclone trajectory. The center of the ellipse is defined as:\nwhere (x wmc , y wmc ) defines the coordinates of the weighted mean centers for each track, with the (x, y) being the coordinates of track point, w, the weight, defined as the TC intensity, and k is the number of points defined by one track during the whole life of a given TC. The weight (w) is the intensity of the cyclone at a given location. Similarly, the weighted second moments (variances and covariance) can be defined as:\nThe five parameters of each track, center coordinates pair, two variances, and the covariance describe the location, size, shape, and orientation of a cyclone track. These five parameters also define the standard deviation ellipse of the track, also with five parameters describing the center, semi-major and semi-minor axes, and orientation [51] . The center of the ellipse is the center of gravity of the entire track which describes the position of the track, and the definition is the same as given above in Equation (1) .\nThe orientation angle is defined as: \nOne of the two axes' values, \u03b4 x and \u03b4 y , gives the semi-major axis value, and the other gives the semi-minor axis value. The orientation is defined by the angle rotated from the north direction to the semi-major axis direction, \u03b8, which is limited to the range of 0 to 180 degrees. In the following context, the parameters for ellipses are used for the discussion of results, although the actual clustering procedure is based on the original five parameters with variance and covariance.\nThe left panels of Figure 1 show examples of the standard deviational ellipse of three cyclone tracks. The weighted mean center is the centroid of the observations which may fall on or off the cyclone track (Figure 1a-c) . The rotation angle of the ellipse is the clockwise angular measure from the north to the long axis of the ellipse. This angular measurement is always between 0 \u2022 to 180 \u2022 because the long axis can always be found on the right side of the vertical axis. The right panels of Figure 1 illustrate the five parameters: center coordinates, two axes, and the rotation angle of the corresponding standard deviational ellipse. Many turns in the cyclone track may lead to a near-circular ellipse (Figure 1c ). These five parameters are equivalent to the mean center, variances, and covariance [52] . The detailed mathematical expressions are given in Equations (1)- (7) in the methodology section. The latter group of five track parameters are used for clustering TCs based on the K-means algorithm. Each of the clusters is then assessed based on intensity, genesis location, landfall, total cyclone accumulated energy, seasonality, and trend.\non the initial setting of the cluster number. Although it is difficult to determine the global optimal number of clusters, there are several ways to select a reasonable k-number. In this study, the number of clusters is determined by the mean silhouette values and numbers of negative silhouette values. Rousseeuw [60] stated that the silhouette is both the measurement of cohesiveness and separability of the clusters. The silhouette value for each observation is a measure of how similar these observations within the same cluster are when compared to the observations in other clusters. The silhouette of the ith observation (Si) can be defined by the normalized differences between the average distance from the ith observation to the other observations in the same cluster and the minimum average distance from the ith observation to observations in different clusters. The silhouette value for the ith point, Si, can be expressed by the following equation:\nwhere ai is the average distance from the ith observation to the other observations in the same cluster, and bi is the average distance from the ith point to points in a different cluster [60] . The minimum is taken across all other clusters. The valid silhouette values are in between \u22121 and 1. The mean silhouette value expresses the cohesiveness of the clusters, whereas the number of negative silhouettes refers to possible misclassification. Therefore, an optimum number of clusters should be chosen in such a way where the mean silhouette is high, and the number of the negative silhouettes is low. In this study, the Kmeans cluster algorithm was run multiple times for 2 to 20 clusters, and the mean silhouette value and the negative silhouette counts were calculated for each run. Figure 2 shows the plot of the mean Clustering analysis is generally an unsupervised approach to find the similarities among the data points and to group them. There are many clustering methods available, such as K-means clustering [53] , probabilistic Curve-aligned clustering and prediction with regression mixture models [54] , fuzzy clustering [55] , and so on. The K-means clustering is one of the most popular clustering techniques for its simplicity and is used for clustering cyclones in different basins [4, [56] [57] [58] . The K-means algorithm divides N points in D dimensions into k clusters, where the summation of the variance within a cluster is minimized to ensure the objects of each cluster are as close to each other as possible [59] . The feature space and the number of clusters are two important considerations in the K-mean clustering algorithm. In this analysis a five-dimensional feature space is used for the clustering with the Euclidian distance metric; since the K-means clustering algorithm uses a distance function to find the dissimilarity, one possible issue may be that the five elements have different scales in measurement and, therefore, need to be normalized so that five elements have the same weight to the clustering process. Therefore, these elements are normalized to the scale between 0 to 1 by max-min normalization ((x\u2212min)/(max\u2212min)).\nThe second important aspect is to set the number of clusters since the result completely depends on the initial setting of the cluster number. Although it is difficult to determine the global optimal number of clusters, there are several ways to select a reasonable k-number. In this study, the number of clusters is determined by the mean silhouette values and numbers of negative silhouette values. Rousseeuw [60] stated that the silhouette is both the measurement of cohesiveness and separability of the clusters. The silhouette value for each observation is a measure of how similar these observations within the same cluster are when compared to the observations in other clusters. The silhouette of the ith observation (S i ) can be defined by the normalized differences between the average distance from the ith observation to the other observations in the same cluster and the minimum average distance from the ith observation to observations in different clusters. The silhouette value for the ith point, S i , can be expressed by the following equation:\nwhere a i is the average distance from the ith observation to the other observations in the same cluster, and b i is the average distance from the ith point to points in a different cluster [60] . The minimum is taken across all other clusters. The valid silhouette values are in between \u22121 and 1. The mean silhouette value expresses the cohesiveness of the clusters, whereas the number of negative silhouettes refers to possible misclassification. Therefore, an optimum number of clusters should be chosen in such a way where the mean silhouette is high, and the number of the negative silhouettes is low. In this study, the K-means cluster algorithm was run multiple times for 2 to 20 clusters, and the mean silhouette value and the negative silhouette counts were calculated for each run. Figure 2 shows the plot of the mean silhouette and the corresponding number of negative silhouette counts with different cluster numbers. The highest mean silhouette and the lowest number of negative silhouettes take place when the cluster number is four. Therefore, the number 4 is the optimal number of clusters for the current study based on the silhouette criterion.

The maximum intensity of cyclones in each cluster is shown in Figure 6 . Different agencies are responsible for cyclone records in the sub-basins of the IO. These agencies use different intensity classes at different wind speeds. Therefore, the current study uses only one general scale, the Saffir-Simson scale, for the common understanding of intensity discussion. The Saffir-Simpson scale categorizes cyclones based on maximum wind speed, and the scale is as follows: Tropical Depression (TD) < 33 kt; Tropical Storm (TS) 33-63 kt; Category 1, 64-82 kt; Category 2, 83-95 kt; Category 3, 96-112 kt; Category 4, 113-136 kt; Category 5, >136 kt.

The percentile ranges of Cluster 2 is higher than other clusters. The mean ACE is the highest and the lowest in Cluster 2 and in Cluster 4, respectively. There are a number of outliers in the distribution, indicating unusual ACE resulted from higher category long-lived cyclones.

Figure 11 shows two different seasons of the NIO: pre-monsoon and post-monsoon. The pre-monsoon season is short (April-May) compared to the post-monsoon season (October-December). The reason behind two seasonal peaks is the Indian monsoon, when the southeast wind from NIO moves toward land. Upper-level winds from the NIO are too brisk (strong vertical wind shear) during the monsoon to form a cyclone in the additional unusual season (April-June). Singh et al. [66] described that cyclones in the pre-monsoon season in this area (Cluster 4) usually moved northward and cross the northwestern coast of India and the coast of Bangladesh. On the other hand, most of the post-monsoon cyclones hit the southeastern coast of India and the coast of Sri Lanka. Figure 12 illustrates the distribution of cyclone month in each cluster. Clusters in the SIO have similar interquartile ranges. January is the median cyclone month of Cluster 2 and Cluster 3, as well as February is of Cluster 1. Cluster 3 has the longest season, nearly ten months of the year, compared to other clusters in the SIO, whereas Cluster 2 has the shortest season among the clusters. In contrast to these three clusters, Cluster 4 has most of the cyclones in November and Cluster 4 has the longest seasonality among clusters considering the two cyclone seasons in the NIO. The distribution of the cyclone month is skewed because of the additional season in the summer. \n"}, {"section_title": "Landfall", "text": "Landfall of a cyclone is important in the context of disaster risk.

Among the clusters in the SIO, ACE decreased in Cluster 2, but increased in Clusters 1 and 3 in the 1990s. Although the cyclone frequency trend was almost steady in Cluster 1, the total accumulated energy increased in the mid-1990s, followed by a gradual decreasing trend.

TC genesis is co-located with the higher positive SST anomalies near the Australian coast. Although Cluster 2 has two positive SSTA zones, TC genesis is mostly co-located at the middle SIO. Cluster 3 is associated with very low positive SSTA in the WSIO, indicating that TCs can form at low SSTA compared with other clusters.

Tropical cyclones may potentially follow similar characteristics-landfall, intensity, energy accumulation-if their genesis and track characteristics are similar. This study clusters IO cyclones based on the standard deviational ellipse of cyclone trajectories using the K-means clustering algorithm. Clusters also explain other characteristics of the cyclones, such as intensity, landfall, trend, accumulated energy, and large scale environmental variabilities, SST, and OLR.\nIn summary, the current study finds four clusters, one in the NIO and three in the SIO, after examining 592 TC tracks over the IO between 1981 and 2015. There are 230, 116, 195, and 51 TC tracks grouped into Cluster 1, Cluster 2, Cluster 3, and Cluster 4, respectively. Long track length, higher intensity, and long lifespan lead to the higher accumulated energy in Cluster 2, which may be because of the location of this cluster in the middle of the SIO. The rotation angle with the common genesis patterns may also explain the landfall as most cyclones move westward. Therefore, with the general westward movement, a large rotation angle indicates the probable track movement towards the northwest, while a small rotation angle is the indication of southwest movement. To know the eastward movement of cyclones, cyclone genesis and the end location need to be analyzed in future research. The Australian coast experienced the landfall of TCs from Cluster 1. Although spatial zones of genesis locations in both Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 are overlapped (Figures 3 and 5) , Cluster 3 has a higher percentage (54%) of landfall cyclones with high intensity (Category 1-4) compared to Cluster 2 (34%). Some clusters may be diffused (Cluster 2) and some clusters may be relatively compact (Clusters  1 and 3) . Though the genesis location of most of the cyclones in both Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 are overlapped, the mean rotation angle of these two clusters are different. The low median rotation angle of Cluster 3 indicates a southwest movement of most of the TC tracks in the cluster, whereas some of the cyclones in this cluster have a large rotation angle because of recurvation of the track. Cluster 4 in the NIO is unique compared to other clusters, for not only spatial location, but also for other characteristics, such as seasons (e.g., only Cluster 4 has two seasons). The cyclone frequency and total accumulated energy linearly increase over the last two decades in Cluster 4. Though the number of cyclones in Cluster 4 is fewer compared to other clusters, this cluster has a high percentage of landfall. Both cyclones with high ACE and a high percentage of landfall cyclones of Cluster 4 may have higher disaster risk potentials. Another interesting finding is that the intensity (Figure 6 ), lifespan (Figure 7 ), track length (Figure 8 ), and accumulated cyclone energy ( Figure 10 ) follow a similar pattern in the comparison among clusters. This pattern indicates that longer track length, long lifespan, and higher intensity make for higher energy accumulation. The genesis locations are co-located with the negative OLR anomalies. Positive SSTA are co-located with the TC genesis in three clusters in the SIO. TC genesis in Cluster 1 is associated with high SSTA in the IO. SST anomalies are localized in three clusters over the SIO. TC genesis is associated with a very narrow band of SST, between 28 \u2022 C and 30 \u2022 C in all clusters.\nThe information on these clusters is helpful to understand the pattern of cyclones in different locations in the IO. Other meteorological conditions such as wind shear, and IOSD-and ENSO-related parameters of these four clusters need to be investigated. The relation of clusters with SST, OLR, and other meteorological factors can be linked to cluster characteristics in predicting the pattern and nature of future cyclones. These kinds of predictions will help to determine possible landfall of cyclones and to determine the potential risk for cyclones, which will be helpful for disaster risk reduction for cyclone-vulnerable societies around the Indian Ocean. Further research on tropical cyclones will be helpful for disaster risk reduction for cyclone-vulnerable societies around the Indian Ocean. "}]
