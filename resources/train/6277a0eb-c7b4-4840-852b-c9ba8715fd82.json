It tracks the path, of those who return (stopouts) to determine where and when they reenrolled. The report also compares the background and school experiences of stopouts with those who do not return (stayouts). Because of fundamental differences in the student populations and the missions of the institutional sectors, the analysis was conducted separately for students enrolled in 4-year institutions and those enrolled in public 2-year institutions. Because of their diverse nature and small sample sizes, students in other types of postsecondary institutions including those in the private, for-profit sector; public less-than-2-year institutions; and private, not-for-profit less-than-4-year institutions were excluded. In total, these individuals represent about 14 percent of the undergraduate population of beginning students. The report is based on data from the 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:90194). The BPS survey is the longitudinal component of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:90), a nationally representative sample that includes students enrolled in all types of postsecondary institutions, ranging from 4-year colleges and universities to less-than-2-year vocational institutions. The BPS:90/94 cohort consists of students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time during the 1989-90 academic year. The cohort was followed up in 1992 and 1994; it therefore offers a wide range of information regarding student persistence and degree attainment 5 years after members of the cohort first enrolled in postsecondary education. The estimates (mostly percentages) presented in the report were produced using the BPS:90/94 Data Analysis System (DAS), a microcomputer application that allows users to specify and generate their own tables. The DAS produces design-adjusted standard errors necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences shown in the tables. For more information regarding the DAS, readers should consult appendix B of this report.

Whereas about half of all students who enter postsecondary education complete some postsecondary credential within 5 years (Berkner et al, 1996), about two-thirds of first-year persisters do so.1 Thus, students' experiences in their first year of college may have a lasting influence on their long-term persistence. Nearly one-third of all undergraduates leave postsecondary education in their first year, a greater proportion than in all later years.2 Student characteristics associated with early departure are typically linked to nontraditional status: being older, working full time, attending school part time, and having financial and family obligations that may conflict with attending school (Horn 1996, Lee 1996, Moore 1995, Mohammadi 1994, Feldman 1993. While students who leave are generally less academically prepared and have lower grades than those who stay, some studies that interviewed leaving students also reported that students cited financial reasons, family or job responsibilities, and personal problems as reasons for leaving more often than they did school or academic reasons (Lee 1996, Ogletree 1992, Kent State University 1993, Bonham and Luckie 1993, White 1971. For example, one survey of 399 leavers from a community college found that less than 20 percent of students cited school factors as reasons for leaving; 40 percent cited lack of time or money; and 67 percent cited \"other events or circumstances\" (Bonham and Luckie 1993). Other studies have reported that many students who left did so with intentions to return (Sydow 1996, University of Maryland 1987, Bradley 1975. Little has been reported, however, on whether or not students actually do return, and if so, how successful they are in completing their postsecondary education. That is the focus of this report. Taking advantage of a national longitudinal survey of beginning postsecondary students (BPS) who began their postsecondary education in 1989-90, the analysis will address the following questions: Introduction How do students who return differ from those who stay out?

A student who leaves an institution and transfers without an enrollment break to another institution is considered a persister in this study, but a leaver from an institutional perspective. For example, the 1990 first-year institutional attrition rate reported by ACT for all 4-year institutions is 26.7 percent (ACT Program 1990).

Students who withdraw early may be experiencing difficulty adjusting to the challenges of college life. For instance, the work may be too difficult or their chosen field of study unsuitable (what Tinto refers to as \"incongruence\" or \"lack of fit\"). Some students, especially those who come from families where no members have attended college, find the social adjustment to college just too difficult. Still others, especially older students, are faced with obligations such as family and work responsibilities, which limit their time and ability to participate fully in academic life. Whatever the reason for early withdrawal, nearly 30 percent of 1989-90 beginning students left postsecondary education in their first year (table 1). About half of those who left returned some time before 1994 (stopped out), and the other half stayed out. A majority of both stopouts and stayouts (63 percent) began in the public 2-year sector (table 2). In contrast, 21 percent of stopouts and 13 percent of stayouts began in public 4-year colleges, while 8 percent of stopouts and 4 percent of stayouts began in private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. Students who left the public 2-year sector were disproportionately represented relative to the total proportion of students enrolled in these institutions (44 percent). The opposite was true for students who left the 4-year sectors: 29 percent of undergraduates were enrolled in public institutions and 14 percent in private, not-for-profit institutions. The next two sections of the report detail the paths of students who stopped out from the 4year and public 2-year sectors. The findings are presented separately for these two sectors because the institutions serve very different student populations and have different missions.7 As Cohen and Brawer point out in their book on American community colleges, public 2-year colleges \"attract those who were not being served by traditional higher education: those who could not afford the tuition; who could not take the time to attend a college on a full-time basis; . . . who had inadequate preparation in the lower schools. . . .\" (1989,22). Thus, students enrolled in public 2-year institutions are more likely than their counterparts at 4-year institutions to be nontraditional, to attend school on a part-time basis while they work full time, and to have shorter 7For a detailed analysis of beginning undergraduates enrolled in the public 2-year and 4-year sectors, see Kojaku and Nunez (forthcoming). Overview of First-Year Leavers term educational objectives. Students who attend public 2-year institutions also understand that due to the open admissions policies of most institutions in this sector, they can leave and return without penalty.

Among those who left, a majority (64 percent) returned ometime before' 1994, and 36 percent stayed out. Among those who returned, a higher proportion transferred to another institution (58 percent) than returned to the same institution (42 percent). And a majority (65 percent) of those who changed institutions transferred to the 2-year sector. An examination of students' grades suggests that beginning students in the 4-year sector who stopped out and subsequently transferred may have been experiencing academic difficulty and changed their degree intentions. About 12 percent of stopout transfers had GPAs of 3.0 or higher, compared with nearly one-third (31 percent) of thOse who returned to the same institution (table 3). The cumulative GPA of stopout transfers was 2.00, compared with 2.39 for stopouts who returned to the same ,institution. This pattern was very apparent in private, not-for-profit 4year institutions where the cumulative GPA for stopout transfers was 2.25, compared with 2.80 for stopout returns. In addition to GPA differences, stopouts who transferred from the 4-year sector were much more likely to have attempted more than one type of degree by 1994. Attempting more than one degree indicates a change in students' intentions. For example, they may have begun college working toward a bachelor's degree and subsequently changed programs and attempted an associate's degree or vocational certificate. Nearly half (45 percent) of stopout transfers had done so by 1994, compared with 7 percent of stopouts who returned to their original institution (table 4). The fact that fewer than 10 percent of stopouts who returned to their original institution attempted more than one degree implies that most stayed in the 4-year sector for the remainder of their enrollment. Despite differences in GPA and degree intentions, if attainment is defined as earning some postsecondary credential within 5 years, the attainment rates between stopouts who returned to their institution of origin and those who transferred from the 4-year sector were similar, about one-third attained some credential (figure 1). However, stopout transfers were more likely to earn subbaccalaureate credentials, while those who returned to the same institution earned primarily bachelor's degrees."}, {"section_title": "-9", "text": "Figure 1 Stopout path for 1989-90 beginning students in 4-year institutions and outcomes in 1994 for first-year persisters and stopouts In 1989-90 Outcomes in 1994  2.33 *Does not include students in private, for-profit institutions; public less-than-2-year institutions; or private, not-for-profit lessthan-4-year institutions (about 14 percent of beginning students).

The timing of reenrollment differed for stopouts from 4-year institutions who returned to the same institution and those who transferred (table 5). Stopouts who reenrolled in the same institution returned earlier: more than half (57 percent) returned in their second year (1990-91) compared with 40 percent of transfers. Despite their earlier return, however, stopouts who returned to the same institution were no less likely than those who transferred to be enrolled in 1994 (26 percent and 24 percent), and were equally likely to have subsequently left with no degree (42 percent and 43 percent) (figure 1). Thus, the persistence of the two groups was similar. But as indicated earlier, stopout transfers were more likely to complete short-term programs associate's degrees and vocational certificateswhile stopout returns almost exclusively earned bachelor's degrees. It should be noted that patterns for stopouts were quite different for those who enrolled in the public 4-year sector relative to those who enrolled in the private, not-for-profit 4-year sector. As shown in figure 2 and table 6, stopouts from private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions who reenrolled in the same institution were much more likely to attain a bachelor's degree within 5 years than their counterparts who returned to public 4-year institutions (58 percent versus 18 percent). While stopouts who returned to the public 4-year sector were more likely than their counterparts in private, not-for-profit institutions to be still enrolled in 1994 (31 percent versus 15 percent), they were much more likely to have left without any credential (49 percent versus 22 percent). Within the 4-year sector, the outcomes of the two types of stopouts (returns versus transfers) in public institutions were opposite to the outcomes of their counterparts in private, not-forprofit institutions. Those enrolled in private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions who returned to the same institution had higher attainment outcomes than those who transferred (63 percent versus 33 percent attained some credential). However, the opposite was true for stopouts in the public 4year sector: those who transferred were more likely to attain some credential, albeit a subbaccalaureate credential, than those who returned to the same institution (34 percent versus 20 percent). Finally, the 1994 outcomes of the beginning students who persisted to their second year illustrate the importance of the first year with respect to eventual degree attainment and long-term persistence (table 6). Among students who began in the 4-year sector and who persisted to their second year, a majority (61 percent) had completed a bachelor's degree by 1994 and an additional 15 percent were still enrolled. Fewer than one in five (17 percent) had subsequently left without attaining a credential. In contrast, first-year stopouts were far less likely to have attained any credential within 5 years, and they were only slightly more likely to be still enrolled in 1994 than first-year persisters.  While there were also outcome differences for first-year persisters ,at public and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, the overall persistence differences were relatively modest (table  6). For example, 19 percent of first-year persisters attending public 4-year institutions subsequently left without any ,credentia1,, compared with 14 percent of their counterparts in private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. However, first-year persisters in private, not-for-profit institutions were more likely to.have earned a bachelor's degree within 5 years than those in public institutions (73 percent versus 55 percent). At the same time, 19 percent of those in public institutions were still enrolled, compared with 8 percent in private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, indicating that those in public institutions may have been taking longer to finish but were still working toward the bachelor's degree."}, {"section_title": "0", "text": "As noted earlier, a majority (63 percent) of students who left postsecondary education in their first year departed from the public 2-year sector (table 2). Within this sector, 42 percent left in their first year (figure 3). Students who left public 2-year institutions were equally likely to stay out as they were to return sometime before 1994. Among those who returned, about 57 percent reenrolled in the same institution and 43 percent transferred. Half of those who transferred stayed at the 2-year level, and 37 percent transferred to a less-than-2-year institution. The remaining 13 percent transferred to the 4-year level. Unlike the pattern in the 4-year sector where there were no obvious differences in persistence between stopouts who returned to the same institution and those who transferred, persistence rates did differ for the two stopout groups in public 2-year colleges. Stopouts who transferred were much more likely to have attained some type of credential than those who returned to the same institution (48 percent versus 27 percent). However, those who transferred earned primarily vocational certificates (42 percent earned a vocational certificate and 6 percent earned an associate's degree), while those who returned to the same institution were as likely to earn associate's degrees as they were to earn vocational certificates (14 percent and 13 percent, respectively). Those who returned to the same institution were more likely to have left with no credential (53 percent) than the stopouts who transferred (34 percent). Thus, stopouts who transferred from public 2-year colleges had higher overall persistence rates than those who returned to the same institution, but they tended to earn short-term vocational credentials rather than associate's degrees. Among stopouts who transferred from public 2-year colleges, those who reenrolled in the same institution returned earlier than stopouts who transferred (table 5): 45 percent reenrolled the subsequent year (i.e., 1990-91), compared with 12 percent of transfers. The frequency with which stopouts who transferred from public 2-year colleges earned vocational certificates suggests that many of these students may have initially enrolled with an associate's degree goal and later determined that a specific vocational program would better suit them. They subsequently enrolled in another institutioneither at the 2-year or less-than-2-year levelin order to pursue this objective. This is supported by the fact that 47 percent of stopout transfers who reported having an associate's degree objective in 1989-90 earned a vocational certificate by 1994, compared with 11 percent of their counterparts who returned to the same institution (table 7).   When comparing the outcomes of first-year persisters with those who stopped out, stopout transfers from public 2-year institutions and those who persisted to their second year had similar persistence and attainment rates (figure 3 and table 6). About one-half of each group attained some credential, and 18 percent were still enrolled. In contrast, first-year persisters in the 4-year sector were far more likely than stopout transfers to attain a credential (68 percent versus 34 percent). In the public 2-year sector, those who persisted to their second year primarily earned associate's degrees (27 percent) and bachelor's degrees (11 percent), while those who transferred earned vocational certificates (42 percent). In other words, while similar proportions of both firstyear persisters and first-year stopouts who transferred from the public 2-year sector may have earned postsecondary credentials, stopout transfers were more likely than first-year persisters to earn postsecondary credentials that require a shorter time to complete. -\") 4!"}, {"section_title": "Who Stops Out and Who Stays Out?", "text": "This part of the analysis attempts to distinguish between students who return to school after leaving their first year and those who stay out. In doing so, it asks the following question: Are stopouts more or less likely than stayouts to have attributes associated with early departure?

For example, students who attend school on a part-time basis are more likely than those who attend full time to leave in their first year. However, there are other factors related to part-time attendance that may affect persistence. Most notably is the likelihood of working full time while attending part time (Horn and Berktold 1998). To control for the interrelationship of variables related to persistence, this analysis used a regression mode1.8 The dependent variable is defined as the likelihood of leaving school in the first year.9 The model included a number of independent variables that represent various aspects of students' background and family characteristics as well as their firstyear college experiences. Two regressions were run: one for students leaving the 4-year sector, and the other for those leaving the public 2-year sector. Independent variables included in the full models are as follows (detailed definitions of all the variables can be found in the glossary in ap- Institution control (public versus private, not-for-profit) for 4-year sector model only."}, {"section_title": "4-Year Sector", "text": "The results for the 4-year sector are displayed in table 8.

Asterisks indicate when a particular group differs significantly from the comparison group (shown in italics). Several factors were significantly associated with early departure from a 4-year institution after controlling for related variables. One significant factor in early departure was having a low to failing cumulative GPA (under 2.0)a group that would include academic dismissalsrelative to students with higher grades. As shown in the table, before adjustment, 32 percent with GPAs under 2.0 interrupted their enrollment, compared with 10 percent with higher GPAs. After adjustment, the corresponding percentages were 33 percent and 11 percent. Students who had no GPA reported-40 percent of whom left in their first yearwould include those who did not attend long enough to complete a term and have grades reported. A similar result was found for timing of first enrollment in postsecondary education after graduating from high school. Whether it is due to lack of academic readiness to attend college, having conflicting responsibilities, or simply not having the desire to attend immediately, delaying postsecondary enrollment by a year or more after high school is strongly associated with early departure. In this analysis, 40 percent of such students departed early, compared with 13 percent of immediate entrants. After adjustment, the estimates were still significantly different (33 percent versus 14 percent). Tinto's (1993) theory of academic integration, students who were less able to engage with their academic program were more likely to leave early, even when controlling for other factors such as low GPAs. In this analysis, academic integration was based on a scale that measured how involved students were With faculty and their peers.\" A low academic integration index score (relative to a high one) contributed to early departure. Working full time while enrolled, which may hinder academic integration, was also associated with early departure, as I\u00b0Due to the strong intercorrelation of the student characteristics age and dependency status with the enrollment characteristics delayed enrollment and part-time status, the age and dependency status variables were removed from the model. \"The academic index score is based on student responses with respect to how often (never, once, sometimes, often) they reported the following: meeting with faculty outside of class, meeting with an academic advisor, having informal or social contact with faculty, participating in a student study group, using student assistant centers, and attending career-related lectures. The response to each item was coded from 1-4 and the mean was taken.

For example, before adjustment, 23 percent of first-generation college students and 10 percent whose parents were college graduates left before the second year. After adjustment, the difference was still significant (19 percent versus 13 percent). The relationship between parents' education and students' early departure may be due to several factors. Firstgeneration college students and students whose parents have limited postsecondary education may have a harder time adjusting to college life than their peers with college-educated parents. They may come from homes where college is not a high priority, especially if they need to work and contribute to the economic well being of the family. They also have less opportunity to be guided by their parents' own college experiences.12 Thus, having parents with no postsecondary education was a significant indicator of early departure, even after controlling for SES and academic integration. A number of factors were significantly associated with early departure before adjusting for related variables, but were not significant afterwards. This may occur when variables are indirectly associated with early departure by virtue of their association with other variables that directly affect the outcome. For example, before adjustment, students in the lowest SES quartile were more likely than students in higher quartiles to leave school early. However, SES is associated with other variables in the model. For example, low-SES students are also more likely to delay their enrollment in postsecondary education a year or more after high school graduation and to have less-educated parents (i.e., high school or less).13 As discussed previously, both delayed enrollment and first-generation college status are associated with early departure. Therefore, once other factors including delayed enrollment and parents' education were controlled for in the model, being in the lowest SES quartile was no longer significantly associated with early departure. Similarly, attending a public 4-year college versus a private, not-for-profit institution and attending part time versus full time were also associated with higher early departure rates before but not after adjustment. Both of these attributes, however, are associated with academic integration index scores. That is, students in public 4-year institutions are more likely than those private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions to have low academic integration scores. The same is true for students enrolled part time relative to full iime.14 Once other factors including academic integration were held constant, the departure rates for students in public institutions and students attending part time were no longer significantly different from their counterparts."}, {"section_title": "Public 2-Year Sector", "text": "The regression results based on students enrolled in the public 2-year sector are displayed in table 9. One difference between this regression model and the model used for students in the 4-year sector is the inclusion of the nontraditional status variable instead of the individual corn-12For a detailed study of first-generation college students, see Nunez and Cuccaro-Alamin (1998). \"BPS:89/90 DAS. For example, nearly half of low-SES students delayed their enrollment, compared with 16 percent of middle-SES and 6 percent of high-SES students. 14For example, 15 percent of students enrolled in public 4-year institutions had low academic integration scores, compared with 8 percent in private, not-for-profit institutions. Similarly, 41 percent of part-time students had low scores, compared with 17 percent of full-time students (BPS:89194 Data Analysis System). ponent variables that make up nontraditional classification (delayed enrollment, part-time attendance, full-time employment while enrolled, financial independence, and having children).15 In a model that included the individual components, none were significantly associated with early departure once all independent variables were held constant. However, when the nontraditional status variable was included in the model in lieu of the individual components, students with two or more of these characteristics (moderately to highly nontraditional) were more likely to leave early than students with one or none of the characteristics (traditional or minimally nontraditional). This was true both before adjustment (55 versus 30 percent) and after adjustment (52 versus 33 percent). As was true for the 4-year sector, students with GPAs under 2.0 were more likely to leave early than students with higher grades as were students with a low academic integration score compared relative to a high score. The only other attribute that remained a significant indicator of early departure after holding other variables constant was having no degree objective relative to having an associate's degree objective. However, students with no specific degree intentions may have fulfilled their educational objective while they were enrolled and their leaving may not necessarily indicate dropping out. There were a number of variables associated with early departure from the public 2-year sector before adjustment for related variables, such as age, SES, and first-generation status, but these were no longer significant after adjustment. However, since all of these variables are associated with being nontraditional (Horn 1996), once other variables including nontraditional status were held constant, these factors were no longer significant predictors of early departure. While the proportion of students leaving before their second year with low academic integration scores appears different from the proportion with high scores, even after adjustment, the estimates were no longer statistically different. However, it should be noted that the sample of public 2-year college students was small, and as shown in the table, the standard errors of the regression coefficients are relatively large."}, {"section_title": "Stopouts Versus Stayouts", "text": "The next step of the analysis explores how stopouts differed from stayouts with respect to variables associated with early departure. It revealed a number of instances where differences occurred, and in some cases, the patterns were found at both the 2-year and 4-year levels. 15See glossary in appendix A for definition under entry \"ATRS8990.\"  "}, {"section_title": "Student Characteristics", "text": "Regardless of where undergraduates first enrolled, characteristics associated with nontraditional students distinguished those who stopped out from those who stayed out. Within the 4-year sector, more than three-fourths (79 percent) of stopouts were either traditional or minimally nontraditional, compared with about half (52 percent) of stayouts (table 10a). Even though nontraditional students are concentrated in the public 2-year .sector, stopouts within this sector were more likely to be traditional than stayouts: about 42 percent were traditional or minimally nontraditional, compared with 27 percent of stayouts. Individual characteristics that distinguished stopouts from stayouts regardless of institutional sector included age, marital status, being parents, and the prevalence of working full time while enrolled. Specifically, stayouts were more likely than stopouts to be 30 or older, married, to have children living in their home, and to be working full time while enrolled (tables 10a and 10b). Students who stayed out after leaving were also more likely than stopouts to be the first generation of their immediate family to attend college. For example, more than half (55 percent) of students in 4-year institutions who stayed out had parents with no more than a high school 'Does not include students in private, for-profit institutions; public less-than-2-year institutions; or private, not-for-profit lessthan-4-year institutions (about 14 percent of beginning students). 2Among those who worked. education, compared with just over a third (35 percent) who stopped out (table 10a). The same pattern was found for students in the public 2-year sector: 51 percent of stopouts were firstgeneration college students, compared with 66 percent of stayouts. Socioeconomic status was also associated with whether students from the 4-year sector stopped out or stayed out, but this was not the case for students in the public 2-year sector (table 1 I a). About one in five (22 percent) students in the 4-year sector who stayed out were from the lowest SES quartile, compared with 4 percent of stopouts. These differences were found for students at both public and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions (table 11b). In the public 2-year sector, on the other hand, 18 percent of stopouts and 25 percent of stayouts were from the lowest SES quartile, a difference that is not statistically significant. Racialethnic group differences were found between stopouts and stayouts for both students in the public 2-year sector and in the 4-year private, not-for-profit sector, but not for those in the public 4-year sector (tables lla and 11 b). In public 2-year colleges and in private, not-forprofit 4-year colleges, stayouts were more likely than stopouts to be white. In community colleges, stayouts were less likely than stopouts to be Hispanic (6 percent versus 15 percent), while in private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, stayouts were less likely than stopouts to be black (4 percent versus 10 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Educational Experiences of Students Who Left the 4-Year Sector", "text": "When examining academic experiences of first-year students, the results suggest that compared to those who stayed out, first-year stopouts from the 4-year sector were more integrated in their academic program than stayouts (as measured by their enrollment intensity and level of contact with faculty and other students), but there was some indication they were less satisfied with the institution they were attending. With respect to enrollment intensity, stopouts were more likely than stayouts to attend school on a full-time basis (85 percent versus 68 percent) (table 12). While the cumulative GPAs of stopouts and stayouts did not differ markedly (table 13), stopouts were more likely than stayouts to report \"sometimes or often\" contacting faculty members outside of class (52 percent versus 35 percent; table 14a). Similarly, stopouts were more likely to \"sometimes or often\" meet with their advisor to discuss academic plans (62 percent versus 54 percent). More differences in academic integration indicators were evident among students in private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, where stopouts were more likely than stayouts to attend career-related lectures, have contact with faculty outside of class, participate in study groups, and meet with their advisors.

Stayouts were much more likely than stopouts to have a low index score when both 4-year public and private, not-forprofit sectors are considered (30 percent versus 17 percent). However, only in the private, notfor-profit sector is the difference between the proportions with low scores for stopouts and stayouts statistically significant (12 percent versus 34 percent). In the private, not-for-profit 4-year sector, stopouts were also more likely than stayouts to avail themselves of academic counseling services (79 percent versus 63 percent) (table 15). Thus, it appears that differences in academic engagement between stopouts and stayouts are more apparent for students in private, not-forprofit institutions than for those in public 4-year institutions. This result may be related to the findings discussed earlier showing that stopouts who returned to private, not-for-profit institutions were more likely to attain bachelor's degrees than those who returned to public institutions (see figure 3). Perhaps their early engagement with the institution played a role in the ability of students attending private, not-for-profit institutions to complete a degree. Alternatively, students who begin in a private, not-for-profit institution may be more sure of their educational path than those who start in public institutions. Though stopouts from the 4-year sector appeared more integrated in their academic program, they were less likely than stayouts to report being highly satisfied with their institution (table 16). About 40 percent of stopouts had a high satisfaction index score, compared with roughly half (56 percent) of stayouts. This finding held for students in public 4-year institutions (42 versus 60 percent), but was not significant for students in private, not-for-profit institutions (34 percent and 42 percent). Stopouts and stayouts in the 4-year sector also differed in how they financed their education program (table 17). Stayouts were more likely to receive aid (reflecting their lower SES relative to stopouts), but among those who received aid, stopouts were more likely to borrow (53 percent versus 38 percent).16 Willingness to borrow to pay for one's education may reflect a greater confidence in one's ability to finish school and pay back the loan. On the other hand, students who borrowed may simply have been more motivated to return to school in order to defer paying the loan. 'The academic integration index score is based on student responses with respect to how often (never, once, sometimes, often) they reported the following: meeting with faculty outside of class, meeting with an academic advisor, having informal or social contact with faculty, participating in a student study group, using student assistance centers, and attending career-related lectures. The response to each item was coded from 1-4 and the mean was taken. Students' scores were then divided into quartiles representing low, moderate (middle two quartiles), and high scores. 2Does not include students in private, for-profit institutions; public less-than-2-year institutions; or private, not-for-profit lessthan-4-year institutions (about 14 percent of beginning students 'Does not include students in private, for-profit institutions; public less-than-2-year than-4-year institutions (about 14 percent of beginning students).

'Does not include students in private, for-profit institutions; public less-than-2-year institutions; or private, not-for-profit lessthan-4-year institutions (about 14 percent of beginning students Due partly to the large standard errors for public 2-year college stopouts, it was more difficult to distinguish between first-year stopouts and stayouts in this sector. Stopouts were no more likely than stayouts to attend full time (table 12), and while it appears that stayouts may have had somewhat higher GPAs (2.53 versus 2.34), there is not enough statistical evidence to conclude they were different (table 13). Stopouts were more likely than stayouts to \"sometimes or often\" talk to faculty about academic matters (61 percent versus 36 percent; table 14a); they also tended to use personal and job counseling services more often than stayouts (table 15). However, the two groups did not differ from one another with respect to other academic integration items. Looking at the overall academic integration index score (table 14b), stopouts were less likely than stayouts to have a low score (38 percent versus 58 percent). While differences between stopouts and stayouts in the public 2-year sector were not as apparent as those found in the 4-year sector, students enrolled in public 2-year colleges may have more varied education goals. Public 2-year colleges serve students whose intentions range from taking a course or two for their own personal development, to taking a series of courses to obtain occupational skills, to earning an associate's degree for the purpose of transferring to a 4-year institution and attaining a bachelor's degree. Thus, not all students at the 2-year level intend to earn a degree, and one might expect students who leave without returning to be more likely than stopouts to have no degree intentions. While stayouts appeared to be more likely than stopouts to report having no degree objective (33 percent versus 21 percent), there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that the two groups differed in their intentions.\" Nevertheless, even if there were a measurable difference, two-thirds of students who left the public 2-year sector and did not return within 5 years reported having a certificate or degree goal, indicating a substantial rate of attrition for these students. 17BPS:89/94 Data Analysis System. Nearly 30 percent of students who first enrolled in college in 1989-90 left before the beginning of their second year. Half or more (depending upon institutional sector) of those who departed reenrolled within 5 years (stopouts). Students who began in the public 2-year sector were much more likely to leave in their first year than those who began in the 4-year sector. Of those who left, students who began in public 2-year institutions were less likely to return than those who began in 4-year institutions. Stopouts either returned to the same institution (stopout returns) or they transferred elsewhere (stopout transfers). At least half of stopout transfers, whether from the 4-year or public 2year sector, transferred to the 2-year sector. Among those who transferred from the 4-year sector, about one-quarter earned subbaccalaureate credentials, and 8 percent attained bachelor's degrees. And among stopouts who transferred from the public 2-year sector (with associate's degree intentions),18 a little under one-half earned vocational certificates, and 8 percent earned associate's degrees. Among stopouts who began in the 4-year sector, the subsequent persistence of stopout returns was similar to stopout transfers. That is, similar proportions of the two groups attained some postsecondary credential within 5 years, and similar proportions subsequently left with no degree. However, stopout transfers tended to earn credentials that take a shorter amount of time to completevocational certificates and associate's degreeswhile stopout returns were likely to earn bachelor's degrees. Students who stopped out from private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions and returned to the same institution were much more likely to attain bachelor's degrees within 5 years and were much less likely to have subsequently left with no degree than their counterparts in the public 4year sector. This result can be interpreted in two ways. Either the private, not-for-profit 4-year sector have more resources to retain stopouts who return, or stopouts who attend private, not-forprofit colleges have stronger degree intentions than their counterparts enrolled in public institutions. In the 4-year sector, students who persisted to their second year were very likely to earn a degree: about 61 percent attained a bachelor's degree by 1994, and an additional 15 percent were still enrolled. First-year persisters from public and private, not-for-profit institutions differed slightly with respect to 5-year persistence: about 19 percent of those who attended public 4-year colleges left with no degree, compared with 14 percent of those from private, not-for-profit institutions. However, first-year persisters from the public 4-year sector were less likely than their counterparts in the private, not-for-profit sector to have attained a bachelor's degree and were more likely to be still enrolled after 5 years. Unlike the 4-year sector, first-year persisters in the public 2-year sector had similar longterm persistence and attainment rates as stopouts who transferred from the same sector (about half had attained a credential and nearly one in five were still enrolled). However, stopout transfers earned primarily vocational certificates, while persisters earned primarily associate's degrees. Stopouts who returned to the same institution appeared to fare the worst in terms of persistence and attainmentless than one-third attained a credential, and about half left without a degree. It is possible that the outcome differences between stopout transfers and stopout returns in the public 2-year sector signal stronger intentions on behalf of the transfers. That is, students who began with an associate's degree objective but subsequently obtained a vocational certificate may have found a program of study that was more suitable or attainable. Indeed, nearly half of the transfers earned a vocational certificate. In contrast, those who left and returned to the same institution may have faced the same challenges that interfered with their initial enrollment. Consequently, fewer (just over one-quarter) of these students earned a credential than did stopout transfers. Alternatively, students who leave and then return to the same public 2-year sector may be less likely to-have explicit degree intentions. Although there was some suggestion of this in the results, the sample was small and the difference was not statistically significant. While the persistence and attainment rates of students who began in the public 2-year sector were relatively low compared with those in the 4-year sector, it should be noted that at least half of all stopouts who transferred did so to the 2-year sector. This was true whether they transferred from 4-year or public 2-year institutions. Moreover, about half of those who transferred to the 2-year sector earned a subbaccalaureate credential (primarily vocational certificates). Thus, the 2-year sector provided these students with a \"second chance\" and gave them the opportunity to complete shorter term credentials. Regardless of where beginning students first enrolled, those who did not return after leaving were more likely to be nontraditionali.e., older, more often married with children, and more likely to work full time while enrolledthan those who did return. Stayouts were also more likely than stopouts to be in the first generation of their immediate family to attend college."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "In the 4-year sector (but not in the public 2-year sector), stayouts were also more likely than stopouts to be in the lowest socioeconomic status quartile. This was found both for 4-year public and private, not-for-profit institutions. Relative to stayouts, stopouts from the 4-year sector were more academically integrated and were more likely to attend full time, but may have been less satisfied with their institution. Stayouts, on the other hand, appeared to have greater family obligations and other nonschool responsibilities that may have conflicted with their schooling. The differences in educational experiences between stopouts and stayouts from the public 2-year sector were less evident, but like those in the 4-year sector, stayouts were more nontraditional than stopouts and also appeared to be less academically integrated.19 Taken together, the results indicate that among students first starting college, those who leave school in the first year and do not return within 5 years (stayouts) have more external obligations such as children and full-time employment than their peers who reenroll (stopouts). These commitments may interfere with a student's ability to integrate fully into an academic program, which in turn is associated with early departure. Stopouts, on the other hand, may have had difficulty adjusting in their first year, but were less encumbered by external commitments. Having fewer external constraints may have allowed them more time to become academically integrated and thus may have contributed to their eventual return. Finally, it should be remembered that the BPS survey extended over a 5-year period. It is possible that students who left in their first year and did not return within the survey time frame may have returned later. a. Talked with faculty about academic matters outside of class time?
