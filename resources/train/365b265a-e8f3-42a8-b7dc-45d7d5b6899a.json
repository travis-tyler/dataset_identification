This package was created to allow the user to bulk-download the BBS point count and related (e.g., route-level conditions) via FTP, and to quickly subset the data by taxonomic classifications and/or geographical locations.

The rBBS package is perhaps most aligned with the bbsAssistant package, in that it also provides functions for downloading BBS data, however, the existing repository is apparently stale. Further, bbsAssistant provides streamlined functionality for retrieving location and species-specific data. Finally, the bbsBayes package, was creating primarily to run hierarchical models in a Bayesian framework within R. bbsBayes provides a function (bbsBayes::fetch_bbs_data()) for retrieving and importing all BBS data, yet does not currently allow for custom download and importation."}]
