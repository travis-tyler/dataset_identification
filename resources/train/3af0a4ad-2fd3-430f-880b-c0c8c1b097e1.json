While the increasing percentages of diverse student populations within the community college directly impact the classroom environment, it also impacts faculty experiences and expectations in the workplace environment. As a result of the shifts in student demographics, community colleges must understand this impact on classroom dynamics and how this will affect faculty and the conditions associated with faculty job satisfaction. Job satisfaction among community college faculty has received considerable attention and has become an important area of focus given the increasingly diverse community college environment, employment trends within the faculty sector, costs associated with faculty turnover, and looming retirements among faculty (Akroyd, Bracken & Chambers, 2011;Milosheff, 1990;Rosser & Townsend, 2006). Community colleges are also seeing a significant increase in the number of full-and part-time non-tenure track faculty members that are becoming the majority faculty. Wells (2007) conducted a study on 375 international faculty members at 172 community colleges and found that a significant proportion of foreign-born faculty members are part-time (64.4%) and non-tenure eligible (67.4%) faculty. These growing trends have not only transformed the traditional landscape of higher education, but prompted leaders and administrators to examine the working conditions and job satisfaction of all faculty more closely. Job satisfaction is referred to how content as an employee is with his or her job. Research has shown that job dissatisfaction can result in turnover and a decrease in institutional and/or departmental commitment. Faculty members' level of satisfaction is important to the institution. Their satisfaction is typically reflected in their performance, teaching delivery, and intent to stay with an institution. Findings from several studies acknowledged the relationship between high job satisfaction, decreased turnover, and institutional and/or departmental commitment (Rosser, 2004; Rosser & Townsend, 2006;Ryan, Healy, & Sullivan, 2012). Rosser (2006) concluded that a faculty members' satisfaction is a contributing factor influencing intent to leave. Understanding factors that cause dissatisfaction is equally important. The effects of dissatisfaction create low morale and can adversely impact student success (Dee, 2004). Valadez and Anthony (2001) found that low salaries, lack of benefits, job insecurity, and lack of tenure track/tenured opportunities were factors that contributed to dissatisfaction among part-time community college members. In order to promote a healthy and inclusive environment, community college leaders will need to better understand the factors that contribute to satisfaction among their faculty members. Knowing these factors can help administrators improve the level of job satisfaction and institutional commitment of faculty and optimize their contributions to their institution (Waltman, Bergom, Hollenshead, Miller, & August, 2012). For some time four-year colleges and universities have understood the significant role foreign-born faculty members can play at promoting diversity on campuses. Given the growth of diverse student populations at community colleges, leaders need to recognize the strategic significance of community college faculty, especially foreign-born faculty members in promoting diversity on their campuses, as well as exposing students to faculty with diverse perspectives and views. While there have been a plethora of empirical studies that have examined job satisfaction among United States citizen faculty, few studies focused on foreign-born faculty at U.S. postsecondary institutions at four-year institutions (Corley & Sabharwal, 2007;Lin, Pearce, & Wang, 2009;Mamiseishvili & Rosser, 2011;Sabharwal, 2011a;Sabharwal 2011b), and research is even further limited among foreign-born faculty members at the community college (Mamiseishvili, 2011;Markus, 2011;Wells, 2007). Research on the demographics of community college faculty found that full-time faculty members at community colleges are still predominately White (Townsend & Twombly, 2007). Considering that community colleges enroll the highest percentage of diverse students of any segment of higher education, it would be prudent for community colleges to invest in and recruit diverse faculty, including foreign-born faculty to serve the record numbers of diverse students. Foreign-born faculty members bring diversity in terms of their teaching and pedagogical approaches, experiences, and cultural perspectives (Skachkova, 2007) that expose students to global perspectives in the classroom (Horn, Hendel, & Fry, 2007). This study can provide relevant scholarly and practitioner significance about the factors that contribute to job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members within the community college. The following section will discuss the purpose of this study, theoretical framework, research questions, significance of this study, definition of terms, and a summary."}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine factors associated with job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members employed at community colleges within the United States. Foreign-born faculty members are a heterogeneous group and vary in terms of country of origin, language, faculty rank, discipline, and academic position (Wells, 2007). In spite of the presence of foreign-born faculty at United States community college campuses, there have been few studies focusing on factors that contribute to job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members at community colleges. Many studies that were conducted on factors related to job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members were focused on four-year institutions (Corley & Sabharwal, 2007;Lin, Pearce, & Wang, 2009;Mamiseishvili, & Rosser 2009;Sabharwal, 2011a;Sabharwal, 2011b). This study utilized selected motivator and hygiene and demographic variables from Hagedorn's (2000) Conceptual Framework of Faculty Job Satisfaction to measure the influence of these variables on the dependent variable, overall job satisfaction. Hagadorn's conceptual model can best explain and predict the relationship among mediator and trigger variables related to job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty. Mediators are job related factors that include (1) motivators and hygienes, (2) demographics, and (3) environmental conditions. The term hygiene refers to maintenance factors that cause job satisfaction (Herzberg, Mausner, and Snyderman, 1959). This study focused on motivator and hygiene variables such advancement, responsibility, and salary and the demographic variable, gender. Triggers are significant life events that can impact a person's satisfaction level at work such as, changes in life stage, transitioning to a new institution, change in perceived justice, and changes in rank or tenure. Trigger variables were not measured in this study because the Survey of Doctorate Recipients did have appropriate items to analyze these factors."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "Four research questions provided the framework for the study: with diverse student populations, international scholars and faculty led to my interest in teaching and learning with an emphasis on foreign-born faculty. These experiences sparked my desire to better understand the experiences of foreign-born faculty within U.S. higher education institutions was a natural segue to this study and it is my hope that this topic will make a significant contribution to the U.S. higher education sector, specifically with the community college."}, {"section_title": "Significance of Study", "text": "Very few studies have examined job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members at community colleges. In recognizing the need to address underrepresented, diverse faculty members, this study addressed job satisfaction factors are associated with foreign-born faculty within the community college sector. Understanding the contributions of foreign-born community college faculty and their needs as related to job satisfaction has both theoretical and practical significance. As related to their contributions, the talents of faculty members contribute significantly to expanding quality education at the community college. Foreign-born faculty members promote faculty diversity, support internationalization efforts, and help community college students develop global awareness and competency. Foreign-born faculty also bring with them rich cultural experiences and knowledge and skills that can enhance the learning environment. Community colleges and students alike can gain from the direct access provided by the presence of foreign-born faculty. Despite the expertise and talents of foreign-born faculty in their perspective disciplines, they still face challenges adjusting to American academic life (Collins, 2008). These challenges may impact their as related to job satisfaction. Transitioning to a new and different environment is a barrier for many, especially foreign-born faculty from non-English speaking countries because of their language skills and different educational backgrounds and experiences (Alberts, 2008). For foreign-born faculty to transition more successfully into U.S. institutions of higher education, customized orientation and faculty development programs are needed to acclimate and prepare foreign-born faculty for the American academic culture and classroom (Gareis & Williams, 2004). Customized training and appropriate socialization to the U.S. academic culture can help foreign-born faculty deal with the challenges they face. The presence of foreign-born faculty in community colleges assuming teaching roles with no formal preparation or training for the classroom presents a need to study and understand what factors contribute to job satisfaction among this unique faculty group. Academic departments, international education scholars and practitioners, and human resources professionals could benefit from this study. Findings of this study can better inform community colleges about the factors related to job satisfaction and employment trends of foreign-born faculty. Academic departments can better understand the experiences of foreign-born faculty and respond to the unique needs of this unique population. To address the needs of foreign-born faculty members, diversity and inclusion initiatives and the development of hiring and recruitment best practices can be implemented. Ingle (2005) suggests that desired diversity outcomes can be best achieved when initiatives are linked to the mission of the institution. Through such efforts, academic departments can help create a campus climate that values diversity among faculty. International education scholars and researchers can have increased knowledge and understanding of foreign-born faculty and use the data to gain new insights and considerations about recruiting foreign-born faculty at community colleges. More importantly, job satisfaction theory can help explain and understand specific job satisfaction factors that impact foreign-born faculty members within the community college sector. It also provides an opportunity to identify problems and modify practices, policies and processes."}, {"section_title": "Foreign-born Faculty at U.S. Colleges and Universities", "text": "Due to limited research focused on the levels of job satisfaction and challenges of foreign-born faculty at the community colleges, literature from fouryear institutions also must be studied to establish a framework and rationale for this study. For example, there were two studies within the literature that examined foreign-born faculty at community colleges (Mamiseishvili, 2011;Wells, 2007). The presence of foreign-born faculty can encourage greater learning and enhance American higher education's internationalization efforts (Stohl, 2007). According to the Open Doors Report on International Education (Institute of International Education, 2012) there has been a steady increase in the number of international scholars during the past 14 years, from 79,651 in 2001 to 124,861 in 2015. Data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (2008) indicated that the greatest number of foreign-born faculty were from Asia, followed by Europe and North America (excluding United States) respectively (See Appendix D). Foreignborn faculty members were more heavily represented in engineering, agricultural/environmental life science, and physical sciences. Foreign-born citizens were also equally concentrated in the private for-profit and four-year educational institution sectors (National Science Foundation, 2012). According to the National Science Board report (2003), approximating 20% of the scientific workforce in the U.S. is foreign-born."}, {"section_title": "Challenges of Foreign-born Faculty", "text": "The presence of foreign-born faculty members has at the same time created challenges for institutions. With the growing diversity of foreign-born faculty, U.S. institutions of higher education are seeing a simultaneous increase in the need for culturally appropriate assessments, services and training to support the unique needs of this faculty group (Green & Myatt, 2011). Foreign-born faculty members from non-English speaking countries generally face greater difficulties adjusting to the academic environment. Some of the noted challenges encountered by foreign-born faculty include cultural and communication barriers, English language proficiency, visa and immigration challenges, and acculturation stress (Alberts, 2008;Foote, Wei, Monk, & Theobald, 2008, Kuhn,1996Thomas & Johnson, 2004). These challenges have resulted in attention to how institutions train and prepare foreign-born faculty for the classroom. Research has indicated that foreign-born faculty members need more exposure to the U.S. academic culture (Collins, 2008;Gareis & Williams, 2004;Kilburg, 1992). The majority of foreign-born faculty members receive little to no formal assistance with transitioning into U.S. colleges and universities. Few higher education institutions offer customized training, mentoring and practical advice for foreign-born faculty (Gravois, 2005;Sarkisian, 2006). In order to create a quality learning environment for both the institution and faculty member, it is essential that faculty members are prepared for the classroom, especially foreign-born faculty members (Green & Myatt, 2011). Sarkisian (2006) provided practical advice and suggestions for international faculty and graduate students who teach American colleges students. She suggested that it is in the interest of higher education that foreign-born faculty members receive some formal training that exposes them to the U.S. higher education classroom environment."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Purpose and Significance", "text": "The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine factors associated with job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members employed at community colleges within the United States. Research on job satisfaction among academic faculty, especially among foreign-born faculty has been limited. More data are needed from the community college perspective and warrants further consideration. This chapter presented the purpose for investigating factors associated with job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty at American community colleges. The lack of literature in this area will make this study valuable to the community college sector. This study also provided a rationale for each of these research questions. contribution to the U.S. academic labor market, definitions of job satisfaction, and an explanation of the theoretical and conceptual frameworks that provide the foundation for this study."}, {"section_title": "Approach to Literature Review", "text": "The data in the study were retrieved from a variety of information sources. Articles, books, reports and dissertations relevant to the research topics were identified for this investigation. Reference lists from journal articles and dissertations also contributed to the study. Academic Search Premier, Oregon State University's database was the primary database used for this study. Google Scholar, EBSCO host, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) were also used to search for articles and abstracts. To search for dissertations PQDT was used. The main search method was to examine abstracts and full text studies from different source types. The majority of the research came from peer-reviewed journals and relevant nonrefereed literature. The most notable time for foreign-born faculty members and international education within higher education was after 2001. This study chose to focus on research after 2001. The tragic events of September 11 not only reshaped many facets of the American higher education but adversely impacted internationalization efforts and the growth in the number of foreign-born faculty. Issues such as increased scrutiny on foreign-born faculty, tightened immigration laws, and visa restrictions contributed significantly to the decline in the number of foreign faculty (Lin, Pearce, & Wang, 2009;Passel & Suro, 2005). The following key words used in this study were: foreign-born faculty, job satisfaction, and community college. Foreign-born faculty, international faculty, and international academics were used interchangeably. Community college and twoyear institutions were also used interchangeably.

Research conducted on faculty members and job satisfaction have consistently shown that when faculty members are content with their jobs they are more likely to stay at the institutions and are more productive (Hagedorn, 2000;Rosser, 2004;Spector, 1997). Furthermore, when faculty members are content and satisfied with their jobs and work environment, they are more actively engaged, productive, and committed to their institutions (Hagedorn, 2000). This study does not attempt to define job satisfaction, but to measure job satisfaction using Hagedorn's conceptual framework."}, {"section_title": "Factors Contributing to Job Satisfaction among Community College Faculty", "text": "Many factors impact job satisfaction and knowing these factors are vital if institutions are to retain their faculty members. Work related concerns such as salary, benefits , instructional autonomy (Kim, Twombly and Wolf-Wendel, 2008), and workload have been identified as determinants of job satisfaction among community college faculty members as well as demographic factors such as gender (Antony & Hayden, 2011;Milosheff, 1990;Townsend, 1998;Truell, Price & Joyner, 1998), ethnicity, institutional type, academic status (Gappa & Leslie, 1993;Kramer, Gloeckner & Jacoby, 2014;Schuster & Finkelstein, 2006;Valadez & Anthony, 2001;Wagoner, 2007) and discipline (Truell, Price & Joyner, 1998;Wagoner, 2007 ) . A considerable amount of research conducted on the job satisfaction levels of faculty at community colleges found that faculty members are generally satisfied with their jobs. Huber (1998) reported that 80% of community college members were satisfied with their job satisfaction as a whole. Work related factors. Milosheff (1990) conducted a study to investigate factors influencing job satisfaction among 703 full-time community college faculty members. A number of independent variables influencing job satisfaction were personal and demographics (e.g., educational degree, attainment, and gender), professional activities/responsibilities (e.g., influence on campus, time spent on school activities relative to students and teaching), perceptions of and relationships with students (e.g. perception of student quality, student interactions outside of class), institutional environment (e.g., adverse finances of the institution, perception of instructional quality), and departmental environment (e.g., perception of department and department colleagues, type of departmental affiliation). This study found that influence on campus, perceptions of students, adverse financial condition of the institution, and perception of department and colleagues were all significant factors with comparatively equal amounts of influence on job satisfaction, with perception of student being the most significant. Findings also indicated that gender, type of degree, and department affiliation were not statistically significant. Kim, Twombly and Wolf-Wendel (2008) investigated factors that predict satisfaction among faculty members at two-year and four-year institutions with instructional autonomy (i.e., authority to make decision about content and methods in instructional activities). The results of Kim, Twombly and Wolf-Wendel (2008) study indicated that over 95% of faculty members were satisfied with their instructional autonomy. They found that community college faculty members were significantly less satisfied than four-year college faculty with their instructional autonomy. Results also indicated that despite community college faculty members being less satisfied with their instructional autonomy, they were satisfied with their jobs overall than faculty members at fouryear institutions. Academic Status. Higher education has seen a dramatic increase in part-time faculty members, specifically within the community college in the last few decades due to increased student enrollments, funding shortages, and retirements. Eagen and Jaeger (2009) conducted a study on part-time community college faculty and found that 27% of all faculty appointments were part-time in 1969, 52% in 1987, and 66.7% in 2003. A significant amount of literature on job satisfaction and community college faculty has focused on non-tenure track and part-time faculty members (Gappa & Leslie, 1993;Kramer, Gloeckner & Jacoby, 2014;Schuster & Finkelstein, 2006;Valadez & Anthony, 2001;Wagoner, 2007). Kramer, Gloeckner, and Jacoby (2014) sought to determine factors that impact job satisfaction among part-time community college faculty members from 13 community colleges within the Colorado Community College System (CCCS). A total of 405 part-time community faculty members responded. The findings from Kramer, Gloeckner, and Jacoby (2014) study revealed that part-time faculty who preferred full-time teaching appointments were dissatisfied with various dimensions of job satisfaction, including their workloads, salary, and overall job satisfaction. They also reported that their belief that part-time faculty members were not treated fairly. In addition, they felt that good teaching was not rewarded and did not feel valued in their departments as part-time faculty members. Antony and Hayden (2011) utilized the 2004 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:04) to examine factors associated with job satisfaction among 18,713 part-time and full-time faculty members at both two-year and four-year institutions. Among the part-time faculty members surveyed, 56.5 percent were community college faculty and 31.8 percent were from four-year institutions. Antony and Hayden (2011) found that part-time faculty members at both two-year and four-were equally satisfied with aspects of instructional duties (e.g., technology-based activities, equipment and facilities, institutional support for teaching, and authority to make decisions) and rewards and workload scales (e.g., satisfaction with job overall, salary, workload and benefits). The findings also revealed no significant differences in job satisfaction among male and female parttime faculty members. Valadez & Anthony (2001) examined job satisfaction and commitment of 6,811 part-time college faculty members. The results indicated that two-year college part-time faculty members were less satisfied with their overall job satisfaction and level of autonomy than four-year college faculty. Gender. Gender has emerged as an important factor affecting job satisfaction among community college faculty (Antony & Hayden, 2011;Townsend, 1998;Truell, Price & Joyner, 1998). Akroyd, Bracken, and Chambers 2011 Bracken, and Chambers (2011) found that instructional autonomy and time spent on disciplinary activities were significant and positive predictors of faculty satisfaction among both male and female faculty members. They also found that both men and women faculty members were satisfied with the financial aspects of their jobs if there was a perceived increase. Other findings within this study revealed that women in general education disciplines were more satisfied than women who taught in occupational areas. Race was also investigated and the results indicated that White men tended to be less satisfied than men of color. Academic Discipline. Academic discipline has been identified as a factor to consider when examining job satisfaction and community college faculty. Wagoner 2007examined job satisfaction among part-time and full-time community college faculty across missions and disciplines (e.g., arts and sciences and vocational training). Wagoner's (2007) findings showed that full-time faculty members were more satisfied with job security, advancement opportunities, salary, and benefits than part-time faculty. Arts and sciences part-time faculty reported being less satisfied with salary and overall with job satisfaction than vocational part-time faculty. Parttime vocational and training faculty reported being more satisfied with their salary and positions overall. Among full-time faculty, the results were reversed. Arts and sciences full-time faculty members were slightly more satisfied with overall job satisfaction than vocational and training faculty. Truell, Price, and Joyner (1998) investigated the level of job satisfaction among 255 full-time and part-time occupational-technical faculty utilizing factors based on Herzberg's et al. (1959) Motivation-Hygiene Theory. Results of the study indicated that part-time occupational-technical faculty expressed significantly higher levels of satisfaction with their jobs than did the full-time occupational-technical faculty. Findings also revealed that there were significant differences between full-time and part-time occupational-technical faculty on four of the 10 factors (e.g., achievement, growth, interpersonal relations, policy and administration, recognition, responsibility, salary, supervision, the work itself, working conditions, and overall satisfaction). Part-time occupational-technical faculty members reported being more satisfied with policy and administration, responsibility, supervision, and working conditions than full-time occupational-technical faculty."}, {"section_title": "Job Satisfaction of Foreign-born Faculty at U.S. Institutions", "text": "The purpose of this section is to provide a review of the literature on foreignborn faculty member's job satisfaction patterns at both four-year and two-year institutions.

U.S. institutions benefit from global talent because they fill needed gaps in the academic STEM market (Lin, Pearce & Wang, 2009). The presence of foreign-born faculty not only boosts an institution's research capacity and productivity (Corley & Sabharwal, 2007;Mamiseishvili, & Rosser 2009;Webber, 2012), but enhances its ranking and reputation in the academic market. Several studies discussed the importance of foreign-born faculty and their role in innovation and scientific productivity (No and Walsh, 2010;Libaers, 2007;Libaers & Wang, 2012). importance for future research and practice. One of the strengths of this study is the added research on the work roles and productivity of foreign-born women in American higher education. Limited studies focused on the contributions of foreignborn women. The SEM data analysis was appropriate and addressed the research questions. The author addressed the limitations of the using secondary data. A major limitation of the data source was the quantitative measures of productivity. It was difficult to determine productivity because the quality of scholarly outputs could not be measured based on this data set. Likewise, Kim, Twombly, and Wolf-Wendel 2012found that international faculty members were more productive, but significantly less satisfied than U.S. faculty. The authors also examined the relationship between international faculty status and productivity while controlling for organizational influences. Results also demonstrated that foreign-born faculty members were highly represented among the tenure-track assistant rank than tenured positions. This study contributed to the current research on international faculty and addressed their levels of satisfaction and productivity at four-year institutions. The authors also stressed the need to develop more research and understanding about international faculty in order for the U.S. to maintain a leading role in fostering global talent and knowledge production. Mamiseishvili and Rosser (2010) also investigated the differences between international and U.S. citizen faculty members' productivity. citizen faculty members 'research, graduate and undergraduate teaching, and service productivity at U.S research universities?; and 2) How do these differences in productivity between international and U.S. citizen faculty members vary when controlling for selected demographic characteristics(e.g., gender, academic rank, and tenure)?

The statistical analysis demonstrated that most of the differences among the job satisfaction items for foreign-born and native born faculty are significant at p < 0.01 level. Decision making showed the greatest difference among the job satisfaction items followed by overall job satisfaction and benefit. Results indicated that overall, foreign-born full-time faculty members were more satisfied with their jobs than their native born faculty members. This study had some important strengths and limitations. Among the strengths of the research are the large sample size (n=11,562), overall quality of the data set, quality methods of data analysis, and results that answered the research questions. This study made an empirical contribution to research on foreign-born faculty and revealed additional research avenues regarding the underrepresentation of native born minorities. The findings suggested that American four-year institutions rely heavily on foreign-born faculty to diversify their campuses, which further contributes to the underrepresentation of domestic minority faculty members. Notably, the study examined foreign-born faculty at four-year American colleges and was one of the few studies that reported foreign-born faculty being more satisfied with the job satisfaction in comparison to their native born faculty. Further research is needed to determine whether these findings could be replicated across other types of higher education institutions and faculty ranks. Birth status and job satisfaction. Birth status can affect job satisfaction among higher education faculty. Sabharwal (2011b) examined the job satisfaction patterns of scientists and engineers by status of birth using Hagedorn's (2000) conceptual framework of faculty job satisfaction. Regression analysis was applied to explore the relationship between the mediator and trigger factors and job satisfaction. A variety of independent variables such as mediators (e.g., salary, benefits, opportunities for advancement, and gender) and triggers (e.g., English language proficiency and geographic location) were included in the regression analysis. Separate regression analyses were run for native born and foreign-born faculty members. Results indicated that foreign-born scientists and engineers were less satisfied with all aspects of their work life as compared to their US-born peers. Gender. Several studies examined the association between gender and job satisfaction among university faculty members (August & Waltman, 2004;Olsen, Maple, & Stage, 1995). Sabharwal and Corley (2009) examined the job satisfaction levels of faculty members at universities with a focus on gender and academic discipline. Sabharwal and Corley's (2009) findings showed that across all academic disciplines, male faculty members had significantly higher levels of overall satisfaction with their job and significantly higher levels of satisfaction with job security than female faculty members. Male faculty members reported being more satisfied with opportunities for advancement than their female peers within the science and social science field. Within the health fields, female faculty members were most satisfied followed by science, social sciences, and engineering. Women in the sciences and social sciences fields reported being more satisfied than their male peers with their level of job responsibility. Country of Origin. Wells, Seifert, Park, Reed and Umback (2007) investigated the differences in job satisfaction between international faculty members based on country of region and their non-international colleagues using data from the with existing literature on foreign-born faculty at four year institutions. Foreign-born faculty members in this study had similar employment characteristics to foreign-born faculty members at four-year institutions. A significant number of foreign-born faculty members were highly concentrated in science and engineering and employed part-time and on the non-tenured track. The findings of this study indicated that foreign-born faculty members had lower levels of satisfaction and more negative perceptions with all aspects of their jobs than U.S. born faculty members. Findings also indicated the largest difference in mean responses between foreign-born faculty members and U.S. born faculty members were: satisfaction with benefits, salary, workload, and perceptions about the fair treatment of minority faculty. This study has some strengths and limitations. Among its strengths are the large sample size and the overall quality of the data set. This study is one of the few studies that examined foreign-born faculty at a community college. The data analysis and methodology seemed appropriate for the design of the study. A limitation is that the results may not be generalizable to all foreign-born faculty members within the community college setting. There was little control for geographical location. Foreign-born faculty members were homogenized and the differences among groups were not explored. Markus (2011) also utilized the 2004 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:2004) to examine factors that contribute to job satisfaction among foreignborn faculty members at community colleges in the United States. The research showed that foreign-born faculty expressed high to moderate levels of overall satisfaction with their jobs and were most satisfied with authority to make decisions. The results also showed that foreign-born faculty members were dissatisfied with teaching and improvements and their salaries.  Herzberg et al. (1959) posit that there are certain factors that contribute to job satisfaction (motivators) and a distinct set of factors that contribute to dissatisfaction (hygienes). Herzberg (1966) assert that satisfaction and dissatisfaction are considered independent phenomena and do not influence each other.  Hagedorn (2000) this framework is a \"strategy to sort and categorize the factors that compose and contribute to satisfaction\" (p. 6)."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Job Satisfaction Theory and Conceptual Framework", "text": "Hagedorn (2000) suggests that the more satisfied faculty members are, the more engaged and productive they are in their work.

The approach to the literature review, an examination of foreign-born faculty members contribution to U.S. academic market, key terms and definitions, and the guiding theoretical and conceptual frameworks were discussed. However, much of the attention was given to literature concerning faculty job satisfaction. Although there was a significant amount of quantitative studies on faculty job satisfaction very few studies focused on exploring factors that influence job satisfaction among foreign-born community college faculty members. Mamiseishvili H 1 : All motivator and hygiene variables will be significant factors that influence job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty at community colleges. H 0 : There will be no significant relationship among these factors. The independent variables are separated into two main types: 1 The purpose of this study was determine if salary, benefits, job security, job location, opportunities for advancement, intellectual challenge, level of responsibility, degree of independence, and contribution to society are significant factors that influence job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty at community colleges and if there is a strong correlation among the factors. Hagedorn's (2000) study found that work itself, salary, relationships with administration, student quality and relationships, and institutional climate and culture were the most highly predictive mediators. Findings also revealed that faculty who perceived a high level of justice within their institution reported higher levels of job satisfaction."}, {"section_title": "RQ2:", "text": "To what extent does gender influence job satisfaction among foreignborn community college faculty members? H 2 : Gender will be a significant factor that influences job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members. H 0 : Gender will have no significance on job satisfaction. This question was asked to determine if gender influences job satisfaction among community college faculty members. Sabharwal and Corely (2009) investigated the relationship between gender and job satisfaction among university faculty and found that female faculty members expressed lower levels of satisfaction than male faculty members. In another study, Sabharwal (2011a) studied the satisfaction patterns of scientists and engineers by birth and found that female foreign-born faculty members experienced lower overall job satisfaction levels compared with male and female U.S. born scientists and male foreign-born scientists.

In Kramer, Gloeckner, and Jocoby's (2014) study, findings revealed that part-time faculty who preferred fulltime teaching appointments were dissatisfied with various dimensions of job satisfaction, including overall job satisfaction. In another study on part-time community college faculty and satisfaction, Antony and Hayden (2011) reported different results. They found that part-time faculty members at both two-year and four-year institutions were equally satisfied with their overall satisfaction. Valadez and Antony (2001) study on job satisfaction and commitment of community college part-time faculty found that community college faculty members were less satisfied overall and with their level of autonomy than four-year college part-time faculty members.

Epistemology refers to the philosophical study of knowledge and knowing. In this study, knowledge was discovered through direct measurements to describe the phenomenon. The role of the researcher in the quantitative research process is to be independent of what is being studied. In this study, an objective systematic process for obtaining quantifiable information was applied. As a result, a quantitative methodology was most appropriate as the purpose of this study was to examine relationships between factors that are associated with job satisfaction among community college faculty members from a large number of participants. In quantitative research, literature also plays a significant role. The literature not only justifies the research problem, but creates a need for the study. The theoretical and epistemological perspectives of this study were informed by published empirical research related to job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty. According to Creswell (2012), the researcher can \"identify in the literature key variables, relations, and trends, and use these to provide direction for your research question and hypotheses\" (p. 14)."}, {"section_title": "Guiding Theoretical and Conceptual Perspective", "text": "Job satisfaction theory was the underlying framework guiding this study. There are several theories that attempt to explain why an employee may be satisfied or not. While there have been several studies that have measured the validity of Hagedorn's conceptual framework and its relationship to job satisfaction (August &Waltman, 2004;Corely & Sabharwal, 2007;Sabharwal & Corley, 2009), there is limited research that focuses solely on the relationship of Hagedorn's framework among faculty members within the community college sector. Thus, this study examined the level of satisfaction between U.S. citizen and foreign-born faculty members employed at community colleges in the United States. The most widely known and accepted approach towards understanding job satisfaction is Herzberg, Mausner, and Snyderman's (1959) two-factor theory. Hagedorn's (2000) Conceptual Framework of Faculty Job Satisfaction is the conceptual framework was applied to explain the variables and measure how they were related. Hagedorn (2000) modified Herzberg's motivator and hygiene concept to develop a model that applies individual and environmental characteristics to explain job satisfaction. According to Hagedorn (2000) this framework is a \"strategy to sort and categorize the factors that compose and contribute to satisfaction\" (p. 6). Hagedorn 2000suggests that the more satisfied faculty members are, the more engaged and productive they are in their work. The Conceptual Framework of Faculty Job Satisfaction posits that there are two constructs that interact and influence job satisfaction: triggers and mediators (Hagedorn, 2000). Environmental conditions are the social and working relationships that exist among administrators, colleagues, and students. These conditions include collegial relationships, student quality or relationships, administrations, and institutional climate or culture. The last portion of her model includes the job satisfication continuum. This concept describes how mediator and trigger factors are used to gauge job satisfaction on a continuum. Due to the limitations of the SDR, this study was not able to measure environmental conditions and Triggers.

This research study will examine the level of job satisfaction among both U.S. citizen and foreignborn faculty members and employ a survey research design utilizing the SDR to answer the research questions and measure the data. In quantitative research, variables are used to support the research objectives and hypotheses. According to Creswell (2012), quantitative research \"describes a research problem through the description of trends or a need for an explanation of the relationship among variables\" (p. 13). In this study, the independent variables include demographic and academic employment characteristics related to foreign-born faculty members. The dependent variable is overall job satisfaction. The researcher chose to pursue a quantitative design with the purpose of collecting numeric data from a large number of participants that could not be analyzed through a qualitative research design. The results will use statistical analyses to make inferences about the level of job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members.

Surveys that are used to impact change, address important issues, and used for decision making must provide evidence of its reliability and validity (Suskie, 1996). According to Creswell (2012), reliability \"means that scores from an instrument are stable and consistent. Scores should be nearly the same when researches administer the instrument multiple times at different times\" (p. 159). Cronbach's alpha was calculated to estimate the consistency of scores for continuous variables. The closer the coefficient is to 1.0, the greater the internal consistency of the variables in the scale. Vogt (2007) suggest that Cronbach's alphas that are above .70 are considered acceptable estimates of internal consistency for social science research. All of the scaled questions in this study produced Cronbach's alphas ranging from \u03b1 = .972 to \u03b1 = .994. The validity or accuracy is also important when conducting scientific research. Validity refers to the extent to which an instrument measures what it is supposed to measure. To establish validity in the study, content validity was used to measure whether the scores from the instrument were valid. Vogt (2007) states that content validity \"gauges the degree to which the content of a test or survey matches the content it is intended to measure\" (p. 119). Creswell (2012) asserts that validity \"can be thought of as the larger, more encompassing term when you assess the choice of an instrument\" (p. 159). The SDR survey was chosen because of its validity in previous studies. Several researchers utilized elements within the survey to measure relevant constructs related to job satisfaction and foreign-born faculty members within the U.S. institutions of higher education (Corley & Sabharwal, 2007;Kim, Twombly and Wolf-Wendel, 2011;Mamiseishvili, 2013;Sabharwal, 2011b)."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "This aim of this study was to conduct secondary analysis of data collected from the 2013 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR: 2013).

This chapter discussed the findings which include a review of the research questions and analysis. Also discussed are the limitations of the study, implications for practice, and recommendations for further research. Chapter1 introduced the purpose, research questions, and significance of this study. Chapter 1 also discussed the role of community colleges within the U.S. higher education sector. Factors that impact job satisfaction among community college faculty (Akroyd, Bracken & Chambers, 2011;Milosheff, 1990;Rosser & Townsend, 2006) were identified. A need for research on factors associated with job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members at U.S. community colleges was also addressed. Attention was also given to the challenges that foreign-born faculty members face within U.S. institutions of higher education (Alberts, 2008;Collins, 2008). In Chapter 2, the review of the literature presented studies related to foreignborn faculty members within the U.S. higher education sector. Despite the extant literature on faculty job satisfaction, few addressed issues related to foreign-born faculty members at community colleges. The results of this study support Mamiseishvili's (2011) study that show foreign-born faculty community college members being generally less satisfied with jobs in comparison to U.S. born community college faculty.

This study confirms prior research that community college faculty members are overwhelmingly satisfied with their position (Huber, 1998;Kim, Twombly & Wolf-Wendel, 2008). In this study, 75.5% of U.S. citizen faculty community college faculty identified being White, 19.7% identified being underrepresented minority, and 4.8% identified being Asian, which supports previous research that community colleges are predominately White and have limited diversity within the faculty ranks (Townsend & Twombly, 2007). However, among foreign-born faculty, underrepresented minority faculty members were the majority at 34.6%, followed by Asians at 33.2%, and White at 32.2%. The findings in this study support previous research about foreign-born faculty members being an ethnically diverse group and contributing to diversity at community colleges (Mamiseishvili, 2011). Age was another key demographic characteristic that emerged. In this study, the average age of all faculty members was 51 years old with the majority of the U.S. citizen population (28.68%, n = 226) falling between the ages 57-66 years old. The majority of foreign-born faculty members were younger than their U.S, citizen peers with 37% of respondents falling within the 37 -46 age range. Research Question 1: Which motivator and hygiene factors have the most significant relationship with job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members at community colleges? The results from the multiple regression analysis indicated that opportunities for advancement, salary, degree of independence, and contribution to society were strong predictors of job satisfaction among foreign-born community college faculty members. Among Hagedorn's (2000) motivator and hygiene factors, salary and opportunities for advancement were significantly related to overall job satisfaction, while level of responsibility, gender, and race/ethnicity were not. This study found that foreign-born faculty members were less satisfied with their salary (M = 3.18 vs. M = 3.32) in comparison to U.S. citizen faculty. These results support prior research about foreign-born faculty being significantly less satisfied with their salary when compared to U.S. citizen faculty (Lin, Pearce & Wang, 2009;Mamiseishvili, 2011;Wells, Seifert, Park, Reed and Umback, 2007) Research Question 2: To what extent does gender influence job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty at community colleges? Results from this study found that gender was not a statistically significant factor influencing job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty. Prior research has shown no significant differences between male and female satisfaction levels (Antony & Hayden, 2011;Milosheff, 1990). In this study, both female and male foreign-born faculty members were most satisfied with contribution to society and less satisfied with opportunities for advancement.

Adjunct faculty also reported being the least satisfied with opportunities for advancement and benefits. Findings from this study support prior research about part-time faculty members generally being less satisfied than full-time faculty (Kramer, Glocekner & Jacoby, 2014;Valadez & Anthony, 2001). Research Question 4: Are there differences in the overall job satisfaction between foreign-born and U.S. citizen community college faculty members? Results from this study found significant differences between U.S. citizen faculty and foreign-born faculty members in terms of their overall job satisfaction. Foreign-born faculty members reported lower levels of jobs satisfaction in all aspects of their job in comparison to U.S. citizen faculty. Other studies have reported significant differences in overall job satisfaction between U.S. citizen and foreignborn faculty members (Kim, Twombly & Wolf-Wendel, 2012;Lin, Pearce & Wang, 2009;Sabharwal, 2011b).

Future studies can be more statistically robust with an increased sample size. In studies that use self-report methods to gather data, researchers rely heavily on the truthfulness of the participants' responses. There are uncertainties about how honest the respondents will be with certain job satisfaction factors. Using secondary data was another limitation of this study. Research has found that institutional factors such as institutional support, departmental environment, funding shortages, and retirements can contribute to faculty satisfaction (Antony & Haydent, 2011;Kramer, Glocekner & Jacoby, 2014;Milosheff, 1990). Due to the limitations of the 2013 Survey of Doctorate Recipients, institutional factors were unavailable in this dataset. This study used a quantitative approach, but the inclusion of qualitative methods could strengthen the findings. There are several reasons for using a mixedmethod study to examine factors related to job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members within the U.S. community college sector. Including a qualitative method can give more meaning to the experiences of foreign-born faculty that quantitative study alone cannot provide. A qualitative method can explore the complexities surrounding demographic factors such as academic status, gender and culture identity that this study was unable to identify. Although gender and academic status were not statistically significant factors influencing job satisfaction, a qualitative method would be most appropriate to better understand how these factors impact job satisfaction. This study and as well as the empirical studies in Chapter 2 yielded a significant amount of information about the factors associated with of faculty job satisfaction, but did not yield some of the unique characteristics and experiences of foreign-born faculty members at community colleges. A focus group or in-depth interviews can validate the quantitative data in this study. Through exploratory methods, this study can better capture the rich experiences, attitudes, and perspectives of foreign-born faculty members as it relates to their job satisfaction."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Practice", "text": "This study provides an important contribution to the literature on foreign-born community college faculty. The results indicate that community college faculty members are generally satisfied with their jobs, but foreign-born faculty reported lower levels of job satisfaction in all aspects of their job in comparison to U.S. citizen faculty members. These results may inform practical implications for community college administrators and human resources personnel working with foreign-born faculty members who are facing challenges in their role. With the presence of foreign-born faculty teaching in the community college, it is imperative that community colleges provide appropriate support to acclimate foreign-born faculty to the organizational culture. Several studies have suggested customized orientation and socialization programs are needed (Collins, 2008;Gareis & Williams, 2004;Kilburg, 1992;Mamiseishvili, 2010)  As a result of this study, all stakeholders will have additional information upon which to base decisions and have a better understanding of the job satisfaction attitudes of foreign-born faculty at U.S. postsecondary higher education institutions. This study can also be used to assess the contributions that foreign-born academics have made to U.S. community colleges and what efforts can be adopted to retain and cultivate highly skilled talent. As institutions continue to recruit foreign-born faculty, managing a diverse workplace becomes a major challenge. U.S. higher education institutions need to have adequate resources in place to accommodate the varying needs of foreign-born faculty members. The evolving needs of foreign-born faculty will require institutions to stay attuned to their particular needs to retain them. As a result, higher education institutions will need to be better positioned to support and address their unique needs."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Community College Leaders", "text": "Given the importance of job satisfaction, it is imperative that leaders within the community college identify ways to improve job satisfaction among faculty members. In this study, foreign-born faculty members reported being less satisfied with their job in comparison to U.S. citizen faculty members. Having this awareness, leaders can develop strategies to attract and retain talented foreign-born faculty members. Leaders will also need to be committed to implementing policies and best practices for hiring, retaining, and promoting culturally diverse faculty. If this matter is not addressed, there is a risk of having high attrition rates among foreign-born faculty members. Opportunities for Advancement. Opportunities for advancement was a significant factor contributing to job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty in this study. In order to retain foreign-born faculty members, administrators will need to invest in providing career development opportunities for foreign-born faculty members. Having limited opportunities to grow contributes to faculty attrition. Research suggests that providing career development opportunities has a direct effect on faculty members' intent to stay and engagement (Association of Higher Education, 2009). The Association of Higher Education suggests that institutions do the following to retain and increase diversity: (1) provide mentoring and support groups for aspiring leaders of color, (2) promote a healthy multicultural environment and campus, (3) adhere to the principles of affirmative action, (4) provide work and life balance opportunities, and (5) ensure fairness in recruitment, hiring, and promotion. Salary. In this study, salary was a significant factor influencing job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members. This suggests that foreign-born salary may influence foreign-born faculty members' satisfaction with their job and the intention to remain in the position or not. Community college leaders will need to provide competitive salaries in order to retain foreign-born faculty. Contribution to society. Contribution to society was another factor influencing job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members. Leaders within the community college will need to further examine what foreign-born faculty members value in a career. Providing meaningful work that makes a contribution to society is a good predictor of job satisfaction for foreign-born faculty members. The community college will need to foster an environment where foreign-born faculty members perceive their work to be rewarding and fulfilling."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Further Study", "text": "The results of this study also have implications for research and demonstrate the need for more studies on job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty within the community college sector. This study sample focused on foreign-born community college faculty members as a single group. Perceptions of job satisfaction may differ according to foreign-born faculty members' country of origin and native language. Also, a future study for consideration could be gained through further inquiry. The following questions can provide more meaningful data about job satisfaction factors associated with foreign-born faculty: (1) What attracted you to work at a community college? (2) What aspects of your job would cause you to stay? (3) What aspects of the job would cause you to leave? (4) What suggestions do you have to retain faculty members at the community college? For foreign-born faculty, having a cultural understanding of their environment is essential for their success. Many foreign-born faculty members face many obstacles adjusting to U.S. Academic life because of their unfamiliarity with U.S. academic culture. The findings of this study can also be used to inform and develop culturally appropriate training and orientation for new foreignborn faculty members. Specifically, administrators, faculty supervisors, and teaching and learning centers need to recognize the challenges that foreign-born faculty face, which can impact their role and performance. This study is one of the few studies that focuses on foreign-born faculty within the community college sector and warrants a need in the literature. Identifying the characteristics and workplace issues of foreign-born faculty is an important initial step to better understand foreign-born faculty and orient them into the U.S. higher education culture. Having a better understanding of their challenges and experiences can provide valuable insights about how to design and deliver culturally relevant orientation. Having appropriate training can not only to enhance foreign-born faculty members' quality of academic life, but also improve student learning and institutional outcomes.
