[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This First Look report presents selected findings from the 2012/17 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:12/17), a nationally representative survey of undergraduates who entered postsecondary education for the first time in the 2011-12 academic year. BPS:12/17 covers the experiences of these first-time beginning postsecondary students over 6 academic years, 2011-12 through 2016-17, and provides information about students' demographic backgrounds; enrollment characteristics; transfer experiences; persistence in and completion of postsecondary education programs; transition into employment; and changes over time in their education and career goals, income level, and debt amount, among other indicators. This report provides a first look at students' persistence, retention, and attainment over 6 years, 1 showing the rates at which students had completed postsecondary credentials, the rates at which they had persisted through or left postsecondary education without earning any credential as of spring 2017, and the rates at which they remained in the first institution in which they were enrolled. Both overall rates and rates disaggregated by key enrollment and student characteristics are shown in the tables. The purpose of this report is to illustrate the range of information available in BPS:12/17. The selected findings present examples of the estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not intended to emphasize any particular issue. Readers are cautioned not to make causal inferences about the data presented here. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Appendix A describes the variables used in this report. Appendix B provides detailed information on BPS:12/17, including data sources, sample design, and quality of estimates. Appendix C contains standard errors for all population estimates in this report."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "BPS:12/17 Data Collection", "text": "The first-time beginning postsecondary students in BPS:12/17 were identified in the 2011-12 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:12), which included a nationally representative sample of about 95,000 undergraduate and 16,000 graduate students attending about 1,500 Title IV eligible postsecondary institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia (Wine, Bryan, and Siegel 2014). 2 Approximately 37,000 respondents in NPSAS:12 were confirmed as first-time beginning postsecondary students in the 2011-12 academic year and became the study sample for BPS:12/17. The NPSAS:12 undergraduate sample represents the approximately 23 million 3 undergraduates enrolled in 2011-12, and the base-year sample included in BPS:12/17 represents the approximately 4 million undergraduates who were first-time beginning postsecondary students enrolled in the 2011-12 academic year. First-time beginning postsecondary students in BPS:12/17 participated in three interviews: in 2012, at the end of their first year in postsecondary education; in 2014, about 3 years after they started postsecondary education; and in 2017, approximately 6 years after they started postsecondary education. The 2012 interview covered a variety of topics, including students' enrollment characteristics during the first year, their education aspirations, and their demographic and academic backgrounds. The 2014 interview focused on students' enrollment patterns since 2012, including any transfers to other institutions, stopout periods, 4 attendance intensity, and certificates and degrees earned. A brief employment history was also collected. Those still enrolled were asked more detailed information about their academic and social experiences in postsecondary education, and those who had left postsecondary education, either with or without a degree or certificate, were asked more detailed employment information. The 2017 interview focused on the degree completion of those still enrolled after 2014 and the employment of those no longer enrolled. BPS:12/17 draws on many sources of data (see appendix B, table B-1 for a list of sources). Information about first-time beginning postsecondary students during their first year comes from NPSAS:12, which included a student interview and obtained data from institutional records, federal financial aid applications, and federal student loan and Pell Grant records. Data on 2011-12 first-time beginning postsecondary students in 2014 and 2017 are based primarily on the follow-up student interviews conducted in those years. The follow-up data are supplemented by information from students' enrollment records from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) and from federal databases such as the Central Processing System (CPS), the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). In addition, the 2014 follow-up collected information from college admissions test agencies (the College Board and ACT). In all three study years (2012, 2014, and 2017), student interviews were distributed as web-based questionnaires that were self-administered or administered by a trained interviewer. In 2017, about 22,530 students completed the interview, resulting in a weighted interview response rate of 64 percent (Bryan, Cooney, and Elliott forthcoming).

Table B-5 provides contextual information on student populations represented by BPS:12/17 sample members overall and in selected types of institutions. The design of the BPS:12/17 sample is described in detail in Ifill et al. (2016) (see p. B-2) and the BPS:12/17 Data File Documentation (Bryan, Cooney, and Elliott forthcoming).  47.1 34.4 60.7 \u2020 Not applicable. ! Interpret data with caution. Estimate is unstable because the standard error is between 30 and 50 percent of the estimate. \u2021 Reporting standards not met either because the standard error is greater than 50 percent of the estimate or there are too few cases for a reliable estimate. 1 Information on future bachelor's degree plans was not collected for first-time students who started in a certificate or bachelor's degree program. 2 Full-time status for the purposes of financial aid eligibility is based on 12 credit hours per term or 24 credit hours per academic year, unless the awarding institution employed a different standard. 3 A stopout is defined as a break in enrollment of 5 or more consecutive months. 4 Black includes African American, Hispanic includes Latino, Pacific Islander includes Native Hawaiian, and Two or more races includes students having origins in more than one race. Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic origin unless specified. 5 Independent students are age 24 or over and students under 24 who are married, have dependents, are veterans or on active duty, are orphans or wards of the courts, are homeless or at risk of homelessness, or were determined to be independent by a financial aid officer using professional judgment. Other undergraduates under age 24 are considered to be dependent. Unmarried includes students who were separated, widowed, or divorced. Students are considered to have a dependent if they have a child or any others for whom they are the caretaker or have financial responsibility. A spouse is not considered to be a dependent. 6 \"Some postsecondary education\" means that at least one parent attended postsecondary education and may have earned a credential up to an associate's degree, but neither parent earned a bachelor's or advanced degree. 7 Information on high school GPA was not collected for students who were age 30 or older by the end of 2011. 8 \"Master's or higher degree\" includes postbaccalaureate and post-master's certificates. NOTE: Estimates pertain to individuals who were first-time postsecondary students in 2011-12 at Title IV eligible postsecondary institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

The weights compensate for the unequal probability of selection of institutions and students in the NPSAS:12 sample and ensure that estimates generated from sample data represent the target population. The weights also adjust for multiplicity 4 at the institution and student levels, unknown student eligibility for NPSAS:12, and subsampling of first-time beginners while creating the BPS cohort during BPS:12/14. Finally, the weights adjust for unknown eligibility, nonresponse, and population coverage in BPS:12/17. Because some BPS:12/17 respondents were nonrespondents in NPSAS:12, BPS:12/14, or both, two analysis weights were constructed for BPS:12/17. The first weight (WTA000), created for all BPS:12/17 interview respondents regardless of their NPSAS:12 or BPS:12/14 response status, was a cross-sectional weight. The second weight (WTB000), created for all BPS:12/17 respondents who also responded in BPS:12/14, serves as the panel weight. Missing data were also imputed for all variables used in this report and most of those included in the BPS:12/17 PowerStats and QuickStats applications. The imputation procedure included a weighted sectional hot deck process (Cox 1980) 5 followed by a cyclic n-partition hot deck process (Marker, Judkins, and Winglee 2002). Additional details regarding the creation and use of weights and imputation procedures are available in the BPS:12/17 Data File Documentation (Bryan, Cooney, and Elliott forthcoming)."}, {"section_title": "Response Rates and Nonresponse Biases", "text": "As shown in table B-4, the BPS:12/17 weighted interview response rate for students was 66.6 percent overall and ranged from 50.7 percent for for-profit less-than-2-year institutions to 75.7 percent for public 4-year doctorate-granting institutions. As the response rates are below 85 percent, as required by NCES Statistical Standards (Seastrom 2014), a student-level nonresponse bias analysis was conducted overall and within each institution category for BPS:12/17. Bias due to interview nonresponse was estimated for characteristics known for most respondents and nonrespondents. These characteristics include institution-and student-level variables available from CPS and NPSAS:12. Bias was estimated before and after nonresponse weight adjustment in order to examine the impact of the nonresponse adjustment. The analyses found little evidence of nonresponse bias and that most statistically significant differences were eliminated by the nonresponse adjustment. For more information on the student interview nonresponse bias analysis, refer to the BPS:12/17 Data File Documentation (Bryan, Cooney, and Elliott forthcoming). For more information on the school-level unit nonresponse bias analysis, refer to NPSAS:12 Data File Documentation (Wine, Bryan, and Siegel 2014). Of the 16 variables used in this report, 6 items had a weighted response rate below 85 percent, 10 items had a weighted response rate below 85 percent for at least one institution type, and 3 items had a weighted response rate below 85 percent for all institution types (table B-6). A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for the 10 items with any response rates below 85 percent following procedures similar to the unit nonresponse bias analysis. This analysis found that nonresponse bias was significantly reduced for 9 out of 10 variables after imputation. Nonresponse bias was not significantly reduced for Plan to continue to a bachelor's degree program within 5 years, 2011-12.

A study like BPS:12/17 includes multiple sources of data for some variables (CPS, institutional records, student interviews, NSC, etc.), and reporting differences can occur among data sources. To protect study members' confidentiality, data swapping and other forms of perturbation were implemented, which can also lead to inconsistencies."}, {"section_title": "Comparing BPS:12/17 Estimates to Prior BPS Estimates", "text": "Comparison of BPS:12/17 results with those for prior cohorts of BPS requires information on how the NPSAS sample has changed over time. For details on these NPSAS sample changes, see Wine, Siegel, and Stollberg (2018). The BPS:12/17 analysis file contains records for all BPS sample members who responded to the student interview. BPS:04/09, however, made use of data from other sources, including NSC, to define study respondents who were not interview respondents but had sufficient data from these other sources. BPS:04/09 statisticians imputed missing data for study respondents who had not responded to the BPS:04/09 interview. For details, see Wine, Janson, and Wheeless (2011). In previous rounds of BPS, records for the interview nonrespondents appeared on the file but did not have data items and had a value of zero for the analysis weight. Enrollment and attainment estimates for BPS:12/17 are higher than those in previous iterations of BPS, including those produced in BPS:12/14 and BPS:04/09. Improvements in matching to administrative sources as well as the addition of sources resulted in higher estimates of these key variables. As a result of increased enrollment estimates, other estimates may be impacted (e.g., transfer, number of institutions attended, employment while enrolled)."}, {"section_title": "PowerStats", "text": "The estimates in this report were produced using PowerStats, a web-based software application that enables users to generate tables for most of the surveys conducted by NCES. PowerStats can use replicate weights produced with Balanced Repeated Replication, jackknifing, or bootstrapping to generate the design-adjusted standard errors necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences in the estimates. PowerStats also describes how each variable was created and includes question wording for variables based on specific survey items. With PowerStats, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report. The output from PowerStats includes the table estimates (e.g., percentages or means), their design-adjusted standard errors, and their weighted sample sizes. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (i.e., fewer than 30 cases, unweighted), PowerStats produces the double dagger symbol ( \u2021) instead of the estimate. In addition to producing percentages or means, PowerStats users may conduct linear or logistic regressions. Many options for output of regression results are available.
