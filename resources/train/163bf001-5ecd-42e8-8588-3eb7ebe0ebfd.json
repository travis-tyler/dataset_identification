The cases selected for the original study were consecutive new referrals to dementia clinics in Sydney, Australia. Participants were recruited into the case-control study to determine risk factors for AD, limiting potential recruitment bias to consent for autopsy for the present study purposes. Details of neurological, neuropsychological, and medical histories, including drug usage, have been previously described in detail.\n11 Clinical follow-up consisted of yearly field assessments using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 12 and assessment of any changes in medical condition and drug usage. Brain collection was limited to a 5-year follow-up period to maintain temporal relevance for the detailed neuropsychological measures.\nApproximately 90 original participants (30% of the original sample) died during the 5-year follow-up period, and for 44 (50%) consent for autopsy was given. All cases and controls were screened for neurodegenerative conditions by means of standardized research protocols, [13] [14] [15] as currently recommended. 16 Strict criteria for selection were used in the present study. Cases were excluded if they took steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, if they had any neuropathological conditions other than that associated with AD (particularly infarction, which increases inflammatory markers), [17] [18] [19] or if they had generalized sepsis at death (which also potentiates cerebral inflammation). 20 Twenty-two cases with matching clinical and neuropathological diagnoses were selected for study, 12 AD cases and 10 controls.\nApolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping was conducted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Details of the DNA extraction have not previously been published. Four 10-\u00b5m tissue sections from each case were dewaxed, rehydrated, and scraped into sterile 1.5-mL standard micro-test tubes (Eppendorf; Hamburg, Germany) by means of a sterile scalpel. Tissue was homogenized in 50 \u00b5L of 1\u03eb PCR buffer (Gibco BRL, Melbourne, Australia) by means of a cordless handheld homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co, Vineland, NJ). Fifty microliters of 20-mg/mL proteinase K (SigmaAldrich Corp, St Louis, Mo) was added and samples were incubated at 55\u00b0C overnight. After digestion, samples were heated to 90\u00b0C for 10 minutes to inactivate any remaining enzyme, and the DNA stock was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until needed. Amplification of the ApoE gene was performed with a mastercycler gradient (Eppendorf ). DNA samples (200-400 ng) were amplified in the presence of 2.5 \u00b5L of 10\u03eb PCR buffer, 1.5 \u00b5L of magnesium chloride (50 mmol/L), 2.5 \u00b5L of dimethylsulfoxide, 0.2 \u00b5L of Taq DNA polymerase, and 2.5 \u00b5L of 20-pmol/\u00b5L ApoE primer stocks 5\u0408-TCC AAG GAG CTG CAG GCG GCG CA-3\u0408 and 5\u0408-ACA GAA TTC GCC CCG GCC TGG TAC ACT GCC A-3\u0408 (35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 45 seconds, 63\u00b0C for 1 minute, and 72\u00b0C for 1 minute). Reactions were all made up to a final concentration of 25 \u00b5L with ultrapure water (all reagents were from Gibco BRL). To ensure that amplification of the correct product size had occurred (227 base pairs), 6 \u00b5L of each sample was run out on a 1% agarose gel (Ultrapure; Gibco BRL). Remaining aliquots of successful PCR samples were then digested with HhaI according to methods previously described. 21 Samples were run out on an 8% polyacrylamide gel to determine the ApoE genotype. Each genotype possessed a unique combination of fragments generated by cleavage with HhaI (91, 81, 72, and 45 base pairs).\nPharmacological exposures and medical treatments were included as a major category in the risk factor interview for the case-control study. 11 Daily medication use for at least 6 months was used as the criterion for significant drug usage. For the present study, cases taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) had arthritis and were monitored for continuation of their NSAID use during the follow-up period. Five cases with AD and 3 controls had consumed NSAIDs for arthritis for a considerable time before death. The remaining cases studied had no documented use of any anti-inflammatory drugs.\n(REPRINTED) ARCH NEUROL / VOL 57, JUNE 2000 WWW.ARCHNEUROL.COM 832 examined was sufficient to identify a 50% reduction in these neuropathological markers. The power calculations show that the number of cases examined was sufficient to detect changes in the amount of diffuse plaque (89% power). This measure was on average an order of magnitude greater in the AD cases than the controls (Table) . The amount of inflammatory microglia in the AD cases was on average twice that found in controls (Table) , and the power to detect a return to control values was 52%. The power required to detect a change in the neuritic pathological features was the weakest (43% power for neurofibrillary tangles and 26% power for neuritic plaques). These pathological changes were less frequently observed on average (Table) . Despite some difficulty with generalizing our results for these neuritic features, on average slightly more pathological features were observed in the AD cases who were using NSAIDs (Table) . This was despite these cases having better neuropsychological test scores in a number of cognitive domains (Table) ."}, {"section_title": "COMMENT", "text": "The findings of the present study cannot support the thesis that long-term usage of NSAIDs protects against or alleviates the brain changes of AD. While better cognitive performance occurred in the AD cases taking NSAIDs, these cases had as much tissue abnormality as their nonmedicated counterparts. In particular, the number of activated inflammatory microglia was not reduced in patients taking NSAIDs, suggesting that these medications may be ineffective in combating inflammation in the brain in AD. Although the power calculation was weak for this variable (52%), the study design controlled for variables that may affect inflammatory microglia, enhancing the opportunity to detect such pathological change. If anything, there were more inflammatory microglia and more neuropathological changes in the AD cases who used NSAIDs. This may seem surprising considering the recent report of a small but significant decrease in the number of activated microglia in nondemented controls who"}, {"section_title": "VISUALIZATION AND QUANTITATION OF PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS", "text": "Apart from the classic Alzheimer-type pathological features (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles), inflammatory microglia were detected by means of immunohistochemistry for the expression of major histocompatibility complex II cell surface glycoprotein HLA-DR. In addition, the involvement of other glial components, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes, was analyzed. Formalinfixed cortical tissue was sampled from the superior frontal, anterior cingulate, inferior temporal, hippocampal, and parahippocampal regions. Two tissue blocks were sampled from each region. One was embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 10 \u00b5m, and the other underwent antigen retrieval with 4% aluminium chloride buffer, as previously described, 22 before cryoprotection and sectioning at 50 \u00b5m on a cryostat. Paraffin-embedded, serial 10-\u00b5m sections were stained with the modified Bielschowsky silver stain and peroxidase immunohistochemical reaction for GFAP (Dako, Glosstrup, Denmark; Z334 polyclonal antibody diluted 1:750) to visualize neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and GFAPpositive astrocytes. Frozen 50-\u00b5m sections were stained to visualize activated microglia by means of peroxidase immunohistochemical reaction for HLA-DR (Dako M775 monoclonal antibody diluted 1:1000), as previously described. 22 The specificity of the immunohistochemical reactions was tested by omitting the primary antiserum samples. No peroxidase reaction was observed in these test sections.\nAreal fraction counts obtained with an 11\u03eb11 eyepiece graticule were used on sections of the superior frontal, inferior temporal, and parahippocampal cortexes to quantify pathological changes. Each slide for each case was assessed and the counts were expressed as a percentage of the total number of grid points. This method is the simplest way of reporting how much of a structure there is in the sections. 23 The area of cortex occupied by diffuse and neuritic plaques ( Figure, A-C) was assessed in 10 random strips of cortex perpendicular to the pial surface and spanning the entire cortical width magnified at \u03eb200. The area of cortex occupied by neurofibrillary tangles (Figure, D) was assessed in 10 random strips of cortex perpendicular to the pial surface and spanning the entire cortical width magnified at \u03eb400. The area of cortex occupied by inflammatory microglia (Figure, E-G) and reactive astrocytes was assessed in 1 field per cortical region containing the greatest density of immunoreactive structures magnified at \u03eb400. Five repeated measures on the same cortical strip by 2 investigators gave 10% or less difference for all measures with 5% or less difference between the mean score for 5 cortical strips."}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS", "text": "For the autopsy sample, analysis of clinical test scores gathered at the time of the case-control analysis was performed to see whether the AD cases taking NSAIDs performed better than those who did not. Examination of the neuropsychological tests scores for the participants has been previously published. 24 The cognitive tests were given either according to their standardized method of administration as published in the test manual or by protocols developed for the study. 24 Scores from multiple tests were grouped into the following cognitive domains: attention, language, memory, visuospatial, frontal-executive, apraxia, and agnosia. For the present study, test z scores for each domain were calculated from control values, and differences between AD cases either consuming or not consuming NSAIDs were examined by means of t tests (Levene's test for homogeneity at P\u03fd.05).\nPathological markers were analyzed to see whether cases taking NSAIDs had fewer pathological changes in the brain than those who did not take NSAIDs. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with diagnosis and NSAID usage as factors was used to evaluate differences in these variables. Variables tested included the areal fraction of diffuse plaques, neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, inflammatory microglia, and GFAP-positive astroctytes. Fisher protected least-square difference post hoc tests were used to identify the specific group or groups affected. P\u03fd.05 was accepted as the level of significance for all tests. used NSAIDs. 26 However, in these controls neither the level of plaques nor that of tangles within the brain was reduced. 26 Thus, the data suggest that the age-related increase in glial activation 20 can be alleviated by treatment with NSAIDs, but give no indication that the agerelated AD neuropathological changes can be stopped. The results of the present study provide direct evidence against the hypothesis that NSAIDs protect against the tissue changes of AD.\nThe patients in the present study were recruited for an alternative purpose, 11, 25 and hence sample bias is minimized to that associated with consent for autopsy. As with all long-term prospective studies, the number of cases consenting to autopsy and therefore available for postmortem analysis is relatively small. Our power calculations suggest that at least some pathological measures should have been reduced if the NSAIDs had a direct effect on the brain. Similar case numbers have been studied previously to show increased HLA-DR glia in AD, 7, 20, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] as seen in the present study. Thus, we believe the data are representative and provide compelling evidence that considerably more work is required to prove current assumptions associated with the underlying mechanisms of drug action in improving cognition in elderly patients.\nThe majority of data implicating NSAIDs as a viable treatment strategy for the prevention of AD has been gathered from cross-sectional epidemiological studies. 6 However, there are now data from 3 longitudinal studies analyzing the question of drug protection in AD. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging 5 examined 1686 people during a 5-year period for type and duration of anti-inflammatory medication use. Recruited volunteers were relatively young (younger than 65 years), with education levels higher than a college degree. Both of these factors decrease the risk of AD. 36 This study found a reduced risk of AD among those who consumed NSAIDs. Furthermore, it was observed that there was an increased protective effect, as indicated by a lower relative risk (0.40 for \u03fe2 years compared with 0.65 for \u03fd2 years), the longer NSAIDs were used. A similar lowering of risk (0.74) was observed in subjects who consumed aspirin, but not for those who consumed another analgesic without anti-inflammatory action. 5 The Medical Research Council Treatment Trial of Hypertension in Older Adults 37 examined NSAID usage and cognitive decline in 2651 subjects during a 4-to 5-year period. These volunteers averaged 70 \u00b1 3 (SD) years of age and had moderate hypertension and also relatively high premorbid intelligence. The results showed (1) a relatively small but significant protection against cognitive decline in those consuming NSAIDs and (2) that this effect was absent in people older than 74 years. The latter finding may explain the negative results obtained by Henderson and colleagues 38 in a study of 1045 Australians aged 70 years or older (mean age, 80 years). They found that neither NSAIDs nor aspirin provided protection against cognitive decline or incidence of dementia during a 3-to 4-year period. These longitudinal studies suggest that NSAIDs provide a modest protective effect against cognitive decline in some people younger than 75 years. The patients in the present study had a mean age of 78 years, and certain cognitive domains were improved by NSAID treatment compared with their nontreated counterparts. The similarity in underlying tissue damage in the brains of these patients suggests alternative mechanisms for any cognitive improvement.\nCognitive improvement with NSAID usage may occur via cerebrovascular mechanisms. Platelet fluidity increases the risk of AD, with the degree of cognitive impairment correlating with peripheral indexes of platelet activation. 39, 40 Platelet activation releases \u2424-amyloid, 41, 42 explaining some of the increase in plasma concentrations of \u2424-amyloid in AD. 43 Several laboratories have shown that an increase in the concentration of luminal \u2424-amyloid affects the blood-brain barrier and vascular reactivity. Both A\u24241-40 and A\u24241-42 vasoconstrict vascular smooth muscle cells. 44, 45 In vivo infusions of A\u24241-40 decrease blood flow and increase vascular resistance specifically in the brain. 46 These data suggest that increased platelet activation leads to a cascade of events that may contribute to the dementing process via cerebrovascular mechanisms.\nOverall, these studies suggest that alternative hypotheses exist for mechanisms of cognitive improvement with NSAIDs, particularly if cerebrovascular processes play a more significant role. Morphological and biochemical alterations to the cerebral vasculature could affect brain perfusion and blood-brain barrier permeability and thereby affect cognition. These factors appear to underlie the clinical effects observed with NSAID usage, rather than a direct action against pathological changes in the brain. Further studies are now required to test all possible hypotheses for drug action and further our understanding of any protective mechanisms against the disease process. \u2020Test scores of the control cases were used as part of a larger cohort to transform test scores of the patients into z scores. Differences between the groups of patients presented are highlighted."}]
