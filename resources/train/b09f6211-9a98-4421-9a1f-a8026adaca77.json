Some farmers, while heavily engaged in farming activities, may only generate low levels of output or sales. For example, establishing an apple orchard requires growing trees for several years before fruit harvesting can begin. Additionally, inclement weather or livestock diseases can cause substantial production losses. Farmers also may choose to place products into inventory rather than sell them.\nCalculating household incomes generates further concerns. Farmers with major recent expenses can have positive cash fl ows but negative net farm incomes. Additionally, off-farm income does not always indicate the household's level of involvement in agriculture. For example, almost 22 percent of operators with households generating at least $100,000 of off-farm income described their principal occupation as \"farm or ranch work.\" Off-farm businesses may also incur signifi cant expenses and losses that can lower total net off-farm incomes, reducing the household's apparent reliance on off-farm income. In 2006, roughly 14 percent of farm operators with off-farm income below $1,000 described their principal occupation as \"work other than farming/ranching,\" while another 11 percent considered themselves \"not in the paid workforce.\"\nSince the early 1980s, agricultural production has shifted dramatically to larger farms. As size increases, so does farm complexity, often leading to greater reliance on hired labor, rented equipment and land, and more intricate ownership arrangements. These trends have raised concerns among some that large, corporate farms are replacing the family farm and that farm program payments are not doing enough to preserve the family-farm structure of U.S. agriculture. Despite numerous organizations interpreting the term \"family farm\" differently, the majority of all U.S. farms, including some of the very largest farms, still qualify as family farms. Use of the screens discussed above could highlight potential confl icts between the goals of supporting family farms and restricting assistance to actively engaged farmers. Restricting Federal assistance only to those whose farm provided most of their household income could disqualify large shares of family farms from Federal aid (see table below)."}, {"section_title": "How various criteria would have affected Federal aid eligibility for family farms in 2006", "text": "If eligibility had been contingent on:\nShare of family farms that would have been disqualifi ed Share of family farm sales by the disqualifi ed group Farm income provides at least 50% of household income 82-87% 30-40%\nAnnual farm sales of at least $10,000 58-70% <4%\nAnnual off-farm income does not exceed $100,000 18-20% 10-15%"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Federal Government has long collected agricultural statistics. The fi rst Census of Agriculture was undertaken in 1840, laying the groundwork for the agricultural statistics that continue to be produced today. 1 Some statistics-such as crop acreage and production, livestock inventories and production, or farm revenues and expenses-are based on farm-level reports, and therefore require a farm defi nition. A broad defi nition, covering many businesses with very little farming activity, can provide a comprehensive accounting of aggregate land use and production. Narrower defi nitions may exclude businesses with limited farming activity, and may therefore provide less complete coverage of some aggregate statistics in favor of more focused coverage of entities with more substantial farming activity. Today, USDA uses a broad defi nition, defi ning a farm as any place that sells, or normally could sell, at least $1,000 of agricultural commodities.\nThe current USDA defi nition provides extensive coverage of the farm sector and yields a clear pattern throughout U.S. agriculture for most commodities: most farms are very small and the bulk of production occurs on large farms, which constitute a small share of all farms. For example, some cattle operations can feed 40,000 head at one time. However, data from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey show that most farms with cattle in 2006 had very few: an estimated 22 percent had fewer than 10 head on the farm, while another 24 percent reported 10-25 head.\nThat pattern is not limited to cattle. Although farms with 100-500 acres of corn accounted for 40 percent of the 2006 corn harvest, 2,000 farms harvested at least 2,000 acres of corn, while another 22,000 farms harvested 10 acres or less. Similarly, some fruit and vegetable farms harvested over 1,000 acres in 2006, and many had sales in the tens of millions of dollars. But most are much smaller: 80 percent of all fruit and vegetable operations harvested fewer than 50 acres. While those small farms generally had sales totaling less than $2,000, some small acreage operations grew high-value crops, such as herbs, generating sales in the millions of dollars.\nBroad coverage can easily mask underlying variation in agricultural production. If not used carefully, aggregate USDA statistics can lead to misleading representations of farm characteristics since farm-level averages are dominated by the many operations with limited production. To understand U.S. agriculture better, it is important to disaggregate the statistics and examine the heterogeneity of farms more closely."}, {"section_title": "Farm Defi nition Matters for Statistics and Federal Programs", "text": "The defi nition of a farm is important for farm statistics and for the design and delivery of farm programs. In 2006, farmers received close to $13 billion in various commodity program payments and another $3 billion in conservation payments, for a total of nearly $16 billion in direct payments from the Federal government. Farmers also received assistance from various indirect sources such as subsidized premiums for crop insurance, or credit assistance in the form of loan guarantees and subsidized interest rates for farm operating and ownership loans. Additionally, funding for agricultural research and extension services, as well as a handful of other Federal programs, is allocated across States in accordance with each State's share of the Nation's farm population. Rules must therefore be set to defi ne farms and farmers and to determine program eligibility.\nThe diversity of U.S. farms complicates agricultural statistics as well as the design of Federal farm programs. A substantial number of farms produce very little output or sales. Many farm households have a small commercial farm business, but draw the bulk of their income, and devote the majority of their time, to nonfarm employment. At the other end of the size spectrum, very large farms often have multiple stakeholders, including some owners or shareholders who may provide substantial capital, but little on-farm labor or management.\nPolicymakers realize that U.S. farms cover a wide range of entities, and have attempted to limit some Federal agricultural payments to those operated by individuals deemed \"actively engaged\" in farming. While the term \"actively engaged\" has been used by some government agencies as a very precise term with explicit specifi c applications toward policy goals, others (including policymakers) have used the term in a broader sense to capture the spirit of the level of involvement of an individual, household, or entity in farming. In this report, the term is used in the latter sense (see box \"What Does It Mean To Be \"Actively Engaged?\").\nIn an attempt to target commodity programs more effectively, legislators added eligibility restrictions to the 2008 Farm Act. Some aimed to exclude high-income individuals from participating in Federal farm programs. As defi ned, high-income individuals either generate average adjusted gross nonfarm income exceeding $500,000, or average adjusted gross farm income in excess of $750,000. Another provision excludes very small-scale operators. Beginning in the 2009 crop year, farmers with fewer than 10 base acres are barred from receiving direct, countercyclical, or average crop-election payments, unless the farmers qualify as either socially disadvantaged or limited-resource farmers. 2\nAlthough the income and base acre constraints were defi ned specifi cally to apply to direct Federal payments, since the limits remain high (for the income constraints) or low (for the base-acre constraints) the restrictions do not substantially limit eligibility. Some policymakers have sought to refi ne the idea of an \"actively engaged\" farmer.\n2 USDA defi nes a socially disadvantaged farmer, rancher, or agricultural producer as a member of a group whose members have been subjected to racial, ethnic, or gender prejudice due to belonging to the group, without taking into account the qualities of the individual. Groups that belong to this classifi cation include women, African Americans, American Indians, Alaskan natives, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and Pacifi c Islanders. In 2003, USDA defi ned limited-resource farmers as those with direct or indirect gross farm sales of not more than $100,000 in each of the previous 2 years (to be increased beginning in fi scal year 2004 to adjust for infl ation using NASS's Prices Paid by Farmer Index), and having a total household income at or below the national poverty level for a family of four or less than 50 percent of the median household income of the county in each of the previous 2 years. For example, in 2007 House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson called for eliminating \"nonfarmers\" from receiving Federal payments (Abbott, 2007) . He suggested raising the USDA sales limit used to defi ne a farm from the $1,000 limit currently in use to $10,000 or $50,000 (Good, 2008) . During the debate over the now-enacted 2008 Farm Act, Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) in December 2007 argued that Federal payments should be limited to more narrowly defi ned farmers, and proposed that Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) payments should be restricted to farmers who generated at least two-thirds of their income from agriculture (Congressional Record, 2007) . While these proposals surfaced in 2007, none of them were included in the 2008 Farm Act."}, {"section_title": "What Defi nes a Farm in USDA Statistics?", "text": "With the goal of capturing as much production as possible, the defi nition of a farm has changed multiple times since originally introduced. For the 1850 Census, a farm was defi ned as any establishment that sold at least $100 worth The term \"actively engaged\" has both general, and very specifi c, implications. Congress requires farmers to be actively engaged in farming to be eligible for certain farm programs (such as the Conservation Reserve Program or various commodity programs). Originally written into law in Section 1001A of the Food Security Act of 1985, the provisions establishing the term \"actively engaged\" have been amended through subsequent farm bills. Putting aside clauses for special classes of individuals, the term \"actively engaged\" applies to either individuals or entities. As currently amended, an individual (or entity) is considered actively engaged in farming if the person (entity) makes a signifi cant contribution (based on the total value of the farming operation) to the farming operation of capital, equipment, or land and a signifi cant contribution of personal labor or active management (and, in the case of an entity, the collective contribution of personal labor or active management must be signifi cant). Additionally, the individual's (entity's) share of profi ts/losses from the operation must be commensurate with the contributions of the individual (entity) to the farming operation. Finally, the individual's (entity's) contributions have to be deemed at risk, meaning that the individual (entity) would have to face the possibility of suffering a loss.\nAlthough codifi ed in law, these provisions in the current Farm Act remain relatively general in nature. In contrast, USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA), a program agency tasked with using these general guidelines to establish rules to create measurable standards to enact the provisions effectively, has much more specifi c criteria to identify those \"actively engaged\" in farming. As written in the FSA Handbook 1-PL, to be considered \"actively engaged,\" an individual is required to supply the lesser of 1,000 hours of labor per fi scal (or crop) year or half of the total hours necessary to conduct a farming operation comparable in size to the individual's (entity's) commensurate share in the farming operation. FSA imposes similarly specifi c restrictions on the contributions of capital, equipment, and land, while also helping to defi ne what constitutes active personal management (a much more diffi cult concept to quantify).\nMost generally, the term \"actively engaged\" encompasses the operator's level of involvement in the farming enterprise. Does the operator rely heavily on farming for a living? Does the operator devote a signifi cant amount of labor to the operation? Or is the farm more of a hobby enterprise than a profi toriented business? Policymakers are currently attempting to refi ne the broader defi nitions of a farmer to include a narrower, more measurable sense of \"active engagement\" to enable them to target some program payments more effectively. In this report, we use the most general sense of the term \"actively engaged.\"\nWhat Does It Mean To Be \"Actively Engaged?\" of agricultural goods. In 1870, a farm had to have at least $500 worth of sales or more than three acres of productive land. By 1900, sales and acreage limits were dropped. Instead, the entire time of at least one individual needed to be devoted to the farm during the year. In 1925, when the agriculture census began to be taken every 5 years instead of every 10, the defi nition of a farm reverted to using an acreage/sales screen combination, this time requiring at least three acres of productive land or $250 worth of agricultural sales.\nIn 1975, USDA, the Offi ce of Management and Budget (OMB), and the U.S. Department of Commerce's U.S. Census Bureau agreed on a defi nition of a farm that is still in use today. 3 \"A farm is currently defi ned, for statistical purposes, as any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural goods (crops or livestock) were sold or normally would have been sold during the year under consideration\" (Glossary, 2005) . USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) also includes government payments as sales. In other words, a farm is defi ned as any place with any combination of sales, potential sales, and government payments totaling at least $1,000.\nThe phrase \"normally would\" aims to ensure the inclusion of farms that do, or could, contribute to agricultural production, even if they did not have $1,000 in sales. Farms might experience adverse events, such as droughts, hurricanes, fi res, or disease that destroy the farm's production in a particular year (or several consecutive years). Some commodities require a long production cycle before sales are realized. For example, a new orchard will typically require several years before the trees mature and harvest can begin. Even for crops with annual production cycles, crops might be harvested and stored, with no sales recorded during a year. Current practice aims to include establishments with the capacity to realize at least $1,000 in revenues from any combination of government payments, cropland, and/or livestock activities.\nTo identify farms that could normally produce at least $1,000 worth of agricultural commodities, USDA uses a system that assigns specifi c point values for crop acreage and livestock inventory. Each assigned point represents $1 in potential sales; any establishment with 1,000 points ($1,000 of potential sales) is classifi ed as a farm. In USDA statistics, such places are called \"point farms\" and are numerous, since many places could produce $1,000 in sales from the cropland and livestock on the premises (see box, \"How Large Is a Point Farm?\"). Overall, using 2006 ARMS data, we estimate that there were approximately 440,000 point farms (over 20 percent of all farms). The newly released 2007 Census of Agriculture reports roughly 500,000 point farms. NASS created new methodologies to collect the data for this Census of Agriculture, designed to more accurately count small farms. While NASS believes that the new methodologies account for at least some of the increase in small farms reported, the new Census of Agriculture data suggest that almost 23 percent of all farms in the United States had the potential to generate at least $1,000 worth of agricultural sales, yet did not do so (USDA/NASS, 2009).\nDue to its broad, inclusive nature, the current USDA defi nition of a farm encompasses almost all organizations that produce agricultural goods, from small farms with very little or no production, to commercial farm businesses with sales in the millions of dollars. Such variation means that simple statistics of the agricultural sector can be misleading. Figures 1-7 show a range of farm sizes and provide a picture of farm structure useful for helping to refi ne the term \"actively engaged.\""}, {"section_title": "How Are U.S. Farms Characterized?", "text": "Each year, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and the Economic Research Service (ERS) jointly design and administer multiple surveys (collectively, the Agricultural Resource Management Survey, or ARMS) covering U.S. farming operations in the 48 contiguous States. The information in this report was obtained from the 2006 Phase III component of the survey, the most recent available data at the time the report was written. This survey collected detailed information relevant to the farm operation and the farm operator's household from 21,700 respondents. Additionally, the survey contains weights that take into account the sampling procedures used to create ARMS. These weights allow for the expansion of the data to estimate selected State and national level statistics. 4 We describe how: gross sales; cash expenses; farm, household, and operator characteristics; household income, including off-farm income; acres operated; government payments; and conservation practices vary across U.S. farms. In turn, these structural descriptors can help us evaluate the coverage offered by various farm criteria and defi nitions.\nSmall fi elds of crops or a few livestock animals allow agricultural operations to qualify as \"point\" farms under USDA's system. While hardly exhaustive, the following attributes would certify a rural establishment as a point farm in 2006: approximately 17 percent grow hay or grasses, including farmland 3. enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a program designed to take environmentally sensitive (e.g., highly erodible) land out of production a little more than 10 percent have a few acres of grains or 4. oilseeds 10 percent have sheep and goats 5.\nNote: The 2006 ARMS Phase III Survey Administration Manual contains information concerning point farm eligibility that allowed the calculation of these amounts of commodities."}, {"section_title": "How Large Is a Point Farm?", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sales", "text": "In 2006, the mean sales of all U.S. farms were approximately $106,000. However, because most farms are either very small or very large, very few farms actually had sales near this amount (fi g. 1). While half of all farms generated sales of $6,600 or less, fewer than 1 percent of all farms sold between $100,000 and $110,000 worth of goods.\nIn 2006, most farms did not produce or sell much output. Almost 1.2 million operations (nearly 58 percent of all farms) had sales of less than $10,000 each, together producing only 1.5 percent of total farm sales in the U.S. (table 1) . More than one in three of these farms were point farms, with less than $1,000 in sales.\nAnother 385,000 farms generated sales between $10,000 and $50,000. Despite relatively low levels of individual sales, farms in this sales class generated approximately $8 billion in total sales, or close to 4 percent of all agricultural sales in 2006. 5 By contrast, just 1.7 percent of all farms generated nearly half of all agricultural sales in 2006. Fewer than 10 percent of farms sold at least $250,000 worth of agricultural goods in 2006, yet these farms produced more than 75 percent of all U.S. gross agricultural sales."}, {"section_title": "Expenses", "text": "To run the farm, operators incur many different costs including livestock and feed purchases, seed, fertilizer, and chemicals expenses, along with labor, fuel, maintenance, and utility costs and other miscellaneous expenses.

Together with taxes, interest and insurance expenses, and rental and lease 5 A farm with sales between $10,000 and $50,000 is a fairly small operation. For example, at 2006 prices and yields, 143 acres of winter wheat would garner sales of $25,000. Similarly, 95 acres of soybeans or 52 acres of corn (for grain) would also generate $25,000 in sales. In terms of livestock, 264 head of hogs or 24 head of beef cattle at 2006 prices would be worth $25,000. Since managing these small operations does not require 2,000 hours of labor over a year, this implies that a substantial number of operators farm on a part-time basis.

USDA farm statistics aim to track aggregate expenses at the national and State levels.\nIn 2006, point farms incurred nearly 3 percent of all U.S. cash expenses (fi g. 2, table 1). Most of the more than 440,000 farms falling in this category had very little, if any, production, and on average incurred few expenses. Despite selling very little, however, a substantial number did generate signifi cant expenses. About one out of every three point farms incurred at least $10,000 worth of expenses. 6 Some of these operations, like those establishing orchards, expect to generate far more than $1,000 in sales in the future.\nFarms with less than $10,000 in sales-including point farms-incurred 7.5 percent of all cash expenses in the United States; farms selling less than $50,000 incurred 13.8 percent of all U.S. cash expenses. Even though contributing very little to the overall sales of agricultural products in the United States, these farms did contribute substantially to the costs incurred by the sector. Some of these farms may have large expenses relative to their sales (including the point farms) in an effort to take advantage of tax lawsincurring large costs to shield some (or all) of their income from taxation (Durst and Monke, 2001 )."}, {"section_title": "Occupation and labor allocation", "text": "While farm sales can vary widely from one farm to the next, individuals do not necessarily consider themselves farmers based on the level of sales they generate on the farm. One way to explore this issue is to look at self-reported data concerning occupation and labor allocation.\nAbout 25 percent of operators on farms generating less than $10,000 in sales considered farming their primary occupation in 2006 (fi g. 3, table 1), while 8 percent of operators on farms generating less than $10,000 in sales reported spending at least 2,000 hours of labor on the operation during the 6 Of these farms, a small number (estimated at 3,800) had expenses between $50,000 and $100,000 while an additional few (2,100 operations) incurred expenses in excess of $100,000.

On farms generating at least $50,000 in sales, the operator typically considered farming as the primary occupation and reported working at least 2,000 hours on the farm during the year."}, {"section_title": "How much do different households rely on farm income?", "text": "Farm households with low levels of agricultural sales tend to report relatively high levels of off-farm income. However, households associated with farms generating the very highest levels of agricultural sales often generate offfarm income as well.\nOperators and their households can generate off-farm income from both earned and unearned sources. Earned off-farm income comes from selfemployment or wages and salaries at a job unrelated to the farm. Households obtain off-farm unearned income from passive income sources unrelated to their farming enterprise, such as Social Security or interest earnings. Total household income combines earned and unearned incomes with the household's net income (revenues minus costs) derived from the farming operation. 8\nFarm households selling less than $50,000 worth of agricultural goods had mean off-farm income exceeding $70,000, while households of the largest farms (those with sales above $250,000) averaged between $50,000 and $60,000 in off-farm income (fi g. 4, table 2). More signifi cantly, the share of off-farm income from earned sources dropped as farms increased in size. The average amount of earned off-farm income for farm households with less than $50,000 in sales was almost twice the amount of earned off-farm income generated by the households of the largest farms in 2006. This is likely due to the fact that as farms grow (both in size and complexity), the 7 The ARMS questionnaire asks the principal operator how many hours, on average, the respondent worked on the farm per week for each of the four quarters of the year (January through March, April through June, July through September, and October through December). Adding up the hours per week provided the values shown in table 1. 8 The ARMS survey contains several questions concerning the off-farm income of the principal operator.\nRespondents were asked to enter value codes representing ranges of income that corresponded to the income they derived from any sources not affi liated with their operation. Midpoints of each range were subsequently used for each value code to obtain estimates for each variable. Earned off-farm income was calculated using responses concerning any off-farm businesses of the members of the operator's household during the year and from any wages or salaries earned from any off-farm jobs. Respondents were also asked to enter value codes for any unearned income, consisting of any passive income sources such as interest, dividends, Social Security, etc. operators, and perhaps other household members, have to devote more time to running the farm business, leaving less time to earn wages or generate revenues off the farm. Reported labor hours in the ARMS data suggest this trend as well. As farm size increases from small farms to those producing at least $100,000 in sales, operators tend to spend more hours working on the farm. Their spouses also appear to increase their on-farm labor as farm size increases. Hours spent earning off-farm income decrease steadily for operators, and more slowly for their spouses, as farm size increases.\nHouseholds of the largest farms relied more on farm income than did the households of smaller farms (fi g. 5, table 2). In fact, more than 58 percent of the commercial farm households (those with farms selling $250,000 or more) earned at least half of their income from farming. In contrast, a large majority of low-sales operators did not rely upon farming for any of their income at Off-farm income, 2006 all. Over two-thirds of farm households with less than $50,000 in agricultural sales incurred losses from farming. 9 Furthermore, an additional 20 percent of farm households in this sales category derived less than one quarter of their income from their farming operation.\nHowever, off-farm income does remain important even for those associated with commercial farms. More than one in four commercial farm households obtained over half of their household income from off-farm sources. Losses from farming and negative household income are not uncommon, even for operators of the very largest farms. More than one in fi ve farms with at least $500,000 in sales either had negative household income or incurred losses from farming, as had one-quarter of all farms with sales between $250,000 and $500,000 in 2006. Bad weather, pests, and diseases can ruin crops and sicken livestock, which can dramatically lower gross income. In addition, farmers can make voluntary choices that alter their reported gross income. Examples include increasing inventories by delaying sales of goods produced 9 Operators can use depreciation expenses to offset income for tax purposes. If high enough, depreciation expenses can cause some farms to claim losses from farming during a year, even if revenues cover all operating costs. In 2006, 18 percent of farms with sales between $10,000 and $50,000 had depreciation expenses that outweighed their revenues, as did 11 percent of farms with sales between $1,000 and $10,000. Fewer than 1 percent of farms with sales below $1,000 had depreciation expenses larger than their net cash farm income, which could be due to the fact that many of these small farms may not qualify as a business for Internal Revenue Service purposes.

In contrast, farms with sales of at least $250,000 produced the bulk of U.S. agricultural output on just over 40 percent of all acres operated.\nRelative to the distribution of sales, acres operated are distributed much more evenly across all farm size classes for at least four reasons:\nLarge livestock operations such as feedlots and operations producing 1.\nhogs, dairy products, eggs, or broilers (among other types) tend to confi ne their animals and use purchased feed, meaning that many do not use much land to produce large volumes of sales.\nModestly sized livestock operations often specialize in the production 2.\nof calves, horses, or sheep or goats, and are more likely to graze their livestock rather than confi ne them.

Operators often enroll entire fi elds in CRP, and can own more acres than their limited sales and expenses would suggest. 10\nOwnership of land may be the primary goal of many small/medium sized 4.\nfarms, rather than farm income.\nWhile acres operated are distributed fairly evenly across sales categories, acres owned are distributed more evenly still. In fact, farms with less than $10,000 in sales tend to own more land than they operate, choosing to rent a Figure 6 Acres operated, portion of their land to other operations. Farmers of larger operations, generally requiring larger amounts of land for production, often rent land from others. On average, farmers with at least $250,000 in sales in 2006 owned less than half the land they operated.\nAgain, however, aggregate statistics can prove misleading. While aggregate acres owned or operated are relatively evenly distributed across farm sales classes, the median number of acres operated differs dramatically. Half of farms with sales between $10,000 and $50,000 operated fewer than 164 acres, while half of farms with between $250,000 and $500,000 in agricultural sales operated more than 825 acres.

Commodity payments in particular tend to refl ect production volumes for program commodities (largely feed and food grains, cotton, and oilseeds). As a result, larger farms producing greater volumes of program commodities tend to receive higher levels of commodity payments. In 2006, operations generating over $250,000 worth of sales collected the bulk of commodity-related government payments.\nDespite increases in working-land program budgets, in 2006 conservation payments consisted mostly of CRP payments-a program designed to retire environmentally sensitive cropland from production (see box, \"Farm Program Payments: Types and Data Source\"). Many CRP participants enroll a signifi cant portion, if not all, of their cropland into CRP, yet are still counted as farms by USDA because government payments are counted as farm sales under the farm defi nition. These farms focus on the production of environmental benefi ts and have little or no production of farm commodities, so the bulk of their farm income comes from CRP payments. As such, operations selling less than $50,000 received most of the conservation-related government payments (fi g. 7).\nOverall, farms generating at least $250,000 in sales collected just over 53 percent of all government payments, while those farms generating less than $50,000 in sales collectively received approximately 18 percent.

Since ARMS contacts only farm operators, however, it excludes the payments made to people who do not farm, mainly nonoperator landlords."}, {"section_title": "What Kinds of Screens Might Capture Active Farming?", "text": "The current, broad defi nition of a farm encompasses a very diverse group of businesses, where many operators do not allocate large quantities of their labor to the farm, and most operations do not generate large amounts of output. Some policymakers have recently proposed redefi ning what qualifi es as a farm (Abbott, 2007; Congressional Record, 2007; Good, 2008) . The proposals defi ne eligibility requirements for a particular government program or defi ne eligibility across all government programs.\nWhile some proposals would restrict the farm defi nition for NASS's Census of Agriculture and for Federal agricultural programs, these can represent confl icting goals. A broad defi nition for the Census could be desirable in order to capture the bulk of agriculture, while it might be desirable to funnel program funds toward a much narrower, targeted population. There may be unintended costs if the same population is targeted for both data collection and for all program purposes since different considerations may apply to the two goals (and to different programs). In each case, the careful identifi cation of the desired population becomes important.\nCommon to the proposals is the view that Federal support of the agricultural community should go to those who are actively engaged in farming. Some policymakers aim to refi ne the term \"actively engaged\" to identify more precisely the segments of the farm population to which they wish to provide support.\nVarious screens have been proposed, but to be useful, they need to be easy to use and verifi able to facilitate implementation and ensure that the intended recipients of any targeted Federal funds are not unintentionally excluded from eligibility. The administration of certain programs already requires that farmers, to establish their fi nancial history, must supply IRS income tax records at State and county offi ces. A similar requirement could be used to establish the proposed screens examined here. 11 For example, IRS Schedule F, titled \"Profi t or Loss From Farming,\" (fi led by sole proprietorships) contains information on agricultural sales and expenses (fi g. 8), and when combined with information on other tax forms (for example, U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns contain off-farm income information), can provide a measure of the relative importance of off-farm income to the household. 12 County offi ce program managers could require farmers to bring in their fi led tax forms to help determine a farmer's active engagement in agriculture. Possible screens that make use of information readily available from tax forms include farm sales, the share of income from farming, and off-farm income streams. 13 A screen such as farmer occupation and/or labor allocation, despite being a convenient way to categorize farmers that closely approximates the ideas behind the defi nition of \"actively engaged,\" is selfreported and therefore not easily verifi able by program managers, reducing their value for program targeting purposes. 11 USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) requires that farmers supply their last 3 years of farm fi nancial records, including tax returns, to qualify for a loan (see Handbook 3-FLP page 3-6). Furthermore, tax returns are used to screen for beginning farmers, limited-resource farmers, and for offfarm income. 12 Similarly, if a farm is organized as a partnership rather than a sole proprietorship, IRS Form 1065 would be appropriate. IRS Form 1120 and 1120S pertain to a farm organized as a C-or S-corporation respectively. 13 Note that tax rules may distort some of what policymakers or program managers wish to measure. For example, rules concerning cash accounting, capital expensing, and other farm deductions may reduce net incomes for tax purposes (Durst and Monke, 2001) ."}, {"section_title": "Figure 8 IRS Schedule F, Profi t or Loss From Farming, page 1 Exploring Alternative Farm Defi nitions / EIB-49", "text": "Economic Research Service/USDA"}, {"section_title": "Farm Sales", "text": "One way to measure active engagement in agriculture is to examine the level of sales during the year. Generally speaking, those with high levels of sales are more likely to be heavily involved in farming than those with low sales. Exceptions do exist, though, especially among those considered beginning, limited-resource, or socially disadvantaged farmers. 14 USDA actively works to provide assistance to farmers in these classes to promote equity. If a farm sales screen were adopted, the typical sales generated from farms run by beginning, limited-resource, or socially disadvantaged farmers could easily disqualify them from receiving Federal support.\nAccording to 2006 ARMS data, operations selling at least $10,000 worth of agricultural products accounted for a little over 42 percent of all U.S. farms, 98.5 percent of all agricultural sales, and received 93 percent of all government payments. Nearly 75 percent of farms with operators who allocate at least 1,500 hours to the farm produce sales of at least $10,000. In contrast, approximately one out of every four operations with either a socially disadvantaged operator or limited-resource operator generates sales above $10,000 (table 3) . Using a higher cutoff (operations with at least $50,000 in sales), while accounting for only 24 percent of farms, still captures an estimated 94 percent of all agricultural sales and nearly 82 percent of all government payments in 2006. However, this higher cutoff only captured about half of all operations where the principal operator spent at least 1,500 hours on the farm and included less than 6 percent of operations run by limited-resource and just over 11 percent of the farms run by socially disadvantaged operators. 14 A beginning operator has fewer than 10 years' experience running a farm. A socially disadvantaged operator is either female and/or belongs to one of the following groups: African Americans, American Indians, Alaskan natives (Native Americans), Hispanics, Asian Americans, or Pacifi c Islanders. Finally, a limited-resource operator must have earned less than $115,600 (2006 dollars) and had household income below the national poverty level for a family of four, or the household income was below the county median household income in the previous 2 years. While a \"farm sales\" screen may be useful as a rough gauge for involvement and is easily implemented, it has drawbacks. A small but substantial number of actively engaged farm households with production or investment but no sales (e.g., orchards) would be screened out. For example, an estimated 7 percent of all point farms in 2006 (approximately 31,000 farms) had little or no sales yet produced goods valued between $1,000 and $10,000. Moreover, a further estimated 1,645 farms with few, if any, sales produced goods valued above $10,000. 15\nA sales screen can be used for several purposes. It can be used as a screen that can help refi ne the actively engaged standard adopted in the 2008 Farm Act to help target Federal monies to the farm population. It is also currently (and has been historically) the backbone of the USDA farm defi nition. For nearly half of the States in the Nation, using a farm defi nition based on $10,000 in sales would induce less than a 0.2-percent change in their share of farms. However, some States would experience much larger changes, with implications for the amount of Federal funds available to them for certain programs (fi g. 9). For example, Texas and Tennessee would each see their share of U.S. farms drop by just over 3 percent and more than 1.5 percent, respectively. By contrast, Iowa would fi nd its share increased by over 2 percent, while Nebraska, Illinois, and California would all experience increases in their share of farms by more than 1 percent. Some Federal programs also use the State shares of farm population to distribute funds in a similar fashion to that used with the State share of farm numbers. Very similar, although not identical, results follow from using the farm population instead of number of farms. Over half of the States in the Nation would experience changes in their share of farm population of more than 0.2 percent. Texas and Tennessee would lose almost 2 percent and just over 1 percent, respectively. Iowa would gain the largest share, at almost 2 percent of the farm population, while Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin would all experience increases greater than 1 percent in their relative share of the farming population (fi g. 10)."}, {"section_title": "Share of Income From Farming", "text": "If policymakers are concerned about sending Federal funds to operators not actively engaged in farming, one option is to make those operators who do not think of themselves primarily as farmers and do not devote many hours to farming ineligible for payments. However, occupation title and labor hours are self-reported and therefore cannot be easily verifi ed.\nHousehold income, on the other hand, can be checked using Federal tax forms. Therefore, the importance of farm income to the overall household income of the operator has been proposed as an alternative way to measure active engagement.\nUsing a screen based on the share of household income from farming, however, may be a poor proxy for the level of involvement in farming, and could exclude a substantial portion of U.S. production. For example, only The chart shows the change in a State's share of U.S. farms if farms were defined with a $10,000 instead of a $1,000 cutoff. Only States with a change of at least 0.2 percentage points are shown."}, {"section_title": "Figure 10", "text": "The 7 percent of all farm households derived at least three-quarters of their income from farming, while generating about one-third of all farm sales (table 2) . Collectively, these households received 28 percent of all government payments. This screen would capture almost 16 percent of those operations where the operator allocated at least 1,500 hours of labor to the farm, 1 percent of all beginning farmers, approximately 6 percent of all limitedresource operations, and less than 4 percent of farms run by those operators considered socially disadvantaged.\nReducing the threshold to those households that generated at least half of their income from farming does not radically alter the picture. Only 12 percent of all farm households generated at least half of their income from farming. This includes almost 1 out of every 4 farms with operators who spend at least 1,500 hours on the farm, as well as 6 percent of all beginning farmers, and just over 7 percent of all farms run by limited-resource and socially disadvantaged operators (table 3) . As a group, farms operated by households earning more than half of their income from farming produced less than half of all U.S. agricultural sales and received 41 percent of all government payments in 2006.\nMany farm households that would appear to be actively engaged in farming by most standards would not be considered active using a screen that required that at least 50 percent of their income come from farming. In large part, this has to do with the complex interplay between actual production and what the farm household claims as income. A household may have a reduced (and even negative) share of income from farming for several reasons. For some, operating expenses could have been unexpectedly high. For others, decisions to increase their inventories rather than sell their goods could have reduced their revenues. Still others may have made recent substantial investments in capital equipment that could allow them to report signifi cant capital depreciation expenses, reducing their net taxable income from farming. This issue becomes even more transparent if we focus on only the very largest farms, those with at least $500,000 in sales. About one in fi ve farms selling at least $500,000 of agricultural products incurred losses during 2006, which would immediately disqualify the households associated with them from being considered actively engaged in farming using the \"share of income\" screen, despite the fact that they generated a large volume of sales during the year (table 2). Another 15 percent of these households had positive household income but derived more than half of their income from off-farm sources. Overall, using a \"50 percent of income from farming\" screen, 35 percent of the very largest farm households would be considered not actively engaged in farming. This pattern is not restricted to just the very largest farms; using the \"50 percent of income from farming\" screen, the households of almost half of all farms with sales between $175,000 and $500,000 would also be considered not actively engaged in farming. If such a screen were applied, a large number of farm households representing a signifi cant portion of total U.S. agricultural output would become ineligible for farm program funds.\nAdditionally, if a \"percent of income from farming sources\" screen were used, it might discourage farm households from diversifying into nonfarm activities. Such disincentives could imperil the overall success of the farm and nearby communities, especially rural communities with a large number of farm households."}, {"section_title": "Off-Farm Income", "text": "A third type of screen, \"level of off-farm income,\" has been proposed to try to exclude individuals with high off-farm income from receiving Federal funding. While this type of screen directly assesses the individual's need for assistance (if off-farm income is very high, presumably the individual would not require Federal assistance), it also can proxy for level of engagement in agriculture. Generating earned off-farm income requires spending time in nonagricultural pursuits and, in general, the higher the off-farm income, the less time is available for the farm operation.\nSelf-reported occupation status can provide a rough proxy for how the operator chooses to spend time, either in on-or off-farm pursuits. Less than one in four farmers with off-farm income greater than $100,000 considered farming as their primary occupation. By contrast, 78 percent of those earning below $10,000 in off-farm income and one out of every two operators generating between $10,000 and $50,000 in off-farm income considered themselves farmers.\nOperators of farms with sales of at least $100,000 are more likely to be considered actively engaged in farming than farmers of smaller operations. Households of farms that generate sales of $100,000 or more also earn an approximate mean off-farm income of $50,000. If an off-farm income screen of $50,000 were used in 2006, operations where households earned less than $50,000 in off-farm income accounted for nearly 48 percent of all farms, generated 73 percent of all sales, and received 70 percent of all government payments. This included more than 60 percent of all farms where the operator worked at least 1,500 hours on the farm, but only 6 percent of all beginning farmers. It also included over 99 percent of all limited-resource farmers and just over half of all socially disadvantaged farmers (table 3 ). If the screen were set to exclude only those who generated more than $100,000 in offfarm income, in 2006 this would have excluded the households of 18 percent of all farms that generated 10 percent of agricultural sales and received 12 percent of all government payments.\nOf the farms run by operators who allocated at least 1,500 labor hours to the farm, nearly 88 percent would be captured using the higher valued screen of $100,000. This elevated screen also captured almost two-thirds of all beginning operators, virtually all limited-resource operators, and more than 80 percent of all farms run by socially disadvantaged operators. Finally, those households generating at least $250,000 in off-farm income represented only 2 percent of all farms and generated only 2 percent of all sales, while collecting only 2 percent of all government payments. At the higher off-farm income cutoffs, few farm households are excluded, while at lower off-farm income cutoffs, substantial levels of production are excluded (over onequarter of all production is excluded at the $50,000 cutoff), implying that, at the $50,000 cutoff, some farm households with signifi cant agricultural activity would be excluded from Federal programs.\nThe 2008 Farm Act includes an off-farm income screen to limit Federal payments to those who earned more than $500,000 in average adjustable gross nonfarm income. Very few farm households earned such large amounts of off-farm income.\nSelf-reported employment categories do not necessarily capture engagement in farming. Most farmers who earned low off-farm income in 2006 did consider themselves farmers and appeared to be actively engaged in farming. However, a full 14 percent of farmers earning less than $1,000 in off-farm income considered their occupation something other than farming, while another 11 percent stated that they were not in the paid workforce. An additional 6 percent of operators whose households earned between $1,000 and $10,000 in off-farm income, and 30 percent of operators whose households earned between $10,000 and $50,000 in off-farm income did not consider themselves farmers when asked their occupation in 2006. In other words, despite earning relatively low levels of off-farm income, a large number of households may still not be actively engaged in farming. Policymakers and program managers using such a screen may continue to fail to target their intended recipients with Federal program funds. Additionally, an off-farm income screen might create incentives for farmers to hide off-farm income to become eligible for Federal funding.\nWhile all of the three screens (sales, the portion of total household income coming from off-farm sources, and total off-farm income) would be relatively easy to implement, the drawbacks associated with them imply that care needs to be taken to ensure that those designated as \"actively engaged\" do, in fact, match policymakers' intended recipients. Additionally, these screens may not work well if program goals include issues such as environmental improvement or help for beginning farmers rather than just ensuring that Federal assistance accrues to those who are actively engaged in agriculture. Alternative program goals may require targeting users of land and water resources or a more thorough examination of farming activity.\nAnother key concern is how the screens might affect family farms, an integral part of our Nation's agricultural sector. Part of the diffi culty assessing such a concern stems from the lack of a widely held, precise defi nition of a family farm. There are many ways to defi ne a family farm, and various organizations within the United States defi ne them differently."}, {"section_title": "Family Farm Defi nitions", "text": "The family farm has long held a dominant place in U.S. agriculture. According to ERS, most production occurs on family farms. Some USDA programs are designed explicitly to support and encourage the growth of family farms, such as the Direct Operating Loans, Direct Ownership Loans, and Emergency Farm Loans administered by FSA. 16 Additionally, some observers have argued that the family organization of farms has been an important reason for the superior performance of U.S. agriculture (Gardner, 2002) .\nDespite their central role in farm policy, legislators have not formally defi ned family farms, and various institutions, organizations, and researchers employ different defi nitions of a family farm. Many equate family farms with small, limited production farms, while associating the larger farms that generate 16 FSA defi nes family farms differently than ERS. Under FSA's defi nition, in addition to making the business decisions, the family must be recognized by the community as running a farm and the farm must produce goods in suffi cient quantities so that it is recognized as a farm rather than a rural residence. Furthermore, the amount of labor provided to the farm must be signifi cant and provided mostly by the family.\nthe bulk of production with corporate, nonfamily interests. \"The legendary 'family farm' is largely as quaint as Grant Wood's 1930 painting, 'American Gothic.' While mom-and-pop farms remain, most U.S. agriculture involves corporate mega-farms rather than pitchforks, barns and overalls,\" Deroy Murdock of Scripps News noted (Murdock, 2008) .\nOther observers have weighed in with similar outlooks. \"Federal farm policies specifi cally bypass family farmers,\" Heritage Foundation budget analyst Brian Riedl noted in 2007. He also stated, \"Subsidies are paid per acre, so the largest (and most profi table) agribusinesses automatically receive the biggest checks,\" and agricultural government payments amount to the \"largest corporate welfare program maintained by the Federal Government\" (Riedl, 2007; Riedl, 2002) . Similarly, Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said, \"Family farms are really getting peanuts under the current system, while corporate agriculture is living high on the hog.\" (Groppe, 2007) .\nAs a result of the many defi nitions surrounding family farms, public perceptions of the family farm remain rather vague. In contrast, ERS defi nes a family farm rather specifi cally-operator ownership and control determine family farm status. ERS designates a family farm as any farm where the operator, and individuals related to the operator by blood, marriage, or adoption, own more than 50 percent of the business.\nThe ERS defi nition captures a very broad range of farms. An operator who owns the entire farm business clearly qualifi es as a family farm. However, an operator whose family owns 51 percent of the farm business also qualifi es under the ERS defi nition, even though the operator may choose to incorporate and fi nd investors. 17 ERS's defi nition of family farms includes sole proprietorships, partnerships, and even corporations, as long as the principal operator's family owns more than half of the farm business. Only farms with ownership that is separate from management (a hired manager runs the farm), partnerships and cooperatives among unrelated people, and operations organized as estates, trusts, grazing associations, and corporations with dispersed ownership do not qualify as family farms.\nIn 2006, ERS identifi ed 97 percent of all farms in the U.S. as family farms, including 92 percent of farms with agricultural sales of $250,000 or more. These farms generated 84 percent of total U.S. agricultural sales. Nonfamily farms accounted for only 1 to 11 percent of U.S. farms, depending on the sales class (fi g. 11, table 1).\nIt is not surprising that almost all U.S. farms qualify as family farms. The Small Business Administration identifi es over 97 percent of all U.S. fi rms as small businesses (defi ned as businesses with less than $750,000 in sales in a year). Overall, families run most small businesses in the United States."}, {"section_title": "Alternative Family Farm Criteria", "text": "To defi ne a family farm, ERS requires that the operator's family own more than 50 percent of the business. ARMS also collects data on whether the principal operator's household (those living in the operator's housing unit) Exploring Alternative Farm Defi nitions / EIB-49\nEconomic Research Service/USDA owns the entire business. This information is used to gauge how sensitive the farm coverage is to variation in share of ownership of the family farm.\nOther groups use alternative defi nitions of the family farm, often imposing explicit or implicit size constraints. The National Family Farm Coalition requires that \"the family provides the vast majority of labor and management decisions.\" 18 The Ohio Family Farm Coalition calls for \"the farm's ownership, assets, management, and major decisions [to be] controlled by at least one family member on the farm.\" 19 Researchers have weighed in with their own defi nitions. Daniel Sumner proposed that either the operator generate a signifi cant portion of household income or that the operator's primary occupation lie in the agricultural sector, while no more than three extended families can run the operation and the farm must provide at least half-time employment for an individual (Sumner, 1985) . Breimyer and Frederick (1981) required that a family farm must supply more labor than it hires, must own some of the land operated, and cannot employ production contracts, since they limit managerial discretion. 20 Finally, World Hunger Year (WHY), an organization with the stated aim of fi ghting hunger and poverty, requires that a family farm operate fewer than 1,000 acres and not qualify as a confi ned animal feeding operation (CAFO). 21 Overall, three criteria appear consistently in these alternative defi nitions of the family farm: labor, land ownership, and size restrictions.\nERS's family farm defi nition can be compared with the defi nition that states the operator's household must own 100 percent of the business. In addition, by imposing household labor supply restrictions, land ownership requirements, and explicit size limitations, we can explore how the ERS classifi cation of farms and sales into either family or nonfamily farms would be altered (table 4, fi g. 12). The proposed screens (sales, off-farm income share of total household income, and off-farm income screens) can then be compared with the various family farm defi nitions to explore the screens' coverage of family farms."}, {"section_title": "Figure 11", "text": "How many farms were nonfamily farms in 2006? According to the ERS definition, very few farms qualify as nonfamily farms, ranging from roughly 1 percent of the smallest farms to approximately 11 percent of the largest. 18 For more details on the National Family Farm Coalition, see http://www. nffc.net/learn/page-learn.html. 19 For the Ohio Family Farm Coalition statement, see http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/2727. 20 For more details, see http://extension.missouri.edu/xplor/agguides/agecon/g00820.htm. 21 For more details, see http://www. yhunger.org/programs/fslc/topics/ family-farms.html.\nIf the principal operator's household must own the entire farm business to qualify as a family farm, the percent of all farms defi ned as family farms would drop from 97 percent to 89 percent, inducing a 24-percentage-point shift in sales of all agricultural goods from family to nonfamily farms in 2006. As farm size increases, fewer farm households own the entire operation.\nUnder some of the defi nitions noted previously, the operator and the spouse must provide at least half the labor on a farm for the farm to be considered a family farm. This would place strict limits on the size of labor-intensive operations (e.g., fruit and vegetable farms and some livestock operations such as dairies and hog operations). As a result, such labor restrictions would focus heavily on smaller farms, inducing a substantial drop in both the number of farms qualifying as family farms and the sales generated by family farms. The ERS defi nition combined with this labor criterion means that roughly 87 percent of all farms would qualify as family farms. In 2006, those farms generated an estimated 44 percent of all U.S. agricultural sales. Comparable, but slightly steeper, drops occur using the alternative defi nition (100-percent ownership of farm by the operator's household) combined with this labor criterion.\nLand-ownership restrictions constrain the size of the family farm under some defi nitions-not many families with very large farms own all of the land they farm, nor would it necessarily be wise to pursue such an undiversifi ed investment strategy. Families associated with smaller operations often own more of their land and tend to rent land to, rather than from, others. Younger farmers, particularly those involved in growing fi eld crops, would be penalized by such land-ownership restrictions as they are less likely to have accumulated enough wealth to purchase costly farmland and often rent most, if not all, of the land they operate.\nIf a farm operator's household must own at least 75 percent of the land it operates and 50 percent of the farm business to qualify as a family farm, roughly 69 percent of farms in the country would be classifi ed as family farms, generating one-third of all agricultural sales.

The next defi nition explicitly introduces size constraints by restricting family farms from operating 1,000 acres or more and eliminates any farm that qualifi es as a confi ned animal feeding operation (CAFO). 22 ARMS does not collect much of the information required to identify CAFOs. 23 A farm is therefore conservatively defi ned as a CAFO if it has at least 700 milk cows, 2,000 cattle, 10,000 hogs, or 125,000 birds.\nUnder the ERS defi nition, combined with the 1,000 acres and/or CAFO restriction, almost 90 percent of all U.S. farms still qualify as family farms, but these farms only generate approximately 40 percent of total U.S. agricultural sales. Under the alternative defi nition (the household owns the entire business) combined with the size and CAFO criteria, an estimated 83 percent of farms qualifi ed as family farms, producing just over one-third of all agricultural sales. While adding explicit size limits to the family farm defi nition does not reclassify many farms as nonfamily farms, the largest farms in terms of total production become classifi ed as nonfamily farms, indicating that this screen assigns a much larger share of production to nonfamily farms."}, {"section_title": "The Screens and Family Farm Defi nitions", "text": "Given the central place that family farms hold in U.S. farm policy, how would they fare under the \"actively engaged\" screens discussed previously? The different family farm defi nitions explored give rise to different distributions of family versus nonfamily farms ( 22 To qualify as a confi ned animal feeding operation (CAFO), an operation must confi ne animals in an area with no vegetation for at least 45 days in a 12-month period. Sheer numbers determine if an operation qualifi es as a large CAFO. Medium CAFOs confi ne fewer head of livestock, but to be designated as such, must also have either a manmade conveyance to surface waters or a stream running through the confi nement area that could allow pollutants to contaminate surface waters. Small CAFOs, by contrast, must be designated as such by the permitting authority.\nIf program eligibility required 50 percent or more of total household income to be generated on the farm, almost 21 percent of all farms-accounting for over three-quarters of all agricultural sales-would have qualifi ed for Federal aid in 2006. While roughly 13 to 18 percent of all farms would have qualifi ed as eligible family farms using either the ERS, the labor, or the CAFO defi nition of a family farm, the percent of sales generated by eligible family farms under these alternative defi nitions differs widely. Under the ERS defi nition, 60 percent of all U.S. agricultural sales would have been from eligible family farms in 2006, while the production of eligible family farms under the labor and CAFO defi nitions would have accounted for roughly one-quarter of all U.S. agricultural sales. Again, the land defi nition has the most pronounced effects, with nearly 9 percent of all farms as family farms that obtained at least half of their income from the farm business, producing roughly 23 percent of all U.S. agricultural sales. Increasing the amount of income that must come from the farm to 75 percent of total household income would have small effects, especially for nonfamily farms, with the land defi nition classifying the fewest as eligible family farms. Note: ERS defi nition of a family farm requiring family ownership and control of the operation underlies each family farm defi nition outlined above. For example, the labor defi nition (the operator and spouse provide at least half of labor on the farm) is in addition to requiring that more than 50 percent of the farm business is owned by those related through blood, marriage, or adoption to the principal operator. Land and CAFO defi nitions are similar.\nSource: USDA, Agricultural Resource Management Survey, 2006. Finally, if Federal aid eligibility required that the farm household generate less than $100,000 in off-farm income, 82 percent of all U.S. farms would have qualifi ed for assistance in 2006. But again, the split between family and nonfamily farms varies considerably depending on the defi nition of a family farm. Under this screen, the labor and the CAFO defi nitions reclassify a relatively few, larger farms as nonfamily farms. While between 70 and 80 percent of all farms would have remained family farms eligible for aid under the ERS, labor, and CAFO defi nitions, the ERS defi nition classifi es roughly three-quarters of all sales as coming from eligible family farms, while the labor and CAFO defi nitions attributed between 36 and 40 percent of all U.S. agricultural sales to eligible family farms. The land defi nition again appears the strictest, categorizing nearly 55 percent of farms as eligible family farms that produced roughly 30 percent of all U.S. agricultural sales. Decreasing the level of off-farm income to less than $50,000 causes roughly an additional one third of all U.S. farms to become ineligible for Federal programs. Despite this drop in eligibility, those eligible (both nonfamily and family farms) for aid under the land defi nition still generate nearly 75 percent of all sales.\nAlternative defi nitions of the family farm place some implicit or explicit limits on farm size, which can substantially reclassify farms, and especially sales, from family to nonfamily farms. The land defi nition appears to be the strictest, resulting in large shifts of both farms and reported sales from family to nonfamily farms. Although the labor and CAFO defi nitions have much more modest shifts in numbers of farms, the shifts in sales between family and nonfamily farms remain substantial.\nWhile alternative defi nitions of the family farm can reclassify substantial numbers of farms and sales between family and nonfamily farms, a small number of farms would not meet any defi nition of a family farm. Most of these operations tend to be partnerships and closely held corporations with unrelated owners. A few nonfamily farms qualify as the mega-farms mentioned by Murdock. These farms generate very large revenues across many agricultural industries.\nFor example, Smithfi eld Foods, the world's largest hog producer and pork processor, generated total revenues close to $12 billion in 2007. Del Monte generated over $3 billion in net sales in 2006 producing, among other goods, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables. Alico, Inc., another large corporation, produces, among other goods, citrus, sugarcane, and cattle in Florida, generating over $77 million in total revenues in 2006. While corporate farms make up a relatively small share of nonfamily farms (15 percent), they accounted for almost half of nonfamily farm production in 2006.\nRegardless of the defi nition used, family farms make up the majority of farms. Despite large differences among family farm defi nitions, the type of screen appears to have a much more signifi cant impact on the number of family farms eligible for Federal assistance than the defi nition used. Indeed, a large percentage of family farms would become ineligible under two of the three \"actively engaged\" screens (\"sales\" and \"household income from farming\") no matter which family farm defi nition is considered here (see fi g. 13).\nRequiring operators to rely on the farm for most of their household income would likely have the greatest impact on the number of family farms quali-fying for Federal assistance. Depending on the defi nition of family farm used, requiring farm income to account for at least 50 percent of household income would have disqualifi ed 82 to 87 percent of family farms and between 30 and 40 percent of family farm sales in 2006. Requiring annual farm sales of $10,000 or more would have disqualifi ed 58 to 70 percent of family farms and less than 4 percent of family farm sales. Disqualifying farm operators earning $100,000 in off-farm income would have reduced the number of family farms eligible for assistance by 18 to 20 percent, and the amount of sales from family farms by 10 to 15 percent. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Businesses designated as farms in the U.S. range from small operations with little or no production to operations with thousands of acres and thousands of head of livestock. Sales, expenses, off-farm income, labor allocation decisions, and the amount of government payments received also represent some of the attributes that vary considerably across farms producing similar outputs. Across farms producing different goods, these categories can vary even more.\nUSDA uses a very broad defi nition of the farm (any place that could produce at least $1,000 worth of agricultural goods in a given year) to monitor the health and productive capacity of the entire agricultural sector. On the one hand, using such a broad defi nition means that a large share of land in agriculture gets accounted for, which may be important for conservation or estate transfer policies. On the other hand, the majority of farms captured by this defi nition produce very little output and generate minimal sales, while a relatively small number of very large farms produce the bulk of agricultural goods and sales in the United States. As a result, the statistics generated for the farm sector as a whole need to be carefully interpreted.\nRecognizing this, policymakers have sometimes tried to aim Federal agricultural programs at those farm households deemed actively engaged in agriculture. Recently, proposals aimed at refi ning the defi nition of \"actively engaged\" have arisen in an attempt to target payments more precisely to their intended recipients.\nSeveral screens have been proposed to help better target Federal assistance to intended recipients. A sales screen could be used to identify those farmers that produce and bring to market substantial amounts of agricultural goods. However, careful implementation would be required to ensure the inclusion of farm households that may have produced (or tried to produce) substantial levels of output, yet had little or no sales.\nThe share of income from farming also has been proposed to identify actively engaged farmers. In general, the more heavily the household relies on farming for income, the more actively engaged in farming the operator is likely to be. However, the link between production and income is not straightforward; higher than expected costs, bad luck (weather, pest infestations, animal disease), and even capital equipment investments (which can lead to high depreciation expenses) can radically lower income levels from farming, making this type of screen unreliable as a measure of active engagement.\nA third proposal uses off-farm income levels to help distinguish between operations where the farmer is actively engaged in farming from those operated as part-time or hobby farms. High levels of off-farm income suggest that the operator does not rely heavily on the farm for income, while lower levels increase the likelihood that the farmer is actively engaged in farming. However, households of small farms with low levels of agricultural sales can also generate low levels of off-farm income, while the households of large farms with very high levels of agricultural sales can also produce high levels of off-farm income. In general, most farm households generate substantial Exploring Alternative Farm Defi nitions / EIB-49\nEconomic Research Service/USDA levels of off-farm income, making it unclear whether or not this screen would allow policymakers and program managers to target their intended recipients better.\nWhile screens might help target Federal aid to farmers, both the choice and the implementation of an appropriate screen require careful consideration. Important subsections of the agricultural population, such as beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers, and limited-resource farmers, could be excluded from Federal assistance if any of the screens explored in this report were applied without exceptions. Additionally, the screens explored in this report may not work well if policymakers wish to pursue environmental goals rather than ensuring that Federal assistance accrues to those who are actively engaged in agriculture.\nU.S. agricultural production has been shifting to larger and larger farm operations over time, raising the question of how the screens that may help identify actively engaged farms might affect family farms. As defi ned by ERS, 97 percent of all farms in the U.S. are family farms, generating 84 percent of all agricultural sales. However, other groups use varying defi nitions of the family farm that either implicitly or explicitly involve farm size constraints, excluding larger farms from being classifi ed as family farms. Consequently, while most farms tend to remain family farms under all the various defi nitions examined, adding labor, land, and confi ned animal feeding operation (CAFO) restrictions to the defi nition of a family farm signifi cantly redistributes production (sales) to nonfamily farms."}]
