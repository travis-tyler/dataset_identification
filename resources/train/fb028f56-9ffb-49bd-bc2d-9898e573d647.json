[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The intraseasonal oscillations (ISO) that vary from 10 to 100 days [Lau and Waliser, 2005] are crucial and integral part of the weather and climate events. They play a key role in initiating events such as El Nino [McPhaden, 1999] and influence the weather at extratropical latitudes [Bond et al., 2003;Jones et al., 2004]. In the ocean there are internally as well as externally generated ISO [Sengupta et al., 2001, Waliser et al., 2003Miyama et al., 2005;Han, 2005]. The former arises due to instabilities of mean current system having an average period of about 20-30 days [Kindle and Thompson, 1989;Woodberry et al., 1989], while the latter arises due to atmospheric wind forcing such as active and break spells of monsoon rainfall [Sengupta et al., 2001], MJO (30-60 days) [Madden and Julian, 1972;Miyama et al., 2005], quasi-biweekly mode (10-18 days) [Miyama et al., 2005] and 90-day winds (basin resonance) [Han, 2005]. The ISO in the tropical atmosphere such as the westward propagating Rossby waves, eastward propagating Kelvin waves [Wheeler and Kiladis, 1999;Chatterjee and Goswami, 2004], the quasi-biweekly mode (QBM) [Murakami and Frydrych, 1974;Chen and Chen, 1993;Numaguti, 1995] and their impact on the monsoon activity and El Nino events [Lau and Chan, 1988;Long and Li, 2002] are extensively studied. In the ocean, however, studies on ISO are mostly confined to the lower frequency (30-100 days) [Madden andJulian, 1971, 1972;Hirst and Lau, 1990;Wang and Xie, 1998;Yu and Liu, 2001;Duvel and Vialard, 2007;Sobel et al., 2008], and most of them are based on theoretical analysis, statistical methods and numerical simulations. There is paucity of observational analysis available on the activity and pattern of ISO in the Indian Ocean [Sengupta et al., 2001;Li et al., 2005] especially at the lower end of the spectrum, i.e., 10-30 days. Among the higher frequency ISO, the Kelvin and Yanai (named after its discoverer M. Yanai, 1966 first in stratosphere) waves are the only two waves seen in 10-30 days. Of these, the Yanai wave is unique as it has no counter parts at higher latitudes and is the least studied. The 25-28 day (lower frequency) Yanai waves are prominently observed in the eastern equatorial regions of Pacific [Harvey and Patzert, 1976;Wunsch and Gill, 1976;Legeckis, 1977;Cox, 1980;Ripa and Hayes, 1981] and Atlantic Oceans [Weisberg et al., 1979;Weisberg and Horrigan., 1981] and in the western region of Indian Ocean [Luyten and Roemmich, 1982;O'Neill, 1984;Reverdin and Luyten, 1986;Woodberry et al., 1989;Moore and Mccreary, 1990;Tsai et al., 1992;Kelly et al., 1995]. Yanai waves whose period varies between a week and a month [McPhaden, 1982;Moore and Mccreary, 1990] exhibit the gravity wave characteristics at higher frequencies and Rossby wave characteristics at lower frequencies and hence the name Mixed Rossby Gravity (MRG) wave. They are antisymmetric about the equator i.e., antisymmetric in zonal current velocity and symmetric in meridional current velocity [Wunsch and Gill, 1976]. The energy propagation of MRG wave is in eastward and downward directions, while its phase propagation can be in eastward (higher frequency wave) or westward (lower frequency wave) directions [Tsai et al., 1992, Sengupta et al., 2004 and vertically in the upward direction. They play a major role in the heat and momentum balance of the equatorial oceans [Kelly et al., 1995]. Luyten and Roemmich [1982] was the first to observe a 26-day period variability in the meridional current from the current meter mooring in the western equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) (40 0 E-60 0 E longitude). Later Reverdin and Luyten, [1986] identified these to Yanai waves based on both current meter and drifting buoy data from the same region. Several theories were put forward to explain the generation of Yanai wave which includes the reflection of incoming equatorially concentrated meridional kinetic energy by the slanting African coast [O'Neill, 1984], instability associated with the northward shift of the southern gyre during later stages of southwest monsoon [Reverdin and Luyten, 1986], and action of cross equatorial winds on the slanted coastline of the western boundary [Moore and Mccreary, 1990;Kelly et al., 1995]. However, Tsai et al. [1992] did not subscribe to the idea of direct wind forcing of Yanai wave as they did not see a corresponding periodicity in the wind. Kelly et al. [1995] suggested that the unstable and meandering eastward current driven by the oppositely flowing Somali current and East African coastal current during northeast monsoon resonantly force the Yanai wave of the southwest monsoon. All the above studies indicated the strongest and coherent signals of Yanai waves in the western EIO during July-September period. However, their eastward propagation was partially blocked by Maldives island chain located between 73 0 E and 74 0 E [Woodberry et al., 1989]. In contrast to western EIO, a biweekly period MRG wave (average period of 14-day) triggered by direct wind forcing of almost the same period is observed in the eastern EIO (80 0 E-100 0 E longitude) [Schott et al., 1994;Reppin et al., 1999;Murty et al., 2002;Sengupta et al., 2001Sengupta et al., , 2004. This biweekly oscillation is prominent in the upper 100m, while the 20-30 day variability is seen below 125m at 90 0 E [Masumoto et al., 2005]. Miyama et al. [2005] simulated an eastward intensification of energy due to the reflection of Yanai wave packet from the near-surface pycnocline and bottom and suggested that, since there are no free equatorial waves having the same period with westward group speed, part of the energy of the biweekly wave can escape to higher latitude via coastal Kelvin waves. A possibility of less than 20-day variability at the central EIO (60 0 E-80 0 E) was first suggested by McPhaden [1982] from the weekly record of current at Gan Island (~73 0 E). The prominent biweekly variability in the near ocean surface in the modeling studies of Sengupta et al. [2001] and Miyama et al. [2005] is a result of direct wind forcing. Ogata et al. [2008] attributed the generation of a 20-70 day oscillation below 150m at south east of Sri Lanka during boreal autumn and early winter to the large barotropic energy conversion. From the above discussion it is evident that studies of MRG wave in the central EIO are very few compared to western and eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. The earlier studies came up with the view that the lower frequency Yanai wave oscillation is dominant in western equatorial Indian Ocean while higher frequency oscillation in a biweekly scale prevailed in the central and eastern equatorial Indian Ocean in the upper water column. The lower frequency oscillations were observed only at the subsurface in the central equatorial Indian Ocean and eastern equatorial Indian Ocean [Ogata et al., 2008]. The higher frequency MRG wave (6-18 day) characteristics above the thermocline depth as well as at 4000m depth have been studied earlier in detail at central and eastern equatorial Indian Ocean [Ogata et al., 2008]. In the present study we use for the first time a long time-series current data spanning five years from the central equatorial Indian Ocean to explore the presence of Yanai wave. We followed a sampling strategy of high vertical resolution in the upper 150m and low resolution below. Unlike the earlier studies, where the upper ocean was sparsely sampled for short duration and the data for the entire sampling period were analyzed as a whole [Mcphaden, 1982;Schott et al., 1994;Reppin et al., 1999;Murty et al., 2002], we analyzed the long-term data for the entire period as well as for each separate years to decipher the occurrence of the lower frequency Yanai wave in the upper layer of the central equatorial Indian Ocean and propose a mechanism for its generation. Section 2 deals with the data and section 3 describe the methodology used for analyzing the data sets. The results are presented in section 4 and discussion part in section 5.

It is worth noting that the period of the time-series data used in the present study includes four positive IOD years of 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007 and a negative IOD year of 2005. The RCM provided hourly data of temperature, salinity, current speed and direction. From the hourly RCM data the hourly zonal and meridional current velocities were derived, which were subsequently averaged to obtain daily mean (Auxiliary Figures 1 to 3). The ADCP provided zonal and meridional current velocities at 15 minute interval and 4 meter depth bins which were converted to daily mean 8m depth bin data (Auxiliary Figure 4). A continuous time-series data was generated from the daily RCM data by linearly interpolating the data gaps, which were typically on an average of 4 days, except at 500m during May 2005 which was 15 days. The entire data at 300m during 2004-05 and at 2000m during 2003-04 and 2006-07 were not used for the analysis as it had large data gaps (see Table 1 and Figure 1 for details). The \"bad values\" in the ADCP data were eliminated and the data gaps, which were typically on an average of 6 days were linearly interpolated for further analysis (see Table 1 for details)."}, {"section_title": "1.

To delineate the years of IOD during the observational period the weekly Dipole Mode Index (DMI) was examined using data from January 2003 to December 2007 derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature Version 2 (NOAA OI SST Ver.2). This DMI is the weekly anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) gradient between western equatorial Indian Ocean (50 0 E-70 0 E and 10 0 S-10 0 N) and south eastern equatorial Indian Ocean (90 0 E-110 0 E and 10 0 S-0 0 N). Positive and negative DMI represents positive and negative IOD respectively.

Further the peaks with 95% and above confidence level (CL) have been determined using the Chi-squared distribution (CS) [Emery and Thompson, 1997]. The Continuous Wavelet Transformation (CWT) [Addison, 2002] was carried out on the meridional current velocity from the ADCP and RCM to understand the temporal variation of the Yanai wave period. Morlet wavelet was used as the mother wavelet. To aid further analysis, the westward propagating part of the Yanai wave of period 7-40 day was equally divided into higher frequency (7-23 day) and lower frequency (24-40 day) spectrum based on the frequency analysis (of the present current meter data as well as by previous authors) that showed distinct spectral peaks centered at 19-day and 26-day. The temperature and salinity profiles from Argo data for central EIO within a 2-degree longitude by 2-degree latitude box centered at 77 0 E and equator (i.e., from 76 0 E to 78 0 E longitude and 1 0 N to 1 0 S latitude) were extracted for the years from 2003 to 2007. From the total number of profiles available for each year (Table 2) the annual mean temperature and salinity profiles were computed which were subsequently used for the computation of sigma-t. The static stability parameter was calculated following Pond and Pickard [1983] to assess the strength of stratification. To explore the existence of lower frequency Yanai waves in the EIO, the region between 3 0 N and 3 0 S was further divided into 3 boxes such as western (50 0 E-60 0 E), central (70 0 E-80 0 E) and eastern (90 0 E-100 0 E) ( Figure 2)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "1. ADCP data", "text": "As the Yanai wave signatures can be easily inferred from the meridional current velocity, which is symmetric about the equator [Wunsch and Gill, 1976], the significant peaks with 95% and above confidence level (CL) were identified using CS (Table 3) analysis carried out on the daily meridional current velocity obtained from the ADCP data at 77 0 E, equator for the period 19 October 2004 to 25 June 2006 at each depth from 48m up to 120m. The 26-day peak was observed significant along with the biweekly peak of 12-day in the upper 88m of the water column, while the higher frequency Yanai wave peaks were observed towards deeper depths up to 120m (Table 3, also Auxiliary Figure 5). The 26-day and the biweekly were the lower and higher frequencies of Yanai wave. In order to understand the reason for such a depth differentiation of the prominent period of Yanai wave, the water column characteristics were analyzed. As the number of Argo profiles are limited (Table 2), the annual mean profiles of salinity and temperature at 77 0 E and equator were calculated from the Argo data and this showed a strong halocline/pycnocline in the upper 88m ( Figure 3). The lower as well as higher frequency Yanai wave during 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007 was observed in the upper thermocline/halocline/pycnocline region, which had an average density gradient of 0.0333, 0.0429, 0.0367 and 0.0368 kg/m 3 per meter respectively. During 2005, a 47-day peak was observed in this upper pycnocline region having an average density gradient of 0.0308 kg/m 3 per meter (the difference in density gradient during 2005 over the depth range 48-88m is larger than that of the IOD years), while the higher frequency Yanai wave alone was observed below the upper pycnocline (up to 120m) as in the case of the other years. The higher frequency Yanai wave during 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 occurred distinctively within the lower pycnocline region (96-120m) which had an average density gradient of 0.0111, 0.0285, 0.0341, 0.0333 and 0.0347 kg/m 3 per meter respectively. The decrease in the density with depth would lead to an increase in the phase velocity of Yanai wave and decrease in its period. To explore this further, we calculated the stability of the water column during each year based on the mean profiles of temperature and salinity. The depth averaged static stability parameter shows that during the positive IOD years of 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007 upper pycnocline (48-88m) is more strongly stratified and stable compared to the negative IOD year 2005 (Table 4). The difference of static stability parameter between the upper (48-88m) and lower (92-120m) pycnocline is the lowest during 2005 (-153.3 x 10 -6 m -1). This difference in static stability is more than 2-times and 2\u00bdtimes during 2003 and 2004 respectively, while it is about 1.4 during 2006 and 2007. Thus, we see a close correspondence between the periods of the Yanai wave with the vertical distribution of the water column stability during positive IOD years. To understand the temporal variability of the Yanai wave period, the ADCP data was further subjected to CWT analysis ( Figure 4). Since Yanai wave showed a change in its period above and below 88m, the ADCP data was segregated into two depths by averaging (1) from 48m up to 88m depth and (2) from 96m up to 120m depth. This data was used for the CWT analysis. In the upper water column (48-88m) the highest energy (180-240 (cm 2 /s 2 )/day) was in the range of 24-34 day period during October to This higher period (29-48 day) signature corresponds to the 47-day peak that we observed in CS and it shows similarity in both frequency and time of occurrence of MJO. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the variability might be of MJO origin. Even though some energy corresponding to the 29-48 day signature was observed in the bottom panel of the CWT analysis of ADCP data, CS analysis showed that it was not significant. Hence only higher frequency Yanai waves were significant in 96-120m depth. The existence of higher frequency Yanai wave (below 88m) and the absence of lower frequency Yanai wave (both below and above 88m) are the notable features observed from the CWT analyses of ADCP data during the negative IOD year of 2005. An absence of the higher period (47-day) signature in the depth range of either 48-88m or 96-120m during the IOD year of 2004 is also noted. To study the Yanai wave below the ADCP depth, further analysis was done with the RCM data."}, {"section_title": "2. RCM data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "2. 1 Deployment-recovery period of 2003-04", "text": "The significant spectral peaks were determined using CS, which showed both higher and lower frequency Yanai wave at 150m and 300m depths, while only higher frequency Yanai wave at 500m and 1000m depths (Table 5). At 4000m depth only 47-day peak was significant and this period was not significant in any other depths. Note that a similar 47-day peak was prominent in the ADCP data during 2005. From the above analysis it is clear that the water column from 150 to 1000m depth responds to lower (28-day) and higher frequency (7-23 day) Yanai wave. The temporal variation of various peaks obtained from the above analysis of RCM data was determined using CWT ( Figure 5).

The CWT analysis was done for delineating the time of occurrence of this variability. The CWT of 2004-05 ( Figure 6) at 500m showed highest energy at 18-25 day period from November to first week of December, 2004 followed by 31-52 day period from July to October, 2005. The lower frequency Yanai wave was not discernible at any depth during this period. The highest energy at 2000m was in the range of 27-42 day from March to May, 2005 while at 4000m it was in the range of 30-49 day from December, 2004to March, 2005. Unlike the previous years (2003)(2004) the signature of Yanai waves were not seen at any depth during 2005.

Deployment-recovery period of 2006-07", "text": "The presence of higher and lower frequency spectral peaks of Yanai waves were seen in the upper 1000m (Table 5). However, only the 21-day peak at 450m and 47-day peak at 4000m were found significant in the CS distribution ( Table 5). The temporal variation of the above significant periods, examined using CWT (Figure 7), showed that at 450m the highest energy was in 12-35 day period, Earlier studies showed that MJO signals are strong at the equator during boreal winter and spring while it is weak during summer [Madden 1986;Gutzler and Madden, 1989]. This seasonality is clearly seen in the CWT of RCM current measurements at 4000m. During 2003-04 the stronger 47day signals are observed during January to August, 2004August, , while during 2004August, -05 (2006 stronger signals are seen during December 2004(2006) up to April, 2005(2007. In short, MJO like oscillations (47-day) were prominent at bottom waters during all the RCM deployment-recovery periods from 2003 to 2007. However, we do not know whether they are forced by atmospheric MJO or it is a resonant mode due to oceanic processes. Thus, during positive IOD years the upper 1000m of the water column, except the lower pycnocline (96-120m), oscillates with a frequency of both lower and higher frequency Yanai wave, while during negative IOD year the response is mainly on 47-day period. The above analysis of the current data from ADCP and RCM as well as the temperature and salinity data from Argo profiles indicates a strong correspondence between the vertical stratification of the water column and the depthwise presence of the Yanai wave and the 47-day oscillations at 77\u00b0E and equator. This has been depicted schematically in Figure 8."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The above analysis brings out the following two important observations. The first one is the presence of the lower (24-40 days) as well as the higher (7 [Wunsch and Gill, 1976], the QuikSCAT daily meridional wind stress for the central EIO between 75 0 E-80 0 E and equator from 2003 to 2007 were subjected to the CS and VP analysis (Figure 9 and 10). A biweekly peak in the intraseasonal time scale was seen during the entire period from 2003 to 2007 (Figure 9 and 10), it was significant only during ). This implies that the higher frequency component of the Yanai wave is from the direct atmospheric forcing. A similar result of the biweekly variability was obtained by Sengupta et al. [2001] and Miyama et al. [2005]. As the QuikSCAT wind did not show any significant energy peak in the 20-30 day period, ocean dynamics must be responsible for the observed lower frequency Yanai wave during 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. In order to understand what caused the lower frequency Yanai wave during 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007 we analyzed the SST DMI dataset, which showed that the year 2005 was a negative IOD year while the years 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007 were positive IOD years (Figure 11). The annual mean and the mean for the months that showed positive DMI (February-March, September-December for 2004and August, 2006to January, 2007for 2006 had the lowest positive values of 0.01 and 0.19 respectively for the year 2004, while the highest positive values of 0.35 and 0.88 respectively for the year 2006. Hence, the year 2004 is a weak positive IOD compared to that of 2003, 2006 and 2007.The year 2005 has the highest negative DMI with an annual mean of 0.33 ( Figure 11). During the positive IOD, which normally starts by May-June, peaks in October and quickly recedes during November-December, the stronger equatorial easterly winds cause a northward shift of the SEC (Figures 2 and 12a) compared to negative IOD year 2005 ( Figure 12b). The northward shifted SEC, which flows westward, meets the eastward flowing southwest monsoon current at the central equatorial region (see Figure 2 for October, 2006) and generates a strong current shear across the equator (Figure 12c). Similar strong current shear was seen during the years 2003, 2004 and 2007 (figures not presented). This current shear is expected to generate stronger barotropic instability, while the vertical current shear associated with the cross-equatorial current shear is expected to generate baroclinic instability. Hence, we calculated the barotropic and baroclinic conversion rates following Jochum et al. [2003] using the OSCAR current data. Though the OSCAR current is at 15m depth, the calculated conversion is expected to hold good within the Ekman layer depth which ranged from 33m to 70m (average 51.5m, Auxiliary Figure 9). During most part of the study period the Ekman layer was deeper than 48m, especially during the period of formation of Yanai waves in a positive IOD period. The barotropic and the baroclinic conversions are given by -\u03c1 o ( v' u' )U y and \u03c1 ) respectively where \u03c1 o is the density of sea water, v' u' is the mean of the product of u' and v', the deviations from the annual mean zonal and meridional current velocity for the period of May-November respectively, U y is the zonal current shear, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and ' ' w \u03c1 is the product of \u03c1' and w', the deviations from the annual mean density and vertical current velocity (calculated from the zonal and meridional current velocities) for the period of May-November respectively. The conversion rates are calculated for the central EIO [3 0 N-3 0 S latitude and 75 0 E-80 0 E longitude] (see Figure 2 for location) for each year. The barotropic energy conversion is positive during the positive IOD years (2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007) and indicates high eddy kinetic energy (EKE) (Fig.12d), which is the result of a net energy transfer from mean kinetic energy (MKE) and presence of Yanai waves. The higher negative value of barotropic energy conversion during 2005, which is a negative IOD year, implies a high MKE and absence of Yanai waves. The baroclinic energy conversion is 4-5 times higher than the barotropic energy conversion during 2003, 2006 and 2007, while it is more or less the same during 2004. However, during the year, 2005 the baroclinic energy conversion was close to zero. Thus, the cross-equatorial current shear during positive IOD years are able to generate high eddy kinetic energy, while the vertical current shear sustains the growth of eddy kinetic energy through higher baroclinic energy conversion. The above results are consistent with the results from the spectrum analysis which showed that Yanai waves in 2005 were weak. Hence we propose that the above processes during a positive IOD create a situation conducive for the generation of the lower frequency Yanai waves. In addition, the upper pycnocline was strongly stratified and stable during the positive IOD years in comparison to the negative IOD year of 2005. This was due to the advection of low salinity waters from the east by the northward shifted SEC (see Fig.3 for a comparison of salinity between positive and negative IOD year). We presume that the strong vertical stratification prevented the upper water column to be dominantly in resonance with MJO which is weak. However, there may be some weak response. Thus, during positive IOD years the upper water column dominantly resonates at the Yanai wave frequency due to the increased meridional shear and vertical stratification, while the deeper waters exhibit 47-day oscillations. During negative IOD year when the water column is weakly stratified the entire water column exhibit 47-day oscillations. In order to see whether the Yanai wave signatures were perceptible in the surface layer above the depth of measurement of ADCP, the merged MSLA data was analysed. Since both the Yanai waves and Kelvin waves are present in the MSLA data in the 14-30 days range, to delineate the Yanai wave signature alone it is necessary to use its characteristic property. As the sea level for the Yanai wave is antisymmetric about the equator [Meyers et al., 1993] we converted the sea level field, h(x, y) to symmetric and antisymmetric components, and then used the antisymmetric sea level anomaly, h A for further analysis. where x and y are the longitude and the latitude respectively. Since maximum variance of Yanai wave were seen at 3 0 latitude in both hemispheres in EIO [Tsai et al., 1992] the antisymmetric MSLA, after removing the seasonal cycle, were used to calculate the CS for western, central and eastern EIO (Figure 13) for the same time period as that of ADCP measurement. The CS of the antisymmetric MSLA after removing the seasonal cycle in the western and central EIO clearly showed a spectral peak at 28-day ( Figure 13). In addition to this a 17-day peak was significant in the eastern EIO. The biweekly wind forcing being prominent in the eastern EIO [Murty et al., 2002;Miyama et al., 2005], the 17-day peak is linked to direct wind forcing. Though a 28-day peak was seen in eastern EIO it was not significant. Thus, from the analysis of MSLA as well as the ADCP the presence of lower frequency Yanai wave could be inferred in the upper water column. This is at variance with the earlier observation as well as modeling studies which observed only the higher frequency (mostly in the biweekly period) Yanai wave in the upper water column in the central EIO [Reppin et al., 1999;Masumoto et al., 2005;Ogata et al., 2008]."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusion", "text": "The The present study, though utilized a long time-series current data, had only one negative IOD year and four IOD years in the study period. A detailed study with adequate in situ data consisting of normal as well as anomalous years is necessary to have a better understanding of the occurrence of Yanai wave in the central EIO and its interannual variability. A model simulation of IOD forcing that can provide a significant support to our observational findings is our future interest. Table.1.
