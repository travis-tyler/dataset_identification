Currently, 11 NIOSH Ag Centers are funded across the nation.\nNurses are major constituents of Ag Centers and they function in diverse roles (e.g., center director, deputy director, clinical director, evaluation director, educator, researcher, scientist, occupational, agricultural and rural health nurse). The occupational health nurse authors of this article comprise the evaluation core for their midwestern Ag Center. The evaluation team's previous study (Cramer & Wendl, 2015) showed that effectively-led coalitions foster learning environments which are highly valued by members and promote satisfaction within the network.\nThe global community agrees that addressing modern public health challenges requires building the capacity of coalitions, establishments, and systems (Alexander et al., 2016; Batras, Duff, & Smith, 2014) . Substantial effort in planning and ongoing coordination is required when forming a coalition; thus, evaluating success is vital to ensuring quality improvement (Zakocs & Edwards, 2006) . Health and safety programs must make a difference; accomplishing this goal requires effective leadership and governance, collaborating with a host of community individuals and organizations. To ensure the efficacy of a coalition, it is vital to study its administrative structure to determine strengths and weaknesses. Organizational adjustments can then support Ag Centers in achieving their intended outcomes. Moreover, with greater competition for government and private funding, it is imperative that coalitions demonstrate their collaborative success to positively influence financiers (Mueller, 2007) . This study is an example of how occupational health nurses and other professionals can evaluate their coalitions or networks.\nThe focus on coalitions and partnerships among various sectors has become more common (El Ansari, Phillips, & Zwi, 2004) . Coalitions require leaders who provide vision and direction. Despite the fact that Ag Centers have been in existence for more than 20 years, little attention has been paid to evaluating their leadership and governance, or how they function as organizations (McDonald & McDivitt, 1998) . The study literature review found a noticeable gap in coalition evaluation studies focused on occupational health nurses in the past 10 years. This article is a case study evaluation for a midwestern Ag Center. The evaluation used a mixed method explanatory sequential design to assess the coalition's organizational effectiveness. Results were used to build on identified leadership strengths and address areas of governance improvement."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "This study involved an Ag Center serving a midwestern seven-state region with a relatively large concentration of farms (n = 437,042) that are mostly corn and soybean operations and cattle and hog production facilities (U.S. Department of Agriculture Census of Agriculture, 2012). Each farm type exhibits exposure risks to hazardous noise and dust. Personal protective equipment (PPE; i.e., facial masks or respirators, ear plugs, or ear muffs) has been available for many years and, when used properly, can protect workers from developing respiratory diseases or hearing impairments (OSHA Fact Sheet, U.S. Department of Labor, 2006) . However, little evidence suggests that agricultural workers routinely wear PPE to reduce their exposures (Schenker, Orenstein, & Samuels, 2002) . The Ag Center goals included promoting PPE, and accomplished its work through the four core areas of administration, research, prevention/intervention, and education."}, {"section_title": "Organizational Structure", "text": "Depicted in Figure 1 , the Ag Center has a clear organizational structure, which facilitates well-defined routes of communication, shared governance, and collaboration among projects and programs, including evaluation. The Administrative Core provides the process that connects all cores, programs, and advisory committees into a cohesive effective leadership structure. Many of the members and leaders are university faculty and leaders of agriculture-related organizations (Table 1) .\nThe Internal Advisory Committee is comprised of core and program directors and administrative staff as shown in the organizational chart (Figure 1 ). This group meets monthly to assist the Center Director with scientific and administrative decisions about Center operations.\nThe External Advisory Committee is composed of multidisciplinary and geographically diverse agricultural experts who meet annually to review evidence regarding the Ag Center's outcomes and impacts. The yearly meeting provides an open exchange of ideas, information, approaches, and knowledge, particularly regarding translating research to practice, linking researchers and stakeholders, and identifying effective outreach channels."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation", "text": "The evaluation team is internal to the Ag Center but operates as an independent entity that reports to the Ag Center leadership and both advisory committees to address overall program improvement based on findings. Three aims were developed to achieve Center goals including process evaluation monitored by the project leader's database entries, outcomes and end results measurement using surveys and other tools, and a leadership and governance focus. Meeting schedule is shown in Table 2 .\nThe specific aims of this study were to answer three key evaluation questions: (a) What are the organizational strengths of the Ag Center? (b) What are areas for improvement in leadership and governance? and (c) Did recommendations implemented from baseline evaluation result in improvements at Year 3? The evaluation study was conducted at two points in time. Year 1 provided a baseline of information that generated specific recommendations for the Ag Center's governance, and a second evaluation at Year 3 provided a measure of effectiveness regarding the recommendations. The study was approved by the organization's Institutional Review Board."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "The evaluation team conducted a mixed method explanatory sequential study ( Figure 2) ; the study first used quantitative methods and then employed qualitative techniques to explain the quantitative results in more depth (Creswell, 2015) . Quantitative data were collected using the Internal Coalition Effectiveness (ICE \u00a9 ) instrument (Cramer, Atwood, & Stoner, 2006a areas needing additional discernment. The questionnaire responses provided greater understanding through personal examples, and provided data for developing recommendations that could strengthen and improve programs (McDonald & McDivitt, 1998; National Institutes of Health, 2011; Pincus, Abedin, Blank, & Mazmanian, 2013) . O'Brien's Standards guided the qualitative data collection process (field interviews) and reporting (O'Brien, Harris, Beckman, Reed, & Cook, 2014) . Both methods were employed in Year 1 (baseline) and Year 3 (second evaluation) of the project 5-year funding cycle. The sample for the ICE \u00a9 instrument included all Ag Center members and leaders at baseline (n = 32) and second evaluation (n = 38). In accordance with the ICE \u00a9 , members and leaders each served a particular role. Members were defined as those who participated in the work of the Ag Center on a regular or intermittent basis (i.e., community participants, advisory committee members, project team members, and consultant personnel). Nineteen members participated at baseline and 27 members participated in the second evaluation (Table 1) . Leaders were individuals in designated roles of accountability, and, for purposes of this evaluation, the leaders were defined as the Center Director, Deputy Director, Coordinator, and Core and Project Directors (baseline n = 13, second evaluation n = 11). Leaders are defined as those in positions of accountability; includes principal and co-investigators; chairs/co-chairs of committees, teams, project, boards; participating agency directors.\nThe sample for the baseline field interviews was pilot project investigators (18-month funding) and fully funded investigators (5-year funding) who were located external to the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) campus. During the second data collection phase, the sample included pilot project investigators and core directors who had not been previously interviewed and were purposively selected as rich data sources. At baseline, five in-person field interviews were conducted (n = 3 members, n = 2 leaders) at site locations across the seven-state region served by the Ag Center. Three new pilot investigators and two project directors were interviewed at their individual locations in Fargo, ND; Fremont, NE; Minneapolis, MN; and Boone, Ames, and Urbandale, IA. During the second evaluation, six in-person field interviews were conducted (n = 3 members, n = 3 leaders) at site locations across the region. The locations were Omaha, NE (n = 4) and Spencer and Iowa City, IA."}, {"section_title": "Measures/Instruments Quantitative", "text": "The ICE \u00a9 instrument corresponds to the Internal Coalition Outcomes Hierarchy (ICOH) framework (Cramer, Atwood, & "}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Quantitative", "text": "The ICE \u00a9 instrument was formatted in SurveyMonkey and sent via email both years.

The communication venue was mainly through the Ag Center meeting schedule (Table 2) . In response to the finding that Knowledge was regarded somewhat lower in ranking, project investigators were asked to present their projects, soliciting feedback from the team to enhance outcomes, and an organizational chart was posted on the website.\nThe second lowest ranking was Activities; respondents seemed less clear about the Ag Center advancement on goals and aims related to the total project. The Evaluation Core addressed this by providing more formative feedback/reports (Table 2) . Quarterly reminders were sent to members for data entry into the Ag Center database, and periodic updates were presented on how data were used. The Center coordinator sent emails to update the team on new media releases, awards, and resources related to Ag Center projects to keep all partners informed. The entire Ag Center team was invited to the annual external advisory committee meeting to present their projects and discuss outreach suggestions. Leadership provided informal opportunities for leaders/members to know other investigators and form collaborations. Assistance and orientation were provided to new grantees via \"field interviews\" so they could better understand \"the system,\" including regular budget updates. The Evaluation team provided member education on the Ag Center Logic Model evaluation tool and on the value of \"success stories\" as a result of their research. Distance was a reported factor in coalition functioning during each round of field visit interviews; this finding was consistent with other studies noting geographic distance as a major challenge for community partners (Chen, Roberts, Xu, Jacobson, & Palm, 2012) .

Coalitions are complex and require significant skill to initiate, lead, and evaluate (Clark-McMullen, 2010) . According to Butterfoss and Francisco (2004) , \"Community coalitions and partnerships can be powerful agents for social change and for solving complex public health challenges (p. 113).\" The results of this study reveal the continuing successful leadership and governance of the Ag Center. In particular, the organization demonstrates strength in their shared Social Vision and Mission, and highly collaborative Relationships among Center members and leaders.\nOpportunities for organizational growth were identified in the two lower scoring ICOH constructs of Knowledge and Activities. Leadership modifications designed to address these themes included reorganizing the monthly Ag Center meeting to include presentations on projects; posting an organizational chart on the Ag Center website; increasing emails to the team regarding all project updates on new media releases, awards, and resources; inviting all team members to the annual external advisory committee meeting; hosting regular meetings with Project Investigators; providing informal opportunities for leaders and members to know other investigators; providing assistance and orientation for new grantees; and presenting education on the Ag Center Logic Model evaluation tool and the value of \"success stories\" as a result of research studies.\nThe outcome of this study revealed improved familiarity with Center organization and accomplishments. Several participants reported improvements in monthly Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health (CS-CASH) member meetings including shared project updates and focused agendas. All respondents reported familiarity with the organizational chart as opposed to only fair understanding at baseline. Findings from the field visits showed that investigators were highly satisfied with the Center's support and resources for their research and all have requested ongoing affiliation through collaboration on research funding, list serves, and newsletters. During the Year 3 interviews, members were able to give examples of goal attainment such as outreach participation in events and development of relevant resources for the community and building substantial inroads in Nebraska and the seven-state region such that the Center's profile and reputation have been growing over the past 4 years, all evidence of how CS-CASH is achieving its mission.\nIn conclusion, strong collaborative leadership is vital to successful population health improvement programs. The ICOH constructs provide elements that may be basic for a functioning team but can be challenging with diverse work groups (Bennett & Gadlin, 2012) . A mixed methods evaluation approach highlighted coalition qualities in a broader environment, capturing a clearer depiction of leadership and member interactions. Findings were shared with the coalition to identify strengths and areas for quality improvement, thereby promoting coalition sustainability (Cramer & Wendl, 2015) . Liaisons are being developed by the Center, and investigators are appreciative of the resources and support that the Center brings to them. Longitudinal studies will continue to evaluate progress and provide data for continued quality improvement."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Practice", "text": "Work settings for occupational health nurses can include corporate offices as well as various community locations. Many occupational health nurses are employed in agricultural health, involving a multitude of worksites for which this study has practical applications. This article also has implications for occupational health nurses who frequently guide and evaluate partnerships and community-based coalitions for efficiency and economy (Clark-McMullen, 2010) . The base competencies for occupational health nursing certification include management and evaluation of programs similar to the example in this article. These findings can be applied to corporate and community occupational health nursing situations to improve the effectiveness of leadership and demonstrate a successful program to funders.
