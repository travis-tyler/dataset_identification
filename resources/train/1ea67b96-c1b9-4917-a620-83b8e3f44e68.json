[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "BACKGROUND: Current classification of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is suboptimal, and management is based on weak evidence, with little attempt to personalize treatment. A need exists for new precision medicine and stratified management approaches that incorporate emerging technologies. OBJECTIVE: To improve characterization and classification of TBI and to identify best clinical care, using comparative effectiveness research approaches. METHODS: This multicenter, longitudinal, prospective, observational study in 22 countries across Europe and Israel will collect detailed data from 5400 consenting patients, presenting within 24 hours of injury, with a clinical diagnosis of TBI and an indication for computed tomography. Broader registry-level data collection in approximately 20 000 patients will assess generalizability. Cross sectional comprehensive outcome assessments, including quality of life and neuropsychological testing, will be performed at 6 months. Longitudinal assessments will continue up to 24 months post TBI in patient subsets. Advanced neuroimaging and genomic and biomarker data will be used to improve characterization, and analyses will include neuroinformatics approaches to address variations in process and clinical care. Results will be integrated with living systematic reviews in a process of knowledge transfer. The study initiation was from October to December 2014, and the recruitment period was for 18 to 24 months. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI should provide novel multidimensional approaches to TBI characterization and classification, evidence to support treatment recommendations, and benchmarks for quality of care. Data and sample repositories will ensure opportunities for legacy research. DISCUSSION: Comparative effectiveness research provides an alternative to reductionistic clinical trials in restricted patient populations by exploiting differences in biology, care, and outcome to support optimal personalized patient management."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "T he Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) core data study and CENTER-TBI registry (NCT02210221) form part of the CENTER-TBI project: a large-scale project supported by the European Union Framework 7 program (grant 602150). It is embedded within the framework of the International Initiative on TBI Research (InTBIR). 1 Each year, approximately 2.5 million people will experience some form of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Europe; of these, 1 million will be admitted to the hospital and 75 000 will die. TBI thus constitutes a major cause of death and disability, leading to great personal suffering for victims and relatives and huge direct and indirect costs to society. In the United States, the annual burden of TBI has been estimated at .$75 billion in patients with TBI. 2 The lifetime costsper-case is estimated at $396 000, with disability and lost productivity costs outweighing medical and rehabilitation costs by a factor of 4. 3 TBI is considered the most complex disease in our most complex organ. It is characterized by great heterogeneity in terms of etiology, mechanisms, pathology, severity, and treatment, with widely varying outcomes. Falls and high velocity road traffic incidents cause different types of injury. TBI may consist of diffuse damage, contusional brain damage, or intracranial hematomas. Some structural abnormalities (particularly traumatic axonal injury) are poorly detected by conventional imaging. The clinical severity of TBI ranges from minor (minimal complaints, no visible structural damage) to virtually unsurvivable injuries. We have found large differences in outcome between centers with up to a 6-fold higher risk in poorer vs better centers after adjustment for chance effects and case mix. 4 We now also recognize that TBI is not just an acute event, but can trigger a chronic process, with progressive injury over hours, days, weeks, months, and even years. 5 The long-term sequelae related to behavior, emotion, and cognition, including early-onset dementia and psychiatric illness as well as later substance-use disorders particularly after repetitive mild TBIs, constitute an increasing societal and economic burden. [6] [7] [8] While basic research has increased our knowledge of the mechanisms involved, improvements in clinical management have not kept pace. Guidelines for the treatment of TBI are available, 9, 10 but the evidence underpinning these recommendations is weak. Moreover, current approaches to the characterization of disease severity and outcome are unidimensional and have not undergone refinement for .3 decades. Treatment generally follows a one-size-fits-all approach and is not targeted to the needs of an individual. Clinical research in TBI is particularly challenging due to disease heterogeneity and has been further hampered by dispersion of efforts with little collaboration between researchers in acute and postacute settings, and by research that focuses on isolated disease mechanisms, testing highly specific neuroprotective agents in underpowered randomized clinical trials (RCTs). RCTs generally use strict enrollment criteria in order to study the investigational intervention in the cleanest setting. The downside of this approach is that results are only valid in such selected subpopulations and that generalizability to the real-world context is limited. Indeed, improvements in TBI care have come not from clinical trials, but rather from observational studies, guideline development, and meta-analysis of individual patient data. 11 However, the large-scale international observational studies on TBI in Europe and the United States that underpin these improvements date back at least 20 years 12 and do not reflect current clinical care.\nRecent advances in genomics, advanced neuro-imaging, and biomarker development provide unparalleled opportunities for refinements in clinical characterization, offering more accurate disease phenotyping. Improved disease characterization will aid precision medicine, a concept recently enunciated by the US National Academy of Sciences. 13 Such improved characterization and stratification will allow for more targeted therapies. Furthermore, comparative effectiveness research (CER) provides a promising framework to identify best practices and improve outcome after TBI. CER is the generation and synthesis of evidence that compares the benefits and harms of alternative methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition or to improve the delivery of care. The purpose of CER is to assist consumers, clinicians, purchasers, and policymakers to make informed decisions that will improve healthcare at both the individual and population levels. 14 A basic concept of CER is to study differences in care and outcome in observational studies, thus turning natural variability into an asset. In CENTER-TBI, we will exploit the existing heterogeneity in structure, process, and outcome to compare treatments and interventions that are standard practice in some centers and countries but not in others. The aim is to discover underlying pathophysiology, to refine characterization, and to identify effective clinical interventions. Natural links exist between CER and individualized approaches, because CER aims to identify the best treatment for the individual patient, with a specific type of injury, severity, comorbidities, and other aspects that determine optimal treatment. We see a great potential for CER in TBI because of various unique features. First, there are large between-center and between-country differences in both outcome and management. Second, robust risk adjustment models have been developed specifically for TBI, providing the possibility to adjust for patient characteristics that affect outcome. Third, advanced statistical models, including random effect models, are available to analyze differences between centers. 15 The key driver of our research plan is to collect data from a large number of European centers and a sufficiently large cohort to enable CER analyses of differences in clinical care and management pathways in TBI. The CENTER-TBI population will be a unique and well-characterized resource, accessible for longerterm follow-up with continued funding. The integrated results of the project will be brought together in a process of translational outputs. We aim for real-world approaches to translating research outputs into practical information for patients, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. We will develop and sustain an international TBI knowledge community that integrates results of the project with high-quality living evidence reviews of the current state of knowledge, aiming to continuously provide evidence to underpin guidelines and treatment recommendations. The impact of CENTER-TBI will be enhanced by international collaborations within and beyond InTBIR. TBI is a global problem and requires a global approach. The CENTER-TBI database and repositories will be an invaluable resource for further research, which we wish to encourage. In this article, we present an abbreviated version of the CENTER-TBI protocol. The full version of the protocol is available as supplemental material (see Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/NEU/A688)."}, {"section_title": "STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES", "text": "The study goals are \u2022 To improve characterization and classification of TBI in Europe, with inclusion of emerging technologies. \u2022 To identify the most effective clinical care and to provide highquality evidence in support of treatment recommendations and guidelines.\nThe specific aims are \u2022 To collect high-quality clinical and epidemiological data with repositories for neuro-imaging, DNA, and serum from patients with TBI. \u2022 To refine and improve outcome assessment and develop health utility indices for TBI.\n\u2022 To develop multidimensional approaches to characterization and prediction of TBI. \u2022 To define patient profiles that predict efficacy of specific interventions (precision medicine). \u2022 To develop performance indicators for quality assurance and quality improvement in TBI care. \u2022 To validate the common data elements (CDEs) for broader use in international settings.

All patients will be allocated a random Global Unique Personal Identification number (GUPI), which will be linked locally to hospital identifiers. Uploaded data will be de-identified and images will be defaced prior to upload. While blood samples and clinical data will be linked, both sets of data will be kept confidential and anonymized beyond the initial stage of correlation for analysis. Imaging and electronic data will be kept on individually passwordprotected servers. Clinical data will be entered into electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) and managed by the QuesGen data management platform, 17 which will be developed in collaboration with KI-INCF. 18 Data collection is based upon the CDEs, 20 thus providing evidence context for further refinement and updating of the CDEs in an international setting, which will inform global standardization of data collection in TBI. The database structure will be compatible with FITBIR. 21 As data are entered into each form, the system will run data validation checks that include conditionally required data, validation across fields, and validation requirements based on subject type. If any validation check fails, the user is alerted immediately that the data do not meet quality assurance (QA) criteria and the issue can be addressed and corrected at that point. All de-identified electronic study data in the CENTER-TBI database will be stored securely in the European data space under supervision of KI-INCF for the duration of subject enrollment and follow-up and for a period afterwards for data analysis and preparation of publications. We estimate that the analysis and publication period will last for several years after the conclusion of subject enrollment.\nTogether with QuesGen Systems, KI-INCF will ensure that data standards are established for the data model (eg, conformity of field formats, field codes, and names to ensure consistency across all datasets). Any approved changes will be fully documented with dataset updates to maintain data quality and accuracy. KI-INCF will be responsible for importing cleaned datasets to other analytic platforms as determined by the coordinators. ICON will undertake source data verification in 10% of datasets, using an approach for dataset selection, which depends (among other factors) on recruitment rates and assessment of data completion and accuracy on the online data entry forms.\nWhere applicable, derived information relevant to the patient's care will be made available to the physician responsible. Data, including blood samples collected as part of this study, will be shared in an anonymized form with collaborators from other European states (this is part of a European Union Framework7 funded program), and with selected collaborators in other countries who form part of the International Traumatic Brain Injury Research Initiative.\nThe KI-INCF will coordinate the establishment of an informatics platform for acquisition, storage, and analysis of CDE-based clinical data. The goal is to develop a next-generation open standards-based platform to support advanced large-scale analytics and model building. Such a platform also provides a model for future clinical studies on brain diseases and disorders. This development will receive additional support from One Mind for Research. 19 Data sharing policies, providing open access, modelled on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 22 ) concept, will aim to broaden access to the data, encourage academic productivity, and accelerate outputs.

We anticipate that many potential patients will not be able to consent to their participation in this project. The nature of TBI means that some patients may lack the capacity to decide to participate in this study especially at the earliest time point. It is important to try and include these patients to ensure that representative samples of patients are included to avoid bias in the study findings. Every step will be taken to ensure that a test of capacity is undertaken before a decision on a person's capacity to consent or not to consent to participate in research is taken. If the subject is not capable of self-consent, all efforts will be made to locate a legally acceptable representative to act on behalf of the subject. When a legally acceptable representative (eg, consultee/proxy) is identified, an opinion will be sought about the potential participant's wishes and feelings in relation to the project, and whether he or she would have wanted to take part in the study.\nSubjects are free to withdraw, or be withdrawn by their consultee/proxy if appropriate, at any point in the study, and they need not state a reason. All individual patient identifiers will be stripped from data before storage on the study database (see details under Data Management).

However, perhaps even more unique is the fact that all the projects will undertake data collection to common standards based on the Common Data Elements scheme developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 20 with the database structure that is compatible with FITBIR. 21 InTBIR was founded in recognition of the importance of TBI as a global pandemic, culminating in significant costs to all societies in terms of mortality, residual disability, health, economic costs, and reduced activity. Although initiated by 3 funding agencies, InTBIR is an open community and welcomes participation of other agencies and funding bodies. With the aim of advancing the care for TBI, the primary intent of InTBIR is to focus on collecting, standardizing, and sharing clinical TBI data for comparative effectiveness research. Within the InTBIR framework, there are currently 10 studies supported by the participating agencies (Table 5) .\nCENTER-TBI has interactions with several other studies within the InTBIR community and has particularly close collaboration with TRACK-TBI (Transforming Research And Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury; PI, Dr Geoffrey Manley), with extensive harmonization of study procedures and data collection. Pediatric recruitment to CENTER-TBI involves a close collaboration with ADAPT (Approaches and Decisions for Acute Pediatric TBI; PI, Dr Michael Bell). The concept of CENTER-TBI and TRACK-TBI has already attracted substantial international interest, and satellite projects are currently being set up in Australia, China, and India. Thus, the philosophy that TBI is a global problem that requires a global approach is now being translated into research practice. The InTBIR studies and satellite projects linked to these initiatives have the potential to provide long-needed evidence to support practice recommendations and to improve treatment.\nDetails on the CENTER-TBI project and scientific work plan are available on the CENTER-TBI website: www.center-tbi.eu.

"}, {"section_title": "Policymakers", "text": "Insight into current epidemiological patterns of TBI across member states will inform prevention campaigns, targeted to needs at national levels. Our focus on the impact of systems of care and organizational aspects of care delivery could yield substantial benefits: for example, introduction of the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines for TBI management was associated with a 12% reduction in TBI mortality. 28 More efficient and targeted care and improved outcome will reduce costs. New performance indicators and improved prognostic models will facilitate benchmarking and assessments of quality of care.\nIn summary, the CENTER-TBI project will contribute towards the overall goals of InTBIR, by identifying more effective and efficient treatment provision, thus improving outcome and reducing costs. The science in the project will provide novel information on disease processes, treatment, outcome, and prognosis in TBI, identifying new therapeutic targets and therapies, while the CENTER-TBI repositories will ensure opportunities for legacy research. Thus, the project has the potential to improve current healthcare and its delivery at both population and individual levels, deliver early scientific advances that could improve the care of patients with TBI, and provide a rich investment for future biomedical research."}, {"section_title": "Disclosures", "text": ""}]
