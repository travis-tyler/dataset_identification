In longitudinal studies, individuals meeting criteria for MCI are at increased risk for progressing to AD compared with age-matched control subjects (1, 2) . However, rates of conversion from MCI to AD are highly variable (3) because the cognitive deficits exhibited by these individuals may be related to a number of different pathologies. In an effort to detect AD in prodromal stages, there have been attempts to identify subgroups of MCI patients who are at highest risk for progression to AD. Many approaches focus on identifying early biological markers in structural (4) and functional (5) neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (6) , but clinical tools, such as neuropsychological testing (7) , have also been useful.\nAnother potential clinical marker for identifying MCI individuals at high risk of developing AD is the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Depression, in particular, has been associated with increased risk of dementia (8, 9) . We previously demonstrated that depressive symptoms predicted progression to AD in MCI patients (10, 11) , but the neurobiological mechanism underlying this association is not yet fully understood. In several cross-sectional studies, depressed elderly appear to have underlying brain changes associated with AD, including reduced temporal lobe (12) , hippocampal, and amygdala volume (13, 14) . As depressive symptoms may be a clinical marker of prodromal AD, we wanted to extend the findings in the existing literature and demonstrate that depressive symptoms would be associated with AD-related neuroanatomical changes, particularly in white matter regions.\nTensor-based morphometry (TBM) is a relatively novel computational approach that can compare longitudinally acquired images and visualize the spatial profile of brain atrophy over time, including estimates of tissue volume loss at each voxel in the brain (15) . This approach has been successfully used to track longitudinal changes associated with normal brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders (16, 17) . Also, it may be more sensitive in detecting changes in white matter volume, as it does not require a segmentation step, thus avoiding potential errors in accurate tissue classification. We applied TBM to compare patterns of brain atrophy in MCI patients with and without depressive symptoms. Specifically, we hypothesized that MCI patients with depressive symptoms would demonstrate greater brain atrophy over 2 years compared with those without depressive symptoms in regions specifically associated with AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "Methods and Materials", "text": "Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

This finding, coupled with the lack of detectable differences between the OTHER and NOSYMP groups, highlights the specificity of the relationship between depressive symptoms and the observed brain changes. Moreover, the DEP group demonstrated greater atrophy, even when compared directly with the OTHER group. Subjects in the DEP group with persistent symptoms over 2 years also demonstrated more decline on select neuropsychological tests and had higher rates of conversion to AD compared with the stable NOSYMP subjects. Depression has previously been demonstrated to be a potentially useful clinical marker for identifying MCI subjects who are more likely to progress to AD (10, 11) . To our knowledge, this is the first study to map the neurobiological effects underlying the predictive function of depressive symptoms associated with increased progression to AD.\nPrior literature on the neuroanatomical correlates of depression in healthy elderly subjects has found reduced volume in the frontal lobes and anterior cingulate (38) , as well as hippocampus and amygdala (13, 14) . Our findings were consistent with these past reports; however, we also observed significant white matter atrophy in parietal and temporal lobes, regions known to be affected in AD. Greater atrophy was observed on the left than the right. This asymmetry has also been observed in previous studies that found greater atrophy and metabolic dysfunction in the left hemisphere of AD patients (39, 40) , suggesting greater vulnerability of the left hemisphere to neurodegeneration in AD. A similar pattern has also been shown in MCI subjects who had higher levels of Pittsburgh Compound-B retention on the left dorsal frontal cortex and sensorimotor cortex compared with the right (41) . Hence, the pattern of atrophy in the DEP group may reflect shared underlying changes in the neuroanatomical correlates of both depressive symptoms and pathological changes associated with AD (42) . This is consistent with our previous findings demonstrating that depressive symptoms represent a phenotypic marker related to the onset of AD and favorable response to donepezil therapy (10), along with other studies that have found increased AD-related pathology in depressed elderly with cognitive impairment, including elevated retention of positron emission tomography radioligands for betaamyloid 1-42 (A\u242442) and tau (43, 44) and higher burden of A\u242442-containing neuritic plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy (45). Qiu et al. (46) found that depressed elderly subjects demonstrated lower plasma-A\u242442 levels compared with nondepressed elderly. In our sample, post hoc analysis of CSF biomarker concentrations available for a subgroup of participants (n \u03ed 129) revealed no significant differences between the DEP, OTHER, and NOSYMP groups in mean concentrations of A\u242442, tau, or phosphorylated-tau or in the prevalence of subjects meeting AD-signature cutoff values (6) in any of these CSF biomarkers (Tables S4 and  S5 in Supplement 1).

In our study, the brain changes associated with depressive symptoms were largely confined to white matter. Some investigators have found reduced white matter volume in depressed individuals (47) , and recent investigations using diffusion tensor imaging have identified lower fractional anisotropy in prefrontal regions, anterior cingulate, and temporal regions in depressed subjects (48) . Severe depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders have also been associated with abnormal myelination (49, 50) and reduced or abnormal oligodendrocytes (51) , especially at older ages (52) .\nBeyond the association between white matter and depression, the white matter atrophy may be a direct consequence of AD pathology. Substantial theoretical and empirical evidence supports white matter pathology in AD (42, 53) . Myelin breakdown has also been observed at the MCI stage (54, 55) . Furthermore, depressive symptoms that were persistent over 2 years were associated not only with white matter atrophy but also more cognitive decline on measures of global cognition, language, and executive abilities, as well as higher rates of conversion to AD compared with MCI subjects with no psychiatric symptoms. Thus, the white matter changes elucidated by the presence of depressive symptoms may be interpreted as a shared early pathological process of AD rather than representative of neuroanatomical changes associated with depression alone. Post hoc analyses revealed that within the NOSYMP group, subsequent development of psychiatric symptoms at 2-year follow-up was associated with greater right frontal white matter atrophy (p \u03ed .033), a trend toward greater right temporal white matter atrophy (p \u03ed .053), and higher rate of conversion to AD (47% vs. 27%; 2 \u03ed 4.19, p \u03ed .041). This finding lends further support to the hypothesis that the development of new psychiatric symptoms in MCI may be a symptom reflecting the underlying progression of AD pathology.\nThe strengths of this study include the prospective design in which each subject acts as his/her own control and measurement of intraindividual rates of change yield greater sensitivity to detect subtle brain changes over time. Several limitations should also be acknowledged. First, the acquisition of MRI scans from multiple centers raises the possibility of interscanner and software variability. However, a standardized MRI protocol was used across all 59 sites to maximize cross-site comparability (28) . Second, although the current study focused on depressive symptoms, there was significant comorbidity in the DEP group, with almost 80% of subjects endorsing at least one other symptom on the NPI-Q. Further, the ADNI protocol specifically excluded patients with clinically significant depressive symptoms constituting a diagnosis of major depression. However, the prevalence rates of depressive and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in our sample are comparable with those reported in other large MCI cohorts, including the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database (56) and the populationbased Cardiovascular Health Study (57) . Moreover, as these symptoms are now recognized to be prevalent in MCI patients and may have predictive value in identifying individuals at higher risk of progressing to AD, the differences we found may even be underestimated. Third, even though the NPI-Q has been demonstrated to provide adequate test-retest reliability and convergent validity for assessing a broad range of neuropsychiatric symptoms (27) , it is not designed as a detailed or comprehensive measure of depressive symptoms; therefore, the inclusion of a more precise instrument is necessary for future studies of the depression risk for developing dementia. Fourth, the present study sample was predominantly Caucasian, male, and highly educated, which may limit the generalizability of the results to more demographically diverse community-based samples. Finally, future studies should examine subregions of the broad lobar atrophy reported here to further explore the neurobiological substrates of the complex relationship between depression and dementia in the elderly.\nAnalysis of serial MRI scans using TBM appears to be sensitive in tracking distinct patterns of brain changes within a population of MCI patients. Specifically, the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with greater atrophy in the frontal, temporal, and parietal white matter compared with MCI patients without any neuropsychiatric symptoms. These regions of increased atrophy may represent shared white matter mechanisms and indicate a greater severity or faster progression of AD pathology. Findings from this study lend further support to the hypothesis that depression may be a symptom of prodromal AD and thus may be useful as a surrogate clinical marker to identify those MCI subjects who are most likely to progress to AD. The number of subjects who maintained a diagnosis of MCI from baseline to 2-year follow-up (No conversion) and those who converted from MCI to AD by the 2-year follow-up visit (Conversion) are reported. Group differences in the prevalence (%) of subjects who converted to AD were assessed using Pearson chi-square tests.\nAD, Alzheimer's disease; DEP, subjects with depressive symptoms; DEP-Stable, subjects with depressive symptoms who remained depressed at 2-year follow-up; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; NOSYMP, subjects with no psychiatric symptoms; NOSYMP-Stable, subjects with no psychiatric symptoms who continued to exhibit no psychiatric symptoms at 2-year follow-up; OTHER, nondepressed subjects with other neuropsychiatric symptoms."}]
