Each individual completing requirements for a research doctorate from a university in the United States or Puerto Rico receives the SED. Research doctoral programs are oriented toward preparing students to make original contributions to knowledge in a field and typically entail writing a dissertation. Doctoral degrees such as the PhD, DSc, and research EdD are considered research doctorates and are covered by this survey; professional degrees (e.g., MD, DDS, JD, and PsyD) are not. For convenience throughout this report, the terms \"doctorate\" and \"doctoral degree\" are used to represent any of the research doctoral degrees covered by the survey. In 2008, 92.1% of the 48,802 new doctorate recipients completed the survey.
