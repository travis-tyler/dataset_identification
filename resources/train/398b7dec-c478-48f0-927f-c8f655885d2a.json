[{"section_title": "", "text": "Jobos Bay is the second largest estuary in Puerto Rico, but has more than three times the shoreline of any other estuarine area on the island. It is a natural harbor protected from offshore wind and waves by a series of mangrove islands and the Punta Pozuelo peninsula. The Jobos Bay marine ecosystem includes 48 km\u00b2 of mangrove, seagrass, coral reef and other habitat types that span both intertidal and subtidal areas. Mapping of Jobos Bay revealed 10 different benthic habitats of varying prevalence, and a large area of unknown bottom type covering 38% of the entire bay. Of the known benthic habitats, submerged aquatic vegetation, primarily seagrass, is the most common bottom type, covering slightly less than 30% of the bay. Mangroves are the dominant shoreline feature, while coral reefs comprise only 4% of the total benthic habitat. However, coral reefs are some of the most productive habitats found in Jobos Bay, and provide important habitat and nursery grounds for fish and invertebrates of commercial and recreational value. The Jobos Bay watershed covers 137 km\u00b2 of the South Coastal Plain of Puerto Rico, and drains surface water runoff and groundwater directly to Jobos Bay. From Spanish Colonial times up to the 1970's, almost the entire coastal plain of the Jobos Bay watershed was under sugarcane cultivation. Over the past 35 years, sugarcane lands have been steadily converted to fruit and vegetable cultivation or entirely removed from agricultural cultivation. Today, cultivated lands in the Jobos Bay watershed only comprise 11% of the area's total land cover. The watershed is overwhelmingly rural with vegetated lands, including grassland, forest and shrub, covering 70% of the landscape. The 32,000 residents of the Jobos Bay watershed live in low density residential communities that are located throughout the area. Among other industries, Jobos Bay hosts two electric power generation plants, a petroleum refinery, and several major chemical and pharmaceutical facilities. For the purposes of this analysis, the Jobos Bay watershed was divided into nine hydrologically discrete subwatersheds. An evaluation of each subwatershed's contribution to predicted sediment and pollutant loading to Jobos Bay is included in this report. Three subwatersheds of Jobos Bay account for over 75% of the predicted annual sediment discharged to Jobos Bay. They include the R\u00edo Seco and Quebrada Coqu\u00ed waterways as well as several diffuse sources near the Barrio Jobos district. These same three subwatersheds, with the addition of the Upper Salinas subwatershed, are responsible for 85% of both the predicted annual total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads to Jobos Bay. The Upper Salinas subwatershed contributed the largest predicted loads of total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids compared to all other subwatersheds in the study area. As expected from these pollutant load predictions, the Upper Salinas subwatershed contains the highest population and most agricultural lands in Jobos Bay. In order to assess the benefits of conservation practices to the health of near-shore coral reef ecosystems, a comprehensive monitoring approach must be implemented in Jobos Bay. Two distinct monitoring efforts have been designed to characterize the ecology of Jobos Bay and its surrounding waters; one measuring water quality and sediment, and the other surveying reef fish and benthic habitat. Water column samples are taken monthly at each of the four NOAA System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) sites, in order to leverage the existing nutrient and water quality data at these locations. In addition, a stratified random sample design has been implemented for sediment sampling throughout the bay. Sediment grabs (n=44) have been taken across four sampling strata, 10 in each zone, and again at the four existing SWMP sites. Sediment sampling will be carried out before and after conservation practices are implemented on the watershed to detect potential concentration changes in pesticides and metals of agricultural concern. As part of the comprehensive monitoring plan, NOAA proposes a reef fish and habitat monitoring effort for Jobos Bay. A stratified random sample design will be employed to investigate 100 sites inside and outside of the bay. NOAA dive teams will collect several types of fundamental, n stu, data on reef fishes and benthic habitats at each site. Visual surveys are conducted along 25 m long by 4 m wide (100 m\u00b2) belt transects and include data on abundance and size-frequency of fish species as well as benthic floral and faunal composition. NOAA expects to conduct yearly surveys to characterize Jobos Bay's living marine resources and describe species distribution changes over time in Jobos Bay. page v list of Tables  Table 1. ..................................................................................4 Table 2.1.

In 2002, the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force identified the need for action at the local level to reduce key threats to coral reefs in each of the seven states and territories which possess significant coral reef resources. Local Action Strategies (LAS) were developed by Puerto Rico's local and federal agency representatives in 2003. The CEAP work in Jobos Bay directly addresses a LAS goal related to land-based sources of pollution by \"reducing loss of live coral reef cover through the promotion and implementation of integrated watershed and land use management practices.\" This effort highlights the interaction between upland and coastal ecosystems and involves a collaborative partnership between USDA and NOAA to address spatially complex natural resource issues."}, {"section_title": "OBJECTIvES", "text": "The primary objective of the Jobos Bay CEAP study is to determine the environmental effects that agricultural conservation practices implemented by farmers on the upland may have on coastal waters and the associated coral reef ecosystem. Chapter 1 -Introduction page Specific objectives to be addressed in Jobos Bay by CEAP partners include: 1. Estimate benefits of conservation practices currently present on the landscape. 2. Estimate effects of conservation practices in terrestrial and aquatic species and habitat. 3. Quantify changes in water quality, sediment chemistry, and coral ecosystem response from implementation of conservation management practices. 4. Estimate the need for additional conservation practices and the benefits that could be realized if appropriate conservation practices were implemented on all cropland and poultry farms. 5. Simulate alternative options for implementing conservation programs on croplands and poultry farms in the future. An initial plan of work has been created that defines the responsibilities of CEAP partners in order to address these specific objectives. Responsibilities were assigned based on each agency's traditional area of expertise and can be summarized by the following: \u2022 ARS leads research to quantify the effects of specific conservation practices on the delivery of water, sediment, and chemicals from agricultural lands to surface and shallow ground waters. \u2022 NRCS serves as the lead coordinating agency for the project and conducts outreach activities with the conservation partnership. NRCS also assists the Puerto Rico Land Authority in development and implementation of innovative conservation practices with farmers. \u2022 NOAA leads efforts to define the state of Jobos Bay water quality, benthic habitats and living marine resources.

The second largest estuary in PR, Jobos Bay has a total surface Chapter 1 -Introduction page area of just over 25 km\u00b2. Jobos Bay is classified as a coastal plain estuary that was formed by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age. The rising seas invaded the low-lying coastal river valley and created the shallow embayment that is now Jobos Bay. It is a natural harbor protected from offshore wind and waves by a series of mangrove islands in the southwest and Punta Pozuelo in the southeast. Jobos Bay features diverse marine habitats, including mangroves, salt marshes, seagrasses and coral reefs. The Jobos Bay watershed reaches as far as 11 km inland and has a total catchment area of 137 km\u00b2. The watershed contains several centers of low density urban development and hosts an estimated total population of 32,000 people (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001). The predominant land use is agriculture, including diversified production of agricultural commodities such as plantains, bananas, papayas, sorghum, corn and hay, and animal operations with poultry and some beef cattle. Water quality and conservation concerns related to agricultural practices are important in the Jobos Bay watershed and may influence coral reef ecosystem health. Preliminary studies reported that pesticides and fertilizers applied in agricultural fields were being transported to the bay (Field et al., 2002). Increasing industrial and commercial growth in the watershed has also been recognized as a concern to Jobos Bay's ecosystem health. There are two landfill operations within the watershed. The regional landfill, operated by BFI, is located in the middle of the watershed and is expected to broaden to twice the size of its original plans; while the other is on the eastern edge of the watershed in Guayama. Other major industries such as Chevron Phillips, Ayerst-Wyeth, IPR Pharmaceuticals, Colgate-Palmolive and ProChem maintain operations in the watershed (Field et al., 2002). Two of Puerto Rico's five power production plants operate within the Jobos Bay watershed."}, {"section_title": "DOCUMENT ORGANIZATION", "text": "This report addresses the three main contributions of NOAA/CCMA's involvement in the CEAP study of Jobos Bay: \u2022 Chapter 2.

Reef fish and Habitat Monitoring Plan", "text": "The last chapter of this document describes the Biogeography Branch's proposed plan to monitor reef fish and benthic habitats in Jobos Bay. This document was generated in fulfillment of NOAA's Year 1 Tasks as described in the Plan of Work agreed upon by CEAP partners (NOAA, 2007a). Fundamentally, Summit to Sea is the process of synthesizing the best available data on the resource conditions of a study area and using predictive models that are most appropriate for that data. It is an adaptive scheme that can be applied to any geographic location at varying scales. Summit to Sea is not an exhaustive modeling effort, but instead should be utilized as an initial screening tool to build more refi ned models and fi eld studies upon. Summit to Sea uses a GIS-based approach that links patterns of landscape use in coastal watersheds to sediment and pollutant loading predictions at the interface between terrestrial and marine environments. Widely accepted water resource models are employed to estimate sediment and pollutant loads for land use and other activities on the watershed. Summit to Sea analysis highlights specifi c watersheds and terrestrial areas that are most likely to contribute sediment and pollutant loads to nearshore coral reef ecosystems. As a result, terrestrial areas that are particularly threatening to marine habitats are identifi ed. The outcome of Summit to Sea analysis is an inventory of coastal land use and predicted pollution threats, consisting of spatial data and descriptive statistics, which allows for better management of coral reef ecosystems. The analysis described in this report uses the evolving Summit to Sea application for the characterization of coastal watersheds and implements its approach in the Jobos Bay watershed. Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page delineation: 1) the entire area draining to Jobos Bay, which will be referred to as the Jobos Bay watershed for the remainder of this document; and 2) the subwatersheds of the Jobos Bay watershed. Each subwatershed is linked to a single point of discharge, while the Jobos Bay watershed is an aggregation of all points of discharge to Jobos Bay."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "A collection of four 12-digit USGS Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC) was identified as the Jobos Bay watershed and the HUCs were merged to define the terrestrial boundaries of the study. Subwatersheds were delineated for this area from a hydrologically corrected 30 m (1 arc-second) digital elevation model (DEM) using N-SPECT. The DEM was acquired from the National Elevation Dataset (USGS, 1999) and represents filtered bare ground readings. Before implementing N-SPECT's delineation module, the locations of National Hydrography Dataset streams were manually embedded into the DEM using analysis tools provided in ArcGIS. Elevation grid cells that corresponded with stream lines were reduced by 2 m less than the minimum value in that area (Figure 2.1). This process, referred to as \"stream burning\", made certain that predicted drainage water flowed continuously across the landscape through mapped river beds. In addition, HUC watershed boundaries were artificially raised in the DEM to ensure agreement between HUCs and the subsequent N-SPECT generated subwatersheds. The prepared DEM was then ingested into N-SPECT's watershed delineation module to derive Jobos Bay subwatersheds. N-SPECT relied upon several traditional ArcGIS hydrology functions. For each grid cell in the DEM, the direction of overland flow (FlowDirection) and the number of cells flowing into each adjacent downstream cell (FlowAccumulation) were defined. Using this flow network, all cells that flowed to a common point were aggregated as a subwatershed (Basin) and the maximum cell within each basin was identified as the point of discharge. Refer to the N-SPECT Techncal Gude (NOAA, 2004) for more detail."}, {"section_title": "Runoff and Pollutant Modeling", "text": "A component of Summit to Sea analysis is evaluation of the threat to coral reef ecosystems from land-based sources of sediment and nutrients. N-SPECT was employed to combine spatial information on the terrestrial environment, such as elevation, slope, soils, precipitation and land cover, to derive estimates of stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution. Two types of estimates were calculated for the watershed: 1. Local Contribution -amount of runoff or pollutant contributed by each individual grid cell. 2. Accumulated -total amount of runoff or pollutant accumulated at each grid cell when considering cells upstream as well. Jobos Bay watershed runoff and pollutants were evaluated on an annual basis, so all calculations reflect yearly estimates. N-SPECT was executed on 30 x 30 m grid cells; as a result, landscape features or land use activities smaller than 900 m\u00b2 may not be accounted for in this analysis. Runoff and sediment modeling of the Jobos Bay watershed was achieved with a series of water resource models. N-SPECT defined the equation's parameters from spatial data on the physical environment using a cell-by-cell approach. N-SPECT utilized the Soil Conservation Service Runoff Curve Number (SCS-CN) method described in Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds: Techncal Release (USDA, 1986) as the basis for its runoff estimates. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) (Renard et al., 1997) was used to evaluate annual erosion in the watershed. RUSLE provided gross erosion estimates that were used to describe the local effects of soil erosion at each grid cell. However, Williams' (1977) sediment delivery ratio equation was necessary to figure 2.1.

With land cover as a proxy, pollutant loadings were determined by applying pollutant contribution coefficients, also known as unit loads, to land cover classes. In other words, the total areas of each land cover class within a subwatershed were scaled by coefficients that corresponded to expected pollutant loads per unit area. Analysis was based on a land cover grid generated by the Puerto Rico GAP Analysis Project (PRGAP, 2006) through classification of enhanced Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. The PRGAP Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page land cover's exhaustive classification categories were aggregated to 10 general classes that are used in NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP). This aggregation allowed for the use of default pollutant coefficients provided in the N-SPECT documentation (NOAA, 2004). One exception was the reduction of the grassland class's coefficients for TN, TP and TSS in order to reflect the unmanaged nature of grasslands common in the Jobos Bay watershed. See Table 2.1 for the land cover classes and corresponding pollutant coefficients used in this analysis. This procedure does not account for duration or intensity of rainfall, but instead uses annual mean rainfall. The N-SPECT Techncal Gude (NOAA, 2004) describes a procedure that improves estimate accuracies by deriving local pollutant coefficients from water quality sampling data. Similar to Burke and Sugg (2006), the N-SPECT default coefficients were accepted due to a lack of water quality sampling data required to derive local pollutant coefficients for the Jobos Bay watershed. The maximum accumulated loads of sediment, TP, TN and TSS were associated with each subwatershed's point of discharge. These discharge points, with accompanying pollutant loads, acted as summary statistics for all the activities occurring on the watershed. The points of discharge were assumed to be the only interface between terrestrial runoff and the waters of Jobos Bay. Although this is a simplification of the mechanisms of non-point source pollution, these point values were considered to be reasonable approximations of land-based sources of pollution to marine waters. Without an understanding of the margin of error in the prediction estimates, using exact values is discouraged. It has been shown that N-SPECT over-estimates loads due to an inability to model sediment and nutrient attenuation within the watershed (Burke and Sugg, 2006). The watershed discharge values are not absolute. Instead, values of runoff, sediment, TN, TP and TSS are relative and can be compared to each other, but not with estimates derived from other techniques. For this reason, predicted pollutant loads in this report are regularly reported as a percentage of the total loadings rather than mass values or concentrations."}, {"section_title": "Equaton", "text": "Where: Q = runoff (in) P = rainfall (in) S = potential maximum retention after runoff begins (in) I a = initial abstraction (in) The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) (Renard et al., 1997) was used to evaluate annual erosion in the watershed:\nWhere: A = average annual soil loss (tons/acre) R = rainfall-runoff erosivity factor K = soil erodibility factor L * S = length slope factor C = cover-management factor P = support practice factor Sediment delivery ratio (Williams, 1977) was necessary to evaluate how much eroded soil was actually transported downstream: SDR 1.366 *10 11 * DA 0.0998 * ZL 0.3629 * CN 5.444\nWhere: SDR = sediment delivery ratio DA = drainage area (km\u00b2) (at the cell level rather than the watershed) ZL = relief-length ratio (m/km) CN = SCS curve number"}, {"section_title": "WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Environmental Setting", "text": "The Jobos Bay watershed is primarily comprised of the low-relief South Coastal Plain of Puerto Rico, but reaches elevations of greater than 700 m (2,297 ft) at its landward boundary. Many of Jobos Bay watershed's physical characteristics are attributed to the presence of two of Puerto Rico's Central Interior Mountain Ranges to the north, La Cordillera Central and La Sierra de Cayey. These mountains serve as a barrier to the moisture-laden northeast trade winds and give rise to a zone of low precipitation throughout the southern coast of Puerto Rico. Mean annual rainfall between 1990 and 2006 was 958 mm (37.7 in.) at the Aguirre rain gauge station located in the watershed (NCDC, 2007). For this same time period and station, September was recorded as the wettest month, with an average rainfall of 152 mm (6 in.), while March was the driest month, with an average rainfall of 30 mm (1.18 in.) ( Figure 2.2). The Jobos Bay watershed is located in the Subtropical Dry Forest Zone, the most arid ecological life zone in Puerto Rico (Ewel and Whitmore, 1973). The parched vegetation is almost entirely deciduous and forms a complete ground cover on most soils. Past land uses, especially abandoned sugar cane fields, support man-modified vegetation that is characterized by a complete grass cover and sparsely distributed tall trees with flattened spreading crowns. Temperatures in the Jobos Bay watershed are high throughout the year and show little seasonal fluctuation. The mean annual temperature is 26\u00ba C (78.8\u00ba F), with a maximum of 27.5\u00ba C (81.6\u00ba F) in August and a minimum of 24.3\u00ba C (75.7\u00ba F) in January (NCDC, 2007). The predominant wind comes from an easterly direction at mean speeds of 10 km/hr or less (McClymonds and D\u00edaz, 1972). The regular daily wind pattern is for low velocity northeast winds to give way to a more brisk southeast wind as the day progresses (Field et al., 2002). Due to Jobos Bay's dry climate and relatively low seasonal rainfall, surface runoff usually only occurs during the wettest months of the year, September through November (Ewel and Whitmore, 1973). As a result, most of the watershed's natural stream beds are only intermittently flooded throughout the year. R\u00edo Seco, in the east, is the only major river that discharges into Jobos Bay during the entire year. Qui\u00f1ones-Aponte et al. (1997) described that year-round streamflow downstream is limited by where most streams meet the highly porous fan delta deposits. At that point, the streamflow infiltration becomes the most important source of groundwater recharge to the underlying aquifer. The Jobos Bay watershed is within the South Coastal Plain alluvial aquifer that extends from the bedrock hills near the watershed's northern boundary to the coast. According to Qui\u00f1ones-Aponte et al. (1997), the aquifer can be divided into three hydrogeologic units: 1) a deep zone composed of weathered bedrock, 2) the principal groundwater flow zone of fan delta and alluvial deposits, and 3) an upper zone of sand and gravel. In the north, groundwater moves mostly unconfined through the upper zone; however, as the amount of fine-grained sediment increases coastward, the upper zone becomes confined from the principal groundwater flow zone (Rodr\u00edguez, 2006). These conditions create two discrete groundwater units in the coastal zone, a shallow aquifer between 3m and 23 m thick and a deep aquifer below. The shallow aquifer is believed to supply the mangrove complex at the watershed's coastal margins, while the deep aquifer may provide freshwater to the offshore mangrove islands that form Jobos Bay's southern boundary.  Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page Irrigation District, two primary irrigation canals distribute water from Patillas and Carite Reservoirs, northeast of Jobos Bay, to operations throughout the watershed. Both canals flow from east to west, with Canal de Guaman\u00ed in the north and Canal de Patillas in the south. Non-irrigation drainage canals were also constructed in order to reclaim wet areas for agriculture and to reduce mosquito breeding in response to the risk of malaria in the 1930's (Field et al., 2002). From Spanish Colonial times up to the 1970's, the Jobos Bay watershed was primarily used for agricultural production (Field et al., 2002). Almost the entire coastal plain of Jobos Bay was under sugarcane cultivation until the demise of Puerto Rico's sugarcane market during the 1960's. Over the past 35 years, sugarcane lands have been steadily converted to fruit and vegetable cultivation or entirely removed from agricultural cultivation. Today, cultivated lands in the Jobos Bay watershed only comprise 11% of the area's total land cover, which is 15 km\u00b2. However, the extensive sugarcane cultivation of the past has had a lasting impact on the landscape of the Jobos Bay watershed. Despite the historic prevalence of agriculture in the Jobos Bay watershed, existing land cover conditions are more indicative of an ecosystem in a natural state. Vegetated lands cover 70% of the landscape with grassland, forest and scrub/shrub accounting for 42%, 15% and 13%, respectively (Figure 2.3). The large amount of vegetated lands may lead to the inaccurate conclusion that the Jobos Bay watershed is a relatively pristine system. Inspection of aerial photography indicated that as much as 13.5 km\u00b2 of the area classified as grassland is revegetated agriculture lands (Figure 2.5). In addition, an unspecified amount of classified grasslands are actually used for livestock pasture. If these areas were considered a separate land cover type the amount of naturally vegetated land cover would be reduced by 10% to 15%. Re-vegetated agriculture fields and pasture have a higher frequency of disturbance and serve fundamentally different ecosystem services than naturally vegetated grasslands. A majority of the disturbed grasslands exist south of the irrigation canals, while the naturally vegetated grasslands tend to lie north of the canals in the foothills of the Central Interior Mountain Range. The 32,000 residents of the Jobos Bay watershed live in low density residential communities that are located throughout the area. Over two thirds of the population are residents of the municipality of Salinas in the western half of the watershed, while the remainder of the residents live in the municipality of Guayama in the east. The average population density in Jobos Bay is maintained at a comparatively low 234 people/km\u00b2 by large areas of open space between communities. The primary transportation routes through the area are Highways 52 and 53, with Route 3 servicing local traffic. A variety of industrial activities are distributed throughout the Jobos Bay watershed. Among other industries, Jobos Bay hosts two electric power generation plants, a petroleum refinery, and several major chemical and pharmaceutical facilities. For the purposes of this analysis, the Jobos Bay watershed was divided into nine hydrologically discrete subwatersheds. Each subwatershed has a unique set of surface water drainage, land cover and land use conditions that are described in the following individual sections. Moreover, an evaluation of each subwatershed's contribution to predicted sediment and pollutant loading to Jobos Bay is included in the following sections. Refer to Figure 2.6 for the subwatershed boundaries and an index of subwatershed codes and the corresponding page number of each section. Appendix A is a table describing summary statistics for each subwatershed assessed in this study. Appendix B displays the predicted values of surface water runoff, sediment, TN, TP and TSS in annual load (kg/yr) to Jobos Bay from individual subwatersheds. For the remainder of this document, all statistics and assertions about land cover, predicted sediment and pollutant loadings, and benthic habitats are the result of Summit to Sea analysis, unless otherwise noted.  (Figure 2.8). The coastal basin lacks a defined stream network, and is instead characterized by several distributed discharges of overland flow to the western edge of Jobos Bay. The Coastal Salinas subwatershed is dominated by two land cover types, wetland and high intensity urban development, 33% and 23% of the subwatershed respectively (Figure 2.7). The wetland complex at Punta Arenas, comprised of tidally flooded coastal lagoons and fringing mangrove, covers an area just under 1.5 km\u00b2. It is possible that these wetlands provide some natural filtration of ground and surface waters that may enter from the agricultural operations conducted in the adjacent subwatershed. North of the Punta Arenas wetlands is a residential community situated around a protected cove with several active marinas. None of the urban development in this area is served by public sewer facilities, but as an alternative uses individual sewage disposal systems. Coastal Salinas supports a population density of 746 persons/ km\u00b2; the highest densities for any subwatershed in the study area. Additionally, the 2,461 permanent residents in the area all live within 500 m of the shoreline of Jobos Bay. As a result, the residential area of Coastal Salinas has the Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page second highest road density (5.6 km/km\u00b2) of all the subwatersheds in this study. Figure 2.9 displays the percent of watershed-wide total loads of sediment, TN, TP and TSS to Jobos Bay. Coastal Salinas only contributes around 1% of Jobos Bay's total load for each of the four pollutants assessed. Local contributions of pollutants from each 900 m\u00b2 grid cell are represented in Figure 2.10. Pollutant loadings from this subwatershed are minimal in comparison to other subwatersheds in the study area because Coastal Salinas is only a fraction of the size. However, a large proportion of this watershed's pollutants are likely discharged directly into the estuary due to a lack of vegetated buffer between residential development and Jobos Bay. In addition, the impacts of the individual sewage disposal systems are not well understood for this community in Puerto Rico and may have a more deleterious effect than predicted in this analysis. The eastern portion of the Coastal Salinas subwatershed in Figure 2.10 is depicted as having no local contribution to predicted pollutant loads. A shortcoming of N-SPECT is that coastal wetlands and standing water are not considered during pollutant modeling. As a result, local contribu- Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page tion output surfaces lack data in these areas regardless of the specific characteristics of the wetland feature. Throughout this analysis, N-SPECT outputs indicate that coastal mangrove complexes contribute no pollutant loads. However, there has been no research in Jobos Bay to characterize the mangroves as either sources or sinks of pollutants. Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page SW 2 -Upper Salinas The Upper Salinas subwatershed (SW2) covers 22.6 km\u00b2 of the western Jobos Bay watershed. Its northern and western boundaries are defined by the drainage divide separating R\u00edo Nigua's catchment area from that of Jobos Bay's ( Figure 2.12). The entire basin is located on the Salinas Fan Delta (Rodr\u00edguez, 2006) and has very little topographic relief. No natural stream channels exist, but a series of irrigation canals deliver surface waters to a single point of discharge in western Jobos Bay. The Upper Salinas subwatershed contains the largest amount of human-altered landscape of all the other Jobos Bay subwatersheds. Cultivated land and urban developed land uses make up 56% of the subwatershed, while an additional 33% is grassland areas that have likely been re-vegetated after past agricultural usage ( Figure  2.11). Upper Salinas is the location of 65% of the total cultivated land in the larger Jobos Bay watershed, comprising 9.5 km\u00b2 of the 14.7 km\u00b2 in the whole watershed. The subwatershed encompasses two communities with significant urban land cover, Salinas in the west and Coco in the north. Salinas and Coco combine to account for over one third of the total population of the Jobos Bay watershed, 12,272 of the 32,096 permanent residents. As a result of these two population centers, Upper Salinas has a higher average road density (6.1 km/km\u00b2) than all of the other subwatersheds surrounding Jobos Bay. Unlike the residential areas of Coastal Salinas, urban development in this subwatershed is connected to the municipal sewer system. The Salinas Speedway, an automobile racetrack located in the center of the subwatershed, is classified as high intensity urban development. It is not well understood what contribution the Speedway has to the overall pollutant loading in this watershed and may be a potential source of contaminants, such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Consistent with the trend described in USDA (1986), conversion of naturally vegetated lands to impervious or less pervious urban cover in Upper Salinas does contribute a larger volume of surface runoff to Jobos Bay. The subwatershed contributes a predicted average of 324 million L/km\u00b2 of runoff each year, the most of any subwatershed in the study. Furthermore, Figure 2.13 provides several statistics about the proportion of pollutant loading that the Upper Salinas subwatershed is responsible for in Jobos Bay.  The Upper Salinas subwatershed had the largest predicted loading for TN, TP and TSS, with 19,000 kg/yr, 3,000 kg/ yr, and 438,000 kg/yr, respectively. These predictions are again consistent with USDA (1986) findings that indicate urban and agricultural watersheds contribute most to pollutant loads. In contrast, the subwatershed was attributed with a much smaller proportion of the overall sediment load to Jobos Bay, at 8% of total load. This 8% is considerably less than the 24%, 25% and 26% contributions of three other subwatersheds of comparative size (SW4, SW7 and SW8) discussed later in this report. Larger amounts of cultivated lands regularly induce higher sediment loads due to reduced vegetative cover and soil tilling. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the lack of topographic relief throughout the Upper Salinas subwatershed. With an average slope of less than 1\u00ba, the required energy to transport sediment in runoff may not be available. Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page SW 3 -Central Aguirre The Central Aguirre subwatershed (SW3) has a total area of 16.5 km\u00b2, one third of which is covered by intertidal lands. The northern reach of the basin begins just south of the convergence of Highways 52 and 53. It widens as it extends southward towards Jobos Bay until a long serpentine coastline of over 20 km forms the southern boundary of the watershed (Figure 2.16). Most of the coastline is formed by the Mar Negro wetland complex, but it also extends beyond the Central Aguirre waterfront and shipping port. Similar to many subwatersheds in Jobos Bay, the Central Aguirre subwatershed has no defined stream channels and as a result discharges surface waters to Jobos Bay at several locations. A diversity of land cover types exist on the Central Aguirre subwatershed, including agriculture, industry, residential development, and natural forested and wetland areas. The dominant feature in the watershed is Mar Negro's mangrove forests and associated tidal waterways and mud flats. These wetlands are protected as part of the Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. Mar Negro and another mangrove forest to its east comprise 32% of the subwatershed's land cover (Figure 2.15 (PRWRA, 1972;PRNC, 1972;PREPA, 1983). The Central Aguirre subwatershed had similar proportions of predicted loadings for sediment, TN, TP and TSS, but was not responsible for more than 10% of any pollutant discharged to Jobos Bay (Figure 2.17). The subwatershed was the fourth largest in area, but only a portion of its landscape was prone to pollutant-inducing land use types, such as agriculture and high intensity developed lands ( Figure  2.18). Although this analysis did not account for the filtration capacity of wetlands, it should be noted that much of the watershed's agriculture occurred upstream of the Mar Negro wetland complex. Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page SW 4 -Quebrada Coqu\u00ed The Quebrada Coqu\u00ed subwatershed (SW4) covers a total area of 24 km\u00b2, making it the third largest subwatershed in the Jobos Bay watershed. Highway 53 divides the basin approximately in half and defines two distinct geographic and topographic areas within the subwatershed (Figure 2.20). The north is characterized by the foothills of La Cordillera Central mountain range, while the south is a continuation of the low-relief South Coastal plain. The Quebrada Coqu\u00ed subwatershed is distinguished from most other subwatersheds in the study area by the presence of two perennial streams. The primary stream channel, Quebrada Coqu\u00ed, runs out of the mountain foothills and along the western side of the subwatershed. Quebrada Aguas Verdes drains a small area of the eastern subwatershed and joins Quebrada Coqu\u00ed just before it discharges into Jobos Bay. A 1 km\u00b2 mangrove basin forest, extending across several subwatersheds (SW3, SW4, SW5 and SW6), is formed by stream discharge at the subwatershed's southern edge. The landscape of Quebrada Coqu\u00ed subwatershed is dominated by grassland and scrub/shrub growth, 76% and 11% respectively (Figure 2.19). Much of the grassland in the north is presumed to be undisturbed natural vegetation around the foothills. However, the trend of historically cultivated land conversion to grassland is much more prevalent in the south of the watershed closer to the agricultural fields of Upper Salinas. Another type of cultivated land conversion in the Jobos Bay watershed is to residential development. Coqu\u00ed, the only residential  Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page community in the subwatershed, hosts a population of just under 5,000 residents in a 1.2 km\u00b2 area. The community is compactly developed with an average road density of 16 km/km\u00b2 and is served by a public sewer system. Although there is only limited cultivated land in the subwatershed, an extensive confined feeding operation exists in the foothills north of Highway 53. During 2002, an estimated 29 poultry farms, with 2 houses per farm, were concentrated in a 1.3 km\u00b2 area. Roubert (2001) reported that this aggregation of poultry farms produced 1.8 million chickens per year. Additionally, a small cattle farm operates just north of Coqu\u00ed. The Quebrada Coqu\u00ed subwatershed contributed substantial predicted loadings for all four pollutants assessed in this analysis. Figure 2.21 displays the predicted loading percentages and Figure 2.22 shows the source areas of pollutant contributions to Jobos Bay. Unlike any other subwatershed of Jobos Bay, SW4 contributed at least 15% of the total loadings for each pollutant. SW 5 -Quebrada Amoros The Quebrada Amoros subwatershed (SW5) is the largest area, 7.4 km\u00b2, of the four smaller subwatersheds in the Jobos Bay drainage basin. Quebrada Amoros subwatershed, along with SW1, SW6 and SW9, has a considerably smaller catchment area than the other five subwatersheds of the study area. The subwatershed boundaries are defined by areas of the landscape that drain to the Quebrada Amoros stream channel (Figure 2.24). Quebrada Amoros is an intermittent stream that delivers water to Jobos Bay during periods of elevated surface water runoff. The Quebrada Amoros subwatershed has the most homogeneous composition of land cover types in the entire Jobos Bay watershed. Grassland covers 84% of the subwatershed, while no other land cover type composes more than 3.5% of the landscape (Figure 2.23). Similar to SW4, the grasslands of the north are naturally vegetated around the foothills, but those grasslands on the coastal plain have been re-vegetated since past agricultural usage was ended. A fraction of the grasslands north of Highway 53 are pasture lands used for cattle grazing. The subwatershed has the smallest amount of developed land cover totaling less than 0.5 km\u00b2 of residential development. With 131 residents/ km\u00b2, only one other subwatershed of Jobos Bay has a lower population density (SW7). One addition to the small extent of built environment in the subwatershed is the presence of a golf course on the eastern boundary. The course straddles the divide between the Quebrada Amoros subwatershed and SW6; as a result it contributes to both subwatersheds' pollutant loadings.   \nJobos Bay is one of the few natural harbors on the southern coast of Puerto Rico. It is the second largest estuary in Puerto Rico with just over 25 km\u00b2 of surface area, but has more than three times the shoreline of any other estuarine area. The shallow embayment's southern boundary is formed by a series of mangrove islands and associated fringing coral reefs to the west, and the Punta Pozuelo peninsula to the east. Jobos Bay's irregular shape and varied circulation patterns have induced three ecologically unique estuarine zones. Similar to PRNC's (1972) delineation, the Inner Bay, Central Bay and Outer Bay are depicted in Figure 2.44. The Inner Bay is the eastern-most zone of the estuary and is enclosed by the Puerto Rican mainland and Punta Pozuelo on three sides. It experiences the least water exchange with the open ocean as it connects only to the Central Bay on its western side. The Inner Bay is the shallowest of the zones with an average depth of about 3 m; however depths range from less than 1 m on the shelf near the mouth of the Inner Bay to 8 m in the dredged channel near the south shore (NGDC, 2007) (Figure 2.45). R\u00edo Seco, the primary year-round surface water input to Jobos Bay, drains on the northern coast of the Inner Bay. A silty bottom is regularly stirred up by the daily winds and creates a persistently turbid water column (PRNC, 1972). The Central Bay is the largest and most complex estuarine zone of Jobos Bay. Unlike the mostly enclosed Inner Bay, the Central Bay has regular water exchange with the Caribbean Sea. The mangrove islands Cayos Caribe and Cayos de Barca, which form the southern boundary, allow Caribbean waters to pass through their shallow channels during incoming tides. Furthermore, Boca del Infierno, a natural channel of 4 m depth, provides an unobstructed exchange of water with the Caribbean Sea. The Central Bay has an average depth of approximately 5 m, but varies widely between the mangrove forests at the bay edges to the Aguirre Navigational Channel through the middle. The Aguirre Navigational Channel is the most distinct bottom feature located in the Central Bay. The 10 m to 15 m deep channel is open to the Caribbean Sea in the west between Cayos de Ratones and Cayos de Pajaros, and runs east until it reaches Central Aguirre, near the entrance to the Inner Bay. The Outer Bay zone of Jobos Bay is characterized by its exposure to the Caribbean Sea to the west and restricted flow with the Central Bay. The Outer Bay is distinguished from the Central Bay by extrusion of the mainland at Punta Arenas. A 10 to 14 m deep channel allows water exchange between the adjacent estuarine zones. Cayos de Ratones form the southern boundary of the Outer Bay and are the western-most mangrove islands in Jobos Bay. The zone has an average depth of just over 4 m. Given its open exposure to the Caribbean Sea, the Outer Bay is most influenced by the ocean currents outside of Jobos Bay. The North Equatorial Current, flowing from east to west, is the dominant current along Puerto Rico's southern coast. It brings ocean water to Jobos Bay that enters at the surface through channels between the mangrove islands and along the bottom through the Aguirre Navigational Channel. Considering the arid conditions in the watershed and lack of surface flow to Jobos Bay, most of the bay's water comes from the open ocean. Under prevailing southeasterly wind conditions, surface water is flushed from the Inner and Central Bays in a southwesterly direction, promoting extensive upwelling along the eastern shore of the Inner Bay (PRNC, 1975). Surface flow westward in the Central Bay is augmented by ocean currents passing through Cayos Caribes and Boca del Infierno. Surface currents in Jobos Bay average 10 cm/s, but may range from 0.0 to 25 cm/s. Refer to Figure 2.46 for a more detailed visualization of currents in Jobos Bay. The generalized tidal flow pattern is for flood tides to move water eastward and ebb tides to generate westward flow. The mean residence time for a water mass in the Inner Bay is approximately 5.5 days, while residence in the other estuarine zones may be shorter. The tidal excursion, the average distance traveled by a water particle, during a half-tide cycle is 574 m in the Inner Bay and 667 m in the Central Bay. Tides in Jobos Bay are primarily diurnal, but are slightly complicated by a second tidal cycle that occurs every 13.3 days (PRWRA, 1972). Field et al. (2002) reported that average tide heights range from 18 cm below mean sea level to 12 cm above, amounting to a 30 cm range. JBNERR staff has been operating water quality monitoring sites in and around Reserve boundaries since 1995. Figure 2.47 displays the location of four sites in the Central Bay that the NERR staff routinely measure n stu temperature, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH and turbidity. In addition, monthly grab samples are taken for nutrients and phytoplankton pigments at these stations. The JBNERR monitoring effort is part of the NOAA System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP); a national network of monitoring sites to develop quantitative measurements of short-term variability and longterm changes in water quality, biotic diversity and land use characteristics of estuarine ecosystems (NOAA, 2006). The four SWMP sites are strategically located to represent the different marine environments of Jobos Bay; with two inside lagoonal features (Stations 9 and 10) and the other two in more exposed parts of Jobos Bay (Stations 19 and 20).  1995(NERRS, 2008. The median water temperature for all four SWMP sites was between 28.6 -29.0\u00ba C. Similar to water temperature, the other parameters have a relatively narrow range indicating there is little variability in water quality between SWMP locations. However, there was a marginal difference in medians for some water quality parameters between the sites within lagoons and the more exposed sites. For instance, salinities for the two sites within lagoons (Stations 9 and 10) ranged from 36 -36.8 psu, while the salinities outside of lagoons (Stations 19 and 20) were slightly less (34.5 -35.5 psu). Station 9 exhibits a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen (3.8 mg/L) compared to the range of the other three SWMP sites (5.4 -6.5 mg/L). Furthermore, Station 9 recorded the highest median values of every nutrient sampled for except nitrate (NO 3 ) and nitrite plus nitrate (NO 2 +NO 3 ). Appendix C displays medians for nutrients and phytoplankton pigments collected for Jobos Bay SWMP sites between 2002 and 2005.  "}, {"section_title": "Sediment Total Nitrogen", "text": "Total Phosphorus Total Suspended Solids Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page SW 6 -Northern Bay The Northern Bay subwatershed (SW6) covers 4.8 km\u00b2 of land that borders Jobos Bay's northern coastline. The subwatershed's upstream reach begins just south of Highway 53 and broadens as it extends southward. At the basin's seaward boundary, approximately 2.5 km of shoreline defines the southern edge of the subwatershed. The subwatershed is further described in the east by the drainage divide between the Northern Bay subwatershed and the catchment of R\u00edo Seco (Figure 2.29). The Northern Bay subwatershed has no defined permanently or temporarily flooded stream channels. Instead, networks of intermittently flooded wetlands in the form of narrow flood plains are spread throughout the center of the basin. These formations are commonly a result of periodic overland sheet flow through sparsely vegetated landscapes. A combination of bare soil, grass and shrubs characterize these areas in irregular-shaped bands running parallel to the flow direction. SW6 is the only subwatershed where these types of intermittently flooded wetlands occur. With a lack of a primary stream network, flow to Jobos Bay is by way of several distributed points of discharge. A variety of land cover types are present on the Northern Bay subwatershed landscape (Figure 2.28). Grassland is again the dominant land cover at 56% of the subwatershed, but other vegetated types such as scrub/shrub and wetlands account for 11% and 14% of the landscape, respectively. Two distinct wetland types exist in the subwatershed, one of which is discussed above. The primary wetland aggregation is a long strip of mangrove that narrows as it extends from SW5 to the mouth of R\u00edo Seco. This mangrove forest borders the entire stretch of the Northern Bay's shoreline, forming a buffer between Jobos Bay and all upland activities.   Cultivated lands represent a small amount of land cover, 9% of the subwatershed's area, but have the potential to increase in proportion. Just south of Canal de Patillas are three center pivot irrigation systems not currently in production. However, a review of 2004 and 2007 aerial photography revealed that these fields were subject to periodic clearing without commercial planting (Figure 2.27). If placed into production, cultivated land in the Northern Bay subwatershed could triple from the current 0.4 km\u00b2. The subwatershed has some urban development which is comparable to other subwatersheds with a population density and road density just above the Jobos Bay means for these metrics. A residential development is located along Route 3 in the southwest corner, comprising 8% of SW6. A portion of the golf course in the northern-most reach of the basin is represented in the land cover dataset as grassland, but may be more reflective of row crop agriculture due to nutrient and pesticide application. Under existing land cover conditions, the Northern Bay subwatershed contributes only 1% of the total loads for each of the pollutants assessed in this study (Figure 2.30). Wetland areas and growth of woody vegetation, such as forest and shrubs, maintain these low values of pollutant loads in the Northern Bay subwatershed (Figure  2.31).  Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page SW 7 -R\u00edo Seco The R\u00edo Seco subwatershed (SW7), encompassing 29.5 km\u00b2, is the largest delineated sub-unit of the Jobos Bay watershed. The R\u00edo Seco subwatershed is the northern most reaching subwatershed, and as a result includes terrain unique to that of the other subwatersheds in the study area (Figure 2.33). Unlike most other areas of the Jobos Bay watershed, the subwatershed is described by the well-defined drainage network of R\u00edo Seco and its associated tributaries. The R\u00edo Seco is the only major river system that discharges directly into Jobos Bay throughout the year. The headwaters of the river begin 3 km to 5 km into the foothills of the La Sierra de Cayey mountain range. The subwatershed's northern boundary is formed by the drainage divide between R\u00edo Nigua and R\u00edo Seco tributaries. As smaller streams converge and form R\u00edo Seco, the subwatershed narrows to a width of 0.5 km at its ultimate discharge into Jobos Bay. Highway 53 partitions the subwatershed into two distinct zones characterized by different topography, ecology and land cover. The northern portion, constituting 85% of the R\u00edo Seco subwatershed, is located in the foothills of the La Sierra de Cayey mountain range. The highest elevation throughout the entire study area, 715 m (2,346 ft), is reached along the northern boundary of the subwatershed. The higher elevations in the north are subjected less to the orographic effects that maintain a semi-arid climate in the majority of the Jobos Bay watershed. Precipitation ranges in the northern section (130 -175 cm/yr) are substantially more than that of the southern section (95 -130 cm/yr) of the R\u00edo Seco subwatershed. As a result, the northern portion is at the transition between the Subtropical Dry and Subtropical Moist ecological life zones, while the remainder of Jobos Bay lies completely in the Subtropical Dry zone (Ewel and Whitmore, 1973). The rugged landscape of the R\u00edo Seco subwatershed does not allow many of the land uses that are prevalent throughout the Jobos Bay watershed. The subwatershed's average topographic slope is 17\u00ba and is almost triple that of the next steepest subwatershed, SW4's 6\u00ba slope. However, south of Highway 53 is a 4 km\u00b2 strip of the subwatershed with a terrain more comparable to the majority of the Jobos Bay watershed that permits typical land use development. The R\u00edo Seco subwatershed is the most pristine basin in the study area with 97% of the total area being covered by vegetation (Figure 2.32). Uncommon in most of Jobos Bay watershed, the forested lands in the mountainous foothills populate 14.8 km\u00b2 of the 29.5 km\u00b2 (50% of the subwatershed). There are natural scrub/shrub and grass-   land extensions from the adjacent deciduous forests on an additional 22% and 25% of the area, respectively. Developed lands, including both residential and agricultural, make up just over 2% of the total land cover in the subwatershed combined. Urban development, with the exception of two small residential communities, is almost non-existent in the basin. This area has the lowest population density (33 people/km\u00b2) in Jobos Bay with a total of 988 residents. Furthermore, the subwatershed has the lowest road density in the study area (2.4 km/ km\u00b2). Extensive areas north of Highway 53 are without roads and offer little potential for future development until the infrastructure is first built. Considering R\u00edo Seco is the only major river system in the Jobos Bay watershed, the subwatershed has the highest modeled delivery of surface runoff to Jobos Bay (Appendix B). Additionally, the R\u00edo Seco subwatershed is predicted to deliver the highest sediment loads in the study area ( Figure  2.34). This can be explained by the presence of the mixedrelief foothills in a large portion of the subwatershed's northern reach (Figure 2.35 Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page hand, TP, TSS and to a lesser degree TN loads are all considerably lower than would be expected based on runoff volume alone. The subwatershed was responsible for 7% of TP and 9% of TSS, both substantially less than the three other subwatersheds of comparable size (SW2, SW4 and SW8). This is a function of the presence of naturally vegetated landscapes and lack of pollutant inducing anthropogenic activity in the subwatershed. Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page SW 8 -Barrio Jobos The Barrio Jobos subwatershed (SW8) encompasses a total area of 25.7 km\u00b2 on the eastern edge of the larger Jobos Bay watershed. The subwatershed's eastern boundary is formed by the drainage divide between the Jobos Bay watershed and the catchment area of R\u00edo Guaman\u00ed; while R\u00edo Seco's drainage divide defines the western boundary (Figure 2.37). Its landward reach begins just north of Highway 53 in the low foothills of La Sierra de Cayey. A portion of the runoff generated in the foothills is stored in Lago Melan\u00eda before it is distributed out of the subwatershed by the Canal de Patillas irrigation channel. A series of intermittently flooded streams, including Quebrada Melan\u00eda, carry surface waters to man-made drainage canals that empty into Jobos Bay's eastern-most shoreline. The Barrio Jobos subwatershed has the most even distribution of land cover types in comparison to the other subwatersheds of Jobos Bay. No single land cover dominates any portion of the basin. The patchy landscape has several aggregations of each land cover classification at different locations in the basin (Figure 2.36). Vegetated cover types prevail in the area with grassland, scrub/shrub, forest and wetland accounting for 80% of the total coverage. Although present in the west, cultivated lands only make up 1% of the subwatershed's total area. Developed lands in the Barrio Jobos subwatershed comprise 15% of the total area, most of which are high intensity development. High intensity developed lands in the subwatershed are one of two types; residential or industrial. Puerto Jobos on the Jobos Bay coast and, to the east, Barrio Jobos district of Guayama are the only two residential communities in the subwatershed. Their combined population of 5,705 residents is the largest and only substantial residential community on the eastern side Jobos Bay. The Barrio Jobos subwatershed residential and industrial development is supported by the third highest road densities in the entire study area, behind SW1 and SW2. In addition, the municipality of Guayama operates a landfill adjacent to Lago Melan\u00eda in the northern reach of the subwatershed. The most prominent land use features in the Barrio Jobos subwatershed are a diverse range of industrial activities. There are two centers of activity on the east edge of the subwatershed with related industries aggregated together. The northern center is home to several major pharmaceutical and chemical facilities owned by Colgate-Palmolive, Baxter Caribe and Ayerst-Wyeth. Less than 1 km south is a complex of energy-related industries that are located near the coastline bordering the Caribbean Sea. Chevron Phillips operates a petroleum refinery to produce gasoline from  Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page crude oil and adjacent to the refinery is a coal-fired power plant managed by AES Corp. AES Corp. sells the generated power to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. Barrio Jobos subwatershed was a major contributor to the predicted loading of sediment, TN, TP and TSS to Jobos Bay (Figure 2.38). The subwatershed was responsible for the second largest loads of TP (18%) and TSS (22%), only behind SW2. As a function of the patchy landscape of Barrio Jobos, localized pollutant contributions are distributed throughout the area (Figure 2.39). The long-term effects of concentrated industrial production of chemicals and pharmaceuticals are an important aspect of Barrio Jobos's contribution to the Bay that is not captured in this analysis. Chapter 2 -Summit To Sea Characterization page SW 9 -Punta Pozuelo The Punta Pozuelo subwatershed's 3.4 km\u00b2 form a peninsula that separates the protected waters of inner Jobos Bay from the Caribbean Sea. Punta Pozuelo connects to the Puerto Rican mainland by a 300 m wide shared border with the Barrio Jobos subwatershed (Figure 2.41). The subwatershed is the only basin in the study area that does not discharge its entire runoff into Jobos Bay. The peninsula lacks any substantial relief and is too narrow to allow surface runoff to aggregate and form major stream channels. Instead, surface waters generated by precipitation events discharge to the nearest shoreline by overland sheet flow. As a result, surface flow from the Punta Pozuelo subwatershed will be distributed between Jobos Bay and the Caribbean Sea. During rain events, a sediment plume drains west from the shallow coastal lagoons of Punta Pozuelo into Jobos Bay (A. Dieppa, pers. obs.). Punta Pozuelo can be characterized as a typical coastal community with areas of natural vegetation and low density residential development. The dominant land cover of the subwatershed is mangrove forests and accompanying tidal ponds and salt flats. When considered as a single landscape feature, these wetlands comprise 57% of the subwatershed's total area (Figure 2.40). This mangrove system is distributed along the low energy coastline that borders Jobos Bay; while the higher energy coast facing the Caribbean Sea is formed by sand beaches. Behind the beaches of Punta Pozuelo lie low intensity developed lands of a residential community. The community is home to 615 permanent residents making it the least populated subwatershed in the entire study area.  Moreover, with 2.8 km/km\u00b2 of roadways, only SW7 has a lower average road density. The upland areas not developed for residential use are primarily covered by a coastal scrub/shrub forest that covers 21% of the subwatershed area. A small marina is cut into the scrub/shrub forest at a man-made inlet connecting to Jobos Bay. The Punta Pozuelo subwatershed does not support any agricultural, commercial or industrial land uses. Furthermore, most of the drainage area is covered by natural vegetation. As a result, the small subwatershed contributes only negligible amounts of predicted pollutant loads to Jobos Bay and the Caribbean Sea (Figures 2.42 and 2.43). "}, {"section_title": "Benthic Habitat Summary", "text": "The Jobos Bay marine ecosystem includes 48 km\u00b2 of mangrove, seagrass, coral reef and other habitat types that span both intertidal and subtidal areas. Knowledge of Jobos Bay's benthic habitats came from the mapping efforts of Kendall et al. (2001) throughout Puerto Rico. NOAA's Biogeography Branch acquired aerial photography for the nearshore waters of Puerto Rico, including Jobos Bay, in 1999. Twenty-one distinct benthic habitat types within eight geographic zones were mapped directly into a GIS using visual interpretation of these orthorectified aerial photographs. An assessment of classification accuracy was conducted on the maps at locations within the project area that included the full complement of conditions representative of Puerto Rico. The maps were determined to be 93.6% (Kappa = 0.93) accurate overall, with accuracies in some categories of 100% (Kendall et al., 2001). Although the maps represent benthic conditions of nearly ten years ago, it is assumed that there has been no dramatic alteration to benthic habitat distributions since 1999. In fact, Field et al. (2002) reported that most of the existing habitats are representative of what was present a century ago, despite substantial alteration of the Jobos Bay watershed. It is likely that some habitat distributions have experienced a small degree of change; however the Kendall et al. (2001) benthic habitat maps are considered the best available data in Jobos Bay. Jobos Bay's variable environmental conditions have led to the establishment of several different benthic habitat types in the system. The Jobos Bay ecosystem is characterized by the interaction between four primary habitat types: mangrove forests, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), coral reefs and unconsolidated sediments. The presence of different benthic cover types tends to support a rich and complex assortment of marine fauna. Many organisms are not associated with a single habitat and instead move freely between different habitat types in order to satisfy daily forage and cover needs. Furthermore, an individual may use a number of habitats during different stages in its life cycle. For example, many fish species are born among the roots of fringing mangroves, but as the fish mature they migrate seaward and take up residence on the coral reef. Jobos Bay, with its diversity of benthic habitat types, hosts a variety of different marine species. Mapping of Jobos Bay revealed 10 different benthic habitats of varying prevalence, and a large area of unknown bottom type covering 38% of the entire bay (Table 2.3). The 18 km\u00b2 ribbon of unknown bottom was indistinguishable on aerial photography due to a combination of persistent turbidity and greater depths (Figure 2.48). It is believed that much of this unknown bottom is covered by SAV or mud depending on the regular environmental conditions. However, no comprehensive research has been completed in the area to definitively describe the bottom type. Of the known benthic habitats, SAVs are the most common, covering slightly less than 30% of the bay. Seagrass beds totaling 13 km\u00b2, and macroalgae to a much lesser degree of 0.7 km\u00b2, are the two types of SAV found in Jobos Bay. Seagrass beds cover 70% of Jobos Bay's shallows up to 3 m in depth (Field et al., 2002). Four types of seagrasses have been observed in Jobos Bay: turtle grass (Thalassa testudnum), manatee grass (Syrngodium filiforme), shoal grass (Halodule wrght), and paddle grass (Halophla decpens). The pattern of zonation observed in Jobos Bay is controlled by salinity, light availability and exposure to air. Generally, shoal grass inhabits only the shallowest areas, turtle and manatee grasses intermix on the shallower portions of the seagrass bed while turtle grass is the sole occupant of the deeper bed, and finally paddle grass grows in the much deeper areas (PRNC, 1975). Paddle grass was observed beginning at depths of 4 m, while no maximum depth was determined for seagrass growth in Jobos Bay (Garc\u00eda-Sais et al., 2003). The presence of seagrass is limited to locations where there is an adequate amount of sunlight to support photosynthesis.  Mangroves are a dominant feature of the Jobos Bay marine ecosystem and cover 12 km\u00b2; that is 25% of the entire bay. An inventory of Puerto Rico's mangrove resources indicated that Jobos Bay contained nearly 50% of this habitat on the southern coast of Puerto Rico (Mart\u00ednez et al., 1979). For that reason, Jobos Bay is considered a site of unique ecological value and fundamental in maintaining biodiversity in Puerto Rico. This emergent vegetation borders all of Jobos Bay's undisturbed shoreline and represents the transition between the bay and the upland, except at urban developments in Coastal Salinas and Central Aguirre. The influence of varied shore morphology, tides and river flow have created three different forms of mangrove forests in Jobos Bay. Hogarth (1999) describes these forms: \u2022 Tide-dominated -often referred to as fringe forests, are characterized by regular tidal inundation over a shallow intertidal zone and occur along the edges of the estuary. \u2022 Basin -on the landward side of fringing mangroves are large areas of mangrove with only infrequent tidal inundation. \u2022 Overwash -small mangrove islets that are completely overwashed by the tides. The mangrove forest forms are found in different biogeographic areas of Jobos Bay. In addition to the varied forest forms, tides and shore morphology give rise to salinity and depth gradients that control the zonation patterns of the three mangrove species of Jobos Bay. Jobos Bay has a consistent pattern of red mangroves (Rhzophora mangle) at the estuarine edge with black mangrove (Avcenna germnans) behind them in hypersaline areas and white mangroves (Lagunculara racemosa) behind them in areas of higher freshwater input (Field et al., 2002). The buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus) often populates the transition between the mangrove forests and upland vegetation (A. Dieppa, pers. obs.). The tall luxuriant mangrove forests found in other tropical areas are regularly limited in this part of Puerto Rico. Scarce surface runoff results in higher salinities and lower nutrient inputs than would be found in mangroves along coasts with more rainfall (Ewel and Whitmore, 1973). Of the remaining benthic habitat types listed in Table 2.3, both linear and patch reefs are some of the most productive habitats found in Jobos Bay. The less than 2 km\u00b2 of coral reefs comprise only 4% of the total benthic habitat, but provide important habitat and nursery grounds for fish and invertebrates of commercial and recreational value. Most of Jobos Bay's corals are in linear reef formations that are oriented parallel to the shore of the mainland. The Central Bay zone contains the bulk of coral reefs in the study area. In fact, each bay zone is characterized by a unique composition of benthic habitats and warrants further discussion (Appendix D). The Inner Bay zone of Jobos Bay is the least diverse area of benthic habitat types. Virtually, the entire shoreline of the Inner Bay is covered by fringing mangrove forests. Two separate mangrove basin forests exist beyond the mangrove fringe on the eastern and western extremes of the estuarine zone. The low elevations and small, but important freshwater inputs from drainage canals connected to Quebrada Melan\u00eda form a 1 km\u00b2 basin forest in the east (Figure 2.49). Similar conditions created by Quebrada Coqu\u00ed produce a slightly larger mangrove forest on the northwest shore of the Inner Bay. As a result of low tidal and riverine currents, these basin forests likely serve as sediment and nutrient sinks rather than sources for export (Hogarth, 1999). With the exception of a 0.5 km\u00b2 patch of seagrass in the middle of the zone, most of the Inner Bay's subtidal habitat is unknown. As discussed earlier, it is assumed that much of this unknown area is SAV and mud. Given the shallow depths of the Inner Bay, it is reasonable to suggest that this bottom type is predominantly seagrass. There is no coral reef coverage present in the Inner Bay zone of Jobos Bay. Unlike the Inner Bay, the Central Bay zone of Jobos Bay has a diversity of benthic habitats and biogeographic areas. Seagrass (25% of the zone), mangrove (24%), mud flat (6%), coral reef (5%) and macroalgae (2%) are all present in substantial quantities. There are two distinctive habitat features in the zone: the Mar Negro wetland complex and the southern fringing cays (Figure 2.50). The Mar Negro wetland complex, the largest aggregation of wetlands in the study area, is the source of the Central Bay coastline's indented shape. Several branches of coastal lagoon extend from Jobos Bay into the wetland area and are defined by mangrove fringe forests along the tide channels and seaward boundaries. These fringe forests are flooded daily by high tides and periodic storm surges, thus maintaining a stable salinity regime. Just behind the fringing mangroves are expansive areas of unconsolidated sediment with little to no vegetation. These large ponds are characterized by limited physical exchange with the surrounding waters of Jobos Bay and tend to contain higher levels of salinity. Closer to the landward margin, shallow upward sloping mud bottoms are exposed during low tides. These mud flats serve as the transition between the benthic habitats of Mar Negro and the upland landscape of Central Aguirre. Just 1 km offshore of Mar Negro is a linear formation of over 30 mangrove cays that run west from Punta Pozuelo to the edge of Jobos Bay. These reef-fringed, mangrove islands form the southern boundary of Jobos Bay and are aggregated into three groups referred to locally as (east to west): Cayos Caribe, Cayos de Barca and Cayos de Pajaros. The cays of Jobos Bay are an integration of coral reef, seagrass and mangrove habitats that conform to a pattern of zonation typical of Caribbean reefs (Figure 2.51). The back reef zone, the most landward feature of the cay, rises up from the deeper lagoon behind it. The shallow depths of the back reef, also referred to as reef flat, support large continuous seagrass beds and tear-shaped overwash mangrove forests. The mangrove islets are separated by channels of 3 -4 m depth with a strong flow of water running perpendicular to the linear reef (Garc\u00eda-Sais et al., 2003). The reef crest, a flattened segment of reef that is emergent during low tides, acts as a physical barrier  Kendall et al. (2001)). Jobos Bay is described by the Lagoon zone with its fringing cays on the Backreef zone. against wave action, allowing development of seagrass and mangroves on the back reef. Beyond the reef crest, at depths below 2 m, the upper fore reef zone is characterized by a diffuse spur and groove formation that extends to about 10 -12 m deep. The deeper fore reef is a steep drop-off wall that reaches to the base of the reef at 16 m depths (Garc\u00eda-Sais et al., 2003). A marine community assessment conducted by Garc\u00eda-Sais et al. (2003) on the fore reef of Cayos Caribe and Cayos de Barca resulted in an inventory of percent cover of sessile benthic biota. At both sites, algal turf was the predominant cover of 61 and 62%, but significant amounts of stony corals were also found at both sites, 20 and 21% cover. Stony corals included great star coral (Monastrea cavernosa), boulder star coral (Monastrea annulars), mustard hill coral (Portes astreodes), massive starlet coral (Sdastrea sderea) and several others of lesser cover. The Central Bay estuarine zone contains just less than 1.5 km\u00b2 of coral reef, with the reefs of the fringing cays accounting for 98.5% of that total. However, there are two small linear reefs not associated with the fringing cays at Cayo Puerca and Punta Colchones (Figure 2.52). These two reefs represent almost all of the corals located inside of Jobos Bay at 21,298 m\u00b2. Garc\u00eda-Sais et al. (2003) surveyed several sites along these two reefs and found almost no live cover of stony corals. They observed that these reef formations are relict staghorn coral (Acropora palmata) communities that are now mostly rubble overgrown with calcareous and turf algae. Throughout both the reefs, a green calcareous alga known as watercress alga (Halmeda opunta) was the main component colonizing available hard substrate. The Outer Bay is the smallest of the three estuarine zones of Jobos Bay, but hosts a variety of benthic habitat types. Seagrass is the primary benthic cover with a total area of nearly 5 km\u00b2 accounting for 64% of the zone's bottom. Most of the seagrass is located on a large, uninterrupted bed that extends 1 -1.5 km from the mainland shoreline at coastal Salinas (Figure 2.53). Unlike both the Inner and Central Bay zones, the mainland shoreline is without fringe mangroves. Instead, the mangrove forests are primarily all offshore mangrove islands. The zone's seaward boundary is formed by five mangrove cays referred to as Cayos de Ratones. These cays are a continuation of the fringing formation existing in the Central Bay and exhibit the same pattern of zonation. The linear reefs of the fringe cays are the only locations of substantial coral reef formation in the Outer Bay. The Outer Bay zone is the most comprehensively mapped area of Jobos Bay as only 16% has been described as unknown bottom. This is most likely a result of decreased turbidity in the water column from increased flushing by Caribbean currents. Based upon the mapping work by Kendall et al. (2001), little is known about the benthic habitats that lie outside of Jobos Bay. In the surrounding area 3 km from the edge of Jobos Bay, only 10% of the seafloor has been characterized. Aside from a small linear reef, and patches of colonized pavement and macroalgae, 90% of the bottom was classified as unknown. This area has an average depth of 17 m and an unrestricted interaction with the flow of the Caribbean Sea. of a tape measure to the anchor or weighted buoy line and proceeds away from the location at a random compass heading (0 -360\u00ba). The diver gathers data for all fishes within 2 m of either side of the transect line and up to the estimated transect ending (25 m). In mangroves, the diver swims along the mangrove edge, looking 2 m into the mangrove and 2 m away from the mangrove. The diver is allowed to look forward to the end of the transect in order to minimize measurement bias attributed to diver movements. The tape measure is unreeled as the diver swims forward and records fish seen in holes, under ledges and in the water column without altering the habitat structure in any manner. As the diver progresses each new observed species is recorded and the number of individuals per species is tallied in 5 cm size increments up to 35 cm using visual estimation of fork length. Fish over 35 cm are estimated to the nearest centimeter and recorded individually. The second diver trails the fish census diver and records data on small-scale benthic habitat composition and structure along the 25 m transect. The habitat diver places a 1 m\u00b2 quadrat at five separate positions that have been randomly chosen before entering the water (Figure 4.1). The diver records information on habitat structure type, depth, and percent cover of abiotic and biotic features. Percent cover is obtained as if looking at the quadrat in a two dimensional plane instead of three dimensions. The second diver can also collect additional information such as surveys of coral bleaching, conch, lobster and urchin. All data is entered into a standardized form throughout the survey. low visibility Alternatives NOAA recognizes that portions of Jobos Bay, particularly the inner bay, may have reduced visibility due to suspended sediment throughout the water column. The sampling methods described in this report assume the divers are able to clearly see 2 m on either side of them while swimming the transect line. If it is determined that this visibility is not regularly attainable in Jobos Bay, alternative sampling techniques will be explored. Some alternatives may include narrowing the belt transect's width or employing a fish capture technique such as push nets, traps or gill nets."}, {"section_title": "SURvEy DESIGN Population to be Sampled", "text": "The Biogeography Branch will investigate the 117 km\u00b2 associated with Jobos Bay. Although conservation practices will only be altered in a subwatershed that drains directly to Jobos Bay, fish populations depend on and interact with surrounding areas over a large spatial scale. To comprehensively monitor fish that depend on Jobos Bay and determine the effect of conservation practices, samples are taken from both inside and outside Jo-Chapter 4 -Reef Fish and Habitat Monitoring Plan page bos Bay. The survey domain, which defines the population to be sampled, is chosen to include as much area around Jobos Bay as possible (Figure 4.2). Considering logistical constraints, the maximum distance offshore to be sampled is 3 km from the nearest bay feature. Bathymetric data derived from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC, 2007) was used to define the geographical areas within safe repetitive diving limits (30 m)."}, {"section_title": "Sampling Design", "text": "A stratified random sample design was employed to improve sampling efficiency and allow rigorous inferences to the study area or designated strata. The survey domain was partitioned into 18 strata based on two spatial variables: benthic habitat and geographic zone. Benthic habitat type and geographic zone were selected because they were covariates of reef fish in past Biogeography Branch studies and allowed the survey domain to be divided into regions of homogenous variance. Kendall et al.'s (2001) benthic habitat map for Puerto Rico was used to aggregate the survey domain into four general habitat types: hard bottom, soft bottom, mangrove and unknown (Figure 4.3A). Hard bottom features were characterized by bedrock, pavement or coral reef. Soft bottom features were characterized by sand, seagrass or macroalgae. Unknown features were areas that Kendall et al. were unable to classify in the original benthic habitat map. Menza et al. (2006) described several case studies that effectively parsed the survey domain according to benthic habitat to improve sampling efficiency. Geographic zones, the other spatial stratification level, were consistent with the areas described for stratifying sediment samples (see section 3.2 Survey Design). In addition, a fifth geographic zone was included to capture the area directly outside of Jobos Bay (Figure 4.3B). Each zone was characterized by distinct conditions of estuarine circulation, ranging from an almost entirely enclosed water body to open ocean. An overlay of both spatial variables resulted in 18 unique combinations of benthic habitat type and geographic zone. Summary information for each stratum is provided in Table 4.1. Using the Biogeography Branch's sampling protocol described in this document; an estimated 100 sampling sites can be surveyed in a 2-week mission. These 100 sites were divided into two separate sampling groups: permanent (n=28) and random (n=72) (Figure 4.4). The 28 permanent sampling sites were intentionally located Chapter 4 -Reef Fish and Habitat Monitoring Plan page in each strata and intended to be representative of the entire survey domain. Permanent sites were also positioned in areas of long-term interest, including co-location with sediment core sites as well as NOAA's active SWMP sites. During periods of fiscal constraint, the permanent sites will function as priority sampling locations to maintain a longterm monitoring program. The other 72 sites were chosen at random throughout the survey domain. During the initial sampling mission, random samples will be distributed evenly among the 18 strata with 4 samples in each stratum. The variance in each stratum can then be evaluated and a Neyman allocation will be employed with the 72 random samples on successive survey missions. A Neyman allocation, or optimal allocation, distributes sampling units according to both stratum size and the standard deviation of metric measurements within a stratum. The advantage of having random sites in addition to permanent sampling sites is two-fold; it allows for a complete spatial characterization of the survey domain whenever possible and provides the ability to prove/disprove the permanent sites as being representative of the survey domain.
