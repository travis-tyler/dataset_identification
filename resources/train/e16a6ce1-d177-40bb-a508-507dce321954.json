[{"section_title": "", "text": "In addition to its primary responsibilities within the EEZ, NMFS also plays a supportive and advisory role in the management of living marine resources in coastal areas under state jurisdiction, provides scientific and policy leadership in the international arena, and implements international conservation and management measures as appropriate. NMFS stands at the forefront of fisheries research, both domestically and internationally. For example, the first of a new class of four 208-ft. fisheries survey vessels (FSVs), the Oscar Dyson, was commissioned on 28 May 2005, and began operations in Alaska waters. On 25 July 2006, NOAA took delivery of the second new FSV, the Henry B. Bigelow, which will be home-ported in New England. The Bigelow will replace the 45-year old Albatross IV and will support NOAA research efforts in the conservation and management of fisheries and marine ecosystems primarily in northeastern U.S. waters. Two other ships, the FSV Pisces and the FSV Bell M. Shimada, are currently under construction. These high-technology ships are among the most advanced fisheries research ships in the world. They will greatly expand the capabilities of the NOAA fleet by meeting modern NMFS data collection requirements, including the exacting quietness standards set by the International Council for Exploration of the Seas-to avoid influencing the survey results by disturbing the fish and mammals being studied. The delivery of these vessels demonstrates the lengthy planning and construction process. The Oscar Dyson was put in service 7 years after the first appropriation was made by Congress, and several years of planning and justification preceded the appropriation. Although keeping the planning and budgeting responsive and coordinated was a challenge, the requirements laid out in this Plan cannot be met without continued availability of stateof-the-art ships. These ships provide scientists with the advanced research platforms required for at-sea data collections supporting stock assessments. Above: The FSV Henry B.

For more than 135 years, the agency's long-term commitment to scientific excellence via internal and external peer-reviewed scientific publications has materially advanced marine science and policy. Since 1871, Federal fisheries scientists have collected, researched, analyzed, and published peer-reviewed data on the Nation's living marine resources and marine ecosystems and on the benefits they provide. Using this peer-review process, important agency findings are published in many highly respected journals. NMFS uses its science quality assurance program to consistently monitor and review NMFS research efforts. Further, this program identifies gaps in infrastructure, facilities, and resources that may affect the productivity of NMFS scientists. The NMFS Scientific Publications Office (SPO) and the Scientific Editor ensure the editorial and scientific integrity of the agency's research products: peer-reviewed journals, professional papers, and technical memoranda. These products and other regional NMFS publication materials serve as the basis for agency scientific reports, regulatory documents, and technical presentations for fishery scientists and managers, commercial and recreational fisheries interests, environmental groups, the information community (media), and the public. Thus, the agency's comprehensive scientific research and publishing efforts provide the foundation for developing sound policies that govern the use, protection, restoration, and conservation of living marine resources, marine habitats, and related aquatic environments. The NMFS Scientific Publications Office produces the noted Fishery Bulletin, one of the top peer-reviewed marine science publications in the world, as well as other peerreviewed publications such as the Marine Fisheries Review and the NOAA Professional Paper NMFS series. With worldwide free distribution, in printed paper and electronic formats, these publications are vital sources for the advancement of marine science."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "This Plan represents an integration of multiple perspectives on the fisheries research needs of American society. The NMFS research planning process itself includes extensive communication with our partners (e.g., Fishery Management Councils (FMCs), the states, and other governmental organizations) and our constituents (e.g., fishermen and others who are concerned about resource conservation or seafood). NMFS research programs are periodically reviewed by informal and formal program reviews, with both internal and external participation. NMFS scientists serve on FMC scientific committees, plan development teams, and boards where research inadequacies are identified firsthand. Regulatory and judicial proceedings also identify information needs that are then incorporated in the research programs. Finally, NMFS scientists work with international counterparts to identify and fill information gaps that constrain management of marine resources both domestically and on the high seas. Planning takes place at multiple levels in government, and requires both awareness of and consistency with the goals and perspectives specific to the different levels. In response to the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, President Bush delivered the U.S. Ocean Action Plan to guide Federal actions to make the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes cleaner, healthier, and more productive (CEQ 2004). This sets the parameters for the plans of all Federal agencies. At the top level within the Department of Commerce, a 5-year strategic plan addresses the varied responsibilities of the Department: to maximize U.S. competitiveness; foster science and technological leadership; and observe, protect, and manage the earth's resources (DOC 2005). Within NOAA, a strong central Strategic Plan (NOAA 2005a) sets forth the missions, goals, and expectations of the organization. A companion Research Plan focuses the underlying research. Each NOAA line office (e.g., NMFS) has its own subordinate plan to outline the mission it serves and link with appropriate parts of the NOAA Strategic Plan. Within the NOAA line offices, additional plans are prepared to implement specific programs, such as those programs legislated by Congress. This NMFS Strategic Plan for Fisheries Research (NSPFR) is such a document. This Plan addresses the intent of Congress as expressed in legislation while maintaining consistency with the research and management framework established within NOAA. As such, this document incorporates research planning elements across several NOAA dimensions: from the overarching NOAA Strategic Plan and the NOAA Research Plan, to the NMFS Strategic Plan (NSP), and lastly, to the six Fisheries Science Center research plans. Lying across this planning agenda is a NOAA 20-Year Research Vision, which presents a longer-term perspective of the environmental and ecological challenges our Nation faces and the technological and scientific advances we expect will help meet those challenges (NOAA 2005b). All these plans must comport with out-year budgets; resource, staffing, and facility plans; fleet replacement and operation plans; and budget and execution plans. And all of these plans are influenced by natural and anthropogenic events and emerging technologies. The scope of the NSPFR is specific to the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) with respect to fisheries, habitat, and certain protected resources research. It does not include the regulatory and enforcement components of the NMFS mission, nor those research elements conducted under non-fisheries mandates, such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This Plan covers current research activities as well as strategies for improving data collection, analysis, and dissemination. Its relationship to other NOAA plans is presented in Appendix A."}, {"section_title": "LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND", "text": "It is important to note that the recent 2006 reauthorization of the MSFCMA contains new provisions for the agency's fisheries research enterprise, and these will be incorporated into its portfolio. Details on the agency's current implementation efforts on the reauthorization are available online at http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ msa2007/implementation.htm. Requirements for this Plan stem from the reauthorized MSFCMA as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA), on 11 October 1996. Section 404 (Fisheries Research) of the MSFCMA calls for the Secretary of Commerce to develop and publish in the Federal Register a strategic plan for fisheries research for the 5 years immediately following such publication.

The MSFCMA requires the NSPFR to address the following research areas: to: -Biological research concerning the abundance, trends, and life history of fish stocks. Social, cultural, and economic relationships among fishing vessel owners, crew, U.S. fish processors, associated shoreside labor, seafood markets, and fishing communities. Development of a fishery information base and an information management system under Section 401 that will permit the full use of information in the support of effective fishery conservation and management."}, {"section_title": "COMPREHENSIVE FISHERY RESEARCH PROGRAM THE SCIENCE ENTERPRISE", "text": "NMFS develops scientific information needed for the stewardship of the Nation's living marine resources. The six NMFS regional Science Centers encompass 25 principal laboratories, employing more than 1,550 scientific and support personnel and another 380 full-or part-time contractors, who conduct a comprehensive, interdisciplinary science program. The scope of their work is multidisciplinary and broad in terms of space and time. The Science Centers provide the scientific knowledge base on which NMFS formulates stewardship policies in concert with its six Regional Offices. Research at NMFS laboratories supports resource management in NOAA, interstate fishery commissions, and other agencies, and the recommendations of the FMCs, to facilitate informed decision-making about marine resource management decisions for sustainable fisheries, aquaculture, protected resources, endangered species, and habitat. The NMFS science enterprise has three primary components. In addition to the laboratories and people, the third component is fisheries survey vessels. These purpose-built, dedicated research vessels meet primary data needs, working in cooperation with chartered vessels from the academic and private industry fleets. The new vessels feature acoustic quieting to reduce behavioral responses of species targeted in surveys and to minimize noise interference to hydroacoustic signals. The ships have the speed, power, and endurance to perform acoustic and trawl surveys at the shelf edge. They support a full scientific complement, and support laboratories, computers, and multiple gears (e.g., trawl, longline, and oceanographic). Dedicated to fisheries missions throughout their 30-year service life, the continuity of service of these ships protects the integrity of long-term resource surveys. These ships are critical to the mission and are the primary method for collecting fisheriesindependent data for most species. In addition to ships, other tools and methods used to amplify and leverage the efforts and intellect of scientists include a full array of sampling equipment, observation systems, and software and analytical systems. Because fisheries are managed on a regional basis, the focus of NMFS research programs varies across Science Centers. Each Science Center develops its own annual research priorities, based on regional and national needs. The research plans are updated as necessary in consultation with the Regional Offices, FMCs, Program Offices in NMFS headquarters, and NOAA's constituents. The Science Center research staffs are generally organized into teams that focus on specific issues or areas of expertise. The Office of Science and Technology coordinates the overall NMFS integrated research program. The NMFS Science Board, composed of the six Science Center Directors and chaired by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology, is responsible for ensuring the integrity and quality of scientific research. The NMFS Science Board addresses national science issues and programs and develops science policy for the agency. All components of the science enterprise provide the agency with information that is comprehensive, objective, credible, and effectively communicated. Responsibility for the total scientific effort lies with the Director of Scientific Programs and Chief Science Advisor. This Director reports directly to the NOAA Assistant Administrator for Fisheries and supervises the Science Center Directors and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology. The NMFS science program collaborates extensively with academia, often through cooperative agreements and grants. These partnerships enhance and extend NMFS' research capability. Many NMFS scientists serve as university adjunct professors, and this relationship enhances the ability of agency scientists to remain on the cutting edge while it expands the teaching capability of the university and brings NMFS expertise into the academic community. Academic scientists also play an important role in the periodic review and evaluation of NMFS research program quality and relevance. The Science Centers work in cooperation with other Federal and state agencies, international entities, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector (including the recreational and commercial fishing industry). The scale and scope of NMFS research varies. Some major research initiatives focus on the needs of the fishing industry and are performed jointly with industry. For instance, joint studies of harvesting methods and development of more effective fishing gear are under way to reduce wasteful bycatch. Other research initiatives focus on the needs of the FMCs (e.g., determination of the correct mesh size for a specific fishery or determination of the timing and area limits for a specific closure) and on the needs of the NMFS Habitat Conservation field offices to meet their scientific and management mandates under the Essential Fish Habitat provisions of the MSFCMA.

The purpose of the NMFS scientific enterprise is to ensure that the science products produced and disseminated by the agency are of the highest possible quality. These products reach the decision process in various ways, including FMC meetings, technical committee meetings, written documents published in print or on the Internet, presentations to policymakers in other fora, and workshops convened to address specific problems."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH COMPONENTS", "text": "The MSFCMA mandates strong action to conserve and manage fishery resources that contribute to the food supply, economy, and health of the Nation's marine ecosystems. MSFCMA provisions require NMFS to end overfishing 1 , rebuild all overfished stocks, and conserve essential fish habitat through research and consultations on Federal and state actions that may adversely affect such habitat. These are among our primary stewardship responsibilities. NMFS is responsible for ensuring that management decisions are based on the highest quality scientific information on the biological, social, and economic status of the fisheries. This includes species' responses to environmental changes, species interactions, exploitation, and other human activities that affect species and their habitat. Social, cultural, and economic behaviors and incentives that influence human/marine interactions are also addressed. The information is used not just for current management decisions, but also to conserve resources and anticipate future trends, ensure future utilization opportunities, and assess the success or failure of the agency's management efforts. NMFS is also responsible for ensuring that this information and the subsequent management decisions are understood and their validity accepted by user groups and other constituents. To accomplish this, we provide roles for commercial fishermen in our fisheries research, including operating charter surveys and participating in research program reviews. Less visible roles include providing firsthand information and knowledge about changes in species abundance and distribution, ideas and testing of bycatch reduction technology, and reviewing assessment methods and results. The research priorities of NMFS may be grouped into the four major areas (with several subareas) defined by Congress (see Legislative Background): I.

RESEARCH TO SUPPORT FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT", "text": "Living marine resources currently support extensive commercial, recreational, and subsistence uses. In 2005, commercial landings by U.S. fishermen totaled 9.6 billion pounds valued at $3.9 billion. The 2005 U.S. marine recreational fish catch was an estimated 423 million fish taken on an estimated 83 million fishing trips by about 12 million anglers ( Figure 2) (NMFS 2007a). Once the value-added benefits are calculated, the commercial fishing industry contributes over $33 billion annually to our economy and about $20 billion a year is spent on recreational marine fishing activities (NMFS 2007a). U.S. consumers spent about $65.2 billion for fishery products in 2005, and based on 2001-2003 data (most recent available), the United States is the third-ranked nation in the consumption of seafood. In addition to these benefits derived from the exploitation of our living marine resources, non-consumptive uses-such as diving on coral reefs and whale-watchingprovide additional benefits to many Americans.  U.S. fisheries operate throughout the United States in all coastal waters, in and beyond the U.S. EEZ, and in many rivers and lakes. The total domestic commercial landings of finfish and shellfish increased from less than 3 million metric tons (MMT) in the early 1950s to over 4 MMT in 2005 (Figure 3). Domestic landings of all commercial fishery products reached a record high of 4.8 MMT (10.5 billion pounds) in 1993 and 1994 at a value of $3.8 billion. Alaska pollock ranked first in terms of weight and lobster ranked first in terms of total revenues in 2005 (NMFS 2007a). The resulting commercial landings combined with aquaculture production make the United States the sixth-ranked fishing nation, with 4 percent of the worldwide landings in 2004 (most recent year for which data are available) (NMFS 2007a). NMFS has undertaken an aggressive plan of action to improve its ability to assess more of the 530 stocks and stock complexes that are identified and referenced in Federal fishery management plans. To begin implementation of this Marine Fisheries Stock Assessment Improvement Plan (SAIP) (NMFS 2001), the agency received an increase of $1.7 million in FY 2001, increasing to a total of $25.7 million in FY 2006. NMFS does not routinely assess the status of many of the 530 stocks and stock complexes identified in the 2005 Status of U.S. Fisheries report (NMFS 2007b), because generally they are not targeted in fisheries and have a low probability of becoming overfished. Based on a ranking system, the SAIP indicates that stocks with the longest history of catches, or value, rank high for having the best data collection programs and the most comprehensive assessments. This ranking system demonstrates that NMFS prioritizes its allocated research dollars to con-   5 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 Year duct status determinations for those target species most vulnerable to overfishing. The SAIP also indicates that modernization of stock assessments will require expansion of cooperative research programs with the fishing industry and other partners. The SAIP is available online at http://www.st.nmfs.noaa. gov/StockAssessment/index.html. NMFS scientists are also working cooperatively with the interstate marine fisheries commissions, state agencies, FMCs, fishing industries, and fishing participants to improve the way data are collected and used to monitor commercial and recreational fishing impacts on fish stocks of the United States. NMFS supports a number of regional fisheries information programs that coordinate data collections, data management, and data dissemination among the state and Federal partners. NMFS is working with its partners to better integrate the data collections conducted in each region into a comprehensive regional monitoring program that more effectively supports the data and statistical needs for stock assessments and fisheries management by all of the partners. NMFS works with its partners to gather, audit, and edit data using rigorous quality control protocols, and they participate in regularly scheduled reviews of data and statistics to identify and resolve possible problems. The state and Federal agencies are working to improve the integration of final data and statistics into regional information systems that can be readily accessed by stock assessment scientists and fishery managers. The cooperative regional programs are striving to provide statistics that stock assessment scientists and fishery managers can combine geographically, temporally, and spatially as needed to support their analyses for different species or fishery segments. For commercial fisheries, NMFS requires participants to obtain permits and report data needed to assess fishing impacts. Permit data systems are essential for effective management of commercial fisheries, and NMFS is leading the development of an enhanced electronic database system that will improve the processing and issuing of commercial fishery permits in all regions. NMFS is designing an electronic registration system that will eliminate unnecessary redundancies in the entry and storage of data and allow implementation of operational changes that will further increase efficiency, improve data quality, and reduce the reporting burden for participants. NMFS also supports and enforces mandatory reporting programs for both commercial seafood dealers and commercial fishing vessel operators that provide the data needed to assess fishing impacts on fish stocks. Wholesale and retail dealers report the quantity and value of seafood products purchased on a trip-by-trip basis. Commercial fishing vessel operators complete and submit logbook records for each vessel trip that provide landings data along with area and effort information. NMFS is working with Top: Pacific ocean perch caught by an AFSC survey trawl for grounfish. Right: A Pacific ocean perch in the Gulf of Alaska. Photos: NMFS. its partners to implement electronic reporting systems that speed the delivery of landings data by federally permitted dealers and vessel operators. NMFS is designing these systems to use unique trip identifiers that can link each dealer trip report to the appropriate vessel trip report. More efficient matching of dealer and vessel trip reports will help reconcile differences and allow further improvements in the accuracy of commercial fishing data provided for use in stock assessments and fishery management decisions. NMFS is also playing a lead role in developing more effective sampling survey methods for the monitoring of recreational fishing impacts. Since 1979, recreational fishing effort and catch have been monitored primarily through a combination of shoreside surveys of fishing access points and telephone surveys of coastal residential households. In recent years, NMFS has led cooperative efforts to test and implement more efficient surveys of fishing effort on for-hire vessels that are based on probability sampling of vessel lists developed from state and Federal vessel registration programs. NMFS has also been working cooperatively with some states to develop more efficient surveys of shore and private boat angler fishing effort that are based on probability sampling of angler lists developed from state licensing programs. Based on recommendations received from a 2006 National Research Council (NRC) review funded by NMFS (NRC 2006a) and from a national assessment of the information needs of fishery managers and stock assessment scientists, the agency is working with the interstate fisheries commissions to initiate a formal Federal-state collaborative process that will reassess and redesign how recreational data are collected, analyzed, and used. The redesign process has been refocused to address specific requirements and timelines for \"Recreational Fisheries Information\" set in the January 2007 bill that reauthorized the Magnuson Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (MSA). The reauthorized MSA requires NMFS to implement an improved survey program by January of 2009, it specifies the need for a collaborative process that addresses the NRC recommendations, it directs NMFS to work with the states to implement Federal-state registry programs for marine recreational anglers, and it directs NMFS to utilize phone/address directories developed from the registry programs in future telephone surveys. Over the next two years, work will focus on resolving a number of potential problems with the sampling and estimation designs used in the current surveys, and on identifying changes needed to ensure that future surveys are appropriately designed to provide statistics that are readily applicable to various kinds of management decisions and that are useful for social and economic analyses. To ensure that a range of viewpoints and expertise will inform the process, NMFS will seek to establish and maintain a dialogue with those most involved and affected by the data, including anglers and various other constituent groups. Recognizing the need to implement an improved survey system in a timely fashion, NMFS will execute the plan at a pace that will ensure that redesign efforts are transparent, inclusive, and well-documented. NMFS and its partners are committed to building an improved recreational fisheries statistics program that will gain the confidence of scientists, fishery managers, and the recreational fishing community. NMFS' research efforts focus on understanding, protecting, and restoring fishery resources and the habitats on which they depend at both ecosystem and species-specific scales. These efforts include mapping, spatial analyses, geographic information systems (GIS), and fishery and ocean habitat modeling and characterization, as well as an evaluation of ecosystem approaches to focus on spatially explicit models and further research into food web relationships. Additionally, with the increasing need to seek new management approaches to enhance and conserve essential fish habitat (EFH), NMFS is conducting studies on adaptive management techniques through the identification and use of potential marine reserve areas or refugia (i.e., using areas closed to fishing activities for both recovery and research), and experiments on no-take and limited-take zones and time-area closures. NMFS is also exploring the research potential of Marine Protected Areas to facilitate important experiments in marine ecology and to support recommendations made by the National Research Council (NRC 2001). NMFS is conducting research on stock enhancement techniques (i.e., supplementing wild stocks with marine species raised in captivity) to help reduce rebuilding times for overfished species and recover endangered and threatened marine species. Further, NMFS is evaluating the potential impacts of artificial reef/habitat as well as commercial and recreational fishing activities on habitat and fisheries production. In combination with evaluating these impacts, public education plays a key role in increasing public awareness and support of our living marine resources. An important aspect of NMFS' research efforts is the incorporation of innovative new technologies and techniques. For example, NMFS is cooperating with other NOAA elements to enhance survey capabilities through research and development of an omnidirectional hydroacoustic system. Airborne LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology shows promise for identifying near-surface pelagic species. Underwater laserline technology is being developed to facilitate habitat characterization and species identification. Additionally, NMFS uses manned submersibles and remotely operated vehicles to evaluate deepwater species and their habitats. NMFS provides fishery managers with the information needed to make scientifically sound decisions. To support fishery conservation and management, NMFS scientists are actively pursuing the research described in the following sections.

Biological research concerning the abundance and life history of fish stocks", "text": "Understanding the factors affecting the abundance and life history of fish stocks requires collecting catch and effort data, measuring biological characteristics, and developing biostatistical analyses for a variety of Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and non-FMP species of exploited fish and invertebrates. Fishery-dependent and fishery-independent (i.e., resource survey) sources provide age and size samples, catch composition, and indices of relative abundance. These data are key inputs to stock assessments, fishery management regulations, and the production of status reports for living marine resources and their fisheries. The biology and life history of species has taken on greater significance in managing the Nation's living marine resources since passage of the MSFCMA. Describing and understanding migration and distribution patterns, predator-prey relationships, habitat use, age, growth, mortality, age structure, sex ratios, reproductive biology, and responses to environmental variability are key to developing harvest strategies that produce high yields at low risk to the long-term sustainability of the resource base. A variety of scientific methods are used, including aging with the use of otoliths (ear bones), histological analyses of gonads, food studies, and observations of spawning behavior. Studies of early life history and fishery oceanography are necessary to understand recruitment dynamics, with the aim of predicting incoming year-class strength. There is also an increasing need to identify and characterize discrete stocks. The use of molecular DNA techniques, life history parameter estimates, and knowledge of ecological habits can aid in determining stock boundaries. This will enable scientists to correctly structure stock assessments and design stock-specific management measures. The production of accurate stock assessments requires three major categories of quantitative information: 1) trends in relative abundance of the fish population, 2) total catch, and 3) life history data (growth, maturity, and natural mortality). dardized, statistically designed surveys. These surveys are conducted by NOAA's Fishery Survey Vessels and, in some cases, chartered vessels specially outfitted to conduct these surveys using a variety of case-specific methods, ranging from standardized versions of fishing gear to acoustics, plankton, submersibles, and other sampling tools. In some fisheries, the fishery catch per unit effort can be standardized to provide a relative index of the trend in stock abundance. landed catch in each commercial and recreational fishery, and from the observer programs that monitor discarded bycatch. and is often augmented through cooperative research between government agencies and the fishing industry. These three categories of data are combined using mathematical models to derive best estimates of vital statistics, such as historical and recent trends in the numbers and biomass of the resource, recruitment levels (number of young fish entering the fishery each year), and the exploitation rate (the fraction of the stock alive at the beginning of the year that is killed by fishing). Significant gaps in any one of the three categories of information will compromise the quality of the assessment. The SAIP defined three tiers for improving the quality of stock assessments: Tier I: Improve stock assessments by using existing data: a) for core species, by conducting assessments that are more comprehensive, more thorough, more timely, better quality controlled, and better communicated. b) for species of currently unknown status, by mining existing databases of research vessel survey data and/or commercial and recreational statistics for archival information for new analyses to evaluate status determination criteria. Tier II: Elevate stock assessments to new national standards of excellence by: a) upgrading assessments for core species to at least an adequate level (today the list of core stocks matches the list of 230 stocks included in the Fish Stock Sustainability Index [FSSI]). This requires improvements in all aspects of the assessment enterprise, including ships, surveys, fishery monitoring, observers, analysis, and related components. b) conducting baseline monitoring for all federally managed species (about 900 stocks are included in fishery management plans). Tier III: Next generation assessments will: a) assess all federally managed species or species groups at an adequate level and improve the accuracy and timeliness of forecasts for core stocks by including more detailed biological information. b) explicitly incorporate ecosystem considerations such as multispecies interactions and environmental effects. Shortly after publication of the SAIP, NOAA set a performance measure to reduce the number of stocks with unknown status. Between 2000 and 2006, the status of 25 major stocks changed from \"unknown\" to \"known.\" For 2007, this performance measure is being replaced by a measure designed to increase the percentage of living marine resource stocks with adequate assessments. This measure is tracked for the 230 core stocks also tracked with the FSSI. Details and updates on the FSSI performance measure are available online at http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/statusoffisheries/SOSmain.htm. For these 230 stocks, an adequate assessment is considered to be an assessment that has enough information to make status determinations and track trends in stock abundance and mortality, and has been updated within the past 5 years. In FY 2006, 52 percent of the FSSI stocks have adequate assessments. Many of these assessments are required to be updated more frequently than every 5 years to support implementation of fishery management plans. Although adequate assessments can generally support the implementation of fishery management plans, improvements can be made by elevating more assessments to the Tier III level. For example, inclusion of environmental information can help explain and forecast fluctuations in the growth and recruitment to improve the accuracy of short-term potential yield and longer-term rebuilding times. Stock assessment models are being expanded to include interactions among species in the ecosystem, and models of ecosystem-wide food webs are being developed to guide fishery managers. By quantifying the status of assessments for each of the important species and the amount of resources required to raise the assessment status to the next tier, NMFS has been able to determine the budgetary and associated resources that are needed to improve stock assessments.\nThe following surveys are planned: Current LME with chartered fishing vessels. off the West Coast using the NOAA FSV Miller Freeman. This survey will be conducted in collaboration with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. central California.

Interdependence of fisheries or stocks of fish", "text": "Living and nonliving components of an ecosystem are linked through physical and biological relationships-e.g., by food chains or shared habitat use. Understanding these relationships is important if we are to successfully manage our living marine resources in a holistic manner. The status of a fish stock and the merits of alternative harvest strategies cannot be determined in isolation; an ecosystem-based approach is needed to take into account the various factors that affect the status of a stock and the importance of a stock to other components of the ecosystem, as recommended in the Ecosystems Principles Advisory Panel's Report to Congress (EPAP 1999). The abundance, productivity, and spatial distribution of a fish stock depend on a number of factors, including environmental conditions; habitat quantity and quality; the abundance and status of its competitors, predators, and prey; and possible symbiotic relationships. The objective of biological studies on ecosystem interdependence is to understand the functional relationships among ecosystem components. To do so requires that we determine consumption rates and the functional form of feeding interrelationships involving resources, as well as spatial and temporal variability in abundance and habitat use. NMFS is developing recruitment and multispecies models that incorporate food web and environmental information. The models can be used to help predict long-term impacts of various harvest strategies and environmental trends on yield potential and species composition, as well as to investigate effects of predation and compensating biological changes on longterm stability, production, and structure of fish communities under different harvest strategies and environmental regimes. Research activities include: \u2022 Marine food web research through field and laboratory studies of fish consumption rates, feeding selectivity patterns, food preference, and nutritional values of various foods. \u2022 Stock size, food availability, and predator-prey dynamics. \u2022 Fisheries oceanography to determine how changing environmental conditions cause changes in biological components of ecosystems. \u2022 Food-web-based dynamic mathematical models that are used to examine how abundance of fish stocks, marine mammals, and other ecosystem components react to changes in environmental conditions and alternative fishery management measures.

Identifying, conserving, and mapping of essential fish habitat (EFH)", "text": "The long-term viability of living marine resources depends on conservation and protection of their habitat. The effects of habitat degradation are often insidious, and some losses are not well understood. Other impacts are obvious. For example, we know that dams for hydroelectric power generation and water diversion for agriculture have restricted some valuable anadromous fish runs, and chemical contaminants cause tumors and reproductive dysfunction in fish (e.g., winter flounder in Boston Harbor and English sole in Puget Sound). We also know that habitat changes in Florida Bay and Chesapeake Bay have resulted in changes in fish communities, and that environmental perturbations, such as El Ni\u00f1o, change the latitudinal distribution, abundance, and recruitment dynamics of several species on the West Coast. Many habitat changes are not only the result of natural processes, but are also the direct result of human interactions with the environment. The Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 requires FMCs to describe and identify EFH in Fishery Management Plans, to minimize to the extent practicable adverse effects of fishing activities on such habitat, and to identify other actions to encourage the conservation and enhancement of such habitat. The Act also requires that Federal agencies consult with NMFS if their actions may adversely affect habitat, and requires that the Secretary of Commerce initiate and maintain related research. MSFMCA defines EFH as ... those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. For the purpose of interpreting the definition of EFH: \"waters\" include aquatic areas and their associated physical, chemical, and biological properties that are used by fish, and may include aquatic areas historically used by fish where appropriate; \"substrate\" includes sediment, hard bottom, structures underlying the waters, and associated biological communities; \"necessary\" means the habitat required to support a sustainable fishery and the managed species' contribution to a healthy ecosystem; and \"spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity\" covers a species' full life cycle. (Federal Register 2002). NMFS will continue to conduct research and analyze data necessary to: 1. Identify freshwater, estuarine, coastal, and oceanic habitats necessary to various life stages of federally managed fish species. 2. Document the life history of managed fish and assess the degree to which fishing is adversely affecting the sensitivity and resiliency of EFH. 3. Increase NMFS' understanding of the role of the benthic community in the overall ecosystem, the interaction of target fish with benthic communities, and effects of fishing on benthic communities. 4. Assess and quantify the impacts of non-fishing activities on EFH, and determine the best methods for conserving EFH injured by human impacts (including harmful spills, vessel groundings, material disposal, and fishing). 5.

Fishery managers will use the information resulting from these activities to identify, describe, conserve, and enhance EFH. NMFS Science Centers work closely with the regional offices, FMCs, National Ocean Service (NOS) research facilities, the NOAA Damage Assessment and Restoration Program, other Federal and state agencies, and academic and other partners to provide timely habitat information. NMFS works with the NOAA line offices and other agencies to develop the Coastal Change Analysis Program and Coastwatch to apply satellite imagery and aerial photography to habitat mapping, analysis of change in coastal land cover, and assessment of water temperature, color (for information on its content), and circulation.

Impact of anthropogenic factors and environmental changes on fish populations", "text": "Changing conditions of the biotic and physical environment occupied by fish, whether natural or anthropogenic, affect population productivity through mechanisms that vary greatly in severity. Detecting such changes is an important task, but determining causal relationships is complex. Anthropogenic effects may be confounded by natural environmental changes or cycles. NMFS is conducting research to unravel these complex relationships to better understand their role in the sustainability of marine fish populations. Toxic contaminant discharges to the coastal oceans can have a significant impact on the viability of important fish populations. For example, contaminants can disrupt an organism's early life stage development and growth, which in turn can affect its reproductive potential as an adult. Such nonlethal effects are not easily identified or characterized, and are therefore difficult to relate to the sustainability of the fish populations. The quantification and identification of deleterious changes is further complicated by natural and uncontrollable variability within and between fish populations and their supporting food webs. NMFS will continue to study the potential effects of contaminants on important fish species as well as the sources of these contaminants. To assess the risk to fish populations from different combinations of stressors, a link must be made between understanding toxic effects of contaminants to individual organisms and the factors, both anthropogenic and natural, that influence fish populations. There has been growing recognition that marine pollution can disrupt the development and function of the reproductive, endocrine, immune, and nervous systems of marine animals, including fishes, which affects reproductive and growth processes critical to population stability. Because the effects are not always immediately visible, it is difficult to establish the impact on fish populations. Environmental variation at different temporal and spatial scales further complicates the picture. NMFS is also studying social and economic causes of habitat degradation, from fishery and non-fishery sources. This research includes coordination with researchers studying land-based activities such as non-point source pollution and urban development. NMFS also engages in research to determine the effects of long-term changes in the ocean climate on living marine resources. This information helps assess the true impact of humaninduced factors. Habitat loss and degradation affect riverine, estuarine, and coastal ecosystems. The primary threats come from physical destruction of wetland and other habitats, or access to these habitats, such as blockage by dams, alteration of freshwater flows, eutrophication, and destructive fishing methods. For example, logging contributes to siltation and can destroy salmon spawning habitat and impede migratory paths. Construction of marinas and docking facilities, as well as dredging and disposal of dredged material in estuaries and bays, also cause significant habitat impacts. Loss of aquatic habitat (e.g., coastal wetlands or seagrass and kelp beds) resulting from development adversely affects a variety of food webs important to adults and juveniles of many marine and anadromous species. Propeller damage to shallow vegetated and nonvegetated habitats not only causes a direct loss of habitat, but results in destabilization of these areas, resulting in increased habitat loss and increased sediment resuspension and turbidity. Changes in freshwater volume and flow rates impact nearshore ecosystems adapted to seasonal discharges of freshwater. Destructive fishing methods can damage EFH and live bottom, such as coral reefs. Nutrient enrichment and eutrophication have a major impact on fish populations in estuarine and coastal waters. This impact is manifested by hypoxia/anoxia accompanying the death of phytoplankton blooms (e.g., in the Gulf of Mexico dead zone off the Mississippi River and the western portion of Long Island Sound) and loss of inshore habitat (e.g., replacement of eelgrass beds by macroalgae or loss of eelgrass beds due to shading by epiphytes or phytoplankton in Chesapeake Bay, Waquoit Bay, and Lake Pontchartrain). In addition, changes in nutrient dynamics can create conditions that facilitate harmful algal bloom events that may lead to shellfish harvest closures and mass mortalities of farmed salmon and wild fish in the Northwest. Fishing activities could also change the population dynamics of harmful algal species. A change in trophic webs that decreases grazing on phytoplankton is a major factor in many blooms, leading to more or longer-lasting bloom events. The potential effect of climate change or environmental variability on harmful algal blooms events is also poorly known. man-made environmental changes on living marine resources and the related ecosystem, social, and economic causes and effects.

A similar project working with Alaskan fishermen and funded by Cooperative Research and Reducing Bycatch funding is designed to reduce the bycatch of Pacific halibut in trawl fisheries in the Gulf of Alaska for Pacific cod and flatfishes.

CONSERVATION ENGINEERING RESEARCH", "text": "Conservation engineering research is intended to make fishing gear more efficient and to reduce fishing costs, bycatch mortality, and habitat destruction. It is also intended to improve the data provided by scientific surveys of fish populations. This research area includes studies related to gear performance and fish behavior to be used in the development of selective fishing gear to reduce bycatch. Bycatch mortality decreases the sustainability of a fishery and the net benefits provided by that fishery in four ways (NMFS 2004): 1. If bycatch mortality is not monitored adequately, the uncertainty concerning total fishing-related mortality increases. 2. The discards themselves can have adverse effects on other species. 3. Bycatch mortality precludes some other uses of living marine resources; for example, juvenile fish subject to bycatch mortality will not contribute directly to the growth of that stock and to future catch."}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "The absence of management measures to reduce bycatch typically results in too much bycatch; i.e., the overall net benefit to the Nation from that fishery can be increased by decreasing bycatch. Commercial discards are a significant source of fishing mortality worldwide. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that, from 1992 to 2001, yearly discards worldwide averaged 7.3 million metric tons. Trawl fisheries for shrimp and demersal finfish account for over 50 percent of the total estimated discards while representing approximately 22 percent of total landings recorded in the study (FAO 2004). Recreational discards are another source of fishing mortality. Information is needed to determine proportions of discards in different recreational fisheries and assess associated release mortality. Additionally, NMFS is encouraging research on ways to increase the survival of recreational releases. Bycatch reduction is particularly critical when the bycatch includes protected species. NMFS conducts research at several of its laboratories regarding fishing gear interactions with populations of species protected under the ESA and MMPA, including sea turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals. Such species interact with species managed under the MSFCMA through, for example, competition for prey species and fishing gear interactions. As such, research conducted to support requirements of the MSFCMA also makes an important contribution to the conservation and management requirements of the ESA and the MMPA. Along with incentives and other management strategies, one way to reduce bycatch is to design and operate selective fishing gears, using knowledge of species behavior, gear hydrodynamics, and fishing practices. An important data collection method used by NMFS to conduct research on fishing gear and its impact on fish stocks, protected species, and habitat is the deployment of marine resource observers on commercial and recreational fishing vessels. Observers collect information on all aspects of fishing gear operations, including what kind of gear is used, how it is set, how long it is set, and how it is retrieved, as well as information on fish catch and bycatch and incidental takes of protected species. Observers also collect life history data on species of concern, collect biological samples, and support research through tagging of released animals and other activities. Observer data provide information for stock assessment research, for the assessment of gear efficiency, and for monitoring the relative impacts of various types of gear and fishing methods on fish and protected species and marine habitats. Currently, observers are deployed in only a fraction of the U.S. commercial and recreational fisheries managed by NMFS or required to be monitored under the MMPA, but initiatives are under way to expand the observer program into more fisheries and to more fully integrate observers into fisheries research activities. Bycatch levels and control measures continue to occupy the attention of most fishery management actions of the regional FMCs. Even when apparent solutions are found, the dynamics and abundance of marine species change in time and area, and this can shift the character of the problems and require continuous adjustments to their solutions. NMFS will continue to conduct studies to determine the magnitude of bycatch of overfished stocks and options to reduce it. The options may require the design of new types of fishing gear that are more selective for the targeted species, and NMFS is working in cooperation with the commercial and recreational fishing industry, tribes, states, international and environmental organizations, academia, and gear manufacturers to find designs that meet conservation needs while recognizing the financial constraints of fishermen. To determine when gear modifications are the most appropriate response to bycatch problems, NMFS is studying a variety of gear technologies and fish behaviors, including: fishery. By understanding the successes and setbacks in these and other settings, NMFS will be better able to coordinate gear research with the social, economic, and institutional constraints of specific fisheries. Experimental work with selective fishing gear involves considerable fieldwork on board fishing vessels working under actual fishing conditions. Most trawl gear evaluation includes an alternative tow approach, varying which net is fishing with the experimental gear and comparing the catch results using statistical tests. Underwater cameras and advanced sonars allow for examination of the behavioral mechanisms and gear variations that would account for the catch differences. "}, {"section_title": "areas.", "text": "Growing concern over the impacts of bycatch on stocks resulted in the development of a NMFS Bycatch Plan (NMFS 1998a). Agency experts with experience in fishery management, stock assessment, and social sciences compiled the plan, which included national bycatch objectives; specific recommendations concerning data collection, evaluation, and management actions necessary to attain the objectives; and a comprehensive assessment of the state of bycatch in the Nation's marine fisheries. NMFS increased its commitment to addressing bycatch by issuing its National Bycatch Strategy on 11 March 2003. This strategy comprised six components (Benaka and Dobrzynski 2004): 1. Assess progress toward meeting the goal, objectives, and strategies of the NMFS Bycatch Plan. 2. Develop a national approach to a standardized bycatch reporting methodology (NMFS 2004). 3. Implement regional bycatch implementation plans. 4. Undertake education and outreach efforts to develop effective and efficient methods to reduce bycatch. 5. Use existing partnerships and develop new international approaches to reduce bycatch. 6. Identify new funding requirements to support the NMFS National Bycatch Strategy on an ongoing basis. NMFS is committed to maximizing the research contribution of the commercial and recreational fishing industry and the other above-mentioned partners in fisheries management.

In addition, \"Research Set Aside\" programs administered by NMFS' Northeast Fisheries Science Center allow fishermen to harvest fish and shellfish they normally would be unable to harvest in exchange for the use of their vessels and other services to conduct bycatch reduction research.\nA map showing Hawaiian locations where marine debris has been found and requires removal.

RESEARCH ON THE FISHERIES", "text": "New management measures, based on the Sustainable Fisheries Act (Public Law 104-297), have been successfully implemented to halt the decline in stock levels in many U.S. fisheries. The 2006 annual report to Congress on the status of the U.S. fisheries identifies 530 marine fish stocks and stock complexes in the EEZ, an area that extends from 3 to 200 miles offshore and covers more than 2 million square miles, including those stocks that straddle international boundaries and highly migratory stocks. NMFS reviewed 530 individual stocks and stock complexes. Of those, 242 have known overfishing determinations: 194 (80 percent) are not subject to overfishing and 48 (20 percent) are subject to overfishing; 187 stocks have known overfished determinations: 140 (75 percent) are not overfished and 47 (25 percent) are overfished (NMFS 2007b)."}, {"section_title": "III. A. Social and economic research", "text": "Many of the principal threats to marine ecosystems (overfishing, habitat degradation, water quality degradation, etc.) are economic and social in origin. Rebuilding and maintaining marine ecosystems requires understanding the economic and social drivers at the root of human impacts, in addition to understanding the biological and ecological functions and constraints of marine ecosystems. The NMFS Economics and Social Sciences Program is tasked with understanding the economic and social motivations that generate impacts to marine ecosystems, as well as assessing stakeholders' and the general public's preferred status of marine ecosystems (e.g., abundance of fish stocks, marine protected species, etc.) and determining the outcomes that achieve the greatest benefits to society. To meet these mandates, the NMFS Economics and Social Sciences Program encompasses three core functions: 1) collecting information on resource users; 2) conducting economic and social analyses of fishery management issues; and 3) providing scientific advice to fishery managers. This emerging program has targeted its data collection efforts on meeting current management needs and building the information base to meet future challenges. For example, although NMFS' goal is to establish high-quality, long-term continuous economic data collection programs on commercial harvesters in all federally managed fisheries, NMFS is currently collecting the full suite of economic data (landings revenue, trip expenditures, and fixed costs) only in key fisheries, with the intention of expanding these efforts to other fisheries in the future. However, in 2006 NMFS conducted its first national recreational survey of angler trip expenditures, and out-year plans call for increased use of surveys that directly ask anglers their preferences for proposed management options. Furthermore, NMFS is currently completing its initial assessment of fishing communities that includes baseline information on demographics and an inventory of marine-related businesses and social and cultural institutions. In the long term, continued phased growth of economic information collections on fishing-related industries and expanded social assessments are planned in order to provide a richer characterization of coastal economies, fishing communities, and fishing participants and for use in predictive modeling. These information collections underpin the second core function of the programconducting economic and social analyses of fishery management issues. In particular, these data enable NMFS to perform rigorous economic and social assessments, including: participants, marine-related businesses, and fishing communities, and that may be used as signals for identifying economic and social hardship in its early stages. grams and habitat and protected species recovery programs in an integrated ecosystem framework. agement measures and existing policies on fishery participants, shoreside firms, and coastal communities. ments in understanding fishery capacity. Fisheries management is undergoing two major changes, both of which suggest an expanded role for using socioeconomic research in decision-making. NMFS' move toward an ecosystem approach to marine fisheries management represents a major regime shift in fisheries management and the science requirements underpinning management decisions. Fisheries economists' ability to support ecosystem approaches has been significantly enhanced by recent advances in spatial econometric modeling, which provides an integrated framework for overlaying commercial harvesters' production decisions (e.g., where to fish, target species choices, and whether to stay in fishing) and recreational anglers' decisions (coincidentally, also location and target species decisions) against the physical, biological, and ecological condition on which those decisions are made. These models are already being used to assess the short-run costs and benefits associated with fishing ground closures. Future extensions of these models include incorporating additional biological and ecological information, including stock and habitat effects, that would enable scientists to assess the effects of localized habitat protection measures on the larger ecosystem as well as estimating the short-and long-run damages from environmental events (e.g., hurricanes, harmful algal blooms, and tsunamis), oil spills, and other exogenous factors. The other phenomenon transforming fisheries management is the recognition of the importance of using market-based approaches to solving fishery management issues. The U.S. Ocean Action Plan and the 2005 and 2006 Economic Report of the President all advocate identifying market-based solutions to fishery management issues. For example, dedicated access privilege (DAP) programs-which include individual fishing quotas, community quotas, fishing cooperatives, and area-based quotas-are often cited as a marketbased solution for reducing overcapacity and improving the economic and environmental performance of commercial fisheries, as well as the long-term sustainability of the fishing communities that depend on these resources. Accordingly, the Administration has set a goal of doubling the number of Federal fisheries managed by DAPs. Increased economic and social monitoring and research will help ensure that the economic and social goals of each DAP are achieved. The data collection and research functions support the third core function of the NMFS economics and sociocultural program-providing scientific advice to fishery managers. Fisheries management is complex because decisions must reflect the values and the oftencompeting needs of many different groups, including commercial and recreational fishermen, subsistence fishing communities, non-consumptive users (e.g., non-harvest divers, whale watchers, etc.), Pacific Islanders, and Native American tribes, many of whom have treaties with the United States guaranteeing certain fishing rights. To understand the importance of economic and sociocultural information to fisheries management, one need only consider that a key feature of the Federal regulatory process is that it is not possible to simply implement a regulation to achieve a conservation goal, but instead fishery managers must consider a suite of management alternatives for achieving that outcome. Fishery managers' evaluations of these options not only include weighing the trade-offs associated with alternative management measures at an aggregate or societal level; they also include evaluating the distributional effects of proposed options on various stakeholder groups."}, {"section_title": "III.B.

Tangible benefits from NOAA's response capabilities also occurred following the Exxon Valdez, North Cape, and other oil spills, as well as from surveys of mercury in Gulf of Mexico fishery resources and Pacific Island region resources, as well as addressing other seafood safety concerns. Intra-and extramural seafood safety research and monitoring provides for the continued integration of trophic web research relative to fishery resource health and disease threats, and differential trophic-level risk evaluation effects resulting from such threats, be they to other fishery resources, marine mammals, or human consumers.

Marine aquaculture", "text": "Aquaculture is defined as the propagation and rearing of aquatic organisms in controlled or selected aquatic environments for any commercial, recreational, or public purpose. NMFS has a long history in aquaculture research and development, stretching back more than 100 years, and has made major contributions to the progress of aquaculture both domestically and internationally. Research efforts span the full range of issues associated with the ability to culture marine species for both commercial production and as a tool in stock enhancement and habitat restoration. Expanded marine aquaculture production in the United States has the potential to reduce the pressure on wild stock harvest and help in the rebuilding efforts for those stocks. Research efforts include the evaluation of the impacts of aquaculture production and stock enhancement on marine ecosystems and, in particular, on wild stocks and their habitats, which is the focus of regional FMCs and NMFS under MSFCMA. In particular, there is a need for models, mapping tools, guidelines, protocols, and other research products to support NMFS and the FMCs in the review of aquaculture projects under MSFCMA and other authorities. With the recent expansion of aquaculture production worldwide, and increasing interest in the expansion of aquaculture in the United States, NMFS laboratories can make significant contributions to public understanding of the scientific issues surrounding marine aquaculture and stock enhancement. Many of the issues raised in public forums are based on outdated or questionable studies that do not accurately reflect current industry practices, so it is critical for NMFS to provide up-to-date assessments based on sound science. If the Administration's proposed National Offshore Aquaculture Act is enacted by Congress, NOAA will become the lead permitting agency for aquaculture in Federal waters of the EEZ, and the need will increase for science activities to support the rulemaking process, evaluation of aquaculture permit applications, monitoring of offshore aquaculture operations in the EEZ, and assessment of the cumulative impacts on marine ecosystems. National policies stated in the National Aquaculture Act of 1980, as amended, and in the aquaculture policies adopted by NOAA and the Department of Commerce in the late 1990s, support the development of sustainable aquaculture production in the United States. The more recent recommendations issued by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy in 2004, and in particular the support for aquaculture stated in the U.S. Ocean Action Plan, reaffirm the national interest in expanding aquaculture production in the United States.

Photo: NMFS. including the increasing demand for seafood which, coupled with limited ability to increase harvests from wild fisheries, has resulted in a growing U.S. trade deficit in edible fishery products that currently is approaching $8 billion. Most of the increased global production of fisheries products during the past decade has come from aquaculture, so the choice for the United States is clear: increase seafood imports, which will increasingly consist of aquaculture products, or increase domestic aquaculture production. U.S. aquaculture production in 2003 was about 926,000 pounds (420,000 metric tons), with a value of $961 million (about 20 percent from marine species). Aquaculture accounts for about 25 percent of the total U.S. landings value, and there is significant potential to increase U.S. marine aquaculture production. NMFS can support the expansion of marine aquaculture by providing sound scientific information and analyses to answer the range of technical, environmental, and socioeconomic questions that have been raised about aquaculture. These questions relate to the appropriate siting of aquaculture facilities, aquatic animal health, alternatives to the use of fishmeal and fish oil in feeds, potential genetic and ecological impacts of escapes, potential marketplace competition with wild products, and other issues. NMFS' scientific expertise can be applied to all of these issues, as well as to the development of sustainable culturing techniques, design of cages and other types of grow-out systems, and establishment of protocols for the release of cultured stock for purposes of stock enhancement. In addition to food production and stock enhancement, aquaculture can also assist in recovery plans for protected species, and can be used to produce nonfood products such as ornamental fish, baitfish, and pharmaceuticals. Finally, an enabling policy and regulatory framework is needed in support of aquaculture development. Regulatory complexity and uncertainty are generally recognized as the major reasons why domestic marine aquaculture production has not increased in recent years. The NOAA Aquaculture Program is addressing this barrier to domestic production by working within NOAA and with other Federal agencies to clarify and simplify how aquaculture is regulated under current law, and by working with NOAA's Office of Legislative Affairs to obtain congressional authorization to establish and implement a regulatory framework for offshore aquaculture in Federal waters of the EEZ. Enactment of the National Offshore Aquaculture Act or similar legislation would establish NOAA as the lead agency for offshore aquaculture, authorize NOAA to develop regulations and issue permits to support a sustainable marine aquaculture industry in Federal waters, and pave the way for a productive offshore aquaculture industry in the United States. To ensure that marine aquaculture progresses in an environmentally sound manner, NMFS will concentrate its aquaculture research activities in the following broad areas, in partnership with the broader research and aquaculture communities: \nLittle Port Walter Marine Station to determine strategies that result in increased contribution of Alaska-origin fish in Alaska fisheries to help achieve an improved harvest balance under Pacific Salmon Treaty oversight. stock cohorts using DNA micro-satellites to determine relative biological and fishery contribution performance measures. survival, maturation, juvenile behavior, and adult spawning behavior on normally anadromous steelhead trout with protected species implications for successful restoration of ESA-listed stocks. stocks of salmon.\nof endangered stocks, stock enhancement, and commercial production.\nresponsible marine aquaculture.\nanimals for stocking grow-out systems in an environmentally conscientious manner. the marine food web. aquaculture systems by experimentally establishing optimal nutritional, physical, and chemical rearing conditions. tions in aquaculture systems, by measuring animal and molecular health and growth performance. desired traits and identifying the genetic and proteomic bases for successful phenotypes for aquaculture production in different environments. tify interactions between shellfish farming practices and the ecosystems in which they are contained.

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT RESEARCH", "text": "To address important data shortcomings, MSFCMA requires the Secretary of Commerce to \"develop recommendations for implementation of a standardized fishing vessel registration and fisheries information management system.\" In December 1998, NMFS completed and delivered a report to Congress that outlined an approach to integrate the collection and management of all fisheries information required under all applicable NMFS statutory and regulatory requirements, including but not limited to MSFCMA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act (NMFS 1998b). It also includes all data collected and statistics compiled under state authority for those states willing to participate. This report was developed in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard, the states, the interstate marine fisheries commissions, the FMCs, other key governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and interested stakeholders. Marine fisheries management organizations have long understood that the quantity and quality of fisheries information relate directly to the quality of the scientific analysis supporting resource management and allocation decisions. In its 1998 Report to Congress, NMFS made the case that significant long-term investment would be required to ensure that the right information of the right quality is readily available to form the basis of these management decisions. In that report, NOAA and its partners delivered a high-level strategy and an estimate of investments needed to realize a national Fisheries Information System (FIS). Congress began funding the agency in 2003 to initiate an FIS program that will improve the existing framework for partnership and collaboration with NOAA partners who collect, manage, and disseminate fisheries information. A governance structure has been developed for the program that includes an Executive Sponsorship Team, a Program Management Team (PMT), and several Professional Specialty Groups (PSGs). The Executive Team is composed of the agency's Chief Science Advisor and Deputy Assistant Administrator for Regulatory Programs; it provides high-level guidance and advice on national and cross-regional issues and ensures that the FIS program operates in a manner consistent with fundamental policies and general principles of the agency. The PMT is composed of representatives of two headquarters offices (Office of Science and Technology and Office of Sustainable Fisheries), the six NMFS Regions, and the three interstate commissions responsible for coordinating the major cooperative state-Federal fisheries information network programs on the Atlantic coast, Pacific coast, and Gulf of Mexico. The regional state-Federal programs for which representation is provided include the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP), the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Information Network (Gulf FIN), the Alaska -FIN), the Pacific Recreational Fisheries Information Network (Pacific RecFIN), and the Western Pacific Fisheries Information Network (WPacFIN). The PMT is responsible for achieving the mission, vision, goals, and objectives for the program and for providing the tactical and operational governance needed to ensure effective planning and execution of all projects. PSGs have been formed as needed to support the FIS program's business and technical needs. Each PSG consists of experts from multiple disciplines brought together to address a specific goal, objective, or subcomponent of the FIS program. Each PSG receives approval and direction from the PMT for functions, tasks, and projects. The FIS program vision of \"a comprehensive, continuously updated time-series of welldocumented, high-quality, easily-accessible information on the nation's fisheries that supports living marine resource stewardship\" guides the PMT in executing the FIS program mission: NOAA's FIS program delivers fisheries information collection, management, and dissemination solutions to improve accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and accessibility. The program leverages Federal-state partnerships and investments to provide the information needed to help understand the effects of fishing on living marine resources, and to improve the quality of resource management decisions. The current development of the FIS program is based on linking and integrating existing regional state-Federal fisheries information collection and management programs around the country with national programs to create a \"system of systems\" that will satisfy information needs of Federal and state agencies, the fishing industry, and the general public. The FIS program is working toward realizing its vision and mission by striving to achieve the following four goals: 1. Expand and adapt data collection to meet current and future needs for resource stewardship. 2. Build, link, and integrate information management systems within and across regions. 3. Establish regional and national standards (including minimum guidelines) for information collection, management, and dissemination to ensure high quality, completeness, timeliness, and accessibility. 4. Implement and maintain effective partnerships to support collaboration among stakeholders and to leverage investments across regions and throughout the Nation. In addition, the FIS program has established certain design principles to: perspectives, standards of measurement, and standards of quality. These design principles represent guiding elements for FIS program execution. Recent initiatives within NOAA and with its domestic and international partners also illustrate the importance of an ecosystem approach to resource management. This will require tight integration of FIS and its products with the agency's fishery-independent data collection and management programs, as well as major NOAA programs such as the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) and the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS). The regional fisheries data collection and information management programs-developed by NMFS in cooperation with state agencies and interstate commissions-have progressed considerably during the past decade. The concept of a \"one-stop shop\" for fisheries information at state, regional, and national levels is achievable if funding and executive sponsorship continues during the next 5 to 10 years. Initial investments have established an FIS program management plan, as well as governance processes for project selection and resource allocation. The PMT has also been developing plans for communications and outreach, program architecture, and risk management. The PMT is implementing program management best practices by: The PMT has organized, funded, and planned projects into eight FIS program portfolios that represent the core areas for initial, current, and future investments: 1.

FIS Program Architecture: Develop a roadmap that describes the current state of business and systems elements and their use in a new FIS program state. The PMT has developed initial high-level work plans and identified the desired outcomes for each portfolio. Additional analyses are establishing critical paths, interrelationships, and dependencies between and among these portfolios. Development of FIS is being coordinated with the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), a developing, multi-agency system to routinely and continuously provide quality controlled data and information on current and future states of the oceans and Great Lakes. The IOOS will operate from the global scale of ocean basins to local scales of coastal ecosystems. It is a multidisciplinary system designed to provide data in forms and at rates required by decision makers to address seven societal goals. Three of these goals are directly relevant to fisheries research and management: reduce public health risks; protect and restore healthy coastal ecosystems more effectively; and enable the sustained use of ocean and coastal resources. The IOOS has three major components to form an end-toend system: observations, data management and communication, and data analysis and modeling. Although development of FIS predates development of the IOOS, FIS can provide the mechanism for bringing fishery-dependent data into the larger IOOS. For example, FIS can be brought into compliance with IOOS standards for data access, metadata, and data stewardship (e.g., quality control and archiving)."}, {"section_title": "MAJOR FISHERY RESEARCH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES", "text": "The major fishery research goals of NMFS have a one-to-one relationship with the program areas identified in the MSFCMA, except that a sixth element has been added to help focus efforts on building partnerships.

NMFS is committed to strengthening existing relationships and building new ones. Strategic planning usually includes the use of timetables for performance of the various activities associated with each goal. Fisheries research has been developing for well over a century. Initially, it was mostly studies of fundamental life history and exploratory fishing. Routine surveys accelerated with the advent of international conservation treaties and became nationwide with the passage of the MSFCMA. Much of the research is operational in nature and will continue into the future. Issues are ever-changing, as natural and humaninduced changes to ecosystems modify species distributions and abundance, unforeseen ecological relationships become suspected or known, marketplace preferences change, and harvesting technology evolves. For example, stock assessment surveys, the analysis of the obtained data, and the projections of future abundance, are done according to a schedule (when there is sufficient funding). Other parts of this plan involve improvements to the science or the provision of new facilities. Several lines of NMFS research have gained importance in recent years, reflecting increased levels of interest in developing management areas. One example is marine aquaculture. The United States has a long history in marine aquaculture, but domestic production has lagged behind as foreign production has substantially increased, resulting in a large and growing seafood trade deficit. There is growing recognition that the U.S. needs to increase marine aquaculture production, particularly offshore, 2 and more research needs to be targeted toward supporting a sustainable and productive domestic industry (e.g., research on new feeds, cage designs, and genetic and disease issues). NMFS is working with industry to increase the level of research required to support domestic marine aquaculture. Another developing line of research involves the relatively new paradigm of Ecosystem Area Management. In this research, all areas of an ecosystem are considered, from climate variability, to predator-prey relationships and changes, and multiple uses of the habitat areas and the resources."}, {"section_title": "NMFS FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTERS", "text": "NMFS is a world leader in fisheries research.

In addition to research on fishery resources, the AFSC is continuing to develop studies that will help predict how marine resources respond to climate change, the nature and location of habitat resources required by commercially valuable fish species, and habitat interactions between fish and marine mammals. Direct research on marine mammals includes stock assessments for most marine mammal species of Alaska, as required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and for those species also listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This information, in turn, is used to assess anthropogenic impacts, including direct (e.g., incidental take) and indirect effects (e.g., competition) of fisheries on those populations. The Fisheries Monitoring and Analysis Division monitors groundfish fishing activities in the U.S. EEZ off Alaska and conducts research associated with sampling commercial fishery catches, estimation of catch and bycatch mortality, and other aspects of fishery-dependent data. The Division is responsible for training, briefing, debriefing, and oversight of observers who collect catch data onboard fishing vessels and at onshore processing plants and for quality control/quality assurance of the data provided by these observers. Division staff process data and make it available to the Sustainable Fisheries Division of the Alaska Regional Office for quota monitoring and to scientists in other AFSC divisions for stock assessment, ecosystem investigations, and a broad range of research investigations. The AFSC also conducts research on habitat use by FMP-managed fish and invertebrates, alterations in habitat quality through human and environmental change, and an understanding of threats to habitat in Alaska. Studies involve diverse fish habitats that range from eelgrass beds to benthic substrates, and wetlands to coral and sponge communities which serve as refugia, forage grounds, or nursery areas for managed species. Perturbations include fishing, oil transportation, logging, and development, plus natural effects on fish habitat such as climate, prey distribution, and nutritional quality. The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) is responsible for conducting research on all marine mammals of the coast of Alaska, and pinnipeds occurring in Washington, Oregon, and California.

The AFSC is conducting research cruises in 2006 and 2007 to inter-calibrate the scientific acoustic survey systems between the NOAA Ship Miller Freeman and the new NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson 1) to ensure the standardization of the surveys over time series; 2) to estimate the selectivity and catchability of standard mid-water and bottom trawl survey nets; 3) to conduct experiments with trawling procedures in order to confirm or revise AFSC trawl survey standards relative to ensuring that the national trawl protocols are met; and 4) to continue research on essential fish habitat determination and to measure the effects of fishing on it. The inter-calibration work may need to be continued beyond 2007 depending on the results of research completed in 2006 and 2007. During all standard surveys, biological specimens of fish and invertebrates will be collected to identify new species, estimate biological rates, and study prey-predator relationships and genetic stock structure. Each year, observers will be deployed on commercial fishing vessels and at shoreside processing plants to meet the following coverage requirements (as specified in the groundfish FMPs for the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands regions): engage in community development quota (CDQ) and American Fisheries Act (AFA) fishing operations.

Three types of seabird deterrent devices were chosen by industry as having potential for large catcher processor vessels, including paired streamer lines, side-boom arrays, and third wire control devices. Seabirds interact with the trawl warp cables and third wire sonar cables, sometimes resulting in mortalities. The experimental deterrent devices were designed to keep seabirds away from these cables. Additional research is being conducted to examine the risk of interactions between groundfish trawl components and the endangered short-tailed albatross and to characterize the trawl fleet regarding seabird interactions. mental \"shrimpfly\" rockfish fishery that will experiment with fishing gear capable of catching rockfish without bycatch of salmon, halibut, and other valuable groundfish.\nRecent Accomplishments: to reduce the capture of overfished groundfish. Initiated in 2004, this project used a state-of-the-art ultrasonic camera (DIDSON, or dual frequency identification sonar) in conjunction with conventional in situ video to document and categorize fish behavior during the sequence of capture in bottom trawls with an emphasis on a selective flatfish trawl-an experimental net being used in West Coast groundfish fisheries. tion programs with age of maturity similar to that of fish rearing in their native habitat. Juvenile salmon rearing conditions and growth regimes that reduce proportions of males maturing at age 2 have been developed. This information is being used to control age of maturity in fish reared in captive broodstock programs to aid recovery of ESA-listed stocks of Pacific salmon. Spawning locations for hatchery and wild spring Chinook salmon in the Yakima River were characterized and the efficacy of acclimation ponds for improving homing fidelity of hatchery fish determined. Center staff initiated a large-scale, long-term experiment to quantify the demographic and genetic effects of supplementation-type hatcheries, and developed a method of detecting natural spawning of salmon by implanting electromyogram transmitters and monitoring muscle activity. V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus. These assays will be used to assess the role of the type IV adhesins in environmental persistence. Center staff also demonstrated that the V. vulnificus type IV fimbrial adhesin encoded by PilA is required for biofilm formation, epithelial cell adherence, virulence, and persistence in oysters, confirming that the PilA adhesin is an important colonization factor. This is the first study to show that a specific bacterial protein structure contributes to colonization of shellfish. They also confirmed that PilA and MshA are highly conserved among all strains of V. parahaemolyticus isolated from many geographical areas (like V. vulnificus). This suggests that adherence and colonization factors identified for one strain will be applicable to all, an important consideration for development of a universal colonization inhibitory factor. V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus. In order to study the role of the PilA and MshA adhesins, it is necessary to construct mutants unable to express these proteins without affecting expression of adjacent genes. This was a significant hurdle requiring considerable empirical experimentation. Development of the method will now allow us to construct similar mutants deficient in expression of MshA, as well as strains defective in expression of both adhesins. tional phytoplankton groups is now possible.

In addition, research investigated short-and long-term survivorship following trawl exposure and discard. ing operations on commercial fishing vessels in the Gulf of Maine. Variability of body measurements for each length class of fish was calculated and a simple model formulated to estimate the mesh size and configuration through which commercial fish species of any size will be most likely to escape. The model enables managers and the fishing industry to predict potential retention rates of major commercial fish species for a range of mesh sizes and configurations. trawls-has been tested and verified, using larger versions of the designs and including nighttime testing. tion engineering was established to share knowledge and skills of fishermen and gear researchers for the development of collaborative efforts in conservation gear engineering projects. and results integrated into the study of yield-per-recruit (YPR) and spawning-stock biomass-per-recruit (SSBPR) models evaluating the effects of incrementally increasing mesh sizes. Specifically, 1) mesh selectivity studies were conducted using an alternate tow method aboard commercial fishing vessels, 2) selectivity analyses on resulting data were conducted and selectivity curves generated for each species by mesh size and shape, and 3) YPR and SSBPR analyses were conducted and isopleths generated. out to learn which bait characteristics are distasteful to the species.

The Hawaii-based longline fishery has reduced seabird takes from thousands per year and sea turtle takes from hundreds per year during the late 1990s to only a few dozen per year in 2005. This was accomplished using bycatch reduction measures developed by scientists at the PIFSC and the NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center working with the fishery councils and conservation groups. In addition, PIFSC scientists are collaborating in on-going experiments to reduce sea turtle bycatch with longline fisheries in Hawaii, Japan, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Spain, and Italy, and are developing logistics for similar experiments in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Vietnam. Scientists also are working to identify protected species hot spots to support efforts to minimize protected species-fisheries interactions. Bottom-mounted high-frequency acoustic recording packages were placed in strategic locations to provide acoustic information where marine mammal/fishery interactions (false killer whales and longline fishing vessels) are known to occur in the Pacific Islands Region. In addition, using satellite telemetry of 43 juvenile loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) in the western North Pacific together with satellite remotely sensed oceanographic data, the -Current water contains high surface chlorophyll. This work was conducted jointly with the Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium in Japan. With respect to recreational fisheries in the main Hawaiian Islands, PIFSC scientists have developed a successful outreach, education, and data collection program for shoreline and near-shore fishermen in Hawaii to investigate the use of barbless circle hooks to increase survival of fish caught in tag and release programs and to reduce injury to protected species such as green sea turtles and Hawaiian monk seals when accidentally hooked."}, {"section_title": "Research Priorities, FY 2007-2012:", "text": "habitat according to a 5-year research plan. catch mortality of prohibited, undersized, or unmarketable species, and to understand performance of survey gear. work.

This information is required for establishing a baseline for use in 1) identifying stakeholders to be included in the distribution of dedicated access privileges (e.g., harvesting quotas and processing quotas), 2) projecting the likely consequences of alternative management measures, and 3) conducting retrospective analysis of management actions that have been taken.\nThe NWFSC developed and began fielding a survey to collect cost information from the West Coast groundfish trawl fleet. Phase 1 of this effort, covering Oregon trawlers, has yielded a positive response rate of over 65 percent. A recreational valuation survey of Washington and Oregon recreational anglers was also developed and initiated. A new economist was hired to coordinate data collection and model development for analyzing regional income impacts associated with West Coast fisheries. Center staff developed objectives and methodology for a cost-earnings data collection program covering West Coast groundfish fisheries and ocean troll salmon fisheries. A pilot research project on methods for enumerating and profiling Washington coast communities involved in West Coast and North Pacific fisheries, including the West Coast groundfish and salmon fisheries, was conducted. Frameworks to discuss communities in quota systems were also developed. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) was able to select specific community options for future impact analysis in an environmental impact statement process. NWFSC staff conducted collaborative research to gain a greater understanding of management measures that have been incorporated into global individual quota systems with the specific goals of protecting or addressing community impact and issues under a quota system. In [2005][2006], NWFSC staff provided critical responses (cruises on the R/V Nancy Foster and Gordon Gunter) through sampling of seafood species (i.e., mollusks, crustaceans, and fish) and measured chemical contaminant levels to provide information for determining measured in water, sediment, and tissues to assess risks to humans.\nReview Committee (SARC: http://www. nefsc.noaa.gov/nefsc/saw/) peer-review process.

Information Management Research", "text": "Recent Accomplishments: The AFSC communicates its scientific information and advice, along with the associated uncertainties, to NMFS staff, other management authorities, the Councils, and the public. For example, survey results of the AFSC were disseminated to the user groups through the participation of experts at meetings and submission of technical reports and published papers. On a yearly basis, the AFSC publishes roughly 100 scientific papers as well as over a dozen NOAA Technical Memorandums and Center Processed Reports. The AFSC's Auke Bay Laboratory is developing protocols and formats to comply with Federal Geospatial Data Committee (FGDC) requirements for web-accessible metadata sets of fisheries-related biophysical and oceanographic information. A full FGDC-compliant metadata record has been constructed for a large data set (Southeast Coastal Monitoring [SECM]) consisting of fish catches and associated biological and physical oceanographic data. In addition, a data dictionary has been constructed for the entire data set. The complexity of the SECM data set makes it likely that its metadata record and data dictionary can serve as the example for most other data sets within the AFSC. When all active Auke Bay Lab data sets are FGDC-compliant (by the end of FY 2007), the information will be ready for access via the Internet.\nRecent Accomplishments: The SWFSC has been a leader within NOAA in providing data to a broad spectrum of users, using methods consistent with emerging NOAA Global Earth Observation-Integrated Data Environment and Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Data Management and Communication (DMAC) standards for data access and transport providing interoperability with other NOAA data and data servers. The SWFSC continues to develop a suite of fisheries-relevant data that cover the entire spectrum of the ocean environment, from surface or near-surface wind and pressure data to surface and subsurface measurements of important oceanographic parameters. A key focus is the integration of these oceanographic and atmospheric data with biological data in support of a regional ecosystem-based management and to make these data sets readily accessible to scientists, managers, and the general public to support research on fisheries, marine mammals and protected species, and for studies in climate change and environmental variability. In cooperation with the West Coast Regional Node of Coastwatch, over 4 terabytes of data are available online, and the amount is increasing every month. The data can accessed, subsetted, visualized, and downloaded in a variety of methods designed to reduce the time users need to spend preparing the data, and allowing users to acquire only the desired data rather than an entire dataset. The SWFSC has developed Thematic Real-time Environmental Distributed Data Services (THREDDS) catalogs, including OPeNDAP and Open Geospatial Consortium standard Web Coverage Services; provided access to a variety of near real-time and science quality satellite data; developed a variety of data delivery and integration tools for the Tagging of Pacific Pelagics (TOPP) program; developed Dapper/dchart applications for accessing aggregated in situ information; and developed data transport and access applications for the Central California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) and the Pacific Coast Ocean Observing System (PaCOOS). The SWFSC developed several software and hardware systems to modernize and standardize data collection and management for HMS biological, physical, and fisheries data through collaboration with the National Fisheries Information System and the SWFSC/ PIFSC Data Coordination Team. The Data Coordination Team developed an Oracle data system integrating all types of fishery data, and a data portal to display HMS data, metadata, and data policies. Electronic calipers were field tested that will enable port samplers to more efficiently collect data from HMS fisheries and allow SWFSC data technicians to more efficiently process the data. The Data Coordination Team also continued to collect data from and monitor HMS fisheries in the Pacific for stock assessments and in support of WCPFC, PFMC, and the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species. The SWFSC began developing IOOS-compatible software that will allow CalCOFI biological and physical data to be accessed on the Internet by interested academic, government, and research partners. The SWFSC began long-term planning and design for an integrated PaCOOS data management system. This system will ensure that physical and biological data from a wide variety of sources and PaCOOS partners will be available and easy to access for scientists and managers.\nRecent Accomplishments: plications that are SSL-enabled, to provide secure access by constituents and the public to SEFSC information resources via web-based technologies. continuity of operations. and distribute scientific data.\nRecent Accomplishments: The PIFSC has implemented projects that improve both data collection procedures and access to data holdings. One key accomplishment was the implementation of major shoreline-based creel surveys in American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to improve monitoring of coral reef fisheries resources in cooperation with local fisheries agencies. In addition, PIFSC personnel have developed detailed metadata describing the Center's collections and holdings of fisheries statistics and fisheries research survey data. These metadata have been packaged into a Data Catalog for posting on the Center's Intranet, making the information readily available to all Center staff. In a related effort, the PIFSC developed, refined and beta-tested the web-enabled InPort Data Catalog prototype for the FIS Program. The InPort system has been approved and accepted as the standard for the FIS Program and is now in use for the entry of metadata on current fisheries information holdings in all regions. InPort is designed to maintain and search a \"who, what, where, and when\" catalog of fisheries data holdings. InPort provides capabilities to: 1) share data across NMFS; 2) search and study existing data for use in fisheries science, management, and regulation; and 3) ensure the quality and understandability of our data in support of ecosystem-based management. InPort also stores details on the quality and completeness of data, its confidentiality policies, research models, data collection protocols, methodologies, and usage constraints."}, {"section_title": "web.

Because of possible predation by Alaskan transients on protected Alaskan marine mammal populations, more information is needed about the specific diet of this ecotype. In the current study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, supported by field observations of the transient diet, found that it is unlikely that Steller sea lion pups represent a substantial proportion the overall diet for Alaska transients. In addition, Alaskan resident killer whales were found to be consuming a fish diet, based on both field observations and their chemical signatures compared to those of other resident populations.

The current staffing level involved in MSFCMA-related activities is at about 95 full-time equivalents (FTEs). An estimated 55 percent of total SWFSC resources are assigned to MSFCMA activities. NOAA research vessels assigned to fisheries research in the SWFSC are the NOAA FSV David Starr Jordan, which has San Diego as its homeport, and approximately two-thirds of the time of the NOAA vessel McArthur II. The Center also charters in excess of 100 sea days annually aboard fishing and research vessels. The SWFSC is a world-class research organization that conducts integrated, multidisciplinary research programs in biology, mathematics, oceanography, and economics to develop scientific technology and provide information to support the management and allocation of Pacific coastal and high-seas fishery resources. These activities support the scientific, statistical, and economic needs of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) and international commissions for large pelagic fishes and Antarctic resources. Center programs also support efforts directed toward the reduction of protected species interactions, fishery-related porpoise mortality, and a better understanding of the biological and environmental factors affecting the marine resources exploited by U.S. commercial and recreational fisheries. The Center provides the scientific information necessary to conserve and manage the following important fisheries in the Pacific and Antarctic regions: and squid). The SWFSC specializes in fisheries of the California Current, Pacific Oceanic, and Antarctic regions. Research is carried out on the ecology, population dynamics, fisheries, and stock assessment of small coastal pelagic species, West Coast groundfishes, Pacific billfish, tunas and sharks (in collaboration with the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center), and California salmon. The Center maintains and uses the largest database on tuna and tuna-related fisheries in the world. The Center makes extensive use of biological and fisheries data, which are collected by observers placed on fishing vessels by the Southwest Region, to monitor interactions with protected resources to achieve goals related to the MSFCMA. It is also considered a leader in fish survey design, conducting surveys to monitor early recruitment success of economically important fish stocks along the U.S. West Coast. It is a co-founder and co-participant in the Pacific Coast Ocean Observing System (PaCOOS) an extension of the much cited state-Federal California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), a comprehensive long-term study of the biology and oceanography of the California Current. In the Pacific, the Center is the leading source of stock assessment expertise on tunas, sharks, and billfishes for international commissions and for the PFMC. In the Antarctic, the SWFSC leads U.S. research directed at gathering ecological information to prevent overexploitation of fish and krill and to protect Antarctic living marine resources. The SWFSC provides oceanic environmental data and indices to the rest of NMFS as well as to other Federal, state, academic, and foreign fisheries scientists. Center scientists are leaders in the research and development of fisheries-relevant environmental data products. The SWFSC is home to a NOAA CoastWatch node at its Environmental Research Division in Pacific Grove, California. Organizationally, the SWFSC consists of the Fisheries Research Division, Fisheries Ecology Division, Environmental Research Division, Protected Resources Division, the Antarctic Ecosystem Research Division, and the Operations, Management and Information Division. Nine research programs are conducted across these divisions: Coastal Pelagic Species, Highly Migratory Species, California Demersal Species, California Anadromous Species, Marine Mammals, Marine Turtles, Abalone, Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and Strategic Research. The SWFSC also has eight programs oriented around the following disciplines: 1) Population Assessment; 2) Resource Surveys; 3) Ecosystem and Climate; 4) Ecology and Ecosystem; 5) Biology and Life History; 6) Life History, Demographics & Movement; 7) Economic and Social Monitoring and Assessment; 8) Data Management; and 9) Administration and Infrastructure. These Discipline Programs cut across all Divisions and Research Programs. SWFSC scientists have taken the lead in characterization of large-and small-scale habitats that support white abalone, groundfish, and bottomfish populations in deep water off California. This work requires an interdisciplinary approach from fishery biologists, geologists, and ecologists and couples the use of GIS with remote-sensing visual and acoustic tools, in-situ survey techniques using remotely operated vehicles, submersibles, and spatial analyses. This approach is being applied to the identification of EFH for various species, the improvement of stock assessment surveys, development of endangered species recovery plans, and the evaluation of MPAs as an effective supplement to traditional fishery management. The National Ocean Service's MPA Center is cooperatively co-located with the SWFSC's Santa Cruz Laboratory. The SWFSC maintains an active communications network with constituents, colleagues in the scientific professions, and the public to receive input for research planning, execution, and results. The network includes frequent dialogue with commercial and recreational fishermen, leaders of environmental groups, participants of FMCs, state and Federal research agency staff, and outside scientists in the United States and foreign countries. Supporting this network is an infrastructure that includes cooperative agreements to support collaborative work with researchers in state agencies, universities, and foreign governmental agencies for collecting logbook and other types of fisheries data and for shared research projects; arrangements for data exchange; and contracts for charters of research vessels and specialty expertise. The SWFSC and its laboratories maintain up-to-date Internet sites that provide a range of information, including scientific reports and summary databases available to other researchers as well as the general public.

Results of a quick turnaround-time genetic stock identification analysis of Chinook salmon port sampled in Monterey Bay were presented to the PFMC. The SWFSC, in collaboration with the NWFSC, developed a population genetics database of several California salmonid stocks for determining stock structure and to use as a baseline for future monitoring efforts. Molecular genetic data are collected from salmonids to identify genetic population structure and demographic units for management and conservation, to estimate relatedness of individuals and populations, and to estimate life-history and population-genetic parameters. Novel analytical methods will also be developed and employed to estimate population-genetic parameters, such as effective population size, probability of parentage, demographic trajectory, new ways to use genetic methods for tagging individual salmon, and manage breeding of salmonids in hatcheries for conservation purposes. for shortbelly rockfish, bocaccio, cowcod, California scorpionfish, California sheepshead, starry flounder, widow rockfish, gopher rockfish, kelp greenling, and vermilion rockfish, as well as rebuilding analyses for boccacio, widow rockfish, and cowcod. fornia coastal Chinook ocean harvest jeopardy standard, hook-and-release mortality in California's ocean recreational fishery, and a Phase I recovery plan through participation in Take Reduction Teams for all listed salmon stocks. for North Pacific Ocean Striped Marlin and North Pacific Ocean Albacore, which the ISC used to recommend management action to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries and sonar for the Southern California Bight. nid stocks for determination of stock structure and as a baseline for future monitoring efforts. harvest and evaluate proposals to minimize listed species take. the albacore fishing industry, Japanese fishery agencies, and other groups to trace albacore movements between fisheries and countries.

One study pioneered the use of the combination of acoustic techniques, fishing information, and direct submersible research to directly evaluate deepwater fisheries habitat. Research considered the potential of multibeam sonar, multi-frequency echosounder, and a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to estimate rockfish distributions and abundance in the Southern California Bight, suggesting that this type of direct observation is a promising independent approach to evaluate fishing effects on a scale consistent with commercial fishing activities. Species identification algorithms for acoustic surveys were also developed for bocaccio rockfish. The Center conducted the first workshop to develop alternative gear for reducing bycatch of dolphins, turtles, and other species in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) tuna purse-seine fisheries. This workshop identified three research proposals that showed the most conservation promise and were the most cost-effective for review and evaluation at a future workshop. These were proposals to reduce fishery mortality of sharks, examine historical fishery data to establish time-area closures, and modify fish aggregating devices (FADs) to reduce sea-turtle entanglement. environmental data from standard equipment on commercial fishing vessels and logging of catch. Develop algorithms for processing and analysis of these data.\nStock Assessment and Fish Biology. -Stock assessment research includes conducting baseline assessments of key species and regular updates for fishery management and conservation purposes. Baseline assessments include a metapopulation stock assessment model completed for lobsters in the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument, which will become a complete population assessment in 2007. Pursuant to Proclamation 8031 establishing the Monument and its codifying regulations, lobsters in the Monument are subject to a zero harvest guideline. The assessment of Hawaiian archipelago bottomfish was updated using a new standardized time-series of catch per unit effort in 2006. An independent assessment of bottomfish was also contracted, confirming the previous baseline approach and results, and providing an alternative model for future analyses. An updated stock assessment of Pacific swordfish was conducted that indicates the resource can well sustain exploitation at the highest levels of fishing effort that have been exerted to date without becoming overfished. In addition, an updated stock assessment on blue sharks was conducted which indicated that, since the 1990s drift net ban, biomass has increased well above minimum levels needed to sustain maximum yield. In collaboration with the Oceanic Fisheries Program of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, stock assessments of yellowfin and bigeye tuna were also updated, which indicated that overfishing is now occurring on both stocks. Working group meetings of the International Scientific Committee on Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific were held to foster cooperative international stock assessments of blue shark, striped marlin, and swordfish. -In addition, several analyses of fish biology were completed or are under way. PIFSC scientist Bruce Mundy published a 704-page book entitled, Checklist of the Fishes of the Hawaiian Archipelago, which describes the known diversity, biogeographic origins, behaviorally defined habitats, and conservation status of the 1,250 fish species known from the area. An age and growth study based on growth rings on hard parts was completed on swordfish, and similar studies are under way on targeted bottomfish species as well as on bycatch species in the longline fishery (snake mackerel and lancet fish). -Using ocean models to describe larval transport, the PIFSC also developed a metapopulation dynamics model of larval movement within the Hawaiian Archipelago. This work included specimen collections and laboratory analyses of trace elements in otoliths, which are used to characterize the pelagic environments experienced by individual larvae during the planktonic dispersal stage. Completion of this work will ultimately provide a series of case studies elucidating connectivity and dispersal among main Hawaiian Island and Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument metapopulations of representative species of shallow-water reef fishes. -A multi-year cooperative tag and release study of lobster growth and mortality is being conducted with chartered commercial fishing operations in the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument. Annual lobster survey cruises are also conducted in the Monument. In addition, PIFSC scientists published a new morphometric method for estimating body size at sexual maturity in slipper and spiny lobster populations. These studies also provide insight to the health of the Monument ecosystem, and the annual lobster survey provides a long-term time-series of both lobster abundance and the abundance of other shallow-water demersal species. International Cooperation on Resource Management. -The PIFSC hosted or attended meetings and conferences that brought together Pacific-wide delegations to coordinate marine resource conservation and management. The PIFSC led the U.S. delegation to the annual meeting of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (also known as PICES) in Yokohama, Japan; NOAA scientists from four science centers and several other NOAA research offices participate in the PICES working groups. PICES serves as a vehicle for enhancing ecosystem research coordination in the North Pacific, with an increasing emphasis on living marine resource conservation and management. The PIFSC also represented the United States on the Scientific Committee of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), and PIFSC scientists conducted stock assessment and related research in conjunction with the WCPFC's Scientific Committee and also with the advisory working groups of the ISC. The Center also sponsored the 3 rd Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Science Symposium, presenting the results of over 20 years of living marine and terrestrial research throughout the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. A wide variety of agencies and universities participated in the symposium, which also drew large public participation. Habitat Characterization and Remediation. -Several habitat mapping projects were completed. PIFSC scientists surveyed 3000 km 2 of seafloor during multibeam mapping operations on the NOAA ship Hi' ialakai and the 25-ft PIFSC survey launch AHI. Major surveys were conducted at French Frigate \u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument, and at Niihau and Penguin Bank in the main Hawaiian Islands. Using these data, accurate delineation of 25-, 50-, and 100-fm isobaths, an important management need for the Monument, was completed. The PIFSC collaborated with the University of Hawaii's Hawaii Mapping Research Group, the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory, and other key NOAA partners to produce the Bathymetric Atlas of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. -In addition, high-resolution bathymetric data for coral reef habitats in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the Territory of American Samoa were published. Surveys were conducted by the 25-foot survey launch AHI, equipped with a Reson 8101ER multibeam echosounder. PIFSC scientists also used multibeam and video validation data to characterize benthic habitat for anchorage at Saipan, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, for the U.S. Navy. -The PIFSC also participated in a multiagency expedition led by the Scripps Institution assessment of the effects of human exploitation on fishery resources and related aspects of their coral reef ecosystems. -The PIFSC also completed Pacific RAMP surveys of coral reef ecosystems around all islands of American Samoa (ASRAMP) in 2002, 2004, and 2006and the U.S. Line and Phoenix Islands in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. Surveys included quantitative spatial and temporal monitoring of biological populations of fish, coral, algae, macroinvertebrates, and important oceanographic processes of ecosystem function. Using monitoring surveys, PIFSC scientists documented that the ecosystem impact of a foreign longline fishing vessel grounding (1993) to the reef at Rose Atoll has now persisted for over a decade, as characterized by a significantly greater abundance of algae/cyanobacteria and greater density of herbivorous fishes at the site of impact. -In 2005, the Center's Marine Debris Team completed a 5-year large-scale marine debris removal effort from the coral reefs and beaches of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (now the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument) after removing about 550 metric tons of primarily derelict fishing gear. With the conclusion of the large-scale debris removal effort, the Marine Debris Team initiated a \"maintenance mode\" removal by collecting 19 tons of debris in 2006 and completed a detailed debris accumulation study that documents average annual accumulation in the Monument of greater than 52 metric tons. -PIFSC scientists made several key findings regarding the role of algae in the Pacific Islands marine environment. The PIFSC reported in Status of Coral Reefs of the World: that macro algae, not corals, dominate many healthy subtropical reef systems in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Center scientists also published discovery of two algal species new to science from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in 2004: Acrosymphtyon brainardii and Scinaia huismannii. To foster algal research in the Pacific Islands, PIFSC scientists entered into collaborative partnerships with molecular researchers from the University of Ghent, Belgium, and the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, to understand molecular population structure of select algal species in the tropical Pacific, and also published a rapid ecological assessment algal sampling protocol designed specifically for remote tropical islands. -In support of NOAA's emphasis on Habitats of Particular Concern within Essential Fish Habitat, PIFSC scientists published a paper in 2004 documenting the importance of sheltered habitats at Northwestern Hawaiian Island atolls as juvenile reef fish nursery habitats, and a second paper also in 2004 documenting the disproportionate abundance of endemic species in shallow reef fish assemblages of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. -Other habitat-related accomplishments included: completion of a cooperative NOAA and State of Hawaii survey of black (deep sea) corals; completion of an in-depth fisheries oceanography survey of the American Samoa tuna fishing grounds; and collaboration with the National Ocean Service to develop an on-line encyclopedia of marine plants in the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument. coral reef ecosystem and to mitigate entanglement hazards to the animals within the ecosystem. marine debris affecting the U.S. Pacific Islands, focusing on educating the commercial fishing and maritime industries regarding the damage to coral reef ecosystems caused by marine debris and on efforts to minimize future damage by reducing or eliminating the sources.

Center staff work on several MPA-related projects for the NMPAC and NMFS on sea-floor mapping using GIS and distribution associated with habitat using ROV technology. Currently the SWFSC is leading efforts to develop a NMFS strategy to integrate MPAs into conventional fisheries science and management. The SWFSC analyzed buybacks of tuna purse-seine vessels in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and determined the feasibility of routinely collecting input data for the Data Envelopment Analysis and for performing industry surveys of tuna fishing capacity utilization for the FAO. The SWFSC developed economic models for three different fishing capacity or productivity analyses. The projects will measure total factor productivity of tuna purse seine vessels accounting for catches of undesirable outputs, measure total factor productivity of U.S. tuna purse seine vessels in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean accounting for environmental influences, and analyze standardization of fishing effort. Data are being collected for the high seas tuna fleets and the longline fleet; computer code has been written for the high seas tuna fleet. SWFSC researchers met in Bellagio, Italy, with international economists, marine life policy experts, legal scholars, fishing industry and fisheries professionals, conservation, sea turtle and natural resource management specialists, and development assistance researchers from governmental, nongovernmental, and private institutions to provide a scientific and policy basis to develop elements of a model treaty to conserve and promote recovery of Pacific sea turtles. The group concluded that a blueprint for sea turtle conservation must address 1) protecting all nesting beaches, 2) reducing turtle take in at-sea and coastal fisheries, 3) stimulating pan-Pacific policy actions, and 4) encouraging sustainability of traditional use of sea turtles. The first point recognizes that protecting nesting beaches has been proven to work in restoring sea turtle populations.

Long-term changes in the ecosystem supporting fisheries are monitored through surveys of that ecosystem; research is under way to convert these data into indices on the health of the ecosystem. Additional process-oriented research projects focus on the effects of pollution on coastal species (e.g., winter flounder and bluefish); biological characteristics of selected shark species in the North Atlantic; field investigations on the effects of trawling on seabed habitats; and descriptions of essential fish habitat (EFH) for most finfish species. The Center also conducts social and economic research in support of the fishery management process. The NSL provides taxonomic expertise on finfish, crustaceans, and squids for all of NMFS. Reliable information-critical to the development of regional FMPs, subsequent amendments, and ultimately to the maintenance of sustainable fisheries-is produced through the Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Workshop (SAW) process. This cooperative effort is guided by the Northeast Regional Coordinating Committee composed of the directors of the NEFSC, Northeast Regional Office (NERO), New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). The Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Review Committee (SARC) is an important part of the SAW process, which includes peer-assessment development (SAW Working Groups or ASMFC technical committees), assessment peer-review, public presentation, and document publication. The process has been in place since 1985, and has provided a forum for preparing, peer reviewing, and reporting on stock assessments of over 40 species/stocks in the region. The SAW is the oldest such process for review of assessments by peers in the Nation and has been used as a model in developing similar protocols around the United States and in Europe. All meetings are open to the public and widely announced. As currently constituted, the SAW has three parts: 1) SAW working group meetings where the assessments are developed (or ASMFC technical/stock assessment groups when stock assessment are prepared by the ASMFC), 2) a high-quality peer review of the assessments by an independent panel of assessment/management experts, and 3) presentation of results/reports from the SARC meeting to the FMCs and ASMFC. The Plan Development Teams and Technical Committees of the FMCs use the Stock Assessment Reports and the peer reviewers' reports to develop management advice for the FMCs that is consistent with existing FMPs. The Northeast Cooperative Research Partners Program (NCRPP)-NMFS' largest cooperative research program in the northeast-was established in 1999 in conjunction with the New England Fishery Management Council. The NCRPP is one of six regional cooperative research programs nationwide. The program has funded more than $26 million in cooperative research projects both large and small, and just over $1 million in 2005. Cooperative research programs promote trust and understanding among fishermen, scientists, and managers; provide a way for fishermen to contribute their empirical knowledge of the sea and marine life to the scientific process; and can strengthen both the information underlying fishery management decisions and the decisions themselves. Much recent gear research in the Northeast has been accomplished through grants, with Northeast Regional Office (NERO) oversight. These grants have gone to fishermen, or to organizations such as states and universities, which carry out the research with the help and cooperation of the fishing industry. The NERO Fisheries Engineering Group is also involved with data analysis for exempted fishery permits and fishway engineering for anadromous fish. Conservation engineering activities in the NERO have recently been concentrated on the problem of entanglement of large whales in fixed fishing gear (e.g., lobster traps and gillnet gear). The fishing industry aided this effort through its participation in the Gear Advisory Group to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team by devising solutions and by volunteering vessels and time for observations and testing. Also, NERO and the NEFSC are collaborating on experiments using pingers and acoustic reflective nets as deterrents to marine mammal entrapment in gillnets."}, {"section_title": "Gloria Michelle", "text": "emy to conduct fisheries training for NOAA Corps' Basic Officer Training Class 106.

In addition, from a marine ecosystem perspective, many PIFSC research programs rely on information about the physical environment in the central and western Pacific Ocean. The Center uses satellite remotely sensed ocean and atmospheric data, including the CoastWatch/Ocean Watch station with the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service; ocean circulation models; a comprehensive physical and biological Coral Reef Ecosystem Integrated Observing System; information from research cruises; and fisheries data to advance our understanding of the dynamic physical and biological ecosystems found in the Pacific region. The PIFSC also makes extensive use of biological and fisheries data collected by observers placed on fishing vessels by the Pacific Islands Regional Office's Observer Program. These observers monitor fishery interactions with protected species to achieve goals related to the MSFCMA, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Organizationally, marine ecosystem and fisheries research at the PIFSC primarily is carried out by four of the Center's research divisions: the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED), the Ecosystems and Oceanography Division (EOD), the Fish Biology and Stock Assessment Division (FBSAD), and the Fisheries Monitoring and Socioeconomics Division (FMSD): mapping that provides the scientific basis for effective management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems in the U.S.-affiliated islands of the central and western Pacific Ocean. Specific research activities include: 1) ecological assessment and monitoring to quantify and document spatial and temporal changes in the health of coral reef living resources resulting from either natural or human-induced impacts; 2) detailed taxonomic surveys of reef-associated organisms to assess conservation of biodiversity in using ecosystem approaches to management; 3) habitat mapping and characterization to define and understand the dynamics of habitat-ecosystem-resource linkages; 4) monitoring of oceanographic processes affecting reefs to identify conditions that influence coral reef ecosystem health; and 5) reef restoration through the assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of the effects of marine debris on coral reef ecosystems. Complementary applied research includes evaluating the effectiveness of marine protected areas, developing non-extractive fishery-independent methods to assess and study bottomfish and their habitat associations, and development of active and passive acoustic technologies to improve capabilities to remotely monitor indicators of ecosystem health. marine ecosystems in the Pacific Islands region and the broader North Pacific.

It covers all research undertaken in support of NOAA's various mission as described in the NOAA Strategic Plan. Its planning horizon is FY 2007-2011 and is undergoing revision with a similar schedule as this update of the NMFS Strategic Plan for Fisheries Research (NSPFR). It has a somewhat different goal structure than the NSPFR because it is based on broad themes designed to bring all of the NOAA resources together in an integrated fashion to address societal needs. The NSPFR, on the other hand, follows a legislatively driven outline guiding the much narrower suite of programs designed to achieve the research objectives of NMFS necessary to implement the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA). Thus, the NSPFR encompasses much of NMFS research activities regarding fisheries and habitat issues and includes specific Fisheries Science Center plans as well. Research on marine mammals, turtles, and protected species of fish is included, but only when it is directed at MSFCMA requirements. The NSPFR is more comprehensive and goes into much greater detail regarding NMFS MSFCMA-related research than does any other strategic planning document in NOAA. Nearly all of the NMFS research program falls under the NOAA Ecosystem Goal and its supporting research program, which has five themes: supporting collaborative approaches to science and management at the regional level, understanding the impacts of climate on ecosystems, enhancing social and ecological resilience to hazards, protecting marine and coastal resource security, and developing a more robust ecosystem modeling capability to serve current and future management information needs. These research priorities can be organized in an end-to-end portfolio that covers advancing the understanding of ecosystems; providing new insight into the oceans through discovery and identification of new resources; forecasting biological events or consequences of natural and human-induced changes in the environment; and developing scenarios to simulate potential impacts on marine and coastal resources. Except for climate-related research on ecosystem productivity that resides in the NOAA Climate Goal, most of the NOAA Research Plan milestones for the Ecosystem Goal are all related to this NSPFR. The exceptions are several milestones related to the NOAA Ocean Exploration Program of NOS and the Ecosystem Forecasting work of OAR.

This report is part of a series of plans for enhancing and modernizing NMFS programs for data collection, information technology, data management, stock assessments, scientific research, and fisheries management. The report includes specific recommendations for improving the quality of NMFS' stock assessment programs and emphasizes the need for the agency to foster partnerships and cooperative research programs with other Federal agencies, state agencies, private foundations, universities, commercial and recreational fishing organizations and individuals, environmental groups, and others with a vested interest in collecting similar types of data.

The study examined representative survey types, but did not evaluate every regional or state survey method. It also considered the match or mismatch between options for collecting recreational fisheries data and alternative approaches for managing recreational fisheries. The report recommended that the current survey programs be redesigned to improve sampling and estimation procedures, their applicability to various kinds of management decisions, and their usefulness for social and economic analyses. The report also emphasized that state and Federal agencies must work together to provide ongoing technical evaluation and modification of survey programs to meet emerging management needs and to achieve much greater degree of standardization among state and Federal surveys. It recommended treating the For-Hire fishing sector as a \"commercial\" sector, and proposed that mandatory timely reporting of all catch and effort by that sector be required. The report also called for NOAA to set a firm deadline linked to sufficient program funding to implement the recommendations (NRC 2006a). This 2006 report commissioned by NOAA reviews the many recent scientific papers about the effects of fishing on marine food webs and the productivity of species. The objective of the review was to evaluate these effects in the context of relevance to fisheries management, future research and stewardship. Recommendations in this report call for a more comprehensive ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, rather than the species-by-species approach currently being used. It calls for supporting research on the extent of fishing effects on ecosystems and the development of comprehensive models suitable for portrayal of different management scenarios. These models should include food webs and species interactions within the ecosystems and the intertwining social and economic factors (NRC 2006b). Published in 2001, this NOAA-commissioned report evaluates marine protected areas (MPAs) as a tool to supplement conventional fishery management. The report recommended networks of MPAs, some for fishery management, embedded within broadly zoned management areas in the coastal ocean. Additionally, the study indicated that the basic knowledge gained through monitoring and evaluation of MPAs on the structure, function, and variability in marine ecosystems would enhance the design of reserves and allow more accurate evaluations of their ecological and socio-economic consequences. Reserves would also allow more accurate estimation of parameters such as natural mortality rates-an essential variable in stock assessment models.

Seafood contributes to a variety of nutritious benefits to the American diet. Contamination of marine resources, however, whether naturally occurring or anthropogenic is a concern to U.S. consumers. Because of the potential for adverse health effects, consumers-particularly subpopulations, which may be at increased risk-need authoritative information to make informed choices that provide desired nutrients balanced against exposure to potential toxicants. The study is being used a centerpiece of information for the agency to focus its extensive fishery food science expertise to assist other Federal agencies and the U.S. consumer to develop a decision path to balance seafood choices to obtain needed nutritional benefits while minimizing exposure.

We believe that the present treatment is adequate for the purposes of this document. Comment: To ensure the progression to ecosystem-based management stays on course, NMFS should design a research program specifically geared toward the recommendations of the Ecosystems Principles Advisory Panel (EPAP) Report to Congress, with schedules and milestones to gauge progress. Response: The EPAP recommendations are useful for measuring progress towards providing information to support ecosystem-based management. The Plan addresses the EPAP recommendations in section I.B. Interdependence of fisheries or stocks of fish. Comment: The Plan notes that an ecosystem-based approach is needed to take into account the various factors that affect the status of a stock and the importance of a stock to other components of the ecosystem, but omits a comprehensive initiative that would serve to implement the first step toward an ecosystem-based approach recommended by the Ecosystems Principles Advisory Panel Report to Congress-that fishery managers consider how fishing affects predator-prey interactions. Comment: While the NSPFR does not directly address regulatory matters, NMFS notes (as explained in the prior ecosystems-related comment) that the agency has increased its emphasis on a holistic approach to resource management. By bringing ecosystem-wide information and advice to resource managers, NMFS helps to ensure that managers will be in a better position to consider predator-prey and all other relevant ecosystem interactions. Comment: NMFS should direct the Science Centers to investigate the ecological roles of commercially important forage species in each region so that these roles can be qualitatively and quantitatively described."}, {"section_title": "Response:", "text": "The role of forage species is a fundamental aspect of ecosystem research, and is a high priority addressed in section I.B. Interdependence of fisheries or stocks of fish. Comment: This Plan reflects an inherent bias towards research that contributes to managing and maximizing fishery yields over that for protected species. Response: The NSPFR, as mandated by Congress, deals with only fisheries conservation and management. It includes only protected species issues that are derived from interactions with recreational or commercial fisheries. Otherwise, protected species research is not part of this Plan, as is explained in the Introduction. When there is known bycatch or entanglement problems due to fishing gear, these issues are addressed through gear research (such as turtle excluder devices or dolphin/tuna net innovations), and through regulatory measures (such as closed fishing areas or seasons when protected species are present). There is considerable effort identified for gear research concerning protected species in this Plan's Goal 2 and corresponding Objectives (pages 40-41) as well as the six individual Science Center sections devoted to conservation engineering research (starting on pages 57, 78, 91, 104, 118, and 136). that is sustainable and minimizes environmental impacts. It is important to note that no commercial aquaculture currently is ongoing offshore (i.e., in Federal water), and very little open ocean aquaculture is currently underway. Therefore, even a small industry would represent \"expansion.\" NMFS will conduct an environmental impact statement, using the best available science, to help determine appropriate locations and permit conditions for OOA, taking into account environmental and other impacts, including cumulative impacts. Comment: Strongly agree with research Objective 1.11 (Conduct additional research to provide needed information to refine EFH designations). Many of the EFH descriptions and designations are now effectively fish habitat descriptions and fail to identify any particular areas that are truly EFH. Research should be conducted to better distinguish between \"essential\" fish habitat and fish habitat generally. Response: NMFS has changed the wording of Objective 1.11 to further clarify the intent of the objective. Comment: The work of the fisheries aspect of NOAA is outstanding and should be fully funded by Congress. NOAA should include Great Lakes waters in its Fisheries studies and request adequate funding for that work from Congress. Response: NOAA has responsibility for some aspects of research in the Great Lakes, but not that related to fisheries stewardship. That role falls to the states and Canadian provinces that border the Lakes. Coordination of fisheries research and stewardship occurs through the Canadian/U.S. Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries as implemented by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. A similar arrangement exists along the ocean coastal states where federally chartered Coastal States Marine Fisheries Commissions coordinate state roles in research and stewardship. The research addressed in this Strategic Plan for Fisheries Research is primarily that in support of stewardship in Federal waters and on the high seas. Comment: The greatest threat to the coastal environment right now is the influx of raw and treated sewage, and increased amounts of farm fertilization and waste runoff being discharged into the fragile back bay and tributary environments instead of being piped a few miles offshore. Also, the industrial waste and byproducts which are causing increased risk of cancer or other disease to humans should be immediately eliminated everywhere. Response: Nutrient loading through sewage, land runoff, and other causes is a major problem leading to eutrophication of many estuaries and coastal waters. NMFS works with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, the states, and others to reduce pollution, for the benefit of both the resources and their human and other users. The research-related aspects of this comment are already included in the Plan. Comment: Mass catching methods (such as purse seining and long-lining are causing complete and utter shutdown of certain populations within our marine habitat. Response: Fish removals must not be disruptive to ecosystems. The agency works internationally with regional fisheries organizations, with the United Nations fisheries organization, and with individual nations, to coordinate research and stewardship of high seas fisheries. In such work we address such concerns as long lining, bycatch of fish and turtles in shrimp trawls, taking of dolphins in tuna purse seines, and unregulated fishing by fleets from non-participating nations. Domestically, we work with the states and Fishery Management Councils to focus our research and stewardship actions on the most important problems affecting resource conservation. The research-related aspects of this comment are already included in the Plan. Comment: 1) Ban all genetically modified organism (GMO) species and manipulation, so marine species are not altered in any way, 2) Coordinate national and international regulation of fisheries, and 3) Continue qualitative and quantitative research. Response: NMFS believes that: 1) unintended release of (GMOs) into the marine environment is to be avoided, 2) that fisheries regulations need to be coordinated, and 3) that qualitative and quantitative research needs to continue to develop a basis for decisions. NOAA policy (http://govdocs.aquake.org/cgi/reprint/2003/514/5140040.pdf) with respect to GMOs is that regulations and decisions regarding the risk to biodiversity, particularly from introduction of aquatic organisms and use of genetically altered organisms, should be guided by internationally accepted codes of practice, existing Federal regulations and procedures and, where appropriate, by approaches and regulations in use at the state level. The same protocols should be used as tools in any evaluations of impact subsequent to the agency's decisions. This Plan will assist decision makers by making the best science available so that appropriate decisions can be made. With respect to coordination of fisheries regulations, we work internationally with regional fisheries organizations, with the United Nations fisheries organization, and with individual nations, to coordinate the research underlying regulatory regimes and the stewardship of high seas fisheries. In such work we address such concerns as long lining, bycatch of fish and turtles in shrimp trawls, taking of dolphins in tuna purse seines and unregulated fishing by fleets from non-participating nations. Domestically we work with the states and Fishery Management Councils to focus our research and stewardship actions on the most important problems affecting resource conservation. The need for continuation and strengthening of our research program is evidenced throughout the Plan. Comment: Somewhere in this extensive NOAA NMFS document there should be a credible discussion of overfishing. Response: Much of NMFS' scientific work is devoted to assessing and monitoring the fish stocks, including the scientific basis for determining whether they are overfished or experiencing overfishing. NMFS agrees that overfishing and overfished should be better defined and has included the operational definitions used by this agency. A stock that is subject to overfishing has a fishing mortality (harvest) rate above the level that provides for the maximum sustainable yield. A stock that is overfished has a biomass level below a biological threshold specified in its fishery management plan. This is treated at much greater depth and with respect to each of the major fisheries in the Annual Report to Congress on the Status of U.S. Fisheries, available on the NMFS site at http://www.nmfs. noaa.gov/sfa/sfweb/. Comment: Greater effort needs to be put into direct manipulation of Bering Sea commercial fisheries to better determine their role and impacts in areas where there are ongoing declines in marine mammals. Response: NMFS recognizes that the effects of indirect interactions between commercial fisheries and marine mammals will not be understood solely by studying marine mammals. To this end, the AFSC has designed and supported a suite of studies directed at both Steller sea lions and their prey, including commercially important forage fish. Studies that involve manipulation of the commercial fishery have not been pursued due to operational and logistic difficulties, and because fishery management measures taken to protect Steller sea lions effectively provided the changes in fishing effort that could aid in assessing responses in Steller sea lion survival, reproduction, or foraging patterns. However, studies that involve manipulations in fishing effort in some areas might be appropriate in the future should indirect interactions continue to be a serious issue for marine mammals in the Bering Sea. Comment: Clearly the discussion in the Plan focuses on salmon recovery. Indeed many species of salmon are listed under the ESA and are still declining. While there is an impressive list of activities, it is clear that either research is not properly focused or management action arising from the research is inadequate, since the fish continue to decline. NMFS should examine whether the interplay between its research and management actions is logical and robust. Response: NMFS concurs that many salmon stocks remain threatened or endangered. NMFS supports the need to ensure that the science to inform management is the best possible given the funding constraints to meet all mandates for the agency. To achieve this end in regard to salmon science, the NWFSC has conducted both internal and external peer reviews of our science plans to achieve a credible effort that can inform management in critical areas in as timely a manner as possible. Moreover, multistakeholder-authored recovery plans and targets now exist for nearly all listed ESU's from which measured gains in relation to management actions can be documented. In many cases, improvements in the status of many stocks have been observed, although delisting has only been achieved for one stock at this time. Comment: NMFS should shift the focus of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands lobster assessment from establishment of harvest guidelines to use as an indicator of ecosystem health. Response: Lobster in the Papah\u0101naumokuake\u0101 Marine National Monument are subject to a zero harvest guideline pursuant to Proclamation 8031 and its codifying regulations. NMFS believes that the data gathered in these assessments is useful as an indicator of the ecosystem health of the Monument, and has modified text accordingly. Comment: NMFS should initiate collection of age-length data for central Pacific non-pelagic (i.e., bottomfish) species from otolith reading, to support examination of the impacts of fishing on age structure and to estimate mortality rates. Given that the Proclamation establishing the Papah\u0101naumokuake\u0101 Marine National Monument restricts fishing activity, NMFS should focus on main Hawaiian Islands bottomfish stocks. Response: NMFS agrees that more basic fisheries biology work is important for the other bottomfish fishing areas, and has revised text accordingly. Comment: Development of tagging programs for highly migratory species in the central and western Pacific seems more in the realm of international fishery management agencies than a NMFS-specific responsibility. Response: NMFS agrees that such tagging programs should be developed in conjunction with regional fishery management organizations, and has modified the text accordingly. Comment: NMFS should ensure that studies examining the impacts of gear modifications on longline fisheries are performed and that the results of the studies be analyzed, reviewed, and made available to fishery managers. Response: NMFS agrees that dissemination of the results of such studies is extremely important, and has worked assiduously both domestically and internationally to disseminate these results. The text has been modified to reflect this. Comment: NMFS should use agent-based modeling to analyze how the participation of individual fishermen in small boat fisheries in the western Pacific region can affect catch rates and, in turn, stock assessments that rely on catch rates as a measure of biomass. Response: NMFS agrees that agent-based modeling (ABM) is a potentially fruitful approach towards understanding fishing effort from both a biological and economic perspective, and has initiated research in this direction. The text has been modified accordingly. are potentially able to recolonize sites within the metapopulation from which the species or subspecies recently became extinct."}, {"section_title": "Minimum Stock Size Threshold (MSST, B threshold ):", "text": "A status determination criteria (SDC). The greater of: a) 1/2 BMSY, or b) the minimum stock size at which rebuilding to BMSY will occur within 10 years while fishing at the maximum fishing mortality threshold (MFMT). MSST should be measured in terms of spawning biomass or other appropriate measures of productive capacity. If current stock size is below B threshold , the stock is overfished. Optimum yield (OY): a) The amount of fish which will provide the greatest overall benefit to the Nation, particularly with respect to food production and recreational opportunities, and taking into account the protection of marine ecosystems; b) is prescribed as such on the basis of the maximum sustainable yield from the fishery, as reduced by any relevant economic, social, or ecological factor; and c) in the case of an overfished fishery, provides for rebuilding to a level consistent with producing the maximum sustainable yield in such fishery. Overfished: 1) An overfished stock or stock complex \"whose size is sufficiently small that a change in management practices is required to achieve an appropriate level and rate of rebuilding.\" A stock or stock complex is considered overfished when its population size falls below the minimum stock size threshold (MSST). A rebuilding plan is required for stocks that are deemed overfished. 2) A stock is considered \"overfished\" when exploited beyond an explicit limit beyond which its abundance is considered 'too low' to ensure safe reproduction. In many fisheries fora the term is used when biomass has been estimated to be below a limit biological reference point that is used as the signpost defining an \"overfished condition.\" This signpost is often taken as being FMSY, but the usage of the term may not always be consistent. (see Minimum Stock Size Threshold) Comment: The stock may remain overfished (i.e., with a biomass well below the agreed limit) for some time even though fishing pressure might be reduced or suppressed. Overfishing: 1) According to the National Standard Guidelines, \"overfishing occurs whenever a stock or stock complex is subjected to a rate or level of fishing mortality that jeopardizes the capacity of a stock or stock complex to produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY) on a continuing basis.\" Overfishing is occurring if the maximum fishing mortality threshold (MFMT) is exceeded for 1 year or more; 2) In general, the action of exerting fishing pressure (fishing intensity) beyond the agreed optimum level. A reduction of fishing pressure would, in the medium term, lead to an increase in the total catch.
