[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": ").\nThe purpose of this report is to describe the state of imaging techniques and technologies for detecting response of brain tumors to treatment in the setting of multicenter clinical trials. Within currently used technologies, implementation of standardized image acquisition and the use of volumetric estimates and subtraction maps are likely to help to improve tumor visualization, delineation, and quantification. Upon further development, refinement, and standardization, imaging technologies such as diffusion and perfusion MRI and amino acid PET may contribute to the detection of tumor response to treatment, particularly in specific treatment settings. Over the next few years, new technologies such as 2 3 Na MRI and CEST imaging technologies will be explored for their use in expanding the ability to quantitatively image tumor response to therapies in a clinical trial setting.\nKeywords: brain tumors, diffusion MRI, imaging biomarker, MRI, PET, perfusion MRI, response assessment, T1 subtraction.\nCurrently Available Techniques With Immediate Application\nIn multicenter studies, the heterogeneity of MR scanners and parameters (eg, field strength, gradient system, manufacturer, sequences) must be considered. It is well known that even minor differences in hardware or in sequence timing may result in significant changes in image contrast and tumor measurements, potentially exceeding the changes caused by therapy or the disease itself. Furthermore, a variety of MR sequences are used for tumor assessment, which further hampers comparability between different centers without tight control and standardization of pulse sequence parameters.\nA high contrast-to-noise ratio between tumor and surrounding tissue is crucial for precise measurement of tumor size. In addition to differences in sequences and sequence parameters, 1 lesion contrast is also dependent on the magnetic field strength of the scanner, 2 with higher field strengths showing higher contrast-to-noise compared with lower field strength scanners (eg, 3T vs 1.5T). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images show even higher variability, as the signal changes induced by the contrast agent are related to the timing, dose, and type of contrast agent used. Dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging has shown that the maximum contrast agent uptake occurs between 4 and 8 minutes after contrast agent application, 3 indicating that this is the most effective window for acquiring postcontrast T1-weighted images for minimal variability in lesion size estimation due to timing of contrast agent administration.\nThere is increasing evidence to support the hypothesis that volumetric estimates of tumor burden are more accurate than 1D/2D measurements. A study by Voss et al 4 showed that the Macdonald assessment of chemotherapy resulted in a kappa coefficient of 0.51, with 55% of evaluated MRI studies not having a complete consensus for categorical tumor response measurement."}, {"section_title": "Standardization of Image Acquisition Reduces Variability in Measurements", "text": "In multicenter studies, the heterogeneity of MR scanners and parameters (eg, field strength, gradient system, manufacturer, sequences) must be considered.

A study by Voss et al 4 showed that the Macdonald assessment of chemotherapy resulted in a kappa coefficient of 0.51, with 55% of evaluated MRI studies not having a complete consensus for categorical tumor response measurement. 4 In a study by Shah et al 5 , the best response assessment had a 63% correspondence between 1D and enhancing volume measurements and 69% correspondence between 2D and enhancing volume measurements. In a study comparing 1D, 2D (bidirectional), and 3D volumetric contrast-enhancing tumor measurements, only 3D enhancing volume was predictive of overall survival (OS) (along with age and sex). 6 Provenzale et al 7 showed poor reader agreement in tumor assessment, with an 14% falsepositive rate in the diagnosis of progression of tumors that are stable. A study comparing 1D, 2D, and 3D volumetric contrastenhancing tumor measurements in childhood brain tumors showed relatively poor concordance between 3D and 1D/2D measurements of 61% -66%. 8 Others have reported somewhat higher concordance rates. For example, Galanis et al 9 compared 1D, 2D, and volumetric results and found good agreement between volume and linear measurements in terms of measurement response at 4 months for newly diagnosed gliomas (75% in 1D and 2D vs volumetric). Similar performance was observed when examining tumors treated with bevacizumab and concurrent irinotecan. 10 In general, high interobserver variability has been noted in bidirectional and unidirectional measurements compared with 3D measurements. 11 This is most likely due to difficulty defining the exact margins and identifying the largest diameter or perpendicular diameter 12 and the tendency of 1D/ 2D measurements to overestimate tumor volume, 6 thus leading to a significantly longer measured progression-free survival (PFS) 8 that is presumably due to larger estimates of tumor burden at baseline."}, {"section_title": "Volumetric Analysis of Recurrent Glioblastoma Treated With Bevacizumab", "text": "Results from volumetric analyses in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) treated with bevacizumab appear to be mixed. A singleinstitution study by Ellingson et al 13 demonstrated that .75% of patients experienced a .5% decrease in contrast-enhancing volume after bevacizumab and that there was no link between the change in contrast-enhancing tumor volume and PFS or OS. In support of these findings, a recent ACRIN-6677/RTOG-0625 multicenter study presented by Boxerman et al 14 convincingly demonstrated that an increase in contrast-enhancing volume beyond 8 or 16 weeks can be used to predict OS in recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab; however, a decrease in the volume of contrast enhancement (ie, \"response\") was not predictive of OS. These results are similar to a recent multicenter study by Ellingson et al 15 involving conventional volumetric segmentation of data from the BRAIN trial, showing that the change in enhancing volume before and after treatment with bevacizumab was not predictive of PFS or OS. In contrast to these studies, a singleinstitution study by Huang et al 16 recently found that baseline enhancing volume, posttreatment residual enhancing volume, and percentage change in enhancing volume were all predictive of PFS and OS. Together, these studies suggest that there are, at most, only weak correlations between volumetric response to bevacizumab and patient survival using conventional volumetric segmentation techniques."}, {"section_title": "3D Image Acquisition Further Reduces Variability in Lesion Volume Assessment Compared with 2D Acquisition", "text": "To date, most tumor studies are performed using 2D techniques with higher in-plane resolution than through-plane resolution (ie, slice thickness). It has been shown that incorrect repositioning of these slices increases variability of lesion volume estimates at follow-up, 17 and that this variability can be reduced by implementing automatic slice positioning tools. Alternatively, the use of 3D acquisition instead of 2D MRI sequences is thought to reduce variability relating to slice positioning by as much as 50%. 18 Evidence suggests that the use of 3D T1-weighted MR images to evaluate tumor volume may have a significant impact on the evaluation of therapeutic benefit. For example, a recent study by Boxerman et al 14 demonstrated that early progression on both 2D and 3D T1-weighted images acquired 8 or 16 weeks following drug treatment using bevacizumab with irinotecan or temozolomide in recurrent glioblastoma (RTOG-0625) predicted OS; however, 3D T1-weighted images allowed for a better separation of responders and non-responders on Kaplan-Meier curves, presumably due to more accurate assessment of lesion volumes using 3D acquisition techniques.\nAlthough 3D gradient echo-based sequences are by far the most commonly used in brain tumor clinical trials (eg, MPRAGE or SPGR sequences), 3D spin echo-based sequences (eg,f CUBE or SPACE sequences) may also be beneficial for quantifying lesion volumes. 3D spin echo-based sequences may have added benefits of reduced susceptibility artifacts and increased contrastto-noise when used on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging compared with 3D gradient echo-based sequences; however, 3D spin echo sequences typically suffer from lower signal-to-noise, higher specific absorption rate, and specific sequence acquisition details may vary across vendors due to lack of sequence standardization."}, {"section_title": "Contrast-enhanced T1 Subtraction (CE-DT1w) Maps Improves Visualization and Quantification of Enhancing Tumor", "text": "The use of image subtraction was first described by des Plantes in 1961 19 and continues to be useful for applications requiring detection of subtle changes in contrast uptake. In fact, the use of digital subtraction maps has been recommended by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and Society for Skeletal Radiology (SSR) in their guidelines for interpretation of MRI of bone and soft tissue tumors. 20 In the brain, digital subtraction of postcontrast MR images from precontrast MR images was described by Suto et al 21 as early as 1989. In 1993, Lloyd et al 22 demonstrated the utility of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted subtraction maps in head and neck tumors, showing that subtraction maps provide a more accurate record of tumor extent compared with unsubtracted postcontrast MR images. In a pictorial essay in 1996, Lee et al 23 described the use of image subtraction as a broadly applicable postprocessing technique that can be performed at any field strength and any T1-weighted sequence in a variety of imaging applications, including use in differentiating enhancing lesions from hemorrhage. Later that year, Gaul et al 24 examined subtraction maps in the presence of hyperintense subacute hemorrhage in the area of interest on T1-weighted images, noting a net negative signal within areas of blood products and net positive signal in areas of residual tumor on subtraction maps. A study by Melhem et al 25 in 1999 attempted to quantify the benefit of postcontrast T1-weighted subtraction maps compared with standard postcontrast images, noting that enhancing brain lesions were more conspicuous on the subtraction images, had a significantly higher contrast-to-noise ratio, and could identify residual enhancement in 88% of patients with parenchymal hematomas where standard postcontrast T1-weighted images had failed.\nA recent study by Ellingson et al 15 implemented a variation of this subtraction technique in order to estimate contrastenhancing lesion volumes before and after bevacizumab therapy in recurrent GBM as part of the BRAIN trial. Results suggested that there were significant differences between conventional and T1-subtraction defined volumes, particularly when examining the change in contrast between pre-and posttreatment time points. Results showed that tumors exhibiting a decrease in contrast-enhancing volume had a significantly longer PFS and OS. The ability to predict PFS and OS was further improved when accounting for differences in the treatment paradigm (bevacizumab alone or in combination with CPT-11) and with the addition of a subsequent confirmatory scan. Together, these results suggest that T1 subtraction maps may be extremely useful for improving tumor delineation, visualization, and quantification of enhancing tumor even following changes in vascular permeability.\nTo date there are a variety of commercially available and open-source solutions for performing T1 subtraction. Since T1 subtraction is identical to digital subtraction angiography (DSA), many postprocessing workstations from MR system manufacturers are already equipped with digital subtraction capabilities. Additionally, third-party software packages are also available for T1 subtraction, including the open-source version of Osirix TM .\nReproducibility, Reliability, and Accuracy of Contrast Enhancement, Volumetric Analysis, and T1 Subtraction Maps\nReproducibility of brain tumor volume measurements appears to be on the same order of magnitude as reported in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), an NIH/NINDS-sponsored initiative involving analysis of high-resolution 3D T1-weighted images of the human brain and the quantification of subtle changes in anatomical volumes and measurements. For example, a study by Kaus et al 26 performed both manual and automated segmentation of low-grade gliomas and noted intraobserver and interobserver coefficient of variations of 2% and 13.6%, respectively, using manual segmentation; both were reduced to ,3% after using an automated algorithm. This is similar to other automated techniques that have shown estimated tumor volume errors ranging from 2.5% to 10% compared with manual segmentation. 27 Quantification of 3D volumes from 2D-acquisition protocols appears to result in slightly higher variability in tumor volume measurements. A study by Mazzara et al 28 noted intraobserver variability of 20% and interobserver variability of 28%, and a similar study by Weltens et al 29 showed a coefficient of variance ranging from 14% to 33% for tumor volumes on MRI, depending on whether the lesion volumes were determined by radiologists, radiation oncologists, or neurosurgeons. This range is similar to those determined on CT, 30 and on average results differed by 1.5 cc. 31 Preliminary comparison between volumetric segmentation of standard postcontrast T1-weighted images and T1 subtraction maps suggests that T1 subtraction provides a lower coefficient of variance compared with standard postcontrast T1 weighted images, regardless of whether a vascular permeability agent is used ( Figure 2 ). In particular, a pilot study was conducted of 20 patients randomly selected from 2 different multicenter clinical trials involving antiangiogenic agents. Enhancing tumor volumes were segmented by 3 technologists with 2+ years of segmentation experience before and after administration of therapy. Results suggest that T1 subtraction maps reduce the coefficient of variance in both trials and both contexts compared with standard segmentation, and T1 subtraction maps provide a more dramatic reduction in variability when used for evaluation of tumor burden during antiangiogenic therapy. These results support the hypothesis that T1 subtraction maps improve the ability to delineate tumor burden regardless of therapy.\nAlthough not specifically addressed in the literature, it is conceivable that use of 3D spin echo-based sequences may provide higher contrast-to-noise T1 subtraction maps when compared with subtraction maps generated from 3D gradient echo-based acquisition based on preliminary 2D comparisons. Despite this potential advantage, however, the use of 3D spin echo sequences are not currently common for volumetric contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging in glioblastoma. Future efforts focused on standardization of 3D spin echo sequences across vendors and direct comparisons with 3D gradient echo sequences are critical for integrating these potentially advantageous sequences into multicenter clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Emerging Techniques That Require More Validation", "text": "Diffusion MRI Diffusion-sensitive MRI techniques are another imaging method that has shown promise in predicting response to standard cytotoxic as well as modern antiangiogenic therapies. Diffusionweighted imaging (DWI) is sensitive to microscopic, subvoxel water motion for which an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can be estimated, reflecting the magnitude of water motion. ADC has been shown to be inversely correlated with tumor cell density, 32 -34 largely thought to be due to restriction of extracellular water motion due to tightly packed tumor cells. Given that brain neoplasms have a higher cell density than normal tissues, they have lower ADC values. On the other hand, edema and necrosis, which are associated with lower cell densities, have relatively higher ADC values. This relationship, however, can be confounded by a variety of factors including ischemia, 35 differences in cell shape, 36 and the presence of infection or inflammation. 37 "}, {"section_title": "Diffusion MRI Reflects the Degree of Malignancy", "text": "Although studies have shown an inverse correlation between tumor cell density and ADC, high-grade gliomas are spatially and genetically heterogeneous and show regions of high cellularity adjacent to areas of necrosis and edema.

After application of T1 subtraction maps, the conspicuity of this lesion is clearly improved, and it can be identified as an obvious ring-enhancing lesion (grey arrow).

With postcontrast T1-weighted images, both of these suspicious lesions show enhancement; however, precontrast T1-weighted images show T1 shortening consistent with blood products within the frontal lobe lesion. After application of T1 subtraction maps, the lesion in the frontal lobe is hypointense (white arrow), and the lesion near the posterior lateral ventricle is hyperintense (grey arrow).

This represents the minimum variability in diffusion measurements that can be obtained by the MR system.

Despite preliminary data from relatively small studies, there remains a significant need to clearly validate DSC-MRI techniques and determine standardized methods that provide clinically reliable measurements across multiple institutions. 57 Generally speaking, reproducibility of DSC-MRI hemodynamic parameters across multiple institutions is difficult to achieve due to a wide range of issues that affect the sensitivity of the MR signal and derived parameters, including arterial the concentration-dependent difference in T2* relaxivity between tissue and large vessels, and specific scan parameters including acquisition flip angle, 59 gradient-echo versus spin-echo preparation, 60 and echo time. 61 When evaluated on the same scanner using the same acquisition protocol, DSC-MRI appears to be relatively consistent.

The normal measurement variations, as well as recommended acquisition and postprocessing techniques, are well outlined in this document. Briefly, Ferl et al 79 82 An alternative target for molecular imaging of brain tumors involves labeling amino acids involved in protein metabolic pathways. Amino acid transport is increased in malignant cells; 83 which is hypothesized to be due the net result of increased demand for amino acids for amino acid synthesis for proliferation, transamination, and transmethylation, the use of amino acids as glutamine for fuel, 84 and as precursors for other biochemical syntheses. Regardless of the specific end use of these amino acids in brain tumors, various studies have shown that a wide variety of radiolabeled amino acids are useful for brain tumor molecular imaging. These tracers include [ 11 C-methyl]-methionine ( 11 C-MET), the most widely studied amino acid tracer in brain tumors to date, 85 89 ). Although each of these amino acid uptake tracers are unique in the complexity of their synthesis as well as their precise involvement in protein synthesis and amino acid uptake pathways, numerous studies have demonstrated that they have very similar patterns of accumulation and performance in identifying regions of active tumor. 90 Studies have shown that amino acid PET may have the ability to differentiate tumor growth from treatment-related changes with a sensitivity of 75% -100% and specificity ranging from 60% to 100%. 91 Large multicenter studies are needed to verify these findings.

Additionally, there are a variety of promising physiological imaging technologies on the horizon, but these require further evaluation and standardization before being integrated into multicenter clinical trials for reliably evaluating new therapeutics.\nRecommendations \u2020 Pre-and postcontrast T1-weighted MR imaging sequences should be matched and standardized in future multicenter trials. \u2020 Volumetric acquisition of T1-weighted images should be used for volumetric quantification of enhancing tumor burden. \u2020 Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted subtraction maps should be a primary focus for further evaluation and validation as a Additional Suggestions \u2020 The role of T2/FLAIR signal changes in assessing disease status should be reevaluated after T1 subtraction maps have been implemented, to determine if T2/FLAIR signal change continues to add value in evaluating response to therapy and if it outweighs the limitations of inherent subjectivity in assessing these changes. \u2020 Diffusion and perfusion imaging should be standardized in a multicenter trial setting for further investigation and validation as potential secondary imaging endpoints for response assessment. \u2020 Amino acid PET imaging should be investigated in a multicenter trial once limitations on its availability are overcome because of its potential to identify metabolically active enhancing and nonenhancing tumor. \u2020 More accurate measures of tumor burden should be developed to allow for identification of drugs and interventions that slow, rather than reverse, tumor growth."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "Ellingson -Genentech/Roche Research Grant; Siemens Research Grant.
