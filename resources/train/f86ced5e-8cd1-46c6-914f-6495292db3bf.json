[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Poquoson River is a tidal coastal embayment located along the Western Shore of the Chesapeake Bay about 4 km south of the York River mouth in the City of Poquoson and in York County, Virginia. Its drainage area has diversified land uses, including high densities of residence, agricultural, salt marsh land uses, as well as a National Wildlife Refuge. This embayment experiences elevated bacterial concentration due to excess bacterial inputs from storm water runoff, nonpoint sources, and wash off from marshes due to tide and wind-induced set-up and set-down. Bacteria can also grow in the marsh and small tributaries. It is difficult to use a traditional watershed model to simulate bacterial loading, especially in this low-lying marsh area with abundant wildlife, while runoff is not solely driven by precipitation. An inverse approach is introduced to estimate loading from unknown sources based on observations in the embayment. The estimated loadings were combined with loadings estimated from different sources (human, wildlife, agriculture, pets, etc.) and input to the watershed model. The watershed model simulated long-term flow and bacterial loading and discharged to a three-dimensional transport model driven by tide, wind, and freshwater discharge. The transport model efficiently simulates the transport and fate of the bacterial concentration in the embayment and is capable of determining the loading reduction needed to improve the water quality condition of the embayment. Combining inverse, watershed, and transport models is a sound approach for simulating bacterial transport correctly in the coastal embayment with complex unknown bacterial sources, which are not solely driven by precipitation."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Fecal pathogens of lakes, rivers, and estuaries are hazardous to public health through water contact recreation, and ingestion of contaminated fish and shellfish. Bacterial levels are elevated in many Virginia waters and hundreds of waterbodies are listed as contaminated bacterially. To provide the basis for States to establish water quality-based pollution control, the development of fecal coliform total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) has been mandated to establish the allowable loading for the pollutant that a waterbody can receive without exceeding water quality standards.\nDeterministic models have been widely used to simulate bacterial transport. These models are linked to watershed models that provide bacterial loadings discharged to estuaries and lakes [1] [2] [3] [4] . For a relatively small coastal embayment, the tidal prism model has often been used for simulating 2 of 14 bacterial transport and fate [3, 5, 6] . The accuracy of the model simulation depends highly on the correct estimation of daily bacterial loading from the watershed. The watershed models, such as HSPF [7] , SWAT [8, 9] , and LSPC [10] , simulate nonpoint source freshwater flow and its associated nonpoint source pollutants. The bacterial loading inputs to the watershed are estimated based on land-use categories and bacterial source distribution including livestock, bio-solids application, wildlife, failing of septic systems, and pets. The advantage of using a watershed model is that it can directly link watershed bacterial sources to the bacterial concentration in the estuaries. It will be extremely useful for understanding the contribution of each bacterial source and to design a management plan to control bacterial loadings. One of the difficulties of using a watershed model is providing bacterial loading to the watershed. These loadings are determined based on the estimation of annual mean results such as wildlife density with consideration of seasonal variation. Because of large variations of watershed land uses and land-use practices, the accurate estimation of bacterial loading is difficult. There are several approaches that have been applied to improve the estimation of bacterial sources based on inverse modeling [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, these applications are for estimating an annual mean loading. It is difficult to use them for estimating long-term seasonal and daily loadings. In this study, we propose to use a combined watershed and inverse modeling approach to simulate bacterial loading in the watershed. For those familiar with agricultural bacterial sources, such as bio-solid application and livestock, the watershed model provides a good estimation of sources. For these sources with large variations or unknown sources, such as wildlife and migration birds, the inverse model can be used to estimate seasonal loading and can be used to adjust the bacterial loading for the watershed to improve the watershed model simulations.\nThe Poquoson River watershed has diversified land uses, including high-density residential, agricultural, and salt marsh land uses, as well as a National Wildlife Refuge. This embayment experiences elevated bacterial concentration due to excess bacterial inputs from stormwater runoff, nonpoint sources, and wash off from marsh areas due to tide and wind-induced set-up and set-down. The bacteria can also grow in the marshes and small tributaries. It is difficult to use a traditional watershed model to simulate bacterial loading, especially in this low-lying marsh area with abundant wildlife, while runoff is not solely driven by precipitation. We combine inverse modeling, watershed modeling (HSPC), and transport modeling (EFDC) to simulate the bacterial transport, which provides a sound approach for simulating bacterial transport correctly in the coastal embayment with complex unknown bacterial sources."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "The Poquoson River watershed is located along the Western Shore of the Chesapeake Bay about 4 km south of the York River mouth (Figure 1 ).

A total of 12 segments of the Poquoson River are listed on the 2006 Virginia 305(b)/303(d) Water Quality Assessment Integrated Report [15] as impaired waterbodies due to violations of the State's water quality standards for fecal coliform and enterococcus.\nThe Poquoson River watershed has diversified land uses, including high densities of residential, agricultural, and salt marshes, as well as a National Wildlife Refuge. The land-use characterization for the entire Poquoson River watershed was based on land cover 2006 data from the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) (http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/ccapregional/). Dominant land uses in the watershed were found to be forest (32%), wetlands (31%), and urban and open space (30%), which account for 93% of the total area in the watershed. For the adjacent Back Creek, the dominant land uses are wetland (48%), forest (19%), and urban (16%). A large portion of the watershed is either tidal wetlands or marshes. The surface water runs off from the watershed and discharges to the embayment through stormwater and point sources.

Routine measurements are conducted monthly. Figure 3 shows the annual mean fecal coliform concentration from 1990 to 2012. It can be seen that fecal coliform concentrations varied from year to year. High concentrations often occurred in wet hydrological years of 1998, 1999, and 2004, but not always following the precipitation variation.

The nonpoint source simulation uses a traditional buildup and wash-off approach. Pollutants from various sources (livestock, wildlife, septic systems, bio-solids application, stormwater, etc.) accumulate on the land surface and are subject to runoff during rain events. Different land uses are associated with various anthropogenic and natural processes that determine the potential pollutant load [3] . The human impact is estimated based on failure of septic systems, human population and pets, and point sources. The wildlife population is estimated based on statistical values of the wildlife density for different habitats in this region as shown in Table 1 . The pollutants that are contributed by interflow and groundwater are also modeled in LSPC for each land use category. Pollutant loadings from surface runoff, interflow, and groundwater outflow are combined to form the final loading output from LSPC. \nThe hourly precipitation at Gloucester Point is used to drive the model.

Since there is no USGS gage or any other continuous flow data available in the Poquoson River watershed, a reference watershed was used for calibration. The USGS Gage 01670000 in Beaverdam Swamp near Ark, VA, located approximately 20 miles north of the Poquoson River watershed, is used to calibrate the model parameters for hydrology simulation. This is the only gauge station in this region. The observation period was from 1980 to 1989.

EFDC is a general purpose modeling package for simulating 1D, 2D, and 3D flow and transport in surface water systems including: rivers, lakes, estuaries, reservoirs, wetlands, and oceanic coastal regions. It was originally developed at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science for estuarine and coastal applications and is considered public domain software [18, 19] . The EFDC model has been integrated into the EPA's TMDL Modeling Toolbox for supporting TMDL development (http://www.epa.gov/ athens/wwqtsc/html/hydrodynamic_models.html). The model grid includes 1593 water cells that cover many tributaries and small embayments (Figure 4 ). Three layers were used in the vertical for this shallow system, which can simulate stratification in this shallow estuary adequately. The model was forced by hourly tide and salinity at the mouth. The inputs are based on a large Chesapeake Bay model simulation [20] . The surface wind is obtained at Gloucester Point. Temperature is not simulated. A constant decay of 1.0 per day was used for the bacterial loss in the stream [13, [21] [22] [23] . Numerical model calibration of fecal coliform was conducted for the period of 2008-2012. Daily flow and loading from watershed model simulation is discharged to the 3D model to the grid cells adjacent to the watershed or small creeks of the adjacent watershed. For a watershed that connects to more than one 3D model grid cell, the flow and loading are evenly distributed to the 3D model grids. Because the flow from Harwood Mills Reservoir mainly overflows from the spillway and bacterial concentration inside the reservoir meets the water quality standard, it has a minor influence on the downstream. Therefore, the loading from the watershed of Harwood Mills Reservoir was estimated based on the observation flow and mean bacterial concentration of measurements instead of using output from the watershed model. The 3D model is calibrated for surface elevation and salinity. As there are no NOAA tide observations, the model is calibrated to the predicted tide. A constant roughness height of 0.3 cm is used for the model. The timestep for the model simulation is 30 s.

The estuary was segmented into 51 tidal segments including tributaries. Monthly observation data are averaged for each segment if more than one observation station were found to be located inside the segment. The linear interpolation of bacteria concentration was obtained for the segment without observations. The decay constant used for the tidal prism model is 1.0 per day.

We introduce the inverse tidal prism model to estimate seasonal bacterial loading. Because the tidal prism model is very efficient in terms of computation, it is feasible to estimate loading, although the spatial resolution is not high enough. The estimated loadings are used to correct the loading input to the watershed model, which is based on the statistical estimation of bacterial loadings for difference bacterial sources, including human, wildlife, agriculture, pets, etc. The watershed model simulates long-term flow and bacterial loading and discharged to a three-dimensional transport model driven by tide, wind, and freshwater discharge. The transport model efficiently simulates the transport and fate of the bacterial concentration in the embayment and is capable of determining the loading reduction needed to improve the water quality condition of the embayment. With the use of inverse modeling, the bacterial loading simulated by the watershed model can be adequately adjusted, which improves both the loading simulation and the 3D model simulation of bacterial transport."}]
