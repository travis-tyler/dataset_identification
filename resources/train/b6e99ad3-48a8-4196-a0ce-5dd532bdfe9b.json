[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Patients and their families have, for many decades, detected subtle changes in cognition subsequent to surgery, and only recently has this been subjected to scientific scrutiny. Through a combination of retrospective human studies, small prospective biomarker studies, and experiments in animals, it is now clear that durable consequences of both anesthesia and surgery occur, and that these intersect with the normal processes of aging, and the abnormal processes of chronic neurodegeneration. It is highly likely that inflammatory cascades are at the heart of this intersection, and if confirmed, this suggests a therapeutic strategy to mitigate enhanced neuropathology in vulnerable surgical patients."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Sporadic, or late onset, Alzheimer disease, is the most common form of dementia, and is thought to be due to an interaction between specific susceptibility genes and environmental factors. But the environmental factors are poorly understood, exemplified by the recent National Institutes of Health consensus statement that \"\u2026firm conclusions cannot be drawn about the association of any modifiable risk factor with cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease\" (Daviglus et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, due to the very common complaint of cognitive decline from patients and families following major illness or surgery, there has been recent focus on these environmental factors as enhancing the neuropathology when in the setting of genetic vulnerabilities. The purpose of this brief review is to review the literature to date on surgery and major illness (primarily sepsis) as risk factors for both the timing and prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia."}, {"section_title": "Surgery", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Human studies", "text": "Anecdotes describing post-operative cognitive decline (POCD) have been around for many decades. It was first characterized by Bedford (1955) , and then more carefully by Moller, Johnson, Monk and others in the last decade (Johnson et al., 2002; Moller et al., 1998; Monk et al., 2008) . Although strict definitions and diagnostic criteria have not been agreed on (Crosby and Culley, 2011; Evered et al., 2011) , POCD seems to be a largely time-limited cognitive syndrome in the days to weeks following surgery. It is most common in the elderly, and after prolonged surgical procedures, but few other risk factors have been identified. No evidence yet exists to implicate any particular feature of the perioperative experience. For example, it appears to be just as common after regional as after general anesthesia (Williams-Russo et al., 1995) . It occurs with all forms of surgery (Moller et al., 1998) . But it appears to resolve; few studies show persistence of the cognitive effects longer than 3 months after surgery. But is this really resolution or merely deployment of cognitive reserve? Longitudinal studies after heart surgery suggest that despite apparent resolution at 6 months, there exists a later decline at about 5 years after surgery (Newman et al., 2001 ). More recently, however, this has been questioned (Selnes et al., 2012) through studies that included medically treated control patients. In fact, because of a lack of preoperative cognitive trajectory information, even the existence of POCD as a real clinical entity has been questioned (Avidan et al., 2009 ).\nWhether or not POCD really exists, or what the diagnostic criteria are, the question of whether surgery is associated with either an earlier onset of dementia, or a higher risk of dementia, remains. This issue was initially tackled by Bohnen et al.
