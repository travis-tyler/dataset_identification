[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Several studies have identified an association between body mass index (BMI) and the incidence and severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but this relationship is not fully understood. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to assess the possible association between BMI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology in subjects with normal cognition and cognitive impairment. The secondary objective was to test whether BMI may contribute to improve the accuracy of a clinical model to predict AD pathology in memory clinic patients with cognitive impairment. Method: One hundred and seven elderly subjects with cognitive impairment (91 memory clinic patients with mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 16 with dementia of AD type) and 55 cognitively healthy volunteers were included in this study. All subjects received a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological evaluation and a lumbar puncture for CSF biomarker analysis. Multiple linear regressions and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were carried out to assess the association between BMI and the CSF biomarkers of AD pathology. Results: BMI was positively correlated with the CSF levels of A\u03b2 42 and negatively with tau and P-tau181 in participants with cognitive impairment. The associations were independent of age, sex, educational level, type and severity of cognitive impairment, cerebrovascular risk factors and the presence of the APOE\u03b54 allele. Furthermore, BMI significantly improved the sensitivity and specificity of a multi-factorial model to predict the presence of an AD CSF biomarker profile. Conclusion: Lower BMI is associated with cerebral AD pathology rather than with cognitive impairment in elderly subjects with MCI and mild dementia. Along with other clinical factors, decreasing BMI may help the clinician to identify patients with cognitive impairment due to AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older age (60-80% of cases) . The development of AD is characterized by a long asymptomatic phase followed by a prodromal stage with beginning cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cerebral accumulation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques, neuronal cell death, and aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau as neurofibrillary tangles are core features of the AD brain pathology (Musiek and Holtzman, 2015) . The cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of A\u03b2 42 , tau, and P-tau181 represent well-established biomarkers of AD and allow for the detection of the disease specific pathology years before the dementia stage (Scheltens et al., 2016) .\nThe body mass index (BMI) is a clinical measure defined by a person's weight in relation to height. Numerous affections have been associated with BMI. Regarding the relation of BMI with AD, an apparent \"obesity paradox\" has been described, i.e. high BMI is associated with risk of (AD) dementia during mid-life whereas in late-life there is an association between low BMI and clinically diagnosed AD (Fitzpatrick et al., 2009 ). More precisely a high BMI in midlife is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes, vascular pathology, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia that are all independent risk factors for developing cognitive impairment and AD dementia in later life. High BMI in midlife has been also associated with cerebral metabolic and structural changes that may early contribute to the development of AD pathology (Erol, 2008) . However, in later life, weight loss and low BMI appear to be associated with severity of cognitive impairment or dementia Luchsinger et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2014) , faster cognitive decline (Deschamps et al., 2002) , and with postoperative delirium (Chung et al., 2015; Juliebo et al., 2009 ) Furthermore, weight loss may be an early event in cognitive decline, and may precede the dementia diagnosis (Buchman et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2006; Knopman et al., 2007) .\nWhile weight loss in older people with cognitive impairment may be detrimental and increase frailty, the relationships between low BMI and cognitive decline, and their causes are not well understood. Possible explanations are that low BMI may result from cognitive impairment and decline with consequences on nutrition and everyday activities; or that specific brain pathology such as AD pathology may result in systemic metabolic changes with consequent weight loss. Evidence supporting this later hypothesis was found in the \"Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\" (ADNI) cohort lower BMI was associated with CSF biomarkers of AD pathology, in both cognitively normal and impaired patients (Ewers et al., 2012; Vidoni et al., 2011) . Also, a post mortem study has found that high amount of cerebral AD pathology is correlated to low BMI (Buchman et al., 2006) . Diagnosis of AD based on clinical and neuropsychological features (McKhann et al., 2011) has limited accuracy in discriminating between cognitive impairment due to AD pathology and cognitive impairment of other causes (Beach et al., 2012) . This is particularly the case in MCI, a group in which the etiology of cognitive impairment and the prognosis are very heterogeneous (Winblad) . Recently proposed revised criteria both include the use of biomarkers to increase the diagnostic and predictive accuracy in patients with dementia; and extend the possible diagnosis of the disease to the prodromal stage of AD, i.e. to MCI due to AD (Albert et al., 2011; McKhann et al., 2011) . However, biomarkers are not always available, or their use may be limited by contraindications, patient's refusal, and costs. Therefore, the identification of additional clinical factors associated with AD pathology may help to improve clinical diagnostic accuracy and to identify, among memory clinic patients, those at high risk of having AD. In this context, BMI, or BMI variation over time along with other clinical features may contribute to improve early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of AD.\nThe aim of this study was to assess the relationships between BMI and AD CSF biomarkers related to amyloid pathology, neuronal injury, and tau hyperphosphorylation. In addition, we addressed the question whether BMI can contribute to improve predictive models of AD pathology in elderly cognitively normal (CN) subjects and in memory clinic patients with MCI and mild dementia."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "One hundred and sixty two community-dwelling subjects aged 50 years or older, 55 of them being CN, and 107 memory clinic patients with cognitive impairment (CI, of which 91 subjects were diagnosed with MCI and 16 with mild dementia of AD type) were included in a prospective longitudinal cohort study aiming at investigating clinical and biological factors associated with AD pathology. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nThe study participants with CI were recruited among outpatients with cognitive impairment referred to the Memory Clinics, Department of Psychiatry and the Department Clinical Neurosciences, University Hospital of Lausanne for investigation of their cognitive complaints. Exclusion criteria were severe concomitant neurological, psychiatric or somatic comorbidities that could affect cognition. All subjects underwent a full clinical evaluation, made by senior neurologists, old age psychiatrists or geriatricians. The clinical examination and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used to assess the presence of relevant depression or anxiety symptoms (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) . Trained neuropsychologists performed a neuropsychological assessment. The neuropsychological assessment included the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Buschke Double Memory Test (Buschke et al., 1997) , the digit span forward and backward (Wechsler, 1955) , the Stroop Test (Stroop, 1935) , the letter fluency task (Cardebat et al., 1990) , and the Trail Making Tests A and B (Reitan, 1958) . The functional assessment included the activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) (Lawton and Brody, 1969) as well as the CDR (Morris, 1993) . The clinical examination, the neuropsychological test battery, ADL and IADL were used to determine the CDR and the CDRsum of boxes (\u2212 SOB) scores and to verify inclusion and exclusion criteria. All tests and scales used in this study are validated and widely used in the field. The CI subjects were further divided into three CI subgroups according to their cognitive profile: amnestic single domain CI (n = 36), non-amnestic CI (n = 10), or mixed impairments (i.e. amnestic multidomain; n = 60).\nBMI was measured and a standard blood sample was taken on the day of the lumbar puncture, after overnight fasting.\nThe diagnosis of MCI or of mild dementia was made by a consensus conference of senior physicians and neuropsychologists prior to the inclusion in the study, based upon neuropsychological and clinical evaluations according to published criteria (McKhann et al., 2011; Winblad et al., 2004) . Patients with a positive diagnosis of MCI or mild dementia were considered together, as the CI group, in accordance with revised concepts of AD considering the disease as a biological continuum of developing cerebral pathology without clear differences between MCI and mild dementia (Albert et al., 2011) . All the subjects in the CI group had memory impairment (\u2265 1.5 SD below the means adjusted for sex, age and education in the verbal memory tasks of Buschke Double Memory Test (Buschke et al., 1997) ), and/or impairment in other cognitive domains such as executive tasks or language skills. All subjects in the CI group also had a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) (Morris, 1993 ) score of at least 0.5 (subjects with a CDR score of 0.5 were categorized as MCI subjects, and subjects with a CDR score of 1 were categorized as mild dementia subjects).\nCN subjects were community dwelling healthy volunteers recruited by advertisement or among relatives of memory clinic patients. The clinical and neuropsychological assessment included the same tests battery and questionnaires as for the CI participants.

Biomarker ratios (tau/A\u03b2 42 and P-tau181/A\u03b2 42 ) as markers of concomitant presence of amyloid pathology and tau pathology (Scheltens et al., 2016; Duits et al., 2014) were also calculated. Different approaches have been proposed to define the AD CSF biomarker profile, but there are still no universal cutoffs established for CSF biomarkers (Duits et al., 2014) . As there may be significant differences between centres, it is recommended to define centre specific cutoffs which should be confirmed by longitudinal clinical follow-up evaluations and, ideally, by post-mortem histology (Molinuevo et al., 2014) . Accordingly, we determined the centre cutoff for CSF P-tau181/ A\u03b2 42 (i.e., 0.0779), we confirmed this cutoff value by using longitudinal clinical follow-up data, and compared it to the literature. Briefly, the centre cutoff was determined in a previous study using data from N = 120 subjects (48 healthy volunteers with normal cognition and 72 memory clinic patients with MCI or mild dementia of AD type) as the value that optimized the Youden index of the Received Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of prediction of CDR categories (CDR = 0 vs CDR > 0; Area Under the Curve [AUC] = 0.789, accuracy: 0.733) Tautvydaite et al., 2017) . This cutoff was further confirmed to be a highly significant predictor of cognitive decline (i.e. change in global cognition as measured by MMSE at a follow-up visit 18 months after inclusion) after considering multiple possible confounders (Beta = \u2212 0.436; p < 0.00001; unpublished data). The determined cutoff for P-tau181/A\u03b2 42 was similar to values previously reported by other (Duits et al., 2014) .\nTo evaluate possible interactions and effects of the APOE genotype on the addressed relationships, leukocyte genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA blood with the Qiagen blood isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the APOE genotype was determined as previously described (Jansen et al., 2015; Popp et al., 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Follow-up visits", "text": "To address the question whether baseline AD CSF biomarker levels were associated with BMI changes over time, and whether lower BMI at baseline may indicate a risk of rapid cognitive decline, we used clinical follow-up data available for a subset of 61 participants, of which 28 were in the CN group and 33 in the CI group. The clinical and neuropsychological follow-up evaluation was performed by the same methods and tests used at the first visit.

Preliminary analyses of longitudinal data in a subsample showed BMI decrease over time in relation to CSF tau and P-tau181, and in association with cognitive decline. Weight change in clinically diagnosed AD dementia has been described previously and associations between weight loss and disease severity and progression have been reported (White et al., 1996; Soto et al., 2012) . General physical frailty (low weight, physical fatigue, sarcopenia, lower gait speed and overall muscular strength) in AD could result from the progressive loss of cognitive function with consequences on nutrition and everyday activities. Furthermore, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy and depression can affect food intake and are often precursors of cognitive decline (Donovan et al., 2014; Geda et al., 2014) . However, impairment of the general nutritional status is mainly observed in the more advanced stages of AD dementia (Marino et al., 2015) .\nWhile weight loss in AD may be relate to cognitive and functional impairment as well as psychiatric symptoms, all with possible consequences on nutrition, another possible explanation is that the development of cerebral AD pathology directly affects the organism's metabolism. One of the early neuropathological changes in AD is the degeneration of the medial temporal lobe cortex (Duara et al., 2008) . This area of the brain may also be related to weight loss (Grundman et al., 1996) . The medial temporal lobe, the entorhinal cortex, and the hypothalamus host structures involved in the regulation of appetite and energy metabolism (Ishii and Iadecola, 2015; Val-Laillet et al., 2015) . Alterations in the synthesis and metabolism of glucose have been described in AD, and may be explained by pathological changes in these brain structures (Gonz\u00e1lez-Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2015; Sato and Morishita, 2015) . Also, misfolded and aggregated amyloid proteins trigger immune responses at systemic and CNS levels that may significantly alter food intake and overall metabolism as with other known chronic inflammatory states (Heneka et al., 2015) . Inflammation, along with other pathological processes related to AD, may increase the susceptibility to developing delirium (Popp, 2013) , and lower BMI has been found to be associated with increased risk of delirium in the elderly (Chung et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2015) . While the association between clinically diagnosed AD dementia and low BMI has been reported in several publications, only a few studies have addressed the possible associations between cerebral AD pathology and BMI, or BMI changes over time. A post mortem autopsy study found levels of cerebral AD pathology to be associated with BMI proximate to death, but other pathologies such as Lewy body pathology and cerebral infarctions were not associated with BMI (Buchman et al., 2006) . Intriguingly, in living older subjects, a study including participants with subjective memory impairment and MCI found high BMI in association with higher amounts of fibrillar insoluble protein aggregates as measured by PET (Merrill et al., 2016) . Using more specific amyloid imaging by PET, another study found low BMI to be associated with greater cortical amyloid burden in cognitively normal older subjects (Hsu et al., 2016) . To our knowledge, the relationships between BMI and CSF biomarkers of AD pathology have been investigated and specifically addressed in only one cohort (ADNI) by two different groups (Ewers et al., 2012; Vidoni et al., 2011) , and no longitudinal results have been published so far. In line with the results from the ADNI cohort, our results in a more heterogeneous group of participants Fig. 3 . Scatterplot showing CSF P-tau181 (pg/ml) versus Body Mass Index (kg/m 2 ) for cognitively normal (CN) and cognitively impaired (CI) patients. n/a n/a n/a n/a Age n/a n/a 0.27 \u204e n/a n/a n/a NYE n/a \u2212 0.26 (p = 0.59) n/a n/a n/a n/a MMSE score n/a n/a n/a 0.

These associations become evident at the pre-dementia clinical stage of AD and seem to be independent of the severity of cognitive impairment. Moreover, we found that tau and P-tau levels at inclusion were related to decreasing BMI over a follow-up time of 18 months suggesting a close and specific relationship between cerebral tau-related neurodegeneration and weight loss. Memory clinic patients presenting MCI and mild dementia are a very heterogeneous group regarding the underlying pathology (Winblad et al., 2004) . Only a part of these subjects have cerebral AD pathology as the main cause of cognitive impairment. Differentiating MCI due to AD from MCI due to other conditions may have major consequences for clinical decision making, especially regarding further, individually chosen diagnostic tests or a \"watchful waiting\" attitude and clinical follow-up, and early and specific treatment options (Popp and Arlt, 2011) . Biomarkers of AD pathology are not always available, or their use may be limited by contraindications, patient refusal, and costs. Therefore, it remains important to identify clinical factors that improve the accuracy of the AD diagnosis. Despite being an easily available and low-cost measure, BMI, or change in BMI over time, is not yet integrated in the clinician's rationale as an indicator of AD pathology in patients with cognitive complaints or beginning decline. To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated the potential of BMI to improve, together with other clinical factors, the diagnostic accuracy of AD. Adding BMI to a model including demographic and clinical factors substantially improved sensitivity and specificity of the model to predict the presence of AD pathology in memory clinic patients with MCI or mild dementia. The results suggest that BMI could be considered along with other relevant clinical parameters to evaluate the individual risk of the presence of cerebral AD pathology in patients with cognitive impairment, in particular if biomarkers are not easily available.\nAnalysis using longitudinal follow-up data available in a subgroup of the study participants showed a correlation between decreasing BMI and MMSE score decline. While preliminary, this additional finding are in line with a recent study showing that in patients with MCI lower BMI predicts evolution to dementia (Cova et al., 2016) , and suggests that decreasing BMI may not only be a clinical indicator of cerebral pathology, but also a clinical factor that could help to identify patients at risk for rapid cognitive decline.\nThe current study has limitations. As a measure of the nutritional status, BMI was shown to have equal or superior performance compared to other body fat-measuring methods (Smith et al., 2014 ). More precise assessment of changes in body composition may provide additional and more specific information, however (Buffa et al., 2014; Cova et al., 2017) . Furthermore, the CN group was too small to appropriately address the question of whether the observed associations between BMI and AD CSF biomarkers may precede the clinical stage of the disease. While preliminary analysis in a subset of subjects with follow-up data indicates that cerebral tau pathology is associated with decreasing BMI over time, further prospective investigation in a larger sample is needed to understand the dynamics between weight loss and cerebral pathology."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "While the precise mechanisms underlying the association between weight loss, metabolic changes, and AD remain to be unraveled, our study provide new evidence suggesting that low and decreasing BMI is associated with CSF biomarkers of cerebral AD pathology in memory clinic patients with MCI or mild dementia.
