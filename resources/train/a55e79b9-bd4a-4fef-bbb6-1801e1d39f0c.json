This document presents selected national estimates of the amount of crime, violence, and disorder at public schools, and the practices and programs that schools use to identify and diffuse potential problems. Much of this document was adapted from analyses that were presented in two NCES publications,Violence in U. S. Public Schools: 2000 School Survey on Crime andSafety (2004-314) or Indicators of School Crime andSafety: 2003 (2004-004). Data on crime, violence, and disorder in our nation' s schools are collected so that policymakers, parents, and educators will have information to identify emerging problems, and gauge the safety of American schools.

One measure of the safety of America's public schools is the presence of violence on school campuses. Public school principals were presented with a list of crimes and asked to report the total number of incidents of each crime for the 1999-2000 school year, as well as the number of crimes that were reported to police or other law enforcement personnel. A subset of crimes collected in SSOCS were those that were violent in nature. These violent incidents included rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attacks or fights with and without a weapon, threats of physical attack with and without a weapon, and robberies with and without a weapon. In order to provide a measure of the most severe incidents, those crimes that would be considered aggravated assaults were included as serious violent incidents. Serious violent incidents included rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attacks or fights with a weapon, threats of physical attack with a weapon, and robberies either with or without a weapon. In 1999-2000, 71 percent of public elementary and secondary schools experienced at least one violent incident (figure 1). Approximately 1.5 million violent incidents occurred in about 59,000 public schools that year. Thirty-six percent of public schools reported at least one violent incident to police or other law enforcement personnel during the 1999-2000 school year (figure 2). Of the 1.5 million violent incidents that occurred at school, around 257,000 were reported to the police. The most serious violence was experienced by a smaller percentage of schools. Twenty percent of public schools experienced at least one serious violent incident (including rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attacks or fights with a weapon, threats of physical attack with a weapon, and robberies either with or without a weapon), for a total of 61,000 serious violent incidents (figure 1). Schools experiencing serious violence were likely to involve police. The majority of those schools that experienced a serious violent incident reported at least one of those incidents to the police or law enforcement personnel (figure 2). Specifically, of the 20 percent of schools with at least one serious violent incident, 15 percent of schools reported a serious violent incident to the police. This means 75 percent of schools that had a serious violent incident reported at least one of those incidents to the authorities."}, {"section_title": "S", "text": "The 2000 SSOCS asked principals about a variety of crimes in addition to those that were violent. In 1999-2000, schools were more likely to have experienced at least one physical attack or fight without a weapon than any other type of crime (64 percent) (figure 3). Threats of physical attack without a weapon (52 percent) and vandalism (51 percent) were the second most reported crimes during 1999-2000, followed by theft or larceny (46 percent), and possession of a knife or sharp object (43 percent). Of those crimes presented to principals, sexual battery other than rape (2 percent), rape or attempted rape (1 percent), and robbery with a weapon (0 percent) were least likely to occur at school.   "}, {"section_title": "DISORDER", "text": "isciplinary problems in school can lead to school disorder that distracts from the ability of teachers to teach and students to learn. A selection of discipline problems were included in the 1999-2000 SSOCS, and principals were asked to report with what frequency those problems occurred at school. The discipline problems included student racial tensions, student bullying, student verbal abuse of teachers, widespread disorder in classrooms, student acts of disrespect for teachers, undesirable gang activities, and undesirable cult or extremist group activities. The level of frequency that a principal reported was used to determine whether the school had a serious problem. Student racial tensions, student bullying, student verbal abuse of teachers, widespread disorder in classrooms, and student acts of disrespect for teachers were considered a serious discipline problem if they were reported to occur daily or weekly. Undesirable gang and cult or extremist group activities were considered a serious discipline problem if they happened at all during the school year. In 1999-2000, schools were more likely to have a serious problem with student bullying than with any other discipline problem (29 percent). Student acts of disrespect for teachers and undesirable gang activities (19 percent each) were the second most reported serious problems for public schools. Among the other discipline problems reported, 13 percent of schools reported student verbal abuse of teachers, 7 percent of schools reported undesirable cult or extremist group activities, and 3 percent of schools reported student racial tensions and widespread disorder in classrooms. "}, {"section_title": "DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS", "text": "rincipals were asked to report the number of disciplinary actions taken for specific offenses during the 1999-2000 school year. Serious disciplinary actions included suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals from school with no continuing services (i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools. About 54 percent of public schools took a serious disciplinary action for any of the specified offenses that occurred in the 1999-2000 school year, for a total of about 1,163,000 actions. Of those serious disciplinary actions, 83 percent were suspensions (for 5 days or more), 11 percent were removals with no services, and 7 percent were transfers to specialized schools (figure 5). Two percent of all public schools took a serious disciplinary action for the use of a firearm or explosive device, and 4 percent did so for the possession of such a device. Use of weapons other than firearms resulted in a serious disciplinary action in 5 percent of schools, while possession of weapons other than firearms led to an action in 19 percent of schools. Ten percent of all public schools took a serious disciplinary action for the distribution of illegal drugs, and 20 percent for the possession or use of illegal drugs or alcohol. In 1999-2000, public schools also reported other reasons for taking serious disciplinary actions in their schools, including fights (35 percent), threats (22 percent), insubordination (18 percent), and other infractions not including academic ones (14 percent). "}, {"section_title": "VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS", "text": "ne approach to reducing the level of crime and violence in schools is to provide students with training intended to prevent certain behaviors. Principals were asked about specific components of formal student programs to prevent or reduce violence at their school. During the 1999-2000 school year, the most frequently reported program components were counseling, social work, psychological, or therapeutic activity (66 percent); behavioral or behavior modification intervention (66 percent); prevention curriculum, instruction, or training (65 percent); and individual attention, mentoring, tutoring, or coaching by students or adults (63 percent) (figure 6). Over half of schools (57 percent) reported the next most common program component, which was programs to promote a sense of community or social integration among students. The program component provided in the survey least reported by school principals was a hotline or tipline for students to report problems (22 percent).

Some of these practices are intended to limit the access that people have to school campuses, while other practices monitor people' s behavior once they are on campus. SSOCS asked principals about a variety of practices that schools utilized during the 1999-2000 school year. Figure   9 shows those practices that schools used to limit access to school campuses. The vast majority of public schools required visitors to sign or check in when entering the school building (97 percent), while few schools required that either students or visitors pass through metal detectors (1 percent). chools use different security measures to monitor the activities of those within the school building. Some of these security measures may include using technology to monitor the school grounds, searching or testing for drugs, or limiting the amount of space available for concealing weapons or drugs. In 1999-2000, schools used a variety of practices to prevent or reduce specific behaviors. Schools were more likely not to provide lockers to students than any other practice used to monitor activities (54 percent) (figure 10). A similar practice is for schools to require clear book bags or ban book bags entirely, which was used by fewer schools (6 percent). While 25 percent of schools required faculty or staff to wear picture IDs, only 4 percent of schools had the same requirement for students. In order to reduce the presence of drugs at school, 21 percent of schools used random dog sniffs, 12 percent of schools had random sweeps for contraband, and 4 percent of schools required drug testing for any students. Finally, 19 percent of schools used security cameras to monitor the school.
