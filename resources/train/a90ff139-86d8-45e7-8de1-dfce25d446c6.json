[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The SNP-SNP interactome has rarely been explored in the context of neuroimaging genetics mainly due to the complexity of conducting \u223c10 11 pairwise statistical tests. However, recent advances in machine learning, specifically the iterative sure independence screening (SIS) method, have enabled the analysis of datasets where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations. Using an implementation of the SIS algorithm (called EPISIS), we used exhaustive search of the genome-wide, SNP-SNP interactome to identify and prioritize SNPs for interaction analysis. We identified a significant SNP pair, rs1345203 and rs1213205, associated with temporal lobe volume. We further examined the full-brain, voxelwise effects of the interaction in the ADNI dataset and separately in an independent dataset of healthy twins (QTIM). We found that each additional loading in the epistatic effect was associated with \u223c5% greater brain regional brain volume (a protective effect) in both the ADNI and QTIM samples."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Traditional univariate methods can test the association of common genetic variants with complex quantitative traits, but they only consider the marginal effect of a single locus and potentially miss variance explained by synergistic or interacting effects of pairs or sets of SNPs 1 [1] . For many complex traits, the similarity of family members drops faster than would be expected as relatedness decreases [2] . This implies that there are non-additive (epistatic) interactions involved in the etiology of many complex traits. Statistical interactions have been demonstrated to be plausible representations of the complex interactions of genes in biological pathways [3] [4] .\nSome prior studies have examined second-order interactive effects of SNPs on brain structure [5] [6] [7] . However, none of these studies has considered genome-wide genotype data; the closest conceptually related study tested for SNP effects on diffusion imaging measures, and aggregated all SNPs with correlated effects into a network [8] . The concept here is different, and aims to assess gene pairs that influence each other's effects on the brain. Prior studies tested interaction effects only for a limited number of popular candidate genes. Any approach based on pre-selecting a pair of genes will overlook a vast search space of potential interactions among SNPs in the genome that have no obvious prior connection. Also, a large main effect is not necessary to be able to detect significant second-order interactions [9] . Given this, prior hypotheses focusing on SNPs with large individual effects may also overlook large second-order effects. Importantly, power estimates for detecting interactive effects are comparable to those for single SNP tests [1] . In simulation studies, the inclusion of interaction terms can boost the power to detect main effects, at least for certain genetic tests [10] . Here we examined the genome-wide, SNP-SNP interactome 2 to test genetic associations with a quantitative biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (temporal lobe volume) in the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We further examine the whole-brain effects of interaction pairs in statistical parametric maps generated with tensor-based morphometry (TBM); we also replicate our tests in an independent, non-overlapping dataset of young healthy twins from the Queensland Twin Imaging (QTIM) study [11] ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Imaging Parameters and Study Information", "text": "We downloaded the full baseline set of 818 high-resolution, T1-weighted structural MRI brain scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

Subjects were scanned with a standardized protocol to maximize consistency across sites. We used the baseline 1.5 Tesla MRI scans, i.e., the T1-weighted 3D MP-RAGE scans, with TR /TE = 2400/1000 ms, flip 1 SNP (=single nucleotide polymorphism): a single-letter variant in the genome; these variations are common, even in healthy human populations, and their effects on brain measures can be assessed using association testing, at one SNP or up to a million genotyped SNPs.\n2 Interactome: The study of interactions between genetic variants or sets of variants in terms of their effects on traits such as brain measures. angle = 8\u00b0, slice thickness = 1.2 mm, and a final voxel resolution = 0.9375 \u00d7 0.9375 \u00d7 1.2 mm 3 .

The largest subset contained 737 subjects from the CEU population (Caucasians). We therefore removed the remaining 81 subjects from our analysis to limit the effects of genetic stratification on our statistical analyses [12] . Additionally, we applied filter rules to the genotype data to remove rare SNPs (minor allele frequency < 0.01), violations of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE p < 5.7\u00d710 -7 ), and poor call rate (<95%). Data were further \"phased\" to impute any missing individual genotypes after filtering using the MaCH program [13] following the ENIGMA imputation protocol [14] . After filtering and phasing, 534,033 SNPs remained.\nAll QTIM subjects were ascertained for genetic similarity, so no subjects were removed before analysis.

EPISIS utilizes the massively parallel processing available in GPGPU (General-purpose computing on graphics processing units) framework to test p(p-1)/2 SNP-SNP interactions in the ADNI dataset in a feasible timeframe. We used the SIS algorithm with cell-wise dummy coding (CDC) [21] to reduce the full predictor space into a subset d of n/log(n) interaction terms [18] . After screening the full set of possible two-way SNP-SNP interactions, we applied ridge regression [22] [23] to the subset of interaction terms (the multiplicative loading of each SNP-SNP pair) and selected significant SNP-SNP interaction terms using the extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) [24] with \u03b3 = 0.5. The choice of the parameter \u03b3 was chosen based on simulations [21] . The EPISIS software is implemented in CUDA and optimized for parallel processing across multiple NVIDIA GPU cards as detailed elsewhere [21] .

Next, we applied ridge regression to the pruned subset of SNP-SNP interaction pairs. Using the extended BIC (\u03b3 = 0.5) [21] to estimate significance in our ridge regression, we identified a significant interaction between rs1345203 and rs1213205.

Here we examined the multiplicative effect of SNP-SNP pairs on brain volume differences. Significant interaction terms explain additional variance in brain volume beyond what is already explained by the additive SNP terms. In our primary tests of associations with temporal lobe volume in the ADNI dataset, we screened 10 11 possible SNP-SNP interaction pairs using the GPU acceleration implemented in the EPISIS software. The top 111 interaction pairs were selected after ranking the marginal effect of each SNP-SNP pair on temporal lobe volume, using an implementation of the sure independence screening (SIS) algorithm [18] . We used ridge regression and the extended BIC [24] to identify a significant interaction between rs1345203 and rs1213205. The functional relevance of the two SNPs is as yet unknown. However, data obtained from the ENCODE dataset (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) show that rs1345203 is located in a transcription factor gene (ELF1/CEBPB) that demonstrates regulatory influence on the DNA structure. The SNP rs1213205 is located in a region of hypersensitivity to cleavage by DNase regulatory elements. It is worth noting that the parameter choices made in the interaction analysis may influence the results, however, parameters were chosen based on the recommended values for EPISIS [21] and SIS [18] . Additional work is still required to identify precisely how these two SNPs might affect brain structure, and to further replicate their interaction. Specifically, we need to identify how changes at a given SNP are related to changes in activity in gene transcription or translation into protein products involved in similar biological pathways. 3D maps of percent tissue change for each additional genetic variant in the interaction in ADNI.
