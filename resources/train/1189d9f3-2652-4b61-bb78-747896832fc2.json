Even though the number of the sequenced isolates is very low and just 3 out of the 11 were local residents, it was very important to study the incidence and frequency of such important number of mutation(s) rarely seen in other countries.\nWe observed the emergence of 18 novel mutations from only 11 sequences, not described before in the literature or in any database. Of those 18 mutations, sixteen missense mutations were found in different positions as follows; 6198C>A, 6281A>G/T, 6285C>A, 6887A>T and 7766A>C belonging to NSP 3, 8897A>T belonging to NSP 4, 10595T>C belonging to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof NSP 5, 12297A>T belonging to NSP 8, 14369G>T and 14993C>T belonging to NSP 12 (RdRp), 16301G>T belonging to NSP 13, 18670G>T and 19499A>C belonging to NSP 14, 22093G>T and 22425C>T belonging to S and 26428A>T belonging to E gene.
