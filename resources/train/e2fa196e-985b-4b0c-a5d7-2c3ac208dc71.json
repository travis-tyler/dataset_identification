[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Storm surge caused by tropical cyclone (TC) is one of the most hazardous events for coastal zones. Superimposing over the astronomical tide, it has produced devastating damage in low-lying areas worldwide in history (Li et al., 2017). Although the operational forecast of storm tide (nonlinear superposition of storm surge and astronomical tide) has made a great progress Many researchers were devoted to developing hydrodynamic models with good precision and high performance for storm tide prediction. Jelesnianski et al. (1992) built the popular SLOSH model which is still extensively used in operational forecast of storm surge. The continual renovation ADCIRC model developed by Luettich and his colleagues (Luettich et al., 1992) has been widely applied in the academic communities. Other hydrodynamic models such as POM (Peng et al., 2004), ROMS (Li et al., 2006), ELCIRC (Stamey et al., 2007), FVCOM (Weisberg et al., 2008), SELFE (Shen et al., 2009) and CH3D (Sheng et al., 2010) have been used for storm surge studies as well. The aforementioned hydrodynamic storm surge models have been further upgraded to couple with the wave models recently. The typical works are: the ADCIRC+SWAN model (Dietrich et al., 2011(Dietrich et al., , 2012, the FVCOM-SWAVE model (Wu et al., 2011)and the SELFE-WWM-II model (Roland et al., 2012). Based on those coupled models, the surge-tide-wave coupling effects can be readily presented. Zhang et al. (2017) concluded that the deviation of water elevation of order of one meter can be caused owing to nonlinear tide-surge interaction. Wuxi et al. (2018) observed wave induced surge and tide-surge interaction along Zhe-Min coast. They found that the relative error due to tide-surge coupling effect can be as high as 28% maximal. These facts imply that the surge-tide-wave coupled models are preferred in the hazard assessment of storm tide inundation (not common at present). In addition to the precision of hydrodynamic model, the challenging issues due to climate change need to be considered for long-term hazard assessment. Tropical cyclone intensification (TCI) and sea level rise (SLR) are obvious among the direct influential factors. Webster et al. (2005)examined the intensity of TC. They pointed out that TCs in the strongest Saffir-Simpson categories 4 and 5 have almost doubled in both number and proportion in the period 1970-2004 for all ocean basins. Relied on the satellite-based estimation of TC intensity, Elsner et al. (2008) reported that significant wind speed upward trends of 0.3-0.09 ms \u22121 yr \u22121 can be observed for the strongest TCs. The study by Knutson et al. (2010) shows that the globally averaged intensity of TC could increase 2-11% by 2100 due to greenhouse warming. Recently, Wang et al. (2016) examined the extreme wind speeds in SCS and NWP, and announced that the spatial inhomogeneous and non-stationary effects should be considered.As for the SLR, the AR5 of IPCC reported that the global SLR for 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005 will likely be 0.26 to 0.55 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2019-284 Preprint.

They also claimed about 70% of the coastlines worldwide would experience lower SLR than the global mean SLR by 2100s. Those results demonstrate that both TCI and SLR have significant spatial inhomogeneous and non-stationary effects. Recently, the impacts of TCI and SLR on storm surge in a few regions have been investigated preliminary.  examined the storm surge trends in the coastal areas of China from 1997 to 2016. They concluded that the increasing rate of extreme storm surge is as high as 0.06 m per year at 90% confidence level. Li et al. (2018) studied the coastal flood hazards at Oahu for 24 TCs in 2080-2099 by the CMIP5 NCAR-CCSM4 model and the SLR under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. Wang et al. (2012) simulated the inundation in Shanghai considering SLR, land subsidence. They found that 46% of the seawalls and levees are projected to be overtopped by 2100.  investigated the inundation risk of extreme water elevations in Rongcheng based on the Pearson Type III distribution considering SLR under situations RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. Yin et al. (2017) studied the impacts of SLR and TCI artificially designed on storm surges and waves at Pearl River Estuary. However, the TCI and SLR are usually artificial gave or use the global TCI and SLR results, which means the spatial inhomogeneous and non-stationary effects is neglected. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, a methodology for long-term hazard assessment of storm tide inundation considering TCI and SLR is implemented in this work. It integrates the high precision surge-tide-wave coupled model and trend analysis of the local TCI and SLR considering the spatial inhomogeneous and non-stationary effects. In addition, the inundation regions are identified using the Geographic information system (GIS). Based on that, a case study is presented for Southeast China coast. The annual average direct economic loss caused by storm tide in China is about 1.73 billion USD, and no downtrend can be observed over the last three decades. Southeast China coast is one of the storm surge prone areas in China where TCs make landfall tending to have stronger intensity. The literature review shows that inundation caused by storm tide there is scarcely studied, let alone the long-term hazard assessment of storm tide inundation considering potential TCI and SLR. The corresponding results can provide reference for the local prevention and mitigation of storm tide inundation hazard and future coastal management."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "The main steps of hazard assessment of storm tide inundation considering TCI and SLR are summarized by the flow chart in figure 1. The details of the tread analysis, numerical analysis and GIS based analysis are described as below. TCI and SLR are the most direct influential factors for long-term hazard assessment of storm tide inundation. Although numerous results about global mean TCI and SLR has provided in literatures, e.g. Elsner et al. (2008), Knutson et al. (2010), using those results directly would introduce significant deviation for a specific study area due to the significant spatial inhomogeneous effect. Therefore, TCI and SLR is estimated by analyzing the long-term historical data of the study area. To consider the non-stationary effect, the non-stationary extreme value theory and nonlinear polynomial fitting are adopted for the TCI and SLR, respectively. The basic conception of the non-stationary extreme value theory is that the statistical parameters of TC wind  vary with time, one may refer to Wang et al. (2016). Based on the potential TCI and SLR, the parameters of the typical future scenarios can be determined. The distribution and evolution of water elevation then can be simulated relied on the hydrodynamic model. Since surgetide-wave coupling effects have remarkable influence on water elevation, the ADCIRC+SWAN model is adopted in this work. In ADCIRC+SWAN model, SWAN and ADCIRC are run on the same computational core and the same unstructured submesh. Therefore, no interpolation is required and water elevations, currents, wind velocities and radiation stress gradients can be passed directly through local cache or memory resulting in high computational efficiency. The governing equations of ADCIRC+SWAN model and its external forcing and dissipation strategy we used are described in Section 3. The numerical water elevation is then analyzed on the GIS platform, low-lying regions of inundation risk can be identified, and inundation hazard information including the area, inundation depth and duration for those regions can be figured out. Those result can provide reference for the subsequent vulnerability assessment. 3 Hydrodynamic surge-tide-wave coupled model"}, {"section_title": "Governing equations", "text": "The water elevation \u03b6 of storm tide is described by the Generalized Wave Continuity Equation (GWCE) as (1).

The source term S tot is usually constituted of six processes which can be as written as (7) (Zijema et al., 2010). S in is the wave energy inputted by the wind. S ds,w , S ds,b and S ds,br are wave dissipation terms caused by white capping, bottom friction and depth-induced wave breaking, respectively.

It struck the coast almost vertically as sketched by the solid line in figure 2. According to the National Meteorological Centre of China, the maximum wind speed of Saomai is about 60.0 m/s during landing. Therefore, scenario S2 (see table 1) is used to examine the storm tide inundation hazard without considering TCI and SLR. To evaluate the worst situation, typhoon makes landfall during the astronomical high tide in S2. Meanwhile, scenario S1, the hindcasting of actual situation of storm tide by Saomai, is also investigated. S3 and S4 as given in table 1 are   https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2019-284 Preprint.

According to the statistical results presented in Section 4.2, the extreme wind speeds of 50-year recurrence period and 100-year recurrence period are adopted for S3 and S4, respectively. As for TCI, SLR of 0.185 m (0.514 m) compared with 2006 is adopted for S3 (S4)."}, {"section_title": "Water elevation", "text": "The distributions of water elevation at the landing moment for scenarios S1-S4 are presented as shown in figure 5. It indicates that the distributions of water elevation for the four scenarios are similar, but with significant difference in magnitude. Comparing S1 (see figures 5(a)) and S2 (see figure 5(b)), the landing moment has dramatic impact on the magnitude of water elevation. Specifically, the maximal water elevation for S2 is as high as about 6.0 m, while that for S1 is about 3.1 m. Significant difference of maximal water elevation along coastline between S1 and S2 can also be observed in figure 7(a). It implies that the potential storm tide hazard if Saomai landed during the period of astronomical high tide would be much more catastrophic than the actual situation of more than 480 deaths and 2.5 billion USD economic loss. It is noteworthy that the difference of water elevation between S2 and S1 is not a linear superposition of storm surge on different astronomical tide levels. The tide-surge-wave coupling effect also play a role. Wuxi et al. (2018)concluded that the water elevation due to coupling effect experiences insignificant premonitory fluctuation, remarkable rise/drop and residual oscillating with a gentle decay of magnitude. To observe the distribution and magnitude of impact of coupling effect on water elevation, the difference of water elevation between S2 and S1 with the astronomical tide excluded is presented in figure 6. Difference of water elevation of -1 m maximal can be observed at area north of the TC track and in the bays. That means coupling effect can reduce the water elevation when astronomical tidal level increases. The main reasons are: 1) waves with larger height can survival in higher water depth resulting in less wave induced surge, 2) nonlinear tide-surge effect trends to reduce water elevation when astronomical tidal level increases. The maximal water elevations along the coastline north of the landing location during the whole process of TC passing by for S1-S4 are plotted in figure 7. From figure 7, the curves of water elevation along the coastline for S2-S4 can be divided https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2019-284 Preprint. Discussion started: 9 October 2019 c Author(s) 2019. CC BY 4.0 License. into three segments with obvious different magnitudes of water elevation, i.e. the segment 0-25 km, the segment 25-225 km and the segment beyond 225 km. The increase of water elevation in the segment 0-25 km is mainly induced by the longshore current blocked by the convex of the coastline when the radius of maximum wind is close to the landing location; while that in the segment 25-225 km is due to the accumulation of water body blown by wind towards coast when the eye of TC is close to the landing location; for the coastline out of the radius of maximal wind, i.e. the segment beyond 225 km, water elevation Figure 6. Difference of water elevation (m) between S2 and S1 with the astronomical tide excluded. is much smaller. Figure 7 shows that the average maximal water elevations along the coastline concerned are 4.91 m, 5.25 m and 5.71 m for S2-S4, respectively. The comparison between S2 and S4 indicates that the non-stationary TCI and SLR effects increase water elevation by 0.80 m on average for the coastline concerned. More specifically, the water elevation due to SLR is a little bit smaller than 0.51 m, while that due to TCI is a little bit larger than 0.29 m. Because the MSL of S4 is 0.51 m larger than that of S2, and the tide-surge-wave coupling effects will reduce water elevation slightly when SLR, which is similar to the behavior of the coupling effect when astronomical tidal level increases (see figure 6). Comparing S3 and S4, it shows that the non-stationary TCI and SLR effects increase water elevation along the coastline by 0.46 m averagely, in which SLR effect is likely to share about 0.33 m. Accordingly, we can conclude that water elevation will be underestimated remarkably without considering the climate change impact, and both non-stationary TCI and SLR are important factors should be dealt with for long-term hazard assessment of storm tide. Further, the locations of the extremums of water elevation curves in figure 7, i.e. B1-B4, are marked in figure 8. It demonstrates that high water elevation occurs in the bays or at the river estuaries, since water body is easy to accumulate in such geography. Specifically, B1 is the bay near the landing location of the TC eye; while B2-B4 are Aojiang river estuary, Feiyunjiang river estuary and Oujiang river estuary, respectively. The maximal water elevations at Aojiang river estuary (i.e. B2) are 6.06 m, 6.51 m and 7.02 m for S2-S4, respectively. While the maximal water elevations at Feiyunjiang river estuary (i.e. B3) are 5.82 m (S2), 6.20 m (S3) and 6.67 m (S4), respectively, and that at Oujiang river estuary (i.e. B4) are 5.67 m (S2), 6.00 m (S3) and 6.44 m (S4), respectively.

And low-lying regions R1 and R8 are also under the threat of inundation. As for S4 with the non-stationary TCI and SLR effects considered, the aforementioned six regions enlarge significantly. In addition, the north coast of Aojiang river (R3), the south and north coasts of Feiyunjiang river (R4 and R5) expose to the storm tide as well.

From table 2, about 379 km 2 is under the threat of storm tide inundation for S2. As for S4, the potential inundation will increase by 108% to about 798 km 2 .

Table 2 shows that the estuaries of Aojiang river (B2), Feiyunjiang river (B3) and Oujiang river (B4) are the hardest hit regions. The remotely sensed maps of the three hardest hit regions are presented in figure 10.

As for S4, the whole downtown of Cangnan city and almost half of Aojiang town located at the north coast of Aojiang river are exposed to the storm tide inundation. At the estuary of Feiyunjiang river (see figure 10(b)), most of the inundation areas are farmland.  districts of Wenzhou city are of high risks of storm tide inundation. To provide reference for the local vulnerability assessments, the inundation durations for spots with different height over MSL for S2-S4 are also provided in figure 11. It shows that the inundation duration of S4 ranks the first followed by S3 and S2, which is consistent with their water elevations. Form figure 11, the inundation duration is not spatial homogeneous, and the estuary of Feiyunjiang river experiences longer period than the other two estuaries.

In the future, the potential storm tide inundation is by no means optimistic due to TCI and SLR. A methodology for assessing the storm tide inundation under TCI and SLR is designed, which includes the trend analysis, numerical analysis and GIS-based analysis. The specific procedures are: 1) analyzing the non-stationary tropical cyclone intensification (TCI) and sea level rise (SLR) statistically based on the long-term historical database; 2) examining the water elevation of typical potential storm tide event using the ADCIRC+SWAN model; 3) identifying the potential inundated regions relied on the GIS platform. Based on this methodology, a case study focused on the storm tide inundation along Southeast China coast, one of the storm surge prone areas in China, is carried out. The results demonstrate that the bays and estuaries in this coastal area tend to experience more dramatic rising process of water elevation. With effects of TCI and SLR neglected, the maximal water elevation around the estuary of Aojiang river by typhoon wind of 100-year recurrence period can be 6.06 m, while that around the Feiyunjiang and Oujiang river estuaries can be 5.82 m and 5.67 m, respectively. Under the same circumstances, roughly 379 km 2 of coast area is under the threat of storm tide inundation. Certainly, non-stationary TCI and SLR have remarkably impacts on the storm tide elevation and subsequent inundation. The water elevations caused by typhoon wind of 50-year recurrence period and 100-year recurrence period considering TCI and SLR are provided. The maximal water elevations caused by typhoon wind of 100-year recurrence period considering TCI and SLR can be as high as 6.51 m (Aojiang river estuary), 6.20 m (Feiyunjiang river estuary) and 6.00 m (Oujiang river estuary). The corresponding potential inundated area could expand by 108% to about 798 km 2 . The remotely sensed maps for the most heavily hit regions, i.e. the estuaries of Aojiang, Feiyunjiang and Oujiang rivers are provided as well, which demonstrate that a few number of downtowns such as Cangnan city and Wenzhou city are exposed to the threat of storm tide inundation. It is worth noting that the factors owing to climate change can be no longer neglected in the future risk assessment of storm tide disasters. Apart from the issues concerned in this study, relevant social and economic data are expected to be integrated in the present procedures for vulnerability assessment. Additionally, the robustness of the local system for immediate warning, efficient evacuating and in situ conservation need to be further evaluated in the future risk analysis as well.
