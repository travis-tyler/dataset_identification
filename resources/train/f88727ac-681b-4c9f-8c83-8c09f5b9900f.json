The constituents of these pathological hallmarks have been intensely investigated as diagnostic biomarkers for early AD in living subjects. There has been increasing use of positron emission tomography (PET) to detect fibrillar A\u03b2 and tau pathologies in living subjects, along with biochemical measurements of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, tau, and ptau in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), for research and clinical studies of AD (Galasko et al., 1998; Shaw et al., 2009; Trojanowski et al., 2010; Molinuevo et al., 2014; Beckett et al., 2015; Kang et al., 2015; Kleinschmidt et al., 2015; Weiner et al., 2015; Leuzy et al., 2016) . However, clinical imaging is limited by high cost, while lumbar puncture for CSF collection is not a readily acceptable procedure for many elderly patients (Lowery and Oliver, 2008; Amorim et al., 2012; Zetterberg et al., 2013; Alcolea et al., 2014; Duits et al., 2015) . In addition, there is still lack of consensus as to how CSF profiles of A\u03b242, tau, and ptau should be used in clinical settings for disease diagnosis (Dumurgier et al., 2013; Blennow et al., 2015) .\nBlood is an inexpensive and convenient source for developing disease biomarkers. Well-validated blood biomarker panels could assist in diagnosis, patient screening for clinical trials, and followup studies. To date, the levels of A\u03b2, tau, and ptau measured in plasma or serum samples reported in the literature have been inconsistent [reviewed in (Hampel et al., 2010; Toledo et al., 2013) ]. The concentrations of these markers in plasma or serum are 10-to 100-fold lower than in CSF, which has caused challenges for accurate and reliable measurement when conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been used (Rissin et al., 2013; Blennow and Zetterberg, 2015b) .\nTo meet the need of higher detection sensitivity, new technologies have been developed (Hye et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2012; Irwin et al., 2012; Mattsson et al., 2013) . Among these technologies, immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assays can sensitively quantify levels of A\u03b2 and tau in biofluids by detecting the reduction in magnetic signals after binding of magnetic nanobead-conjugated antibody to the target analytes using a high-sensitivity magneto-susceptometer, a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) (Yang et al., 2011) .\nStudies in Taiwanese cohorts using this technology showed significant increases in A\u03b242 and tau concentrations in plasma samples of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCIs) due to AD, and in early-stage AD (Chiu et al., 2012) . A similar study also showed that the computed products of A\u03b242 and tau increased the sensitivity for discriminating normal controls (NCs) from early AD subjects (ADs), and MCIs from early ADs (Chiu et al., 2013) .\nWhile previous IMR studies have provided promising findings, the assays have not been independently confirmed in other cohorts of different ethnicity. To achieve this, we recruited a cohort of NC and AD subjects from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute (BSHRI) (Sun City, AZ, United States) to provide plasma samples for IMR assays. We compared the plasma levels of A\u03b242 and tau in the BSHRI cohort with those of samples collected independently at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). Using the same statistical approach, we determined the ability of these measures to distinguish ADs from NCs in both cohorts. To further explore the utility of plasma A\u03b2, A\u03b242, and tau levels for AD diagnosis across age and population, we developed new statistical models that incorporated age along with the levels of these biochemical analytes to establish cut-off values for identifying AD in the combined data from the BSHRI and NTUH cohorts. The findings confirmed that plasma A\u03b242 and tau levels detected by IMR technology achieved exceptional accuracy of diagnosis and thus have potential to be further developed as blood biomarkers for assisting in the clinical diagnosis of AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "BSHRI Site (United States)", "text": "The participants consisted of 16 healthy non-demented control subjects (NCs) who were also enrolled in the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (ASAND), and 16 agematched subjects clinically diagnosed as probable Alzheimer's dementia (ADs) by a dementia neurologist.

The BSHRI participants were age-and gender-matched between NCs and ADs. However, the ADs in the NTUH cohort were significantly older than NCs (NCs: 64.4 + 1.1 years; ADs: 72.5 + 1.5 years, P = 0.003). Overall, the BSHRI cohort was significantly older in both groups (NCs: 81.9 + 1.5 years; ADs: 82.5 + 1.4 years).

The compiled data are shown in Table 2 . To illustrate the distribution patterns of the single analyte data, scatter plots of A\u03b242 and tau levels from individual cohorts are shown in Figure 2 .\nIn both cohorts, the levels of plasma tau were significantly higher in ADs than in NCs (BSHRI: NCs: 20.48 + 1.24 pg/ml; ADs: 34.52 + 3.75 pg/ml, P = 0.002; NTUH: NCs: 13.98 + 1.89 pg/ml; ADs: 52.47 + 2.72 pg/ml, P = 7.19 \u00d7 10 \u221217 ).

This was demonstrated in two independently recruited cohorts in this study. In both cohorts, data confirmed that plasma tau levels from IMR assays had high degrees of sensitivity and specificity, which was enhanced by including computed ratios and products, A\u03b242, along with age to distinguish ADs from NCs. With high-sensitivity and specificity not previously seen by other assay platforms, we developed regression models that showed the power of discrimination these measures provide. In separate cohorts, the regression model incorporating age and tau level had 81 and 96% accuracy in identifying probable AD in the BSHRI and NTUH, respectively; incorporating age with the products of A\u03b242 and tau had 84% accuracy in the BSHRI cohort and 95% accuracy in the NTUH cohorts. When the two cohorts were combined, at a 382.68 (pg/ml) 2 cut-off value, the products of A\u03b242 and tau achieved 92% accuracy with 96% sensitivity and 90% specificity.\nOur results strongly support plasma A\u03b242 and tau levels as having a significant role in AD biomarker development. Previously, there have been few studies of plasma levels of tau in AD (Sparks et al., 2012; Zetterberg et al., 2013; Krishnan and Rani, 2014) . The results from these studies showed technical limitations in measurements of tau levels in plasma. At present, only the new technologies of SIMOA and IMR have been able to produce reliable plasma tau measurements (Zetterberg et al., 2013; Mattsson et al., 2016) . In the recent study by Mattsson et al. using SIMOA to measure tau, the results showed mean values at 2.58 pg/ml in NCs and 3.12 pg/ml in ADs in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, and 5.58 pg/ml in NCs and 5.37 pg/ml in ADs in the Swedish Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably (BioFINDER) study cohort. These values were all much lower than the values obtained with the IMR-based tau assay in this and previous studies (Chiu et al., 2013 (Chiu et al., , 2014 Zetterberg et al., 2013) . There were significant increases in plasma tau levels in clinical ADs compared with NCs and MCI in the ADNI cohort, but this result was not detected in the BioFINDER cohort (Mattsson et al., 2016) . The distribution of plasma tau levels very much overlapped between the diagnostic groups. By contrast, the IMR assayed tau values overlapped less between diagnostic groups; AD tau levels in the BSHRI cohort were significant with 1.7-fold increased from NCs and 4-fold in the NTUH cohort; in both IMR studied cohorts, the IMR tau data was less compressed. The tau levels in ADs in the combined cohort had median values of 45.12 pg/ml in a range of 21.16-105.03 pg/ml. This study established that in a group of patients with clinically diagnosed moderate AD, plasma samples contained elevated tau compared to NCs, whereas the levels of A\u03b242 in the AD groups had either a small increase (in NTUH cohort) or an increasing trend (BSHRI cohort). However, the prediction accuracy for ADs was enhanced by the ratio or product of plasma levels of A\u03b242 and tau. The improvement was more pronounced in the United States (BSHRI) cohort, increasing from 75 to 81% when using A\u03b242 or tau levels alone to 88% when using A\u03b242 \u00d7 tau. A smaller improvement was shown in the NTUH cohorts as its single analyte measures already had high prediction accuracy (95-97%). When a logistic regression model was tested in the pooled data, which spanned a broader age range and disease severity, the prediction accuracy for clinically diagnosed AD were 93% for A\u03b242 \u00d7 tau.\nAs the NTUH cohort was not age-matched between the disease groups, age was included as a covariate for analysis of disease-group differences using ANCOVA. While significantly higher plasma A\u03b242 was detected in probable ADs than in NCs in the NTUH cohort, there was only a non-significant trend in the BSHRI cohort. The lack of significance could be contributed by greater variability of A\u03b242 values in NCs, smaller number of participants, and data overlap between NC and AD groups.\nThe most common issues for measurement of small amount of molecules in the protein-rich media such as plasma and serum are interference and matrix effects that might result in false high or low detection of analyte concentrations (Blennow and Zetterberg, 2015a) . It is possible that the interactions of antibody-conjugated magnetic nanobeads and target analyte during the assay are less prone to be masked by the abundant proteins present in plasma, as magnetic nanobeads are oscillating rapidly in a magnetic field under alternate currents. Moreover, the IMR procedure does not include secondary antibody, which can be potential source of immunoglobulin cross-reactivity between species.\nPlasma or serum A\u03b2 species and tau levels measured by conventional ELISA assays have been inconsistent in demonstrating disease-associated differences due to assay sensitivity and the wide data overlap between groups (Sparks et al., 2012; Chiu et al., 2013 Chiu et al., , 2014 Zetterberg et al., 2013; Krishnan and Rani, 2014; Tzen et al., 2014) The application of IMR and SQUID technology for AD blood biomarker development has been a recent invention (Yang et al., 2011; Chiu et al., 2012 Chiu et al., , 2013 Chiu et al., , 2014 . The current study is the first side-by-side comparison of IMR-assayed findings of cohorts from two distinct ethnic populations.\nPlasma A\u03b242 levels have been investigated extensively in autosomal dominant AD and down syndrome, as well as lateonset AD, using single or multiplex ELISA methods, where elevated plasma A\u03b242 levels and/or A\u03b242/40 ratios in patients with autosomal dominant AD have been reported (Cavani et al., 2000; Schupf et al., 2001; Coppus et al., 2012; Toledo et al., 2013; Fleisher et al., 2015; Quiroz et al., 2015) . However, studies of sporadic AD subjects were not consistent, reporting A\u03b242 levels as being unchanged, decreased, or increased (Mehta et al., 2000; Blennow et al., 2009; Lui et al., 2010; Chiu et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012; Toledo et al., 2013; Janelidze et al., 2016; Lovheim et al., 2016; Poljak et al., 2016) . Factors that affect A\u03b242 results include platform-associated limitations such as matrix effect, interference, and epitope masking (Bibl et al., 2004; Toledo et al., 2011; Slemmon et al., 2012 Slemmon et al., , 2015 Blennow and Zetterberg, 2015b) . Although both ELISA assays and IMR assays are based on antigen-antibody reactions, IMR assays appears to have unique capability of detecting modest alterations in plasma A\u03b242 levels possibly due to minimal matrix effect. However, the possibility of different forms or sub-types of A\u03b242 being detected by these assay platforms cannot be ruled out. It is crucial to confirm plasma A\u03b242 increases in AD in studies with larger subject numbers, since lower CSF A\u03b242 levels have been shown to be very sensitive marker for pathologically confirmed AD (Shaw et al., 2009) . Disease heterogeneity could be a common problem contributing to lack of differences between groups in plasma samples (Toledo et al., 2011) . This is inevitable in a complex multi-factorial disease such as AD, where factors of age, gender, ApoE genotype, and other pathologies can affect disease progression. The risk genotype, ApoE e4, has been reported to associate with lower A\u03b242 levels in plasma samples (Sun et al., 2009; Metti et al., 2013) . In this study, we could not establish such relationship possibly due to too small number of subjects in BSHRI cohort, as ApoE genotype data were not available from NTUH cohort. Future study will ensure such data available for assessing the effects of ApoE genotypes on plasma A\u03b2 and tau levels assayed by IMR. The ability for plasma levels of A\u03b242 and tau to aid in clinical diagnosis of AD were evaluated vigorously as performance metrics in this study, based on areas under the curve (AUC) of ROC, which were compared using LOO cross-validation to avoid over-fitting. The use of the logistic model approach with age took into consideration that the cut-off value of a given plasma analyte might be age-dependent. The cut-off value will not be a single value for all ages, but a series of cut-off values corresponding to different ages, when the age-effect in the logistic model is significant.\nVarious combinations of A\u03b242, tau, or ptau levels in CSF such as ratios of tau or ptau to A\u03b242 performed better for diagnosis of AD than single biomarker. This should be expected based on the known interaction of these molecules in AD. In AD CSF, A\u03b242 levels were decreased and tau or ptau levels were increased (Hampel et al., 2004; Diniz et al., 2008; Mattsson et al., 2013; Toledo et al., 2013; Kang et al., 2015) . Plasma A\u03b242 was present in a narrow range at low concentrations with small changes between subjects. Therefore, the product with tau levels improved the usefulness of plasma A\u03b242. This was supported by AUC analyses of predicting accuracy for clinically diagnosed ADs. A recent review of CSF biomarker panels indicated that regression models incorporating various combinations of factors such as age, gender, baseline MMSE, or ApoE status could increase similar robustness for the AD diagnosis (Duits et al., 2014) .\nThere are limitations of this study that should be considered; the BSHRI cohort was small; both study cohorts were limited to clinically assessed subjects; and the study was cross-sectional. Nonetheless, the results are promising due to the high degree of discrimination between ADs and NCs, supporting that additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings. Such discrimination has not been reported for an AD core blood biomarker previously. Further work is needed (1) to clarify and confirm the assay ability to identify subjects at preclinical stages of AD, e.g., MCI; (2) to confirm discrimination AD from other types of dementia; (3) to track AD in longitudinal studies; (4) to determine correlation with other biomarkers (e.g., imaging and CSF markers); and (5) to assess the benefits of disease-modifying treatments."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The results from this side-by-side study supported recent findings using the IMR platform, and extend the findings to a Caucasian population. Using ultra-sensitive IMR-based assays, patients with the clinical diagnosis of late-onset AD dementia could be identified with a high accuracy rate by combining use of A\u03b242 and tau levels. Further studies are needed in larger study cohorts for differential diagnosis, early detection, and tracking of AD."}]
