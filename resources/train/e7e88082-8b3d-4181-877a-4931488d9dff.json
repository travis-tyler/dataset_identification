According to the new National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA)/International Working Group (IWG) research criteria, AD can be subdivided in three stages: an asymptomatic or preclinical stage, a stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and the dementia stage [2] [3] [4] . The pattern of disease progression in each of these stages is not fully understood yet. This limits trial design, in particular in the predementia stage where intervention is believed to be most effective because neuronal injury and cognitive impairment are still limited. The aim of the present study is to investigate biomarker and cognitive changes in the asymptomatic stage, MCI stage, and dementia stage of AD. We also investigated whether these changes differed from subjects with normal cognition, MCI, or dementia but without AD pathology. We selected subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with AD pathology, defined as abnormal amyloid beta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), who had normal 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni. ucla.edu).

To compare cognitive markers and biomarkers at baseline and over time, raw scores were converted into z-scores, relative to the baseline scores of the cognitively normal controls. The z-score is the number of standard deviations from which the score deviates from the expected score given age, sex, education, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. In the control group we performed multiple linear regression with age, sex, education, APOE genotype, and ICV (MRI measurements only) entered in the first step, using P , .05 as the criterion for remaining in the model. On the basis of the resulting model, an expected test score for each subject was calculated. This score was subtracted from the observed score. The residual was divided by the standard deviation of the residual in the reference population to give the z-score. Z-scores were expressed such that a negative score indicated a performance worse than the control group at baseline. For each variable and assessment z-scores were calculated relative to the control group at baseline.\nChange in biomarkers and cognitive scores over time were assessed by slope analyses with mixed models using an unstructured covariance matrix (which assumes a random intercept and random slope), with age, education and gender as covariates and follow-up time as repeated measure. We assumed a linear change in time, as time coded with a quadratic term was not a statistically significant predictor. Analyses were performed in the total group using contrasts to calculate baseline differences and slopes for individual groups and to compare them between groups. The analyses of the slopes included baseline score and available followup scores. We tested whether slopes were different from 0 and whether they differed between groups. A difference with a P-value ,.05, without correction for multiple testing, was considered statistically significant. In Table 2 we indicate which differences would not be statistically significant after correction for multiple testing according to Benjamini-Hochberg [19] . Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics according to diagnostic groups. Age, gender, and APOE \u03b54 status differed between groups. Age was higher in subjects with dementiaother compared to the other subjects, except for subjects with AD-asymptomatic, and subjects were more often female in the dementia-other group compared to the MCI-other group. APOE \u03b54 was more frequently positive in subjects with abnormal amyloid levels than in subjects with normal amyloid, regardless of clinical status. ADasymptomatic subjects were less often APOE \u03b54 positive (45%) than subjects with AD-MCI (65 %) and APOE \u03b54 carriership tended to be lower in AD-MCI compared with AD-dementia (77%). Among \u03b54 carriers, \u03b54 homozygosity was least common in AD-asymptomatic (10%) and highest in AD-dementia (32%).

The pattern of decline was distinct from that of subject without amyloid pathology.\nOur observation that subjects in the AD-asymptomatic stage had abnormal CSF tau is in line with previous studies [20, 21] . Ventricular volume was abnormal in ADasymptomatic subjects, indicating that this is a sensitive measure [22] . The finding of normal hippocampal volume, whole brain volume, and FDG-PET in AD-asymptomatic is in line with previous studies [23, 24] . Other studies, however, reported cortical thinning in several cortical regions [25] , and reduced whole brain and hippocampal volume [26, 27] . These discrepancies may be explained by differences in subject selection or image analysis techniques. All imaging measures showed decline at follow-up but only the increase of ventricular volume exceeded that of the control group. This finding is consistent with earlier studies [23, 28] and supports the observation that change in ventricular volume is better correlated with amyloid pathology in cognitively normal subjects than change in brain volume and hippocampal volume [22] . Subjects with AD-asymptomatic had impairments on the ADAS-cog and executive functioning relative to controls. Only the CDR-SOB declined at follow-up although it did not exceed that of the control group. Previous studies yielded conflicting results with some studies showing a relation between amyloid pathology and impairments or decline in memory, executive function, or global function, while others did not [27, [29] [30] [31] [32] . These differences might, again, be explained by differences in tests used and in subject selection.\nSubjects with AD-MCI differed at baseline from controls on all markers and from MCI-other on all markers, except whole brain volume. This finding, together with other studies, indicates that cross-sectionally measured whole brain volume is not specific or sensitive for early AD in MCI subjects [33] [34] [35] . AD-MCI subjects declined more than MCI-other on CSF tau, imaging and cognitive markers, illustrating that AD pathology drives neurodegeneration in these subjects.\nIn AD-dementia subjects baseline cognitive scores and biomarkers did not differ from the dementia-other group, except for the CSF measures and ventricular volume. Over time, AD-demented subjects showed the same rate of decline as dementia-other subjects on CSF, MRI (except for ventricular volume), and cognitive markers, although the interpretation of these findings is limited by the small sample size of the dementia-other group.\nWe summarized the trajectory of change on five key markers for AD in Fig. 3 to make a comparison with previous modeling studies that hypothesized trajectories for these markers [32, 36] . As regards the rate of order of decline, our findings support the assumption that CSF Ab1-42 declines first, followed by tau, which is followed by the other markers. Unlike the proposed models, hippocampal volume, FDG-PET, and ADAS-cog declined simultaneously in our analysis. As regards the form of the curves, our findings support the proposed flattening of the curves of Ab1-42 and tau in the ADasymptomatic or AD-MCI stage. It also suggests that impairments on the imaging and cognitive markers will continue to increase in more advanced stages, as we did not observe flattening of these markers in the dementia stage. Because we used z-scores relative to controls rather than relative to end-stage dementia, we could also compare the severity of the impairments on each marker. We found that in the dementia stage impairment for CSF Ab1-42, FDG-PET, hippocampal volume, and ADAS-cog were similar and more severe than for tau. This would suggest that CSF tau levels reach a balance between tau release and tau metabolism, despite increasing neuronal cell death [37] [38] [39] . However, there are also other explanations such as the variability of the SD between measures which affected z-scores (see later), the possibility that tau is also abnormal in controls [40] [41] [42] or selective dropout of subjects with high tau, although this then would also apply to the other injury markers.\nAs regards the markers that were not taken into account in the summarized figure, whole brain volume followed the same pattern as FDG-PET and hippocampal volume. Ventricular volume, was already abnormal in the asymptomatic stage. Besides ADAS-cog, executive function was impaired in AD-asymptomatic but decline was observed only for the CDR-SOB. In the MCI and AD stage all markers were abnormal and showed further decline, and the rate of decline further increased in the dementia stage.\nThe APOE \u03b54 allele distribution was lowest in ADasymptomatic and highest in AD-dementia. Because the APOE \u03b54 allele is strongly associated with age of onset, the difference in APOE \u03b54 carriership between the AD stages could explain why subjects in each stage had a similar age despite differences in disease severity.\nAlthough the control group did not have amyloid pathology they still showed decline on the biomarkers. This decline may result from normal aging, no-AD related neurodegeneration, or very early stage AD. Post-hoc analyses, however, made it less likely that in controls decline was driven by latent AD pathology because decline on the cognitive and biomarkers was very similar between subjects with a \"low-normal\" CSF Ab1-42 (CSF Ab1-42,193-250 pg/ml) and \"high-normal\" CSF Ab1-42 levels (CSF Ab1-42 .250 pg/ml).\nSubjects with MCI-other had normal CSF Ab1-42 and tau at baseline and did not change over time in these measures. Relative to the control group, MCI-other subjects only showed increased decline in hippocampal volume, while change in other imaging markers was comparable to that of controls. Cognition was remarkably stable in MCIother subjects suggesting a relatively benign underlying process [23, 31, [43] [44] [45] .\nOur data contained very few subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AD with normal CSF Ab, which were labeled as dementia-other. They were older and had less abnormal CSF tau levels than AD-dementia subjects. They were all APOE \u03b54 negative and had CSF tau levels marginally increased compared with controls. These findings suggest non-AD pathology, but further studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm this.\nOur analyses expand those reported from other ADNI studies and other cohorts in several ways. We stratified clinical groups according to amyloid status, tested simultaneously a wide range of biomarkers and clinical markers and presented follow-up data for up to 4 years [32, 38, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . This enabled us to study trajectories of different markers in different AD stages and relative to amyloid negative subjects. We used z-scores, relative to control subjects, which enabled us to compare scores between different diagnostic groups and also between markers despite different units of measurements. A limitation of zscores for comparison across different tests, however, is that the standard deviation (SD) could vary between different markers, which may influence the absolute zscores. Variability in SD may be caused by biological variability, test characteristics and selection of subjects. For example, the CDR was used to define normal cognition, which resulted in a small SD in controls and large z-scores for diseased subjects. Still, when we repeated all analyses with raw scores similar results were obtained.\nA possible limitation of our study is that our cognitive markers might not be sensitive enough to find abnormalities in the AD-asymptomatic stage although the tests used are well known and typically used in trials. FDG-PET was performed in only 50% of the subjects. This reduced statistical power to find changes compared with the other markers tested. Our subjects were relatively old and because the rate of decline may depend on age, this might have resulted in an underestimation of decline in biomarkers and cognition and our findings may not apply to younger subjects [41] . We selected subjects with different AD stages cross-sectionally. Although our findings suggest a continuum between the stages (Fig. 3 ) findings need to be replicated in studies that follow subjects with asymptomatic AD until the dementia stage. A number of our findings were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.\nOur study provided further evidence for a temporal evolution of AD. Our findings might be helpful to determine which marker can be used in each clinical stage of AD, for inclusion or outcome measure in clinical trials.
