These findings, however, have limited power to explain how the identified SNPs interact to influence QTs. Using the biological networks and pathways as prior knowledge, integrative analysis have been performed to discover disease-relevant modules enriched by GWAS findings to examine collective effects of multiple genes, with the potential to enhance statistical power and help biological interpretation [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] .\nExisting module identification methodologies typically start from assigning GWAS statistics onto a user-specified functional interaction network. After that, candidate modules are formed across the entire network and assessed for whether to be enriched by the GWAS findings. One successful example is the dmGWAS [4] , which loads gene-level p-values onto the network as node weights, and then applies dense module searching to identify modules with locally maximized proportion of significant genes. Another example is the network interface miner for multigenic interactions (NIMMI) [5] , which scores genes by combining p-values with connectivities and then constructs modules from high weighted genes. Protein interaction network-based pathway analysis (PINBPA) [9] and its extension iPINBPA [8] start from a seed and expand the module by adding neighbors to reach a pre-given statistical significance. These strategies are all bottom-up. The power of the bottom-up strategy could be limited by multiple comparison correction as it examines a large number of candidate modules to identify GWAS enriched ones. Meanwhile the efficiency could also become suboptimal when large-scale networks are present.\nMost network-based GWAS of quantitative traits are using tissue-free biological networks such as human PPI network, without considering tissue specificity. The precise functions of genes are highly related to their tissue context, and human diseases result from the disordered interplay of tissue-specific processes [10] . Recently, tissuespecific genome-scale functional interaction networks have been constructed to capture the changing functional roles of genes across tissues. Disease-gene associations have been reprioritized by constructing a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to reorder GWAS results using tissue-specific network data as features, named as NetWAS (network-wide association study). It has been implemented on hippocampal volume in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) study to re-prioritize GWAS results and demonstrated that tissue-specific networks could provide helpful context for understanding complex human diseases [11] . Note that SVM classifier employed in NetWAS requires pre-defined threshold to label GWAS results, and may lose some valuable information embedded in the continuous z-scores corresponding to the GWAS p-values.\nIn this study, we propose and compare two novel module identification frameworks: (i) a machine learning approach that introduces a regression model into NetWAS to take continuous z-scores into account (Ridge regression in this paper); and (ii) a GWAS top-neighbor-based (tnGWAS) searching approach that extracts densely connected modules from top GWAS findings. Ridge and tnGWAS both offer a more efficient, top-down strategy to identify phenotype-relevant modules, while using slightly different hypotheses: (1) Ridge hypothesizes relevant modules are enriched by relatively significant and functionally-relevant genes; and (2) tnGWAS hypothesizes that relevant modules consist of top GWAS findings and their close neighbors. Of note, machine learning methods (e.g., SVM and Ridge) provide re-prioritized gene findings, while tnGWAS does not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks by applying them to a hippocampal imaging genetics analysis in the study of AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "To demonstrate the implementation of Ridge and tnGWAS on imaging QT-relevant module identification, we apply them to hippocampal imaging GWAS in AD.

Below we describe their details.\nMachine learning based GWAS re-prioritization: Following [10] , we trained an SVM model using hippocampusspecific network connectivity as features and the significance status based on nominal p=0.01 as labels to re-prioritize GWAS results. In addition to SVM, we trained a ridge regression (Ridge) model using also the network data as features while using z-scores converted from p-values as responses. Different from classification which required a pre-defined threshold, regression approaches utilize the complete information from the continuous z-scores.\nWe trained SVM and Ridge models using interactions between a subset of genes C and all genes as features, and the z-scores converted from the gene-level p-values of C as responses (positive or negative labels for SVM). To balance the training data, set C was constructed from the combination of significant gene set A and one third of randomly selected nonsignificant gene set B, where p=0.01 was used as nominal significance. Genes were re-prioritized according to their predictions (Ridge) or distances from separating hyperplane (SVM). Re-prioritized results offered a more flexible way to analyze functional associations at different scales. To demonstrate the performance of re-prioritization, we accessed the mean interactions and the area under receiveroperator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of re-prioritized genes from Ridge and SVM with original GWAS using 66 documented AD candidates as gold standard positives."}, {"section_title": "Concordance of reprioritized GWAS and documented AD genes", "text": "tnGWAS: Starting from a set of significant GWAS findings, tnGWAS includes their immediate neighbors in the result. tnGWAS hypothesizes that QT-relevant functional modules consist of top GWAS findings and their close neighbors. We extracted the interaction matrix containing connectivity measures between significant GWAS findings and all the genes, and identified genes highly interacted with \u22651 significant gene. In the experiment, we applied gene p-value \u22641e-7 to select significant GWAS findings, and interaction weight \u22650.3 to define strong connectivity. This yielded 4 significant genes and 120 highly interacted neighbors. In practice, we can include more top predictions and take more GWAS top neighbors to obtain larger scale candidate modules.\nIdentification of GWAS enriched modules: Machine learning based approaches were designed to yield top gene findings not only enriched by GWAS results but also densely connected; while tnGWAS was to identify top GWAS findings together with their immediate neighbors. For module identification, both frameworks offered a list of candidates for us to detect GWAS-enriched modules. We clustered top genes from above to firstly identify candidate modules. Since one gene could perform functions in multiple pathways, we employed the Link Clustering algorithm [16] on top genes to detect communities as clusters of links instead of nodes. The resulting candidate modules could be overlapping. Top GWAS findings were used to assess the enrichment of candidate module, while significantly enriched ones were identified as phenotype-relevant modules. Different from previous bottom-up methods, these topdown strategies examine only a small number of candidate modules that are both highly connected and GWAS enriched, and thus can potentially help increase the statistical power.\nFunctional annotation: To assess the functional relevance of identified modules, we tested their over-representation on specific neurobiological functions and signalling pathways. We analyzed functional annotation using KEGG pathways and Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO-BP)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "GWAS of hippocampal QT", "text": "GWAS was performed to examine the association between SNPs and the hippocampal FDG measure.

Top predictions from Ridge and SVM are also densely connected. In addition, they contain more top GWAS findings than tnGWAS (i.e., more nodes were colored by top GWAS findings). These observations reflect the different hypotheses behind the two strategies described earlier.
