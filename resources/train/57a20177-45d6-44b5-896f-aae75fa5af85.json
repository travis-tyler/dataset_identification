[{"section_title": "", "text": "valuation and treatment of males suspected of having testosterone deficiency entails multiple controversial issues. Recognition of the high prevalence of low testosterone levels in many men with common chronic diseases, an aging population, and greater recognition that testosterone levels fall with aging have greatly expanded the number of men who are diagnosed to have low testosterone levels. The development of new delivery systems and increased marketing of these delivery systems have combined with the larger number of potential patients to make testosterone replacement more common. It is a hot topic for the lay press and primary care clinicians, as well as for urologists and endocrinologists.\nModern medicine is striving to provide evidence-based care. To do this we need large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RPCTs), preferably multicentered, and preferably government funded. Treatment of testosterone deficiency due to classical diseases affecting the hypothalamus, pituitary, and/or testes has been accepted for decades, although there were no multicenter trials. Some of the testosterone delivery systems predate the requirement for multicenter studies, and most of the more recently developed testosterone delivery systems were approved by the Food and Drug Administration on the basis of their pharmacokinetic profile and their ability to achieve physiological blood levels. Approval was not based on long-term studies of efficacy and risk. Some outcome studies have provided sufficient data to permit meta-analyses. However, most of these analyses have relied on a limited number of small clinical trials of short duration, and they have used a variety of testosterone delivery systems. Thus, their conclusions often are compromised. This review will identify many of the issues that continue to challenge clinicians, investigators, and patients. This is even truer for most busy primary care clinicians who write a large percentage of the prescriptions for testosterone treatment."}, {"section_title": "Epidemiology", "text": "Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based studies have evaluated the prevalence of low testosterone levels, and some of them have used questionnaires to evaluate associated symptoms. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging found low total testosterone levels in approximately 20% and low free testosterone index levels in approximately 35% of men 60 -69 yr of age (1) . Low testosterone levels were much more prevalent in older age groups. In the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, total testosterone levels declined cross-sectionally at 0.8%/yr of age, whereas both free and bioavailable testosterone levels declined at about 2%/yr of age (2) . The longitudinal decline for subjects between baseline and follow-up was 1.6%/yr for total testosterone and 2-3%/yr for bioavailable testosterone. A cross-sectional survey of 3200 community-dwelling men aged 40 -79 yr from a prospective cohort study in eight European countries found an age-related decrease in calculated free testosterone levels of 9 pg/dl \u2150 yr (3) . The prevalence of symptomatic hypogonadism increases with age, especially after age 70 (4) . The Boston Area Community Health survey of men 40 -70 yr of age at baseline did not find significant differences in the prevalence of testosterone deficiency among non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and African-Americans (5) .\nUntil recently, it was thought that testosterone deficiency in middle-aged and older men mainly affected the quality of life, but it was unlikely to affect morbidity or mortality. However, population-based studies indicate that testosterone deficiency predicts future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (6) , metabolic syndrome (7), cardiovascular events (8 -11), mobility limitation (12), frailty (13), and mortality (8 -11). Whether testosterone treatment can improve health and prolong active lifestyles is unknown. No large, multicenter, long-term RPCTs have addressed these issues."}, {"section_title": "Diagnosis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Definition of hypogonadism", "text": "The Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline for Testosterone Therapy in Adult Men with Androgen Deficiency Syndromes has defined hypogonadism in men as \"a clinical syndrome that results from failure of the testis to produce physiological levels of testosterone (androgen deficiency) and a normal number of spermatozoa due to disruption of one or more levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis\" (14)."}, {"section_title": "Symptoms and signs associated with classical causes of hypogonadism", "text": "The Endocrine Society Guidelines Committee identified signs and symptoms that are more suggestive of androgen deficiency (14). They include incomplete sexual development, reduced libido, decreased spontaneous erections, breast discomfort or gynecomastia, loss of body hair or reduced shaving, very small or shrinking testis, inability to father children or low sperm counts, decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis, decreased muscle mass and strength, and hot flushes. Other manifestations that are associated with androgen deficiency but are less specific include decreased energy and motivation, dysthymia, decreased intellectual capacity, poor concentration, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, mild anemia (normochromic, normocytic, in the female range), increased body fat, increased body mass index, and diminished physical performance (14). The less specific symptoms and signs can be caused by other conditions, and comorbidities make the diagnosis more difficult in older men.\nZitzmann et al. (15) surveyed 434 consecutive male patients aged 50 -86 yr in an andrological outpatient department to determine whether psychosomatic complaints and metabolic factors were related to sex hormone levels in a symptom-specific manner. No clear-cut threshold for late-onset hypogonadism was found. Rather, prevalence of psychosomatic symptoms and metabolic risk factors increased with decreasing androgen levels. The prevalence of loss of libido or vigor increased with testosterone concentrations less than 432 ng/dl, and depression and type 2 diabetes mellitus were more common in men with testosterone concentrations less than 288 ng/dl. Testosterone concentrations below 230 ng/dl contributed to erectile dysfunction.\nUsing the large European Male Ageing Study database of 3369 men between the ages of 40 and 79, Wu et al. (16) have found that poor morning erections, low sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, inability to perform vigorous activity, depression, and fatigue were significantly related to the testosterone level. They found that late-onset hy-pogonadism can be defined by the presence of at least three sexual symptoms associated with a total testosterone of less than 320 ng/dl and a free testosterone less than 6.5 ng/ml. The three sexual symptoms had a syndromic relationship with decreased testosterone levels."}, {"section_title": "Questionnaires", "text": "Questionnaires can help patients and clinicians recognize medical conditions. Lack of specificity has been the greatest problem with existing questionnaires used to detect hypogonadism, and lack of sensitivity of these questionnaires is an issue in assessing treatment (14). A new screening questionnaire has been developed that promises greater specificity (17). However, it has not been used in large populations, and it is not known whether it will be useful in assessing testosterone treatment."}, {"section_title": "Laboratory diagnosis", "text": "The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency requires the presence of symptoms and low serum testosterone levels, but the normal ranges for different assays vary greatly. It is well recognized that serum testosterone levels exhibit a diurnal pattern in younger men, with higher levels in the early morning (18). The diurnal pattern is blunted in most older men (18, 19). Thus, sampling time is important because normal ranges are based on early morning sampling in younger healthy men. The Endocrine Society appointed a task force to address issues related to sensitivity, variability, and standardization of testosterone assays (20). They have stated that \"laboratory proficiency testing should be based on the ability to measure accurately and precisely samples containing known concentrations of testosterone, not only in agreement with others using the same method.\"\nOne should recognize factors that affect SHBG levels and thus total testosterone levels and know techniques used to estimate bioavailable or free testosterone levels. SHBG concentrations are decreased in patients with moderate to severe obesity, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, and in those who are taking glucocorticoids, progestins and androgenic steroids. SHBG levels are increased with aging and in patients with cirrhosis, hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, or HIV disease, and in those men who are taking anticonvulsants or estrogens (14).\nTotal testosterone levels are now being measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrophotometer in large reference laboratories and in some research laboratories (21). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrophotometer provides greater accuracy than either platform assays or RIAs because it does not encounter issues of cross-reactivity. However, the equipment is expensive, so this methodology is not available in smaller regional and hospital laboratories. Until recently, there was no effort to use a common standard for testosterone assays. Under the leadership of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there is a national effort to correct this problem (20, 21). Although there is some uncertainty as to how best to estimate testosterone concentrations that are available to peripheral tissues, determination of free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis has been the gold standard (22). Because equilibrium dialysis requires greater technical expertise, time, and cost, it is not a practical test for most laboratories. Many think that both albuminbound testosterone and unbound testosterone are available to peripheral tissues. Bioavailable (free and albuminbound) testosterone can be assayed after ammonium sulfate precipitation of SHBG-bound testosterone (23). Vermeulen et al. (22) have popularized the use of calculated free testosterone and calculated bioavailable testosterone measurements based on measuring total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin and then using a mass action equation. These values correlate well with those obtained by equilibrium dialysis or by actual measurement of bioavailable testosterone, but it requires accurate measurement of total testosterone and SHBG. Furthermore, there are different equations, which give somewhat different results (24). Finally, normal ranges using this approach are not readily available. Unlike the preceding techniques to measure or estimate free testosterone, the direct measurement of free testosterone by RIA does not provide valid results when there are alterations in SHBG (22). This technique should not be used! Thus, whereas there have been improvements in assaying total, bioavailable, and free testosterone levels, uncertainties remain. Hopefully, the effort undertaken by the CDC will lead to much more accurate assays, better standardization of assays, and the establishment of similar normal ranges.\nIt is important to determine whether the patient has primary or secondary hypogonadism. To do this, one must measure serum LH, and prolactin should be assayed in patients with secondary hypogonadism to identify the rare patient who has a prolactinoma. The majority of men who do not have a classical cause of hypogonadism will have low testosterone levels and low or inappropriately normal LH and FSH levels. The Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend imaging the hypothalamus and pituitary only if there are other findings suggesting hypothalamic or pituitary disease or if the total testosterone level is below 150 ng/dl. This recommendation is based on one report of 164 men 27 to 79 yr of age whose chief complaint was erectile dysfunction and who had serum testosterone levels less than 230 ng/dl and low or inappropriately normal LH levels (25). Macroadenomas and hypothalamic lesions were confined to six subjects with testosterone levels of 104 ng/dl or less. Assessment of the karyotype to diagnose Klinefelter's syndrome is recommended for those men with a testicular volume less than 4 ml, low testosterone levels, and elevated LH levels (26, 27).\nMost middle-aged and older men with symptoms consistent with hypogonadism and low testosterone levels will have one or more chronic diseases, and many of these men are obese. The majority of these men will have functional abnormalities of the HPG axis rather than anatomical or congenital abnormalities. Whether their symptoms are due to the comorbid condition or to the low testosterone levels is the question. The majority of these men will increase their serum LH and testosterone levels when treated with clomiphene citrate (28). We interpret this response to indicate that the abnormality is functional. One also frequently observes low total and sometimes free testosterone levels in men with moderate or severe obesity. When obese patients lose significant weight, their serum testosterone levels usually increase (29, 30 ). This provides further support for functional abnormalities of the HPG axis in many of these men."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Trials", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Age considerations", "text": "We think that age must be considered when deciding to prescribe and monitor testosterone treatment. Studies that have included men 20 yr of age and older are listed in Table  1 . We only included parallel studies of 3 months or longer and men with baseline testosterone levels below 300 ng/dl, bioavailable testosterone levels below 150 ng/dl, or free testosterone levels below 9.0 ng/dl. The total and free testosterone cutoffs are those recommended by The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline (14), and the bioavailable testosterone cutoff is that proposed by Vermeulen (31) and endorsed by The Endocrine Society Position Statement (20). Comorbid diseases may make older patients less responsive to testosterone replacement, so a separate table lists studies that were limited to men 60 and older (Table 2) . Because SHBG levels increase with age, we have included studies with total testosterone levels below 350 ng/dl. We recognize that there are many informative trials that have included men with higher cutoffs and several relatively large studies that do not meet our inclusion criteria but may provide efficacy information (32-36); however, these trials are at greater risk of failure to dem- We only included parallel studies of 3 months or longer and men with baseline testosterone levels less than 300 ng/dl (\u03fd10.4 nmol/liter), bioavailable testosterone levels less than 150 ng/dl (\u03fd5.2 nmol/liter), or free testosterone levels less than 9.0 ng/dl (\u03fd0.31 nmol/liter). n (T/P), Total number of men included in trial (number of men treated with testosterone therapy/number of men treated with placebo); TRT, type of testosterone replacement therapy used in the trial; T, testosterone; TC, testosterone cypionate; TE, testosterone enanthate; TU, testosterone undecanoate; FFM, fat-free mass; FM, fat mass; LBM, lean body mass.

When sexual development is delayed, it can cause psychological problems, and it may reduce adult bone mass (44) . Whether chronic testosterone treatment will be required is dependent on factors that include the underlying cause for the testosterone deficiency, age, and desire for fertility in the near future. We are unaware of any RPCTs evaluating testosterone treatment in boys with constitutional delayed puberty, isolated gonadotropin deficiency, Klinefelter's syndrome, or prepubertal or pubertal acquired causes of hypogonadism. Testosterone can cause pubertal changes, and these changes usually are desirable in this setting. Most clinicians use injectable testosterone cypionate or enanthate, and effective dosing regimens have been developed (45) . Transdermal testosterone gel can be used; however, it is more difficult to titrate to the desired dose and to ensure compliance. Human chorionic gonadotropin or recombinant human LH can be used in boys with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but these regimens are more expensive and they require greater patient compliance (46, 47) . Pulsatile GnRH treatment also can be effective, but it is more cumbersome and more expensive (48) . Unlike testosterone treatment, these treatments increase testicular size as well as testosterone levels. This may be of psychological benefit, and there could be benefit to future fertility. Although testosterone treatment can cause suppression of spermatogenesis, development of gynecomastia, and less commonly premature closure of the epiphyses, strategies for managing or preventing these conditions usually are effective."}, {"section_title": "Ages 20 -49 yr", "text": "Testosterone treatment for hypogonadal men between the ages of 20 and 49 also is effective and is associated with a low frequency of serious adverse events.

An example of the benefits of treating men with such abnormalities is the study of Snyder et al. (49) . They treated 18 previously untreated men who were 18 yr of age or older and who developed acquired hypogonadism after having gone through puberty. Their mean \u03ee SD serum testosterone was 78 \u03ee 77 ng/dl, and they were treated for up to 3 yr.

Calof et al. (80) published a meta-analysis of adverse events in middle-aged and older men who have been treated with testosterone. They found that older men treated with testosterone had more prostate events and more erythrocytosis. In a recent meta-analysis of adverse events, Fern\u00e1 ndez-Balsells et al.

Libido, erectile function, and mood seem to be improved with levels in the low normal range (121) , whereas skeletal muscle responds in a dose-responsive manner in younger and older men (55) . Demonstrable changes in BMD are dependent on dose and duration of treatment (72) . Most clinicians evaluate treatment effectiveness by reassessing the patient's presenting symptoms and by physical examination. Requires im injection; peaks and valleys in serum T levels.\n1% T gel Available in sachets, tubes and pumps; 5-10 g T gel containing 50 -100 mg T should be applied daily.\nCorrects symptoms of androgen deficiency; provides flexibility of dosing, ease of application, good skin tolerability.\nPotential of transfer to a female partner or child by direct skinto-skin contact; skin irritation in a small proportion of treated men; moderately high DHT levels. Transdermal T patch 1 or 2 patches, designed to nominally deliver 5-10 mg T over 24 h; applied daily on nonpressure areas.\nEase of application, corrects symptoms of androgen deficiency.\nSerum T levels in some androgen-deficient men may be in the low-normal range; these men may need application of 2 patches daily. Skin irritation at the application site occurs in many patients. Buccal, bioadhesive T tablets 30-mg controlled release, bioadhesive tablets used twice daily.\nCorrects symptoms of androgen deficiency in healthy, hypogonadal men.\nGum-related adverse events in 16% of treated men.\nT pellets Three to six pellets implanted sc; dose and regimen vary with formulation used. The regimen used in Europe typically involves 1000 mg injected im, followed by 1000 mg at 6 wk, and 1000 mg every 10 -14 wk\nCorrects symptoms of androgen deficiency; requires infrequent administration.\nRequires im injection of a large volume (4 ml). Cough has been reported immediately after injection in a very small number of treated men. T-in-adhesive matrix patch Some skin irritation.\nModified from The Endocrine Society Guidelines (14). T, Testosterone; DHT, dihydrotestosterone. Certain formulations are available in other countries but not in the United States. These include: a oral testosterone undecanoate (typically used at a dose of 40 to 80 mg orally two or three times daily with meals); b injectable testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg followed by a second 1000 mg injection 6 wk later, and then 1000 mg every 10 to 14 wk; and c two testosterone matrix patches 30, 45, or 60 cm 2 applied every 2 d.\nPatients also must be evaluated for potential side effects associated with testosterone treatment and for those that are delivery system specific ( Table 4 ). The frequency of monitoring and the parameters that should be monitored are dependent on age. Patients should be questioned about skin reactivity, and application sites should be monitored when patients are treated with transdermal delivery systems. Middle-aged and older men are at potential risk for developing or worsening of sleep apnea, so they and their mates should be questioned for symptoms of sleep apnea.\nThe American Urological Association Best Practice Statement (2009) recommends evaluation of a prostatespecific antigen (PSA) level and a digital rectal examination of the prostate at age 40 (http://www.auanet.org/ content/guidelines-and-quality-care/clinical-guidelines/ main-reports/psa09.pdf). Individuals with PSA levels above the median (0.6 ng/dl) for this age should be monitored annually, whereas monitoring can be less frequent for those below the median. When lower urinary tract symptoms are significant or when treatment is increasing male pattern baldness, one can consider using a 5-\u2423-reductase inhibitor; however, trial data showing that this is effective in patients being treated with testosterone are limited."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The diagnosis and treatment of androgen deficiency are less controversial in younger men with classical causes of androgen deficiency who have unequivocally low testosterone levels. The diagnosis is less certain in middle-aged and older men with comorbid diseases and borderline low testosterone levels. Clinical trials in these men have produced more equivocal outcomes. Several RPCTs in older testosterone-deficient men have shown improvement in outcomes. A large, multicenter, National Institute on Aging-sponsored study is under way. It should provide definitive answers to potential benefits of testosterone replacement in older men. However, it is not powered to assess potential risks of prostate cancer and cardiovascular events. For now, clinicians should discuss the available efficacy and risk data for testosterone replacement and should help each patient make the decision that is best for him. 3 nmol/liter), adjust dose or frequency. Transdermal patches: assess testosterone level 3-12 h after application of the patch; adjust dose to achieve testosterone level in the mid-normal range. Buccal testosterone bioadhesive tablet: assess level immediately before or after application of fresh system. Transdermal gels: assess testosterone level any time after patient has been on treatment for at least 1 wk; adjust dose to achieve serum testosterone level in the mid-normal range. Testosterone pellets: measure testosterone levels at the end of the dosing interval. Adjust the number of pellets and/or the dosing interval to achieve serum testosterone levels in the normal range. Oral testosterone undecanoate: monitor serum testosterone level 3 to 5 h after ingestion. Injectable testosterone undecanoate: Measure serum testosterone level just prior to each subsequent injection and adjust the dosing interval to maintain serum testosterone in mid-normal range. 3. Check hematocrit at baseline, at 3 to 6 months, and then annually. If hematocrit is \u03fe54%, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to a safe level; evaluate the patient for hypoxia and sleep apnea; reinitiate therapy with a reduced dose. 4. Measure BMD of lumbar spine and/or femoral neck after 1-2 yr of testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men with osteoporosis or low trauma fracture, consistent with regional standard of care. 5. In men 40 yr of age or older with baseline PSA greater than 0.6 ng/ml, perform digital rectal examination and check PSA level before initiating treatment, at 3 to 6 months, and then in accordance with guidelines for prostate cancer screening depending on the age and race of the patient. 6. Obtain urological consultation if there is:\nAn increase in serum PSA concentration \u03fe1.4 ng/ml within any 12-month period of testosterone treatment. A PSA velocity of \u03fe0.4 ng/ml \u2150 yr using the PSA level after 6 months of testosterone administration as the reference (only applicable if PSA data are available for a period exceeding 2 yr).
