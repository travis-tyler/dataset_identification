[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "For preschool aged children, enrollment in Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) in many countries is now the norm [1,2]. Some studies have demonstrated that higher-quality ECEC is associated with improved language development, cognitive functioning, social competence, and emotional adjustment [3][4][5]. However, others have failed to report such linkages [6][7][8]. Structural quality indicators (e.g., staff/child ratios, staff education) generally refer to aspects of quality that are more easily quantifiable. As a result, governments tend to focus on regulation of these characteristics. Structural quality is thought to impact children indirectly by setting up the conditions in which children's direct experiences with the environment take place [9]. For example, when staff-child ratios are better, staff may have more opportunities to have positive interactions with children. Process quality is harder to assess as it focuses on the quality of interactions that children experience directly such as the warmth and responsiveness of the staff that care for children. At least in part due to increasing calls for accountability in education systems, substantial attention is being paid to identifying the kinds of environments that support young children's learning. Recent studies have focused attention on the quality of interactions children experience and are, therefore, thought to influence children more directly [8,10]. This focus on interactions is driven by some of the most fundamental theories in developmental psychology. These include, but are not limited to, the importance of children's early social exchanged as outlined by attachment theory [11], Ecological Systems theory's focus on the child's interactions with his/her most immediate environment [12] and Vygotsky's emphasis on learning through social exchanges by supportive \"experts\" [13]. In keeping with these theories, a key aspect of process quality is the warmth and responsiveness of interactions between staff and children, and the extent to which the interactions scaffold children's learning and development. The Classroom Assessment Scale (CLASS) is a relatively new measure of the emotional tone and the quality of developmentally appropriate \"instruction\" (e.g., providing a language/literacy rich environment, opportunities for hands on exploration of natural phenomena, etc.) of ECEC classrooms in a systematic way. In this paper we present a systematic review of the CLASS, which is increasingly influential in the field and child outcomes. Hamre et al. (2013) [14] present, and provide empirical support for Teaching Through Interactions. This is a conceptual framework that identified three key domains in teacherchild interactions. These domains are Emotional Support, Classroom Organization and Instructional Support. While this work largely discusses instruction within the formal education system it is based on theories that apply equally well to the preschool years. Specifically, in keeping with attachment [11], Emotional Support focuses on staffs' ability to create warm, safe, responsive and predictable environments that help children because secure, autonomous learners. Classroom Organization captures staffs' ability to structure the room in a way that minimizes behavioral problems and allows children to focus on their attention on learning. Finally, in keeping with Vygotskian thinking, Instructional Support focuses on the extent to which staff builds on children's existing knowledge and scaffold leaning. The importance of these domains is supported by a body of research that links them to a host of child outcomes, broadly construed (see Cappella et al. [15] for a comprehensive review of child outcomes associated with these domains of interactions between teachers and children). The CLASS is a key measure in this important research area as it is specifically designed to capture these three domains. Furthermore, the CLASS has also been central in the development of professional development programs for early childhood educators (e.g., MyTeaching-Partner [16]) that are built around this fundamental view of good caregiving/instruction for young children. Thus, the contribution of this systematic review and meta-analysis lies within the current theoretical discussion about the importance of teacher-child interactions as a key driver of teacher effectiveness. The CLASS is one of several classroom level measures of ECEC process quality. The most frequently used of these is the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R [17]). The ECERS-R is a global measure of quality that includes both structural aspects of the environment (e.g., the physical environment) and process quality (e.g., the kind of language that staff direct to children). There is a substantial body of research linking the ECERS-R to other measures of quality as well as to child outcomes [18][19][20]. The Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment (ORCE [21]) is another measure but research using the ORCE is largely based on one sample of approximately 1000 participants. As a result, it lacks the evidence base for extensive use or for a systematic review/meta-analysis. While the CLASS is a relatively new measure (certainly compared to the ECERS-R), it is supported by a growing body of evidence and grounded in a substantial theoretical/conceptual framework. The growing importance of the CLASS is evidenced by the fact that it is now used in statewide ECEC program quality assurance systems in Arizona, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Vermont, Virginia and Washington [22]. These assessments are used to make key funding and quality improvement decisions. Some quality assurance programs also make ratings public so that parents can use ratings in selecting placement for their children. Having access to empirically based measures of ECEC quality that are known to be associated with child outcomes is important for a range of stakeholders including parents and the people parents turn to for advice (e.g., their child's pediatrician), funders, policymakers and others. Despite rapid increases in use of the CLASS in research and in high stakes accountability settings, associations between the CLASS and child outcomes have not been systematically reviewed. We chose to cast a wide net regarding the child outcomes we included in this review. This reflects an understanding of the classroom context as having an impact on children that goes \"beyond achievement tests\" [15]. In keeping with this view, we set out to compile studies that used a broad range of outcomes and included information about young children's very early academic outcomes (including language and early literacy skills); their health/wellbeing and their social-emotional development. The objective of this review was to evaluate associations between CLASS domain and dimension scores in classrooms that served preschool aged children and children's concurrent or subsequent social, emotional and cognitive outcomes. A secondary aim was to explore associations between specific CLASS domains and dimensions and specific child outcomes (e.g., Emotional Support to children's social outcomes, Instructional Support for Learning to language and mathematics or Language Modeling to language outcomes)."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Selection of Studies", "text": "Searches for potential studies were conducted in three ways.

Instructional Support is made up of Concept Development, Quality of Feedback, Language Modeling, along with Literacy Focus. Factor analysis of the earlier version of the CLASS yielded two domains: Emotional Climate and Instructional Climate [33]. Emotional Climate includes all of the dimensions of the Emotional Support domain and the Behavior Management dimension that later became part of the Classroom Organization domain. Instructional Climate is a composite of Concept Development and Quality of Feedback. Eligible studies used in this paper operationalized the instrument in various ways (see Table 2). When reported, findings for individual dimensions were gathered. This was done to explore the possibility that associations might be higher between specific dimensions that mapped onto specific outcomes more closely than between the broader domains and specific outcomes (e.g., that language modeling might have a stronger association to children's language skills than Instructional Support).

For language outcomes, a high number of significant associations for the OWLS, PPVT, WJ Letter Word ID (and letter identification measures that were not part of the WJ) and WJ Rhyming were identified in the included studies.

Results from studies that used NCEDL data included in this systematic review should be interpreted with caution as the samples in these publications are drawn from a single dataset and therefore overlap. There were a few positive associations between CLASS scores and the math outcome of WJ Applied Problems but none with the ECLS-B Mathematics measure. Few positive significant associations were reported between the various CLASS domains and dimensions and measures of child outcomes. We also explored whether any one domain or dimension of the CLASS had a stronger pattern of associations with any of our outcomes. We paid particular attention to CLASS domains and dimensions that were conceptually linked to specific child outcomes (e.g., Emotional Support to children's social outcomes, Instructional Support for Learning to language and mathematics or Language Modeling to language outcomes). Across domains and dimensions there were few associations identified and most of them used from NCEDL data. Overall a consistent lack of relationships between the CLASS and the various outcomes reported in the literature was observed. We also explored whether accounting for covariates influenced the pattern of results. We did this by comparing results in studies that provided both a Pearson's correlation and either partial correlations, betas or unstandardized regression coefficients. Five studies [7,38,42,43,63] presented these statistics for the same operationalization of the CLASS and child outcome. Findings across these five studies were highly consistent indicating that when covariates were added there were fewer significant associations compared to the Pearson's correlations. The one exception to this was Sabol, 2013 [63] in which the significance level of most of the Pearson correlations was not reported. As a final check, we compared studies that used overlapping samples and found that results were highly consistent among them."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The CLASS is a relatively new measure of ECEC quality that focuses on constructs that are supported by a long history of theory (e.g., attachment theory, ecological systems theory, etc.) and research on the kids of environments that support child development.

Thus, despite being a relatively new measure we found 35 studies that could be used in this review. The quick uptake of this measure in research studies allows us to draw some conclusions about the extent to which it is associated with child outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analyses, we found a limited number of significant associations between the CLASS and the language social outcomes available in the literature. This was especially true when the large number of studies that used the NCEDL data was accounted for. Meta-analyses of studies that used the same operationalization of the CLASS, had identical outcome measures and had statistics that could be converted to r revealed some relationships between the different domains of the CLASS and child outcomes. Of the 14 meta-analyses we conducted, 2 showed significant, although small effect sizes. The low I 2 values found across these analyses suggest that the studies within each meta-analysis were homogeneous and support our conservative approach of only meta-analyzing studies that were quite similar to one another in terms of operationalization of the CLASS and child outcome. The lack of relationships is especially surprising in cases in which the CLASS domains maps onto a specific child outcome measure most closely (e.g., Emotional Support and children's Social Skills measured using the SSRS).

Our finding that associations between the CLASS and child outcomes are limited likely reflects the multitude of family and other factors the impact the outcomes we explored in this paper. Below we discuss some of the methodological limitations of the research we covered. We then provide alternative explanations for the weak associations. The literature in this area is problematic because: 1) it is heterogeneous and 2) many studies have methodological limitations. First, potential for selection bias in the included studies in this review is non-trivial as a number of studies did not randomly select programs and many programs and parents decline to participate. For example, 16 studies [7,8,30,31,[39][40][41]43,44,47,48,50,56,58,62,63] included in this review used data from the NCEDL database. The NCEDL is a large-scale study that draws on randomly selected programs from a number of diverse states. While this study is clearly an important one, it consists of a single sample. Approximately 78% of randomly selected programs in this study agreed to participate while 55-61% of parents from these programs agreed for their children to take part in the study. Thus, even in this relatively methodologically strong study, the final sample may not be representative of the general  [46,49,52,55,57,59] that had an outcome that appeared in only one or two samples were omitted from this figure. Several analyses from other papers that had idiosyncratic outcomes were also excluded. For a comprehensive display of all of the data for all of the child outcomes see Tables A-D, S4 File. b This paper is one of a series of Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews assessing the relationship between child care quality and children's outcomes; therefore, superscript letters below are in reference to various large databases that samples in these papers were drawn from. These letters have been kept consistent across the series of papers for our readers. c Samples within papers are described in more detail in Table 2  population of children. Moreover, sample self-selection may contribute to the low variability in CLASS scores observed. With few exceptions, the standard deviations reported for the CLASS domains and dimensions were smaller than 1. This self-selection may result in an over estimate of the quality of existing programs as better programs may be more willing to participate in research on program quality. It may be possible to achieve higher response rates in studies that are part of government initiatives to improve regulation of ECEC programs. Thus, researchers and government or other agencies involved in oversight of ECEC programs need to work together towards improving the quality of research in this area. In general parents who agree to participate in research tend to be better educated. This parent self-selection likely skews the types of children who participate in published studies. Another limitation of the samples used in these CLASS studies is that they all come from the United States. Clearly more research is needed to explore the role of the process quality, as captured in the CLASS, in other jurisdictions. Second, scores on the domains and dimensions of the CLASS; though consistent across programs, were not always favorable. Scores for Instructional Support were consistently low with values at around \"2\" whereas Classroom Organization and Emotional Support scores were higher at around \"5\" on this 7-point scale. This indicates that Instructional Support is an area in particular need of quality improvement across programs. The low scores observed for some domains and dimensions are especially worrisome given our speculation that these are likely to be overestimates of quality due to sample self-section issues. Finally, there was significant heterogeneity in the outcomes included in these studies. There are two versions of the CLASS, some researchers reported a total score, others created their own profiles from different CLASS codes. To maximize the number of studies we could draw  [46,49,52,55,57,59] that had an outcome that appeared in only one or two samples were omitted from this figure. Several analyses from other papers that had idiosyncratic outcomes were also excluded. For a comprehensive display of all of the data for all of the child outcomes see Tables A-D, S4 File. b This paper is one of a series of Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews assessing the relationship between child care quality and children's outcomes; therefore, superscript letters below are in reference to various large databases that samples in these papers were drawn from. These letters have been kept consistent across the series of papers for our readers. c Samples within papers are described in more detail in Table 2  from we attempted to \"streamline\" the CLASS scales as much as possible by equating domains that were made up of very similar dimensions and including studies that provided data on some dimensions only. There was also substantial variability in the statistics that were reported which further limited our ability to meta-analyze findings across papers. Finally, there is enormous variability in the covariates used in different studies. For example, some studies reported zero order correlations using no covariates [31], while other studies reported only partial correlations or regressions that included anywhere between 5 [39] and 22 [34] covariates controlling for child, family and program factors in their analyses [32]. Clearly studies in this area need to be conducted and reported more consistently so that findings can be integrated more effectively in the future. Studies about the effects of child care generally have some methodological limitations. For example, for ethical as well as logistical reasons, it is not possible to randomly assign children to programs of differing quality. As a result, all of the studies we included are observational/ correlational and causal conclusions about the link between the CLASS and child outcomes cannot be drawn. Reporting of study methodologies and results is inconsistent and at times incomplete. For example, a measure of variability was not reported in a number of studies [7,55,[65][66][67]. However, it is worth noting that the studies included in our meta-analyses used psychometrically strong measurements, had large sample sizes, included many covariates in the analyses in an effort to mitigate the program and parent self-selection issues discussed  [46,49,52,55,57,59] that had an outcome that appeared in only one or two samples were omitted from this figure. Several analyses from other papers that had idiosyncratic outcomes were also excluded. For a comprehensive display of all of the data for all of the child outcomes see Tables A-D, S4 File. b This paper is one of a series of Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews assessing the relationship between child care quality and children's outcomes; therefore, superscript letters below are in reference to various large databases that samples in these papers were drawn from. These letters have been kept consistent across the series of papers for our readers. c Samples within papers are described in more detail in Table 2  above, and ensured that children who were assessed had been exposed to the programs. Thus, while the studies we included suffered from substantial limitations, they also had many strengths. One major drawback of this heterogeneity and the number of studies available for metaanalysis is that we could not test the effects of possible moderators on the relationship between the CLASS and child outcomes. Variables of particular interest are whether the duration of exposure and socioeconomic backgrounds of children influence associations between the CLASS and child outcomes. In general, ECEC programs are expected to make the greatest impact on children from low SES backgrounds. While we were not able to test SES as a moderator, the studies we included generally over represented lower income children. Future reviews based on additional studies to be published in the future in this area, will hopefully be able to test these issues more directly. Other explanations for the small effect sizes found in this review include the possibility that higher quality programs only impact children who require especially supportive environments. The differential susceptibility hypothesis [74] posits that children who are more vulnerable for genetic, temperamental or other reasons, may be differentially impacted by the extent to which their surroundings are supportive. Thus, overall effects may be eliminated/reduced when aggregating across diverse children within a given sample. Another possible explanation is that the CLASS measures quality at the classroom level, while classrooms in the early childhood sector are staffed by multiple adults. Measures like the Caregiver Interaction Scale [75], which are collected at the staff level, are worth exploring. However, these generally focus only on warmth and sensitivity without the emphasis on developmentally appropriate instruction offered by the CLASS. Discrepancies in the unit of analysis may be contributing to the lack of associations reported in this review. In addition, it is possible that other aspects of interaction should be attended to. For example, Hamre et al. (2013) [14] mention the \"use of emotion words and emotion coaching\" as \"unique elements of classroom interactions not measured by the CLASS\" (p. 464). Alternatively, child outcomes might be better predicted by more comprehensive measures such as the ECERS-R described earlier, that capture both structural and process quality. In addition, while we set out to collect a broad range of child outcomes, we could only report on outcomes that were found in the literature. Some outcomes (e.g., gross and fine motor abilities) are notably absent and could explain the lack of associations observed in this study. Future studies should look at the presence of non-linear relationships between quality characteristics and child outcomes, as there may be some threshold value in ECEC quality that changes the direction of the association. Such relationships cannot be adequately captured by statistical indices that assume linear relationships reported here. The possibility that there are thresholds of quality in terms of impacts on children is gaining attention from researchers. This is illustrated by the recent publication of a special issue on this topic [76]. However, one study that tested this possibility directly with the CLASS did not provide support for the threshold hypothesis for this measure [77]. Finally, one of the strengths of this study is that we cast a very wide net in terms of our initial searches. This resulted in many \"hits\" that were not, in the end, relevant to the goals of this study. We then developed and systematically applied a set of selection criteria with the aim of having a relatively homogenous sample of studies for subsequent analysis. The downside of this approach is that it was very labour intensive. The upside is that we can be more confident that our searches were comprehensive. As described earlier, the CLASS is being used increasingly as part of quality assurance programs. It is also used as an integral part of professional development (PD) programs where with the help of a coach, caregivers use the CLASS as a lens through which staff co-view videos of their own interactions with children to improve their practice. The logic of such PD programs stems from the rich literature that formed the basis for approaches like Teaching Through Interaction and informed the development of the CLASS. Yet, given the results of the current systematic review and meta-analysis, clearly more research about what aspects of the classroom environment are associated with child outcomes is needed."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The CLASS operationalizes difficult constructs such as scaffolding and contingent responding by ECEC staff, constructs that are thought to be key in supporting children's development. The CLASS domain that was most closely linked to child outcomes was Instructional Support. Sadly, it is also, by far, the lowest scoring domain across studies. Very few effects were found for Classroom Organization and Emotional Support. However, it is important to note that based on these findings we cannot conclude that programs of lower or higher quality than what we found in the literature would not impact children. As noted above, it may well be that there are threshold/levels of quality that must be met for quality to impact children. One of the most important conclusions of this study is that more research, using stronger methodologies and a variety of samples is needed. Research with samples from outside the US is especially important. However, despite all of the methodological limitations discussed above, there is a growing body of research about associations between the CLASS and child outcomes and it is important to systematically review the existing literature about this influential measure. Unfortunately, based the existing literature, it appears that associations between the CLASS and child outcomes are quite limited. "}, {"section_title": "Supporting Information", "text": ""}]
