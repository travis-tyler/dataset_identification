These reactions result in ammonium (NH 4 + )-containing aerosols, which may be of concern in particulate matter (PM fine ) nonattainment areas. At the Earth's surface, NH x (= NH 3 + NH 4 + ) at low concentrations can be a valuable source of nutrient input; however, high concentrations can lead to acidification of soils, forest decline, and eutrophication of waterways [Asman, 1994; Aneja et al., 1998 ]. Therefore, the spatial distribution of NH 3 emissions and parameters which control the fate of this specie are important in determining areas of excess nitrogen input, and will aid in the development of models to predict the transport and deposition of atmospheric NH x .\n[3] Globally, approximately 54 (22 -83) Tg N-NH 3 (1 Tg  =10 12 g) are emitted each year [Bouwman et al., 1997; Schlesinger and Hartley, 1992; Warneck, 1988] . The largest fraction ($41%) is from domestic animal excreta, at approximately 22 Tg N-NH 3 yr"}, {"section_title": "\u00c01", "text": ". In the United States, domestic animal waste is also the largest contributor to atmospheric NH 3 emissions, responsible for approximately 80% nationwide [Battye et al., 1994] . Combined with fertilizer application to farmland, animal husbandry and agricultural practices account for $90% of the total NH 3 emitted in the United States each year [Battye et al., 1994] . Approximately 32% of the southeast United States (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Tennessee) is used for farming practices and agriculture and while the southeast accounts for only 12% of the total area of the continental United States, it holds 18% of the total farmland [USDA, 1999] .\n[4] Analysis of the fate of NH 3 emissions in the United States is complicated by a lack of data on gaseous NH 3 in the ambient atmosphere. NH 3 monitoring data for the United States are rare, and data on long-term ambient trends are generally not available for gaseous NH 3 . However, acid deposition monitoring networks provide considerable data on NH 4 + ion concentrations in particulate matter. The Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) measures concentrations of particulate NH 4 + , sulfate (SO 4 2\u00c0 ), and nitrate (NO 3 \u00c0 ). These data can provide some insights into the fate of gaseous NH 3 emissions. Therefore the objective of this study is to investigate concentrations of NH 4 + associated with aerosols and in precipitation and NH 3 emissions in the southeast United States over the period 1990 -1998, with the intent of defining relationships between NH 4 + concentrations, local meteorology and NH 3 emissions.\n) versus natural log-transformed annual county NH 3 emission density (kg NH 3 ha \u00c01 yr \u00c01 ) (b). revealed that the concentration of NH 4 + peaks during the summer when temperatures are warm. This relationship is to be expected based on the fact that atmospheric NH 4 + is primarily a product of NH 3 reacting with acids formed in the atmosphere, such as H 2 SO 4 , HNO 3 , and HCl and the formation of these acids depends on the availability of hydroxyl radical (OH) and O 3 in the atmosphere, which peak during the summer months [Seinfeld, 1986] . Furthermore, biogenic NH 3 emissions from soils and animal waste storage and treatment lagoons [Aneja et al., 2000] are in part driven by temperature, where a 10\u00b0C increase in temperature approximately doubles the rate of ammonification [Addiscott, 1983] ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Selection", "text": "[5] To estimate NH 3 emissions, agricultural data was obtained from the 1997 Census of Agriculture [USDA, 1999] . The census provided a complete data set for cattle and horses (i.e., an exact number was provided for each county in each state). However, the data for poultry, swine, and sheep was incomplete. In this case, the total number of animals was based on the average farm inventory. When the statewide population was less than 5000 for a particular animal, the estimate for that animal was considered negligible and therefore excluded from the final estimates. In the case of fertilizer, data was obtained from the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials, Inc. and is based on sales made by fertilizer registrants in each state.\n[6] Data on NH 4 + concentration associated with aerosols was obtained from the Clean Air Status and Trends Monitoring Network [CASTNet, 1998] . CASTNet was designed to be a rural monitoring network collecting data to establish site-specific measurements of total deposition and is considered the nation's primary source for estimates of dry acidic deposition and rural ozone (O 3 ) concentrations [CASTNet, 1998 ]. The network consists of 51 monitoring sites located across the United States, most of which have been operational since 1987. Continuous measurements of meteorological data including temperature, relative humidity, solar insolation, precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction are taken at each site and atmospheric concentrations of NH 4 + are obtained from weekly filter pack measurements [Holland et al., 1999] .\n[7] The CASTNet monitoring network [USEPA, 1998 ] measures weekly average ambient concentrations of particulate NH 4 + [Lawrence et al., 2000; Sickles et al., 1999; and Clarke et al., 1997] . The network also measures concentrations of particulate SO 4 2\u00c0 , NO 3 \u00c0 , base cations, O 3 , SO 2 , and nitric acid (HNO 3 ). NH 4 + in the particulate, which is collected on a Teflon filter, is measured on a weekly basis by colorimetry. The CASTNet network was not designed to measure NH 3 gas. Ten CASTNet sites chosen for this study were selected based on location and availability of data. All of the sites, excluding CKT (located in Morgan County, KY), have more than 290 weekly NH 4 + measurements from 1990 to 1998 making them suitable for long-term trend analysis. For more information regarding CASTNet data analysis and validation procedures, see the studies of Clarke et al. [1997] and of USEPA [1998] .\n[8] Data on NH 4 + concentration associated with precipitation were obtained from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN) [NADP/NTN, 1999] . NADP/NTN began monitoring in 1978 and currently operates over 200 sites nationwide. The purpose of the network is to collect data on the chemistry and amount of precipitation for monitoring spatial and temporal long-term trends. The precipitation at each station is collected weekly from AeroChem Metrics wet -dry deposition samplers according to strict clean-handling procedures. The precipitation sample is then sent to the Central Analytical Laboratory in Illinois, where it is analyzed for hydrogen (acidity as pH), SO 4 2\u00c0 , NO 3 \u00c0 , NH 4 + , chloride, and base cations (such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium) (NADP/NTN). Data validation procedures used at the laboratory are described by Bowersox [1984] .\n[9] It should be noted that both positive and negative biases in NH 4 + concentration in precipitation have been measured. A positive bias may result from the deposition of NH 3 gas to the open precipitation collector [Jensen and Asman, 1995] . This bias will, on average, be greatest in agricultural areas and will likely be positively correlated with ambient temperature. A negative bias, as large as 40% in some cases, has been shown to result from postcollection incorporation of NH 4 + into microbial biomass [Ramundo and Seastedt, 1990; Lamb and Comrie, 1993] . This bias is also expected to be larger under warm temperatures. Unfortunately, it is not possible to quantify the net result of these biases. While this source of error may reduce the amplitude of season cycles, due to a net reduction of summer values at most sites, it should not greatly effect the magnitude of long-term trends. At agricultural sites, the competing biases may result in a relatively small net error.\n[ "}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "[11] In this study, regression analysis, specifically the method of ordinary least squares, was used to identify relationships between dependent and independent variables.

To develop this regional emissions inventory, emission estimates from all major agricultural sources in the southeast United States were calculated using data from 1997. The sources considered in this inventory include dairy and beef cattle, poultry, swine, horses, and sheep, as well as fertilizer application. County totals are obtained for each source, and NH 3 emission estimates are performed at the county level. For the purpose of this study, NH 3 emissions are assumed to be uniform across the county. This provides a general spatial distribution of estimated NH 3 emissions across the eight-state region. County-level NH 3 emission estimates for each source type are based on the following equation:\nThe activity data is simply the number of animals present in each county, and is obtained from the 1997 U. spheric temperature and humidity, waste-handling practices, and many other parameters [Asman, 1992] . Because of the many uncertainties, it may be difficult to obtain an accurate NH 3 emission estimate. Table 3 is a summary of documented emission factors that were considered in developing the emission inventory for this study. The large variation in estimates illustrates the difficulty in developing precise estimates.\n[13] Emission factors were selected for each livestock group including beef and dairy cattle, hogs and pigs, chickens, broilers, turkeys, horses, and sheep. An earlier study and literature review by Battye et al. [1994] refined European emission factors based on United States agricultural practices. Their results have been used as a guide to obtain the emission factors employed in this study. The U.S. Census of Agriculture has provided estimates for both beef and dairy cattle; therefore, a unique emission factor was determined for each. Battye et al. [1994] \u00c01 yr \u00c01 , are derived for fattening hogs and sows respectively. The factor 16.43 for sows includes a correction for young sows and piglets that account for 40% of the population. Therefore, to estimate total NH 3 emissions from a general hog population, 50% of the population was multiplied by 6.39 and 10% of the population by 16.43. This equates to an average emission factor of 4.84 kg NH 3 per hog, which has proved to be a satisfactory estimate based on recent studies at a commercial hog farm by McCulloch [1999] . His study estimated total NH 3 emissions from hog facilities to be in the range 3.4-6.9 kg NH 3 animal \u00c01 yr \u00c01 [McCulloch, 1999] . Battye et al. [1994] proposed emission factors for sheep, broilers, and laying hens older than 20 weeks based on the study of Asman [1992] . These estimates have been refined based on new experimental data, and the updated values are employed in this study [Van Der Hoek, 1998 ].\n[15] For the remaining animal groups (pullets 13-20 weeks, pullets less than 30 weeks, and turkeys) and fertilizer application, the emission factors proposed by Battye et al. [1994] are used. Table 4 lists the estimated emission factors for various nitrogen fertilizers, based on total U.S. consumption in 1993. A summary of emission factors and corresponding 1997 emissions estimates for all domestic livestock and fertilizer application in the southeast are given in Table 5 . Based on the emission factors and agricultural census data, both the relative contribution from each source category (Figure 1 ) and the spatial distribution of NH 3 emissions were determined ( Figure 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Influence of NH 3 Emissions on Atmospheric NH 4 + Concentrations", "text": "[16] Exploratory regression analysis is used to determine relationships between county-scale NH 3 emissions and within-county observed annual average concentrations of NH 4 + associated with aerosols and annual volumeweighted average concentration of NH 4 + in precipitation (Table 2 ).

Measurements of NH 4 + concentration in aerosols from 10 CASTNet sites across the southeast United States and NH 4 + concentration in precipitation from 10 neighboring NADP sites were analyzed for the period January 1990 to December 1998. Due to the proximity of each CASTNet and NADP site (Table 1) , the same meteorological data were used for both analyses.\n[18] To investigate the relationship between ambient and wet NH 4 + concentration and meteorology, a multiple linear regression model of the following type was employed at all sites [Walker et al., 2000a; Holland et al., 1999; Buishand et al., 1988; Dana and Easter, 1987] :\nwhere log(C t ) refers to the natural log-transformed weekly concentration of ambient NH 4 + (mg m \u00c03 ) or wet NH 4 + in precipitation (mg L \u00c01 ) at time t weeks from 1 January 1990. Raw data were transformed to help achieve the condition of normality in regression residuals. The second term in model (1) contains sine and cosine functions, which are commonly used to model seasonal cycles in data [Lynch et al., 1995; Holland et al., 1999] . In model (1), the amplitude (A) of the cycle is determined as:\nand the phase angle (f) is determined as:\nThe regression routine calculates p-values for coefficients a and b under the null hypothesis that no cycle is present at frequency 2pt/52 (a = 0 and b = 0). If the p-value for either of the regression coefficients is less than the specified alpha level, the null hypothesis may be rejected. Meteorological parameters (temperature, precipitation amount, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction) included in the model are represented by x n = x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 , and x 5 . Finally, a o represents the intercept of the regression line, while the residual (e i ) represents the error in the point prediction of log(C t ).

To improve the normality of regression residuals, NH 4 + concentrations in aerosols and precipitation, along with emissions, were first natural logtransformed. Regression analyses were performed on transformed variables. Results show that natural log-transformed annual NH 4 + concentrations associated with aerosols increase with natural log-transformed county annual NH 3 emission density (R 2 = 0.86, p < 0.0001, N = 12) ( Figure  3a) . The untransformed data show a clear logarithmic increase in NH 4 + concentrations in aerosols with increasing emissions. This relationship suggests that local NH 3 emissions strongly influence ambient NH 4 + concentrations, but that there exists a level above which NH 3 emission is no longer the primary source of variability in ambient NH 4 + concentration. This can be explained by the fact that NH 4 + aerosol formation is limited by the availability of acid gases in the presence of excess NH 3 . Thus, counties with high NH 3 emission densities likely represent areas within which NH 4 + aerosol formation is no longer NH 3 limited. A similar regression analysis shows that natural log-transformed annual volume-weighted average NH 4 + concentration in precipitation shows only a very weak positive correlation with natural log-transformed annual NH 3 emission densities within the corresponding county (R 2 = 0.12, p = 0.04, N = 28) (Figure 3b ). Perhaps the primary reason for this much weaker relationship is that the incorporation of NH 4 + into rainfall takes place on a spatial scale greater than the area of individual counties. In most cases, the majority of NH 4 + observed in rainfall at a particular location originates from relatively distant sources, and the local signal may result from the relatively inefficient process of below-cloud scavenging of NH 3 and NH 4 + [Shimshock and De Pena, 1989] . In general, agricultural NH 3 sources are shown to influence local concentrations of NH 4 + in aerosols and precipitation both in the United States and Europe [Marquardt et al., 1996; Erisman et al., 1998; Asman et al., 1998; Aneja et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2000a; Sutton et al., 2001a Sutton et al., , 2001b ."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Weekly NH 4 + Concentration Associated With Aerosols", "text": "[21] Table 6 summarizes the results from model (1) applied to the weekly ambient concentration data at each CASTNet site (Table 1 ). The R 2 values range from 0.18 at SUM (Liberty County, Florida) to 0.73 at PNF (Avery County, North Carolina). The poor performance of the model at site SUM may be attributed to its location, a Florida site with very little seasonal variability and strong coastal influence.\n[22] Precipitation amount was the most significant parameter at 7 out of 10 sites, having a negative regression coefficient ranging from \u00c00.0045 to \u00c00.005. This inverse relationship has also been reported in other studies [Prado- , 1990; Walker et al., 2000a] . Relative humidity is found to be a significant ( p < 0.05) parameter at 6 sites. The positive regression coefficient (0.001 -0.005) suggests that higher relative humidity leads to increased concentrations of NH 4 + associated with aerosols. Therefore, increased water vapor in the atmosphere near sources of NH 3 , lead to higher concentrations of NH 4 + [Andersen et al., 1999; Asman, 1994; Warneck, 1988; McMurry et al., 1983] . Moreover, at high relative humidity (>62%) ammonium nitrate is less likely to dissociate into HNO 3 and NH 3 [Stelson and Seinfeld, 1982] . Wind speed is a significant parameter in the model at 6 sites and is negatively correlated to NH 4 + concentrations. Low wind speeds often coincide with stable conditions and limited dispersion whereas lower concentrations are often characterized by higher wind speeds and increased mixing throughout the boundary layer [Arya, 1999] . Temperature is also a significant model predictor at half of the sites. Finally, wind direction is significant at 6 CASTNet sites. From the regression coefficients, however, it is difficult to interpret the effect wind direction has at any particular site and is better illustrated by showing NH 4 + concentration associated with aerosols relative to wind direction for CASTNet site CND located in Montgomery County, North Carolina (Figure 4) [Yamamoto et al., 1995] . From this plot, it is clear that higher concentrations of NH 4 + associated with aerosols occur when the wind is from the E and SE. Indeed, Area I, previously defined as an area of elevated NH 3 emissions, is located to the E/SE of site CND (see Figure 2) .\n[23] The model with the best fit (R 2 = 0.73) was for CASTNet site PNF located in Avery County, North Carolina. A plot of measured and predicted concentrations at site PNF, for the period January 1990 to December 1998, shows that the model follows the general seasonal trends of the ambient NH 4 + concentration but fails to predict the peaks ( Figure 5 ).

The results for all CASTNet sites (Table 1) selected are summarized in Table 7 .\n[25] The models of monthly NH 4 + concentrations perform much better than those of weekly concentrations with R 2 values ranging from 0.14 to 0.86 for seasonality model (4) and 0.07-0.81 for temperature model (5). If we remove the Florida site SUM, the average R 2 for models (4) and (5) are 0.69 and 0.63, respectively. This means that 69% of the variability in NH 4 + concentration in aerosols is explained by seasonality factors in model (4), while 63% of the variability is explained by temperature dependence in model (5). These results suggest that most of the variation in NH 4 + concentrations in aerosols can be explained by temperature or seasonal effects. In general, Table 7 shows that R 2 values are consistently higher for the seasonality model (4), which is to be expected based on the strong interaction between temperature and seasonality inherent in this model. However, to account fully for spatial variations in ambient NH 4 + concentrations and deposition, one must also consider such variables as ambient concentrations of NH 4 + precursors, surface roughness, and vegetation properties, which have large spatial and temporal variability [Asman, 1994] .\n[26] Statistically significant trends were evident at 2 of the CASTNet sites over the period 1990-1998. A positive trend was present at site SUM in Sumatra County, Florida ( p = 0.05). However, this site performed poorly in the above analyses, so this result may be inaccurate. A negative trend was observed at site SPD, located in Claiborne County, Tennessee. Mean concentrations of NH 4 + associated with aerosols fell from approximately 2.14 in 1990 to 1.88 in 1998 ( p = 0.06) . Trends in mean surface temperature were investigated at site SPD (Claiborne County, Tennessee). However, no statistically significant trend was present over the period 1990 -1998 suggesting that temperature is likely not responsible for the decreasing trend in NH 4 + concentration at these sites."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Weekly NH 4 + Concentration Associated With Precipitation", "text": "[27] Model (1) was run for all NADP sites (Table 1) to select the best parameter fit.

Two of the NADP sites showed a statistically significant positive (p < 0.05) trend for the period 1990 -1998; KY35, located in Rowan County, Kentucky, and NC35, located in Sampson County, North Carolina. The linear trends for these two sites are shown in Figure 6 .\n[29] At the Sampson County, North Carolina site (NC35), located in Area I (see Figure 2) Walker et al. [2000a Walker et al. [ , 2000b . Their findings reveal that no significant increasing trends in temperature or precipitation are present for the period 1990 -1996; therefore, meteorology is likely not responsible for the increasing trend in NH 4 + . Walker et al. [2000b] go on to relate the increasing trend in NH 4 + in precipitation to an increase in local NH 3 emissions caused by swine facilities. In fact, the hog population in North Carolina rose from approximately 2 million to 10 million hogs between 1990 and 1998, with 50% of the statewide population, and hence the emissions, located in the concentrated area surrounding Sampson County. The natural summertime peaks of NH 4 + concentration in this area are further enhanced by the presence of waste from hogs.\n[30] At site KY35, the average NH 4 + concentration in precipitation rose from approximately 0.2 mg L \u00c01 in 1990 to 0.35 mg L \u00c01 ( p = 0.004) in 1998. Analyses of precipitation and temperature revealed no statistically significant trend in either variable over the 8-year span; therefore, temperature and precipitation amount do not appear to be responsible for the increasing trend in NH 4 + concentration in precipitation found at NADP site KY35. The reason behind the increasing NH 4 + trend at KY35 is less obvious than at NC35, because Rowan County, Kentucky, has an average NH 3 flux of only 131 kg NH 3 km \u00c02 yr \u00c01 . Based on CASTNet meteorological data, the prevailing wind at site KY35 is from the SW; however, concentrations of NH 4 + in aerosols, and presumably NH 4 + in precipitation, are slightly higher when the wind is out of the N. The trend observed at this site likely results from increasing upwind NH 3 source strengths over the period."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "[31] This study provides insight into the coupling between NH 3 emissions and NH 4 + concentrations associated with both aerosols and precipitation and how environmental parameters affect these relationships. Regression modeling shows that counties with relatively higher agricultural NH 3 emissions exhibit higher annual average concentrations of NH 4 + associated with aerosols though the influence on NH 4 + concentration in precipitation is much less clear. Analysis of NH 4 + concentration in aerosols at the various CASTNet sites revealed that temperature, precipitation amount, and relative humidity are the most statistically significant ( p < 0.05) parameters in predicting the weekly concentrations of NH 4 + .

Analyses of NH 4 + emissions and deposition in the United States are complicated by a lack of data on ambient levels of NH 3 gas and the complex interrelations among NH 3 gas, HNO 3 gas, and SO 4 2\u00c0 and NO 3 \u00c0 particulate components. [32] Results from this study provide additional evidence that agricultural NH 3 source strengths are seasonally dependent. Modeling exercises which use annual emissions estimates derived from factors such as those presented in this study should attempt to account for this effect. Furthermore, seasonality in NH 3 emissions may translate to seasonality in ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate aerosol concentrations in some areas. This relationship, however, is confounded by seasonality in nitric and sulfuric acid concentrations. Further research (both measurement and modeling) is warranted to investigate such dynamic NH 3 /aerosol relationships and the influence of NH 3 on total PM 2.5 . The general form of the parametric models presented here may be useful in examining the temporal variability in NH 3 , SO 4 2\u00c0 , NO 3 \u00c0 , HNO 3 , and sulfuric acid to better characterize the seasonal nature of NH 3 /NH 4 partitioning."}]
