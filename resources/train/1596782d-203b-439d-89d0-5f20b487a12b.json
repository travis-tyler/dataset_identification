[{"section_title": "", "text": "peer perceptions and peer influence are also becoming important (Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 2006). Overweight and underweight youth are more likely to report negative body perceptions (Calzo et al., 2012;Wardle & Cook, 2005) and are more likely to be socially stigmatized because of their size (e.g., see Puhl & Latner, 2007). Unsurprisingly, overweight and underweight youth struggle with internalizing difficulties during this developmental period (Puder & Munsch, 2010;Wang et al., 2010;Whetsone et al., 2007). When examining these factors concurrently, the extant research highlights salient associations between children's weight and mental health. An important next step in the literature is to examine the temporal sequencing of these events. Few studies have examined the links between internalizing difficulties and weight status longitudinally, with even fewer studies focusing on children and slow BMI growth. In one study of youth that ranged in age from 9 to 18 years, the onset of depression or anxiety at age 9 years was associated with greater increases in adiposity over a life span than late-adolescent and adult-onset psychopathology, suggesting that middle childhood is a sensitive period for later health-related difficulties (Anderson, Cohen, Naumova, & Must, 2006). In a younger sample of children, obesity status from kindergarten to 3rd grade was associated with internalizing symptoms for young females only (Datar & Sturm, 2006). In both of the aforementioned studies, only adiposity status or internalizing symptoms were used to predict changes in the other; however, few studies have examined these processes in tandem among youth. In one such study, 7th to 12th graders' baseline depressive symptoms were linked to obesity 1 year later; however, baseline obesity status did not predict follow-up depressive symptoms (Goodman & Whitaker, 2002). Given the dearth of research in this area, it is unclear how underweight status is linked to changes in internalizing symptoms and vice versa. The links between adiposity and internalizing symptoms are complex, and current research seems to suggest the relation between the two constructs is likely moderated by race and sex. Data provided by Ogden and colleagues (2014) indicate that sex and racial disparities appear to emerge during middle childhood for adiposity. Although rates of obesity were similar for Black males, Black females, White males, and White females in the 2-5-year age range, differences in obesity status between sex and race start to emerge among youth aged 6-11 years, with Black males averaging the highest rates of obesity. These differences remained throughout adolescence, with Black females surpassing all groups in rates of obesity. Regarding underweight status, males (3.6%) and females (3.5%) remained relatively equal between 2007 and 2010 (CDC, 2012). Similar race by sex breakdowns for underweight youth do not currently appear to be available. Internalizing symptoms have been inconsistently related to sex, but not race. For example, in a recent meta-analysis, Chaplin and Aldao (2013) found that from middle childhood to adolescence, girls evidenced higher levels of both positive emotions and internalizing emotions than boys. However, other research indicates that before the onset of adolescence, internalizing symptoms in males were slightly higher than in females (Angold & Rutter, 1992;Nolen-Hoeksema & Girgus, 1994). Males' levels of internalizing symptoms remain stable over time, whereas females' level of internalizing symptoms rapidly increase and exceed males' levels during adolescence (Galambos, Leadbeater, & Barker, 2004;Leadbeater, Kuperminic, Blatt, & Hertzog, 1999;Twenge & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2002). Rates of hopelessness, depression, and suicidal ideation have not been shown to vary across Black and White children (Kazdin, French, Unis, Esveldt-Dawson, & Sherick, 1983;Twenge & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2002). Taken together, sex has shown to moderate the relation between both weight status and internalizing symptoms. Further, evidence has clearly highlighted that racial disparities exist for Black children, particularly when compared with White children. Thus, it is important to examine the moderating role of sex and race when examining the relation between weight and internalizing symptoms."}, {"section_title": "Present Study", "text": "Previous research has consistently linked being overweight and underweight with internalizing symptoms in children and adolescence. Limited research has examined the relation between BMI and internalizing symptoms over time during childhood, with no studies to our knowledge examining how changes in each construct are associated. Given the extensive relation between BMI and internalizing symptoms, it is likely that these changes are dynamic and interrelated. Understanding this process could bode well for both preventive and intervention research. As noted in the previous section, prior research has also documented sex and race differences on internalizing problems and adiposity. Thus, it is potentially valuable to examine how sex, race, internalizing symptoms, and zBMI interact and relate to one another over time. The present study will primarily focus on Black and White youth, as these youth have the highest prevalence rates compared with other racial groups (Ogden et al., 2014). Examining the psychosocial processes across these two racial groups may potentially elucidate similarities and differences through streamlined comparisons, thus laying the foundation for one-to-one comparisons between other racial groups. The primary aim of the present research was to determine whether children's zBMI was associated with changes in internalizing symptoms, whether internalizing symptoms were associated with changes in zBMI, and whether patterns emerged differently by sex and race. Although the analyses were largely exploratory, we anticipated that changes in zBMI from kindergarten to 8th grade were associated with changes in internalizing symptoms from kindergarten to 5th grade, and that these relations were moderated by race and sex."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The data obtained for this study represent a secondary data analysis derived from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K).

The children in the ECLS-K (N \u00bc 14,800) came from both public and private schools and attended both full-day and partday kindergarten programs. The present research focused on White and Black children only. Children with limited limb functioning (as reported by parents), were excluded from the analyses, as impaired mobility could influence the amount of exercise and adiposity status. Child race and sex were assessed at baseline interviews with parents. At the first period, there were 14,800 (before exclusion) non-Hispanic White and Black children, 11,631 non-Hispanic White children (51.6% male), and 3,169 non-Hispanic Black children (50.2% male). In the present study, participants totaled 12,674 children after applying exclusion criteria, in which 2,338 children were excluded because of a documented diagnosis that impeded limb functioning or missing data regarding the presence of this diagnosis.

Biologically plausible BMI scores were standardized for the child's age and sex using tables provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 2009). The Centers for Disease Control suggest Body Mass Indexes as reliable indicators of body fatness for most children and teens. Research has shown that BMI scores correlate to direct measures of body fat (Mei et al., 2002) and is used as an alternative for direct measures of body fat (CDC, 2011a, b). See Table I for a breakdown of weight status (e.g., underweight, average weight, overweight, and obese) for the current sample across all time points. Internalizing Problems Each child's regular classroom teacher (i.e., the teacher who taught the child for the majority of the day) reported on children's internalizing behaviors based on the Social Rating Scale (SRS) at five data time points spanning the fall of the kindergarten year to the spring of the 5th grade year. The SRS was adapted from the social skills rating system (Gresham & Elliot, 1990). The present study only used internalizing scores from each data point. The internalizing behavior problem scale consists of four items regarding the presence of anxiety, loneliness, low self-esteem, and sadness in the child and has shown adequate reliability for each time point (a \u00bc .76-.80; Pollack, Atkins-Burnett, Najarian, & Rock, 2005;Pollack, Atkins-Burnett, Rock, Weiss, 2005;Rock & Pollack, 2002). Further, this measure has shown to be predictive of children's emotion knowledge and ability to accurately label and recognize emotions (Izard et al., 2006). Teachers used a 4-point Likert scale to report how often the child exhibited the behaviors (1 \u00bc never to 4 \u00bc most of the time).

LGCM is a structural equation modeling technique that represents repeated measures of a dependent variable (i.e., zBMI and internalizing symptoms) as observed or directly measured indicators of latent variables that represent individual differences in growth over time (e.g., growth in zBMI from kindergarten to 8th grade). Latent growth models incorporate information about the means, as well as the variances and covariances, of measured variables . These models focus on both group and individual levels of analyses (Willett, Singer, & Martin, 1998). Several models were examined to determine the best statistical model for children's zBMI and internalizing symptoms (modeled separately). More specifically, changes in children's zBMI were modeled as linear, quadratic, piecewise, and latent basis . The goodness of fit of the models was evaluated using a Scaled Chi-Square statistic (Yuan & Bentler, 2000), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker Lewis Index (TLI)/Nonnormed Fit Index, and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA; MacCallum, Browne, & Sugawara, 1996). The RMSEA was used as an indication of population error variance (Browne & Cudeck, 1993;Hu & Bentler, 1995). The same procedures were applied to children's internalizing symptoms.

Prior research on children has documented longitudinal links between ON statements indicate that the intercept of internalizing, intercept of BMI, and the interaction between the intercepts are predicting the various slopes. As factor loadings were divided by 10 for model estimation purposes, slope values, slope variance, and slope covariance values should be interpreted by dividing by 10. internalizing symptoms and adiposity status; however, no study to our knowledge has examined the longitudinal relation of these events among youth and how changes in one domain are associated with changes in another domain. The goal of the present research was to simultaneously examine the patterns of changes between children's internalizing difficulties and adiposity over time. Given the potential moderating effect of sex and race (Banks et al., 2015), the longitudinal trajectories for both internalizing symptoms and adiposity were examined separately by sex. Overall, the results suggest a longitudinal association between adiposity and internalizing symptoms, with kindergarten as a sensitive period for future health-related difficulties for White males. Research on the longitudinal links between changes in adiposity and internalizing symptoms is rare in youth, particularly for youth with slower rates of growth compared with their peers. Of the few studies that have examined these processes, being underweight was found to be associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (Whetsone et al., 2007). Males frequently report desiring to be \"bigger,\" often leaving smaller than average males with decreased body satisfaction (Cohane & Pope, 2001;Watkins, Christie, & Chally, 2008) and higher levels of psychological stress (Atlantis & Ball, 2008). Findings from the present study appear to parallel that of previous research, and add to it by examining the longitudinal predictive link between these processes. That is, White males experiencing higher initial levels of internalizing symptoms (\u00fe1 SD above the mean) in kindergarten evidenced slower zBMI growth from 3rd to 8th grade. Similarly, White males with initially high levels of zBMI (\u00fe1 SD above the mean) evidenced a negative relation between zBMI and internalizing symptoms from 3rd to 8th grade. In other words, as zBMI increased, internalizing symptoms decreased. For White females, starting internalizing symptoms at kindergarten were marginally linked to steeper increases in zBMI from the following semester of kindergarten to 1st grade. This association may become more pronounced as youth reach middle childhood and adolescence, a time when increases in internalizing symptoms occurs (Galambos et al., 2004;Leadbeater et al., 1999;Twenge & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2002), and decreased body satisfaction (Bearman, Presnell, Martinez, & Stice, 2006). Previous research has highlighted racial disparities between Black youth and White youth with regard to BMI and differences in body image. Black youth were more likely to be classified as overweight or obese (Ogden et al., 2014) in risk profiles in which selfconcept is lower and BMIs are higher (Berlin et al., 2015), and both Black males and females were more likely to desire larger body size (Cohane & Pope, 2001;Parker et al., 1995) and not experience significant levels of body dissatisfaction compared with their counterparts of other races (DiGioacchino, Sargent, & Topping, 2001;Yates, Edman, & Aruguete, 2004). As such, internalizing symptoms may be less influenced by BMI scores for Black females and males, as indicated in the present research. In terms of clinical practice, there are many different school-based intervention and prevention programs for children that begin as early as kindergarten. However, as evidenced in the present study, prevention programs may bode well if they also target early depressive and anxious symptoms. Specifically, helping children to effectively cope with these difficulties could potentially aide in increasing age-appropriate weight gain for White males. The present research adds significantly to our understanding of the longitudinal relation between children's adiposity and internalizing symptoms, but the results should be considered in light of a few limitations and expanded on in future research. As noted previously, peer acceptance is important for healthy social and emotional development throughout middle childhood and adolescence (Rubin et al., 2006). Youth that do not fit within normative body size expectations are often victimized by their peers and more likely to experience depression (Adams & Bukowski, 2008;Janssen, Craig, Boyce & Pickett, 2004;Pearce, Boergers, Prinstein, 2002;Storch et al., 2007). Thus, peer victimization might act as an important mechanism moderating the relation between adiposity and internalizing symptoms, and should be considered in future research. Previous research has highlighted an important link between SES and internalizing symptoms (Mendelson, Kubzansky, Datta, & Buka, 2008) as well as BMI (Wang & Beydoun, 2007). Although we did not find SES to change the relation between zBMI and internalizing trajectories across the four groups, a more comprehensive Figure 2.

HIHB \u00bc high internalizing scores (\u00fe1 SD) and high zBMI scores (\u00fe1 SD), HIMB \u00bc high internalizing scores (\u00fe1 SD) and moderate zBMI scores (mean), HILB \u00bc high internalizing scores (\u00fe1 SD) and low zBMI scores (\u00c01 SD), LIHB \u00bc low internalizing scores (\u00c01 SD) and high zBMI scores (\u00fe1 SD), LIMB \u00bc low internalizing scores (\u00c01 SD) and moderate zBMI scores (mean), LILB \u00bc low internalizing scores (\u00c01 SD) and low zBMI scores (\u00c01 SD). investigation of the moderating role of SES will be a critical step in future research. Also, teacher reports were gathered as an assessment of children's internalizing difficulties. Although this method has been used throughout the extant literature documenting children's internalizing problems (e.g., Datar & Sturm, 2006;Keiley, Lofthouse, Bates, Dodge, & Pettit, 2003;Somersalo, Solantaus, & Almqvist, 1999), teachers may not be the best informant of children's internalizing processes. It may be a fruitful avenue to examine children's self-reported difficulties. Finally, analyses in the present study assumed homogenous growth trajectories for all children. It is likely that different subgroups of children exist; exploring this may further highlight critical times for intervention . In sum, the results from the present research suggest that the link between adiposity and internalizing symptoms begin much earlier than adolescence for White males, and that changes in adiposity status are a function of the interactive effect of initial levels of internalizing difficulties and adiposity status. Importantly, the present findings highlight that kindergarten may be an optimal time point for intervention, as difficulties starting here are associated with long-term physical and psychological health-related outcomes.
