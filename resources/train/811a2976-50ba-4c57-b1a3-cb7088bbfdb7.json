[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. Progression of people presenting with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to dementia is not certain and it is not possible for clinicians to predict which people are most likely to convert. The inability of clinicians to predict progression limits the use of MCI as a syndrome for treatment in prevention trials and, as more people present with this syndrome in memory clinics, and as earlier diagnosis is a major goal of health services, this presents an important clinical problem. Some data suggest that CSF biomarkers and functional imaging using PET might act as markers to facilitate prediction of conversion. However, both techniques are costly and not universally available. The objective of our study was to investigate the potential added benefit of combining biomarkers that are more easily obtained in routine clinical practice to predict conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease. To explore this we combined automated regional analysis of structural MRI with analysis of plasma cytokines and chemokines and compared these to measures of APOE genotype and clinical assessment to assess which best predict progression. In a total of 205 people with MCI, 77 of whom subsequently converted to Alzheimer's disease, we find * Correspondence to: Simon Lovestone, King's College London, \nbiochemical markers of inflammation to be better predictors of conversion than APOE genotype or clinical measures (Area under the curve (AUC) 0.65, 0.62, 0.59 respectively). In a subset of subjects who also had MRI scans the combination of serum markers of inflammation and MRI automated imaging analysis provided the best predictor of conversion (AUC 0.78). These results show that the combination of imaging and cytokine biomarkers provides an improvement in prediction of MCI to AD conversion compared to either datatype alone, APOE genotype or clinical data and an accuracy of prediction that would have clinical utility."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The challenge of the neurodegenerative diseases is daunting; it is estimated that the global prevalence of dementia will rise from 24.3 million cases in 2005 to 81.1 million cases in 2040 [1] . Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest form of dementia [2] . Rising to the challenge posed by this health burden, there are many potential disease modification therapies in development with approximately 10 compounds for AD in phase III and more than 50 in phase II [3] . There is a consensus that disease modification therapy is most likely to be efficacious very early in the disease process and because of this there is an increasing drive towards very early identification and diagnosis. Given the inherent difficulty of very early, and even prodromal, diagnosis, biomarkers are likely to play an important role. They are incorporated into the proposed revision of diagnostic criteria [4] for AD and have been increasingly examined for their potential to predict which people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are most likely to progress to full dementia [5] . This is important as only a minority with MCI progress to full dementia in the time frame of a typical clinical trial. A recent meta-analysis showed an annual conversion rate of 8.1% and a cumulative proportion of 33.6% for MCI conversion to AD [6] and in a previous systematic review we found study-related variables including recruitment strategy to be the most important factors predicting conversion [7] .\nThe primary focus in the search for biomarkers for AD to date has been on neuroimaging, and on A\u2424 and tau proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [8, 9] . Various studies using structural MRI have identified brain regions within the medial temporal lobe, particularly the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, as potential biomarkers of conversion from MCI to AD [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In addition molecular imaging using amyloid PET ligands also report efficacy as markers predictive of conversion [15] . CSF is an excellent fluid for biomarker discovery in neurodegeneration as it is in direct contact with the extracellular space of the brain and is therefore supposed to reflect biochemical changes occurring in the brain [16] . Recently Shaw et al. showed in the US Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study that the t-tau/A\u2424 ratio discriminated between those who will remain MCI subjects and those who will convert to AD within one year follow-up [17] . In addition it has been reported that MCI subjects with abnormal results on both FDG-PET and episodic memory were more likely to convert to AD [18] . However, structural MRI is not sufficiently predictive of conversion [14, 19] , PET imaging is a highly specialised approach available in relatively few centres, and lumbar puncture for CSF, although nontraumatic and without side effects in the majority of patients, necessitates a high level of skill and a hospital setting. A blood-based biomarker would be hugely advantageous especially in large-scale population and community based studies of elderly frail people.\nPreviously we and others have demonstrated using proteomics that blood-based biomarkers were feasible and reproducible in independent studies [20] [21] [22] . However, the most impressive evidence for a specific and sensitive marker of MCI conversion to date comes from a study reporting that 18 signalling proteins in blood plasma could be used to predict conversion from MCI to AD 2-6 years later with an accuracy of 91% [23] . However these results have not yet been independently replicated. Recently, O'Bryant et al. developed a serum protein-based classifier for the prediction of AD patients and controls [24] .\nFor the most part, these studies have concentrated on single modality biomarkers although there are theoretical reasons and increasing data from combinatorial studies to think that combining biomarkers might have added benefits [25] [26] [27] [28] . Some studies have combined imaging with clinical variables to try to increase predictive power, with mixed results. One such study found no added benefit of combining structural MRI data with clinical measures [12] whereas another developed a predictor including three clinical predictors (SRT immediate recall, FAQ and UPSIT) as well as two imaging markers (hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume) [29] . Davatzikos et al. recently integrated MRI and CSF biomarkers and noted improved predictive accuracy compared to either individual data type [9] and Ewers et al. investigated the accuracy of MRI and CSF biomarkers and neuropsychological tests for predicting the conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease [30] .\nHowever no study, to our knowledge, has investigated the potential added benefit of combining biomarkers that are readily obtained in routine clinical practice. To explore this we combined automated regional analysis of structural MRI with analysis of serum cytokines and APOE genotype to assess if the combination of data types improved prediction of progression in a small cohort of participants from the AddNeuroMed study, a European ADNI-like biomarker study [31] . In addition, we have examined the predictive accuracy of a cytokine panel in a larger dataset, which includes the AddNeuroMed cohort."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The study population used in this report was derived from the AddNeuroMed study, a European multicentre study, aiming to identify biomarkers for AD [31] and the Alzheimer Research Trust-funded cohort at King's College London (KCL-ART) [32] .

Alone, cytokine levels showed some predictive value for MCI conversion while imaging data showed a modest predictive accuracy. However, the predictive model using combined cytokine levels and imaging measures outperformed either individual classifier (Table 3 and Figure 2 ). The cytokine classifier exhibits low sensitivity and a higher specificity (supplementary table 3) whereas the converse is true of the imaging classifier. When the two data-types are combined the classification accuracy is improved (Table 3 and supplementary table 3 ). Considering that the potential disease modifying therapies are non-hazardous and aim to focus on an early stage of the disease the ideal predictive model would have a high negative predictive value and a high specificity. From a clinical point of view our here introduced model combining imaging and cytokine measures is favorable above combined imaging measures alone, which have been a point of primary interest in the literature so far.\nPrevious studies have looked at a number of brain regions (e.g. volumes of hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, ventricles, and whole brain) as potential biomarkers of conversion from MCI to AD [10, 29, 41] . Devanand et al. integrated the baseline predictors cognitive test performance, informant report of functional impairment, APOE genotype, olfactory identification deficit, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes [29] . Ultimately, they used five variables in a predictor: Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ; informant report of functioning), University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT; olfactory identification), Selective Reminding Test (SRT) immediate recall (verbal memory), MRI hippocampal volume, and MRI entorhinal cortex volume. A recent imaging study, also based upon the AddNeuroMed patient cohort, has analyzed regional MRI volumes and thicknesses as predictors of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD [14] . Analysis of the expanded patient cohort of 103 subjects (22 converters at year one follow up) showed that the bilateral hippocampus and amygdala, and right caudate baseline volumes were significantly smaller in MCI to AD converters compared to stable MCI subjects.\nWe analyzed a subset of 7 of the 18 signaling proteins for MCI conversion identified by an earlier study [23] (see Materials & Methods for details). We trained an SVM using these 7 cytokines and applied the model to a test set resulting in an AUC of 0.60. Our findings suggest that the inflammatory markers identified by Ray et al. may show some differential expression in people with established AD, and we are able to show some prognostic value of these markers for the more demanding, but more clinically important task of predicting MCI conversion.\nSome of the cytokines we have examined have been previously implicated in AD as potential markers. Reports describing IL-1\u2424 levels in serum of AD patients have been conflicting with some groups describing an increase in IL-1\u2424 serum levels in AD patients compared to controls [42, 43] , but others finding no change [44] . A meta analysis also found a genetic association of a IL-1\u2424 polymorphism and AD [45] [46] [47] . It has been hypothesized that proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u2424 are activating a cascade of neurotoxic changes in the brain, that are related with the development of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characteristics in AD [48] . VEGF is associated with neuroprotection and regeneration in the brain. It co-localizes with plaques in AD brain [49] and some studies report an increase in VEGF levels in serum and CSF [50, 51] , whereas others find a decrease in serum [52] and no change in CSF [53] . In the cytokine/imaging cohort the classifier using APOE \u03b54 dosage alone performs better than most other classifiers. It is not surprising that APOE performs well as it is clear that the \u03b54 allele is associated with AD and has previously been associated with the time to progression from MCI to AD [54] . In addition, in this smaller dataset the mean APOE\u03b54 dosage per converting patient is much greater than in converters in the entire cohort (0.77 compared to 0.54 - Table 1 ).\nThere are limitations to our study. Most obviously, the sample size of the cytokine and imaging cohort is relatively small (n = 48), which meant constructing a predictive model with a training set of 31 subjects. When applying our predictors to the set of 17 subjects, although the combination of cytokines outperforms APOE\u03b54 dosage, the increase in performance is mod-est. It is noteworthy that adding clinical information (including basic cognitive tests, diagnosis and medical history but not very detailed neuropsychometry) adds nothing to the predictive power. This emphasises that the clinical assessment of MCI alone does not predict conversion.\nAs such, our predictor would need to be applied to a larger dataset to independently assess its accuracy. Nonetheless, we show preliminary evidence that a combined set of imaging and cytokine measures provides a small improvement in prediction of MCI to AD conversion than either cytokine or imaging data alone. It remains to be seen whether the accuracy reported here may be improved still further by the addition of other biomarkers or by alternative MRI analytical routines. As the prediction in this case was over only one year after test these data hold out the promise of a combinatorial biomarker for use in both clinical practice and, perhaps more pressingly, for patient stratification and enrichment in trials of disease modification agents.
