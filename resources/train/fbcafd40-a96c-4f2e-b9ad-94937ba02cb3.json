In a second step it uses an atlas of predefined regions of interest in that template space to extract regional brain volumes [15] . The method has already been applied to neurodegenerative diseases in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, demonstrating its sensitivity to detect volume changes within 6 month intervals [11, 12, 14, 17] .\nObviously, volumetric accuracy depends critically on registration performance: the more precisely the registration in the template space matches individual anatomy the more accurate volumetric results are obtained [18] . To enhance registration accuracy highdimensional diffeomorphic image registration approaches, such as diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) [2] , have been proposed. DARTEL is part of the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac. uk/spm) and is a highly elastic registration method resulting in a more precise registration which has been confirmed in numerous studies [7, 22, 25, 30] .\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging 34 (2016) [455] [456] [457] [458] [459] [460] [461] In the past, inter-and intrascanner variability of ABV was studied by Huppertz and co-workers [15] who deployed the unified segmentation algorithm [3] of SPM5 for normalization. MRI data from a single healthy volunteer scanned three times on six different scanners were used to calculate the variability of volumetric results for a number of GM and WM regions. Furthermore, Eggert and coworkers [8] investigated the reliability of whole brain GM segmentation deploying five current automated segmentation pipelines using a larger public database of real images from a single scanner. The present study extends this previous work and provides a comprehensive assessment of intrascanner variability of ABV for whole brain and tissue compartments (GM, WM) as well as cortical and subcortical brain structures using DARTEL. In contrast to the study of Huppertz et al. [15] the assessment is based not only on one single healthy volunteer but on 78 subjects comprising cognitively normal subjects as well as patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). As opposed to Eggert et al. we assessed the variability of volumetric results not only for GM but also for WM and various subregions. The results of this study help to distinguish volume changes due to biological or physiological effects from inherent noise of the methodology and are an important basis for future clinical studies using SPM and DARTEL algorithms for atlas-based MRI volumetry."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": "MRI data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

The data have been acquired at different imaging centers (ADNI study centers) using diverse MR scanners. Prior to study initiation acquisition protocols were harmonized to achieve a similar image quality (contrast-tonoise, spatial resolution, resistance to artifact, speed, etc.) across scanner platforms [16] . While acquisition parameters, such as echo time, repetition time, inversion time etc. varied depending on the scanner type, all images have slice thickness of 1.2 mm in common. The in-plane resolution was slightly higher (average 1.0 mm, range 0.94-1.30 mm).

Only one of the AD patients (ADNI subject 133_S_1170) had to be excluded from our study (in comparison to the cohort investigated in Wolz et al.) because the field of view did not cover the whole skull in one of the 4 scans provided by ADNI.

For segmentation of the brain into GM, WM and CSF components we used the unified segmentation engine of SPM12 with default parameters, except that the image data were sampled every 2 mm instead of the default 3 mm as proposed by Herron and coworkers [13] . Normalization of brains to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space was performed using diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL), a high-dimensional elastic image registration technique [2] . GM and WM component images in native space resulting from unified segmentation were used as an input to the DARTEL process. We ran DARTEL with default parameters and 'with existing templates'. Targets for normalization were the IXI555 templates provided in the VBM12 toolbox by C. Gaser (http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm) which are already in MNI template space. The normalized component images were 'modulated' in order to preserve the overall volume. In previous SPM releases this meant that the determinant of the Jacobian of the transformation field was locally applied in order to preserve the volume. In the new SPM12 release, however, the warped data are not scaled by the Jacobian determinants when generating the 'modulated' data. Instead, the original voxels are projected into their new location in the warped images. This exactly preserves the tissue count, but has the effect of introducing aliasing artifacts (such as ripples and even holes where voxel values in the original native image are missing), especially if the original data are at a lower resolution than the warped images (cf. SPM12 manual, page 46). To circumvent this problem of aliasing artifacts the component images in native space were rescaled to 0.5 mm voxel resolution before normalization to MNI space."}, {"section_title": "Atlas based volumetry", "text": "Volumetric measures of intracranial compartments and brain structures were derived from the normalized and modulated component images processed with DARTEL. Volumetric measures of brain structures were calculated by a voxel-by-voxel multiplication and subsequent integration of normalized and modulated component images (GM, WM or CSF) with predefined binary masks from different brain atlases. Binary masks for the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobe were derived from a cerebral lobe atlas defined in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space and published by Fonov et al. [10] . For the hippocampus, which comprises cornus ammonis, fascia dentata and subiculum substructures as defined by Amunts et al. [1] , a binary mask was taken from a freely available toolbox [9] . Binary masks for the caudate nucleus and putamen were derived from the LPBA40 atlas [28] . The thalamus mask and the mask for lateral ventricles were taken from wfu pickatlas [20] . A 30% margin was added to the lateral ventricle masks to accommodate the wide variety of ventricle sizes. The corpus callosum mask was composed of binary masks from subregions, i.e. genu, body and splenium, which were taken from the ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas [24, 27] . All masks were interpolated to a 1.5 mm isotropic resolution, which matches the resolution of the modulated and normalized component images. Lobar volumes were calculated for both GM and WM. For the caudate nucleus and hippocampus only GM partial volumes were estimated. Similarly for corpus callosum only the WM volume was assessed.

The only outlier, but still with a median percentage volume difference below 2% was the occipital WM (cf. Table 2 ) which is the smallest of the investigated lobar structures and thus perhaps more prone to be affected by the intrinsic measurement variability. Overall, these results indicate a favorable reliability of ABV for repeated MRI measurements on the same scanner. -The median interscanner variability was up to 10 times higher than the intrascanner variability. This confirms results from previous studies that automatic volumetry highly depends on the scanner platform [19] .\nIntrascanner variability was independent of magnetic field strength. However, in AD patients, intrascanner variability was generally higher than in normal subjects. While this difference was relatively small for median values, it became most obvious for the 95th percentile, which more than doubled in AD patients for about half of the investigated structures ( Table 2 ). This indicates that outliers were responsible for the increased intrascanner variability. These outliers are most probably the result of motion artifacts in MR images, a hypothesis which is supported when visually inspecting MR images of AD patients with especially high intrascanner variability. Fig. 3 shows example images of two AD patients in whom movement artifacts in one of the scans were accompanied by increased variability of volumetric results between scans. AD patients but also patients with other neurological diseases may be less capable than normal subjects of lying still during the acquisition process. It does not come as a surprise that this can negatively affect intrascanner variability of volumetric measurements.

Table 2 summarizes the intrascanner variability for ABV methods. The table may help users to estimate the minimum absolute percentage volume difference between two MRI scans of the same subject necessary to detect a significant volume change beyond the level of intrinsic measurement variability. For example, a hippocampal volume change of more than 5.41% between two MRI scans using the same scanner can be regarded as significant with an error probability of 5% (cf. last column of Table 2 , i.e. the 95th percentiles of AD patients)."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with other methods and studies", "text": "Smith et al. [29] assessed intrascanner variability of BP volume for a fully automated method (called SIENA) of longitudinal change analysis. SIENA is frequently being used in multiple sclerosis drug trials and is considered as a gold standard in assessing longitudinal BP volume changes [26] . A median absolute error of 0.2% has been reported in this paper which compares well to the median absolute percentage volume difference in our analysis (0.24%) ( Table 2 ).\nIn the study by Cover and coworkers [6] ADNI data were used to assess intrascanner variability of SIENAX which is the cross-sectional version of the SIENA. The authors reported a median error of 0.92% (for healthy subjects), which is almost four times as high as suggested by the results of our study (0.24%).\nEggert and coworkers [8] systematically explored intrascanner variability of GM for 5 different segmentation engines. They evaluated a total of 20 scans from 10 healthy subjects as provided by the publicly available OASIS database [21] . Each subject was scanned twice within 12 days. They calculated 0.6% mean volume difference for GM for \"new segment\" which is part of SPM8 and which became the standard segmentation procedure under SPM12 (deployed in our paper). This value is in quantitative agreement with our results (0.52%) ( Table 2 ).\nIn the study of Wolz et al. [31] the intrascanner variability of an automated hippocampus volumetry method (LEAP algorithm) was investigated in the same ADNI data that were used in the present study. The median percentage volume differences of the scan pairs compare to our results (for the hippocampus) as follows: AD patients at 1.5 and 3 T: 1.56% and 1.06%, respectively (LEAP) vs. 1.04% and 1.01%, respectively (ABV); 75th percentile 2.75% and 2.38% (LEAP) vs. 1.83% and 1.88%, respectively (ABV). Cognitively normal subjects at 1.5 and 3 T: 0.93% and 0.89%, respectively (LEAP) vs. 0.66% and 0.86%, respectively (ABV); 75th percentile 1.91% and 1.97% (LEAP) vs. 1.28% and 1.60%, respectively (ABV). Overall, hippocampus volumetry using ABV seems to have slightly lower intrascanner variability than LEAP.\nIf a patient receives a follow-up scan and a certain brain volume loss is measured it is necessary to distinguish between true biological/pathological volume changes and changes due to the intrinsic variability of the methodology applied. The intrascanner variability can be influenced by several factors, such as effects of scanner and image quality, individual brain anatomy, or the ability of a patient to lie still during image acquisition. For a specific patient and a specific scanner the intrascanner variability is unknown. However, since the ADNI data were acquired in many different centers with different scanners and comprises data of many healthy subjects as well as patients, the range of intrascanner variabilities given in Table 2 can be regarded as an estimate of intrascanner variabilities occurring in clinical routine. If the ABV method proposed in this study is deployed, the results of Table 2 , as indicated above, can help to assess volume changes beyond noise levels at single subject level. The 95th percentiles in this table can be regarded as the minimum absolute percentage volume difference between two MRI scans necessary to assume a significant volume change with an error probability of 5%. Based on the 95th percentiles of AD patients, volume changes from 2.4% (for GM) up to 10.6% (for caudate nucleus) would be required, with a median of 4.3% for all brain structures. Naturally, these thresholds would decrease for group studies, depending on the sample size. However, using the 95th percentiles determined in the AD patients of this study might also be too conservative considering that apparently MRIs with movement artifacts have not been excluded from the ADNI database ( Fig. 3 ). We deliberately chose to use all available data of AD patients but with a stricter quality control the thresholds for significance could be even lower. Furthermore, for patients with expectably lesser degree of brain atrophy (e.g. patients with multiple sclerosis) it might be appropriate to refer to the 95th percentiles of cognitively normal subjects in this study. The thresholds for significance would then range between 1.3% and 4.3% (again for BP and caudate nucleus, respectively), with a median of 2.3%. It should be noted that (except for the caudate nucleus in AD patients) all thresholds for significance are in the one-digit percentage range. For most structures the thresholds are even below 5% which is in the range of the typical annual volume loss expected in AD patients [4] . These appear to be very favorable results, especially when considering that these thresholds are valid at a single patient level which renders them useful in clinical routine. In addition, the underlying volume changes are hardly discernable by pure visual inspection of MR images."}, {"section_title": "Methodological considerations and limitations", "text": "The calculation of intrascanner variabilities in this study was based on scans acquired back-to-back during a single imaging session. However, variabilities may increase with repeated sessions due to changes in subject positioning, differences in pre-scan and shim settings, and magnetic field drift. Morey et al., e.g., showed that the reliability of volume measures for an interscan interval of 1 h was higher than for an interval of 1 week [23] . The potential influence of these additional sources of variability could not be assessed in this study. Thus, our results may underrate the scanrescan variability of scans acquired in different sessions.\nIt should be noted that without \"ground truth\" for volumetric measures, this study was not intended to investigate the anatomical accuracy of ABV. However, the accuracy of DARTEL has already been shown in numerous studies [7, 22, 25, 30] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The results of this study indicate that fully-automated ABV deploying high-dimensional image registration techniques with a large number of degrees of freedom, such as DARTEL in SPM12, promising improved anatomical accuracy, is robust with regard to intrascanner variability and hence suitable to be included into future clinical applications. Median absolute percentage volume differences of less than 1% between scans and rescans using the same scanner were determined for the majority of investigated structures, with higher values in AD patients as compared to normal subjects. Intrascanner variability did not depend on magnetic field strength. As a consequence the minimum absolute percentage volume changes detectable for an error probability of 5% by ABV in a single subject measured repeatedly using the same MR scanner are in the one-digit percentage range for almost all structures, for most of them even below 5%. The interscanner variability was up to ten times higher than the intrascanner variability and therefore, longitudinal volume changes can only be assessed when baseline and follow-up are acquired on the same scanner.
