[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Statistical Programs of the United States Government: Fiscal Year 2011 outlines the funding proposed for Federal statistical activities in the President's budget. The budget requests an estimated $6,827.5 million for statistical work to be carried out in FY 2011. Excluding cyclical funding for the Decennial Census ($739.2 million), 40 percent of this overall funding provides resources for 13 agencies that have statistical activities as their principal mission. The remaining funding is spread among more than 80 other agencies that carry out statistical activities in conjunction with other program missions, such as providing services or enforcing regulations. The information in this report covers Federal agencies (inclusive of organizational units that in official nomenclature are institutes, centers, services, and offices) that have annual budgets of $500,000 or more for statistical activities. This information was obtained from materials supplied to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during the budget process, with the agencies providing additional details about their reimbursements for statistical activities and their purchases of statistical services. Agencies that perform statistical activities in support of nonstatistical missions and programs supplied additional budget detail for this report. This report fulfills a responsibility of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Section 3504(e)(2) of Title 44, United States Code) to prepare an annual report on statistical program funding. The report has three chapters. Chapter 1 outlines the effects of Congressional action on the President's FY 2010 budget request and the funding for statistics proposed in the President's FY 2011 budget. Chapter 2 highlights program changes for Federal statistical activities proposed in the President's FY 2011 budget. Chapter 3 describes a number of ongoing and new agency and interagency initiatives to improve Federal statistical programs, including the development and periodic revision of statistical standards and guidelines, various collaborations among the statistical agencies, and selected plans to improve the quality and usefulness of the Nation's statistical products. In addition to budgetary resources data, the appendices include information on staffing levels for the principal statistical agencies. The report is available in both electronic form and a limited number of hard copies. The electronic version can be accessed on the Internet through the OMB web site: www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy/. The report is also located at the one-stop shopping site for Federal statistical data: www.fedstats.gov/ (go to \"Federal Statistical Policy\"). At both sites users may also access the FY 1997 to FY 2010 versions of the Statistical Programs report. Please direct any inquiries to Katherine K.

It highlights the effects of Congressional action on the President's FY 2010 budget request for Federal statistical activities and outlines recommended changes in funding for these programs for FY 2011. The chapter also includes information about statistical work performed by agencies on a reimbursable basis and about agency purchases of statistical services and products. The budget information for FY 2011 is from the President's budget as submitted to the Congress and does not reflect actual appropriations."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Statistical Program Budgets", "text": "Please keep the following in mind when reviewing the information in this report: \u2022 Not all Federal spending on statistical activities is included. The report covers agencies that have direct funding for statistical activities of at least $500,000 in FY 2009, or estimated direct funding for statistical activities of at least $500,000 in either FY 2010 or FY 2011. Using these criteria, the report includes the budgets for statistical programs and activities for over 90 agencies (inclusive of organizational units that in official nomenclature are institutes, centers, services, and offices). \u2022 Changes in an agency's funding for statistical activities can affect which surveys an agency maintains in its portfolio; the breadth of topics and the sample size of a particular survey; and the accuracy and precision of statistical aggregates estimated from data. \u2022 Funding for statistical activities may increase or decrease as a result of the cyclical nature of surveys. Such increases or decreases should not be interpreted as changes in agency priorities, but rather as the normal consequences of the nature of the programs. Agencies also experience increases or decreases in their budgets because they conduct one-time surveys or studies in a particular fiscal year. \u2022 Statistical activities are defined to include the following: collection, processing, or tabulation of statistical data for publication, dissemination, research, analysis, or program management and evaluation; planning of statistical surveys and studies, including project design, sample design and selection, and design of questionnaires, forms, or other techniques of observation and data collection; training of statisticians, interviewers, or data processing personnel; publication or dissemination of statistical data and studies; methodological testing or statistical research; data analysis; forecasts or projections that are published or otherwise made available for government-wide or public use; statistical tabulation, dissemination, or publication of data collected by others; construction of secondary data series or development of models that are an integral part of generating statistical series or forecasts; management or coordination of statistical operations; and statistical consulting. \u2022 Major statistical programs differ in organizational structure and in the means by which they are funded. Thirteen agencies are deemed to be principal statistical agencies whose activities are predominately the collection, compilation, processing or analysis of information for statistical purposes. For most of the principal statistical agencies, funding appears as a line item in the President's budget. Some major statistical programs, such as labor force statistics and energy statistics, are carried out by principal statistical agencies (the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Energy Information Administration, respectively). In other cases, agencies have statistical programs that support their program planning and evaluation functions or that are an outgrowth of their administrative responsibilities. In these cases, the budget for statistical activities is included in the total appropriation for that agency, including an allocation of the salaries and operating expenses for the statistical program. In addition, a statistical program is not always executed by the agency that sponsors it. In these instances, the work is done on a reimbursable basis by another Federal agency or by a state or local government or a private organization under contract. \u2022 Whether statistical work is done inside or outside the agency, the direct funding reflects the level of statistical activities in support of the agency's mission. Table 1 presents direct program funding for FY 2009, FY 2010, and FY 2011 for major statistical programs, by department and agency. \u2022 OMB recognizes that its definition of statistical activity is broad and has been interpreted differently among agencies that have provided information on statistical activities. Some have interpreted the scope of statistical activity narrowly to include only traditional surveys and census statistics. Others have interpreted the definition more broadly to include statistical methods that are used in the collection and analysis of scientific studies and experiments. For FY 2011, OMB asked agencies to continue to report essentially as they have in the past. In the coming year, prior to the collection of information for the FY 2012 report, OMB will further investigate how agencies interpret the definition of statistical activities and develop improved guidance on what should be included in reports of statistical activities.

Fifty million dollars of this difference was due to a Congressional reduction to account for lower mileage reimbursement rates than originally budgeted for decennial census operations (the budget for those reimbursements occurred at the height of the fuel price spikes two years ago). The remainder resulted from a reduction of $100.0 million to budget authority. Funding includes $6,751.1 million for the 2010 Decennial Census Program. In addition, nearly $900 million for decennial census activities is available from planned carryover funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This funding allows the Census Bureau to conduct the enumeration of the population. Specifically, the Census Bureau is conducting major 2010 Census operations, which include: mailout, receipt, processing of returned census forms; the Nonresponse Follow-Up operation whereby households not returning a census form are contacted by census enumerators who collect the information; and numerous other operations to cover specialized populations such as the military and U.S. territory populations. These operations are supported by an extensive partnership and communications effort. Additionally, funds provided by the FY 2010 appropriation support a Local Employment Dynamics initiative, building on internal and external investments in the Census Bureau's innovative pilot program demonstrating the power of linked longitudinal business/employee data sets. The FY 2010 appropriation also supports dissemination of data from the 2007 Economic Census and planning efforts for the 2012 Economic Census and 2012 Census of Governments.

To successfully redesign the NCVS and put it back on a sound methodological and fiscal footing, BJS must resolve many complex statistical issues including investigating methods for producing subnational estimates of criminal victimization while also improving the precision of national estimates; develop and implement an ongoing prisoner reentry and recidivism statistics program that would include: monitoring ex-prisoner employment outcomes and linking these data to criminal history records; analyzing jail reentry issues focusing on offenders with special mental health or medical needs; and implementing automated processes to analyze criminal history records in order to conduct ongoing reentry and recidivism studies; initiate new data collection programs in Indian country, as the first dedicated Federal efforts to collect data specific to Indian country and tribes, including activities of tribal, state, and Federal judicial agencies in order to support the design and development of effective crime prevention programs. Specifically, BJS plans conduct a feasibility study in Indian country to obtain data from: tribal jails; tribal justice agencies' law enforcement; prosecution and adjudication; and a limited victimization study in Indian country; undertake new data collection on indigent defense services by contract attorneys and assigned counsel, in order to provide more complete BJS national-level estimates of public defense services in light of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that states are required to provide counsel to all indigents accused of a crime in their jurisdictions; and begin a new national statistical program to measure the impact, causes, and characteristics of childhood exposure to violence. Data from this program would support policymaking for the Attorney General's initiative aimed at decreasing the prevalence of childhood exposure to violence and improving the life outcomes for children who have been exposed to violence or victimized. \u2022 The NIJ budget request supports expansion of the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program to better inform policy decisions about evolving trends in the types of drugs used by offenders and their relationship to the crimes being committed by continuing the core 10-city program, adding additional cities, developing more efficient automated survey methods and sample designs, including female arrestees, and updating the collection and analysis techniques."}, {"section_title": "Education Statistics", "text": "The Educational Policy and Data Center in the Agency for International Development (AID) provides access to data, tools for data presentation and analysis, and policy-relevant research and support for developing countries.

The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in USDA collects, summarizes, analyzes, and publishes agricultural production and marketing data on a wide range of items including number of farms and land in farms; acreage, yield, production, and stocks of grains, hay, oilseeds, cotton, potatoes, tobacco, fruits, selected vegetables, floriculture, and selected specialty crops; inventories and production of hogs, cattle, sheep and wool, goats and mohair, mink, catfish, trout, poultry, eggs, and dairy products; prices received by farmers for products, prices paid for commodities and services, and related indexes; cold storage supplies; agricultural chemical use; and related areas of the agricultural economy. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) in USDA conducts actuarial analysis for Federal crop insurance programs. Major program changes and new activities in agriculture statistics planned for FY 2011 are: \u2022 ERS plans to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of ERS data at separate secure sites with the ability to control and monitor access as ERS physically relocates from its current location as part of USDA's consolidation of seven existing leases. \u2022 The budget request for NASS includes plans to: improve the quality of county estimates covering most agricultural commodities as well as economic, environmental, and rural demographic data that are used to administer billions of dollars for crop insurance programs, crop revenue support programs, emergency assistance payments, and the Conservation Reserve Program; enhance remote sensing capacity by increasing the number of states in which cropland data are collected as well as collecting additional data on crop and soil moisture conditions and drought monitoring. The development of a web accessible geospatial tool for crop progress and condition data will aid economic and policy analysis to help agriculture mitigate and adapt to climate change; develop an ongoing data series on organic agricultural production, handling, and distribution to monitor the financial health and continued growth and evolution of this vital sector; and eliminate the Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land survey, the Census of Aquaculture, and the July sheep and goats estimate in order to reallocate $5.1 million towards support of higher priority goals.

The members of the ICSP currently include the heads of the principal statistical agencies, as described in Chapter 1 of this report, plus the head of the statistical unit at the Environmental Protection Agency. Because the members have management responsibility for statistical programs in their respective agencies, their advice and cooperation are essential for effective implementation of OMB statistical policy decisions and for planning improvements in Federal statistical programs. The ICSP is a vehicle for coordinating statistical work, particularly when activities and issues cut across agencies; for exchanging information about agency programs and activities; and for providing advice and counsel to OMB on statistical matters. In the past year, agenda topics included, among others, collaborating on the identification of highest priority statistical program improvements, including cross-cutting initiatives such as a \"Statistical Community of Practice\" for the statistical agencies to pursue; exploring opportunities to reinforce the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on National Statistics' Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency; fostering innovative practices in statistical agencies and contributing to the design of a NAS workshop on this topic; developing views on improving implementation of the Paperwork Reduction Act; providing direction to the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology's subcommittees on privacy and administrative records; continuing the successful \"funding opportunity\" in survey and statistical research and recommending improvements in the programs and services of the Joint Program in Survey Methodology; furthering the role of the statistical agencies in the \"State of the U.S.A.\" (Key National Indicators) Initiative; exploring opportunities for cooperation and collaboration with the American Statistical Association; fostering the usabil-ity of Federal statistics; and facilitating the participation of the statistical agencies in the Administration's Data.gov initiative.

It can also increase information security by pooling scarce personnel skills and IT resources across the participating statistical agencies. To begin to realize this vision, the President's FY 2011 budget proposes an initiative for the Economic Research Service to serve as the Program Management Office for a Statistical Community of Practice (SCOP, pronounced SCOPE). Statistical agencies would participate in this systemwide initiative on a voluntary basis. The program management office would coordinate system-wide projects on standards, practices, policies, and protocols concerning targeted barriers and inconsistencies that now exist across agencies.

The legislation reaffirms that pledges of confidentiality will be honored and gives additional weight and stature to policies that statistical agencies have pursued for decades, assuring respondents who provide statistical information that their responses will be held in confidence and will not be used against them in any government action. CIPSEA also authorizes the sharing of business data among the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the Census Bureau. Thus, it provides a framework to enhance the efficiency of the Federal statistical system by reducing reporting burden on the public and strengthening the quality and usefulness of the Nation's Federal statistics. A companion legislative proposal would make complementary changes to provisions set forth in the \"Statistical Use\" section of the Internal Revenue Code. These changes would represent the first major revision of these policies in more than 20 years, reducing the amount of sensitive tax information that will change hands to support statistical programs while substantially increasing the effectiveness of that support. A legislative proposal to accomplish these aims was developed by BEA, BLS, and the Census Bureau in collaboration with OMB's Statistical and Science Policy Office; endorsed by the Treasury Department; and submitted to the Congress. To assist agencies in implementing the confidentiality provisions of CIPSEA, OMB issued implementation guidance in the Federal Register on June 15, 2007. The guidance is available on OMB's web site at www. whitehouse.gov/omb (go to \"Statistical Programs and Standards\"). BEA, BLS, and the Census Bureau are currently working to imple ment the data sharing provisions of CIPSEA. These agencies are re quired to enter into a written agreement before sharing any business data. The written agreement must specify the business data to be shared; the statistical purposes for which the business data are to be used; the officers, employees, and agents authorized to examine the business data to be shared; and the appropriate security procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of the business data. BLS and BEA are continuing to collaborate on the development of experimental inter-area price indexes. At present there are no officially published statistics that permit com parison of price levels across geographic areas. The project will en able both agencies to assess the feasibility of calculating inter-area price measures using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, and will assist BEA in developing some experimental real personal income measures for select metropolitan areas. In addition, BLS and BEA continue to collaborate to share information (as authorized under CIPSEA and the International Trade and Services Survey Act) from the BLS business list and various BLS establishment-level surveys (including Mass Layoff Statistics and Occupational Employment Statistics survey data) and informa tion from BEA's surveys of foreign-owned companies in the United States, U.S. owned companies abroad, and U.S. international trade in services. The linking project has provided some useful preliminary statistics and analysis of services off shoring that were described in a Congressionally-mandated report on off shoring by the National Academy of Public Administration. Currently, the linked data are being used in exploratory joint research on the geographic, occupational, and wage structures of U.S. multinational companies within the United States. BLS also continues to provide to BEA Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages data for use in developing the wage and sal ary component of the National Personal Income and Gross Domestic Product statistics, as well as access to a file that includes all employment, mean wages, percentile wages, and wage ranges for all major occupational groups by industry and state that BEA is using to improve the accuracy of its estimates of employer contributions to Social Security. The Census Bureau and BLS have completed research comparing their business establishment lists, and the Census Bureau and BLS continue to collaborate on a North American Industry Classification System code matching project in which BLS supplies a business's classification to the Census Bureau when the Census Bureau does not have a classification in its list. The Census Bureau continues to share monthly net export files and names and addresses from the annual survey of exporters and commodities with BLS. BLS will use these files to assemble sampling frames for its export price index series. The Cen sus Bureau also shares with BLS natural gas import files for use by BLS to assemble sampling frames for its import price survey.

Such data are often precisely those that are difficult to collect accurately and affordably, or with acceptable respondent burden, via sample surveys. Their use can increase the quality, coverage, or analytical texture of statistical data series. In 2007, the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology established an interagency subcommittee to identify opportunities for using administrative data and to address barriers to their use. The group documented a series of barriers-statistical agency access, inadequate agency infrastructure, underdeveloped methods to measure and ensure data quality, and researcher access to data-that until now have limited statistical use of administrative records. To help address these, the subcommittee has developed a model agreement for data sharing, is developing model informed consent materials, and continues to identify ways to better document and standardize the measurement of administrative and linked data quality. Yet those efforts alone will not be sufficient to fully address the identified barriers. To complement these efforts, the President's budget for FY 2011 includes funding for a system-wide initiative to advance the statistical uses of administrative data. The initiative comprises a series of three pilot projects designed to address barriers systematically. The goal of the first pilot project is to simulate the 2010 Census using administrative records, in order to thoroughly examine and document the coverage and quality of major administrative records data sets, while also building an infrastructure sufficient to support research on potential administrative records applications for the 2020 census and other household surveys. The second pilot, which is designed to benefit from the same infrastructure, will facilitate more efficient and higher quality record linkage among health surveys and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrative data than can be achieved by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) alone. Such enhanced linkages will help NCHS better address many substantive health policy questions such as whether rising obesity rates would increase Medicare and Medicaid program expenditures; suggest strategies for improving management of patients with multiple chronic conditions (e.g., asthma and diabetes); and facilitate analysis of comparative effectiveness of treatments for a wide variety of conditions, including mental health conditions in children and populations of special interest including disabled persons. The second pilot also will build new knowledge about the quality of linked data files and methods to facilitate appropriate researcher access to resulting data files. The third pilot will acquire and use state-level data to understand how nutrition assistance and other government assistance programs work together to provide a social safety net and a better assessment of how such programs work together with health care policy to improve dietary and health outcomes.

Ongoing support for the ACS allowed the Census Bureau to publish detailed social and economic data every year for all households in places with a population of 65,000 or more starting in summer 2006. Group quarters data and data from the Puerto Rico Community Survey, first gathered in 2006, became available in summer 2007. Year-to-year changes were available beginning in 2008 (for differences between 2006 and 2007) and every year thereafter. In 2008, three-year period estimates were released covering 2005 to 2007 for all places of size 20,000 or more. These three-year estimates will be updated every year. After five years of data collection, beginning in fall 2010 and continuing every year thereafter, accumulated data will be available to make annual estimates for all places and tracts (small statistical subdivisions of counties or county equivalents). The 2011 data release will be the first to include five-year accumulations of both housing unit and group quarters data for every year in the release and, therefore, will produce information comparable in content and reliability to the decennial long-form data. The President's FY 2011 budget includes an initiative to increase the ACS sample to 3.5 million households to improve the reliability of the ACS estimates at the tract level. The increase will also allow the Census Bureau to enhance field and telephone center data collection, conduct a 100 percent nonresponse follow-up operation in Remote Alaska and small American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Homeland areas, and provide additional resources for the full review of 3-year and 5-year data.

The GSS initiative builds on the accomplishments of this decade's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geocoding and Referencing System (MAF/ TIGER) Enhancement Program, which redesigned the MAF/TIGER database, improved the positional accuracy of TIGER spatial features, and emphasized quality measurement. The GSS initiative is an integrated program of improved address coverage, continual spatial feature updates, and enhanced quality assessment and measurement that all contribute to MAF improvement. Continual updates throughout the decade will provide improved address coverage and feature updates for the ACS sample and other Census Bureau surveys throughout the decade. These efforts are expected to lead to increased efficiency of field staff work for ongoing surveys, as well as improved data collection and data dissemination programs.

For the output approach, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program will sample from a wide set of industries that directly produce green goods and services. Also, the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program will complement the data from the QCEW industry survey by collecting information on occupational staffing patterns and wages in establishments that produce green goods and services. For the process approach, the OES program will develop a special employer survey to test the feasibility of collecting data on jobs associated with the use of environmentally friendly production processes. This survey will identify whether an establishment uses any such processes, and whether it employs any workers whose primary duties are related to those processes, and collect information on the number, and occupations and wages, of these workers.

In FY 2011, BLS will begin data collection in the QCEW program to produce industry and geographic level estimates of the total number of green jobs, with publication to begin in FY 2012. Also in FY 2011, the OES program will supplement its sample to collect information on occupational staffing patterns and wages at establishments producing green goods and services. The OES program also will field the first special employer survey to collect information on the occupations of workers involved in environmentally friendly production processes."}, {"section_title": "Measuring the Service and Construction Sectors", "text": "Improved measurement of services enhances the relevance, accuracy, and timeliness of key Federal economic statistics such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), prices, and productivity while augmenting coverage of the services sector. It also leverages strategic alliances among the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, the Economics and Statistics Administration, and the Federal Reserve Board to improve the quality of Federal economic statistics. Several programs of the Census Bureau profile service industries and continue to expand their coverage. For nonfarm businesses with employees, the Economic Census collects information on employment, payroll, revenues, and products. The 2007 Economic Census collected several new measures of the economy, including information on employers' contributions for pension plans and health insurance, measures of franchise operations for almost 300 industries and detailed information on more than 2,000 products of service industries. For the 2012 Economic Census, plans are being made for the collection of North American Product Classification System-based products for wholesale trade, retail trade, and manufacturing industries. The Service Annual Survey (SAS) provides full coverage for all service sectors, matching the coverage of the Economic Census and accounting for 55 percent of GDP. In addition to revenue estimates, the 2009 SAS provides data on exported services for about 50 service industries. The Quarterly Services Survey (QSS) continues to expand coverage to new sectors. When fully implemented in FY 2011, the multiyear initiative will increase coverage of the QSS to fully cover all service sectors of the economy, matching the coverage of the SAS and the Economic Census. The Quarterly Financial Report, which collects aggregate statistics on the financial results and position of U.S. corporations, began collecting data for selected service industries in FY 2009. This collection was piloted beginning with data for the fourth quarter 2009 and covered industries within the information sector, and professional, scientific, and technical services sector, excluding legal services."}, {"section_title": "Improving Foreign Trade Statistics", "text": "Official U.S. import and export statistics record the physical movement of merchandise between the United States and foreign countries. Foreign trade statistics face two challenges-their timeliness and the coverage of exports. Many nations now release their monthly trade numbers before the United States. In addition, for a number of reasons largely related to changing trade practices, the statistics on exports of goods understate the value of the exports in the range of three to seven percent. Correction of this shortfall needs to be addressed as efforts proceed to improve the timeliness of trade statistics. The Census Bureau published new Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations during 2008. These regulations mandate export filing through the Automated Export System. Beginning in February 2009, the Census Bureau modified the way in which transaction level export statistics are processed. Over a period of two years, each aspect of the export process was examined and many significant improvements were made. These changes mark a significant improvement in the quality of export data released by the Census Bureau. Based on the Census Bureau's efforts, errors in the prior processing system were identified and resolved, thousands of data corrections that were previously unused will now be applied, and the efficiency of the export processing system has been vastly improved. An examination of the import processing system is underway."}, {"section_title": "Measuring Consumer Spending in the 21st Century", "text": "The Consumer Expenditure (CE) survey measures consumer spending of the general population of the United States. The primary mission of the survey is to update the relative weights of goods and services for the Consumer Price Index (CPI). CE data also are used by a wide variety of policy analysts, government agencies, and researchers who are interested in studying the economic well-being of Americans, as well as measurable outcomes of government policies. The CE survey faces numerous challenges in the data collection environment, leading to difficulties in respondent recall and reporting, such as: a significant increase in the number of competing surveys, less willingness on the part of households to respond to the survey, and the expansion of online shopping and automatic bill paying. Furthermore, the original CE survey was designed in the late 1970s as a paper and pencil survey collected in person, and since that time, the overall design and structure of the questionnaire have remained essentially the same. The combination of these challenges has led to concerns about the accuracy of the weights used in the CPI, as well as concerns about the underestimation of CE data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is proposing to modernize the CE survey. On a continuing basis, the CE survey redesign will research and incorporate multiple data collection modes to take advantage of new technologies, use new sample and statistical modeling methods to increase cost effectiveness, and assess the feasibility of implementing further improvements. Additionally, the CE survey sample size will be increased by eight percent through the introduction of additional geographic areas. In FY 2011, BLS plans to begin the modernization effort. As part of the initial activities, by FY 2013 BLS will improve the use of group-targeted skip questions to reduce interview length and pilot test individual household member diaries to improve data accuracy. In addition, the redesign will assess ways to reduce or eliminate the overlap of expenditure categories between the CE Interview and Diary Surveys to reduce respondent burden."}, {"section_title": "Updating and Augmenting the Consumer Price Index", "text": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the principal source of information concerning trends in consumer prices and inflation in the United States. Both the private and public sectors use this measure extensively for economic analysis and policy formulation as well as to adjust contract values between individuals and organizations. The CPI also has a significant impact on the finances of the Federal Government because it is used to adjust payments to Social Security recipients, to civilian and military retirees, and for a number of entitlement programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) and school lunches. In addition, the CPI is used to adjust individual income tax brackets and other tax parameters for changes due to inflation. In FY 2011, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will continue to transition to the new design for the housing sample used for the Rent and Owner's Equivalent Rent indexes that comprise almost 31 percent of the CPI. Also, in FY 2011, the official published CPI will incorporate the first of the augmented units in the estimation of the Rent and Owner's Equivalent Rent indexes. The introduction of these augmented units represents the first step in transitioning to a continuously updated housing sample, previously updated only periodically. In FY 2011, BLS proposes to increase the number of CPI commodity and services price quotes collected by 50 percent. BLS will identify the item areas where adding sample to the CPI will have the greatest impact in reducing the variance to the overall CPI and the other published lower level indexes. Data collection will begin by the end of FY 2011, with the entire expansion reflected in the index by FY 2015. BLS also proposes to research how to improve or replace the current survey used to identify the outlets at which consumers purchase the items BLS prices in the CPI. The current survey is a telephone, random-digit dialing survey conducted by the Census Bureau. By construction, it does not include cell phones, making it increasingly out of touch with trends in phone usage and, therefore, possibly under-representing the types of retail outlets frequented by cell-phone-only (and, on average, younger) households. The proposed research will provide the CPI with a set of potential solutions for addressing this issue. In FY 2011, BLS plans to begin this effort by initiating survey design and methodology research, to be completed in about two years."}, {"section_title": "North American Industry Classification System", "text": "The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) represents a continuing international effort by Statistics Canada; the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Geograf\u00eda e Informat\u00edca (INEGI) of Mexico; and the United States, through OMB's Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), to foster comparability in the industrial statistics produced by the three countries. NAICS reflects, in an explicit way, the enormous changes in technology and the growth and diversification of services that have marked recent decades. In 1997, NAICS replaced the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification; it has been adopted by Federal statistical agencies that collect or publish data by industry. Like its predecessor, NAICS also is widely used by state agencies, trade associations, businesses, and other organizations. Statistics Canada, INEGI, and OMB have put in place a process to ensure that the implementation of NAICS is comparable across all three countries. NAICS is scheduled for review and, if necessary, update every five years. The NAICS revision for 2012 is underway, focusing on clarifications for outsourcing and classification of establishments providing logistic services. In addition, industry level detail in the manufacturing sector is being reviewed. The three countries are reviewing and updating NAICS coverage continuously to ensure that new activities are promptly recognized and added to the electronic lists of products and services that result from economic activity changes in North America. Up-to-date materials resulting from rulings and interpretations and a complete list of the final changes for 2012 will be available at www. census.gov/naics. The supporting structure for the NAICS web site underwent a substantial revision in 2008 to facilitate maintenance and improve customer services. Just as NAICS has facilitated comparisons of economic activity among its North American partners, there is also significant value in fostering comparability of industrial statistics from a variety of international, regional, and national classifications. "}, {"section_title": "North American Product Classification System", "text": "In recognition that a production-based industry classification system does not meet all of the varying needs of business data users, in 1999 OMB proposed an initiative to develop a comprehensive classification system for the products produced by North American Industry Classification System industries. Like NAICS, this initiative is a joint effort by Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The long-term objective of the North American Product Classification System (NAPCS) is to develop a market-oriented/demand-based system for products that is not industry-of-origin based; can be linked to the NAICS industry structure; is consistent across the three NAICS countries; and promotes improvements in the identification and classification of products across international classification systems, such as the Central Product Classification system of the United Nations. The Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Bureau of Economic Analysis worked together to ensure that product data solicitations in the Economic Census are collectable, meet the needs of business and academic users, and also meet the needs of the producer price program and the national accounts. Provisional NAPCS products were included on Economic Census questionnaires for service industries in 2007. Canada, Mexico, and the United States have agreed to complete NAPCS products for manufactured goods, wholesale trade, and retail trade during 2010. Work on this initiative is progressing and the United States has prepared an initial presentation of potential NAPCS products within a broad demand based aggregation structure.

It is designed to reflect the current occupational structure in the United States and to cover all occupations in which work is performed for pay or profit. OMB established the SOC Policy Committee (SOCPC) to ensure that the SOC remains relevant and meets the needs of individuals and organizations. With the implementation of the predecessor to the 2010 SOC, the 2000 SOC, all major occupational data sources produced by the Federal statistical system provided data that are comparable, greatly improving the usefulness of the data. The 2010 SOC revision and future revisions will continue to serve this purpose, and to improve data collection and maintain currency. Integral to the 2010 SOC revision process was a series of OMB and SOCPC requests for public comment on what should be added or changed in the SOC and on the Classification Principles and the proposed structure of the SOC. Public comments were reviewed by OMB and the SOCPC. In January 2009, OMB announced its final decisions for the structure of the 2010 SOC in the Federal Register; the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification Manual was issued in June 2010. Additional information regarding the SOC revision for 2010, including full text of the Federal Register notices, the final structure and definitions, crosswalks, and other supporting material is available at www.bls.gov/soc. OMB requested that the SOCPC continue to ensure that the SOC reflects the structure of the changing workforce. The SOCPC will meet periodically to monitor the implementation of the 2010 SOC across Federal agencies. This consultation will include regularly scheduled interagency communication to ensure a smooth transition to the 2010 SOC. The SOCPC will also perform SOC maintenance functions, such as recommending clarifications of the SOC occupational definitions, placement of new occupations within the existing structure, and updating title files. OMB and the SOCPC have decided that the next major review and revision of the SOC should begin in 2013, in preparation for a 2018 SOC. The intent of this revision schedule is to minimize disruption to data providers, producers, and users by promoting simultaneous adoption of revised occupational and industry classifications for those data series that use both. Given the multiple interdependent programs that rely on the SOC, this is best accomplished by timing revisions of the SOC for the year following a North American Industry Classification System revision, which will occur for years ending in 2 and 7. The next such year is 2018, which has the additional benefit of coinciding with the beginning year of the American Community Survey five-year set of surveys that bracket the 2020 Decennial Census. Thus, OMB intends to consider revisions of the SOC for 2018 and every 10 years thereafter. As has been the practice prior to each decennial census, OMB asked its interagency Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area Standards Review Committee to examine how the 2000 standards have functioned and to recommend changes, if any. As a result of its review, the Committee concluded that only certain aspects of the 2000 standards needed updating. OMB's Federal Register Notice of February 12, 2009, requested public comment on the Committee's specific recommendations for the elimination of local opinion in the qualification and titling of Combined Statistical Areas, intercensal updates of the statistical areas, and use of the term \"delineation\" to replace \"definition\" when describing the geographic extent of an area. OMB announced its decision on the review of the standards on June 28, 2010, prior to the availability of data from the 2010 Census."}, {"section_title": "Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area Delineations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Measuring Relationships in Federal Household Surveys", "text": "Legal and societal changes have resulted in increasingly complex family configurations, living arrangements, and marital and household relationships. These changes are challenging the frameworks and tools that Federal statistical agencies have for measuring and reporting household relationships and marriage data. Most recently, there has been significant attention focused on the Census Bureau's treatment of data reflecting family relationships, particularly with respect to same-sex couples who report that they are married. The analysis and discussion around these issues have highlighted the need for a further understanding of how to measure and report data on marriage and relationships in Federal surveys. As a result, the Secretary of Commerce asked the OMB Director, in accordance with his responsibilities for developing and issuing standards for the collection and tabulation of Federal statistics, to establish an in-teragency task force to examine issues related to collecting and tabulating data on relationships. A meaningful examination of the measurement of marital and household relationships necessitates a dialogue among agencies that use these kinds of data to develop policies or monitor and administer programs as well as the statistical agencies that collect these data. For example, it is critical to consider which concepts fit the needs of the Federal agencies that use the data, what questions need to be asked to measure these concepts, and how the results should be tabulated and disseminated to be most useful. In 2010, OMB established an Interagency Work Group on Measuring Relationships in Federal Household Surveys (MRFHS). Representatives were invited from agencies that use and produce these data. The mission of this task force is to research the complex facets of the measurement of marital and household relationships, consider the uses of the data and implications and effects for programs and for measurement, and prepare recommendations to OMB and other Federal agencies for the development and testing of questions to more accurately capture data on marriage and family relationships. The MRFHS work group is examining the current practices of the Federal agencies for collecting, editing, and reporting data on relationships and marriage, with special focus on statistical surveys that are widely used. The Census Bureau has also conducted a number of focus groups around the country to begin to identify alternative wording and ways of asking questions on relationships. The Work Group will be reviewing the results of the focus groups and current agency practices to develop further plans for testing and comparing new and alternative questions. Eventually, it is expected that the Work Group will make recommendations to OMB on questions to implement in major household surveys."}, {"section_title": "Classification of Data on Race and Ethnicity", "text": "OMB's standards for data on race and ethnicity provide a minimum set of categories for use when Federal agencies are collecting and presenting such information for statistical, administrative, or compliance purposes. In October 1997, OMB issued Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity, which superseded the standards originally adopted in 1977 (62 FR 58781-58790). As a follow-on to the adoption of the 1997 standards, OMB worked with its interagency committee to develop Provisional Guidance on the Implementation of the 1997 Standards for the Collection of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity. This guidance focused on three areas: collecting data using the 1997 standards, tabulating data collected under the 1997 standards, and building bridges to compare data collected under the 1997 standards and the earlier 1977 standards (current standards and guidance are available at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy). In response to requests from agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing civil rights laws, OMB also led an interagency group that developed more specific guidance for agencies that collect or use aggregate data on race. In addition, this guidance addresses the allocation of multiple race responses for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement (OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, March 9, 2000, is available at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy). The guidance in OMB Bulletin No. 00-02 is designed so that agencies can continue to monitor compliance with laws that offer protections for those who historically have experienced discrimination, and that reporting burden is minimized for those reporting aggregate data to Federal agencies. Most, if not all, of the national population-based surveys and censuses have now implemented the 1997 standards. The Department of Education is implementing the OMB 1997 standards in its aggregate administrative record data reported by school districts beginning with the 2010-2011 school year. OMB continues to monitor implementation of the standards for data on race and ethnicity through its information collection review process under the Paperwork Reduction Act."}, {"section_title": "Supplemental Poverty Measure", "text": "Poverty is a critical indicator of how widely prosperity is shared in our economy and is a key benchmark for targeting resources toward the disadvantaged. The U.S. poverty measure was developed in the 1960's and has not been substantially changed since then. As such, it is based on outdated assumptions and does not take into account the availability of many economic resources. In particular, the official measure does not include many government transfer programs, and hence, cannot be used to evaluate the impact of anti-poverty programs. It has been widely criticized for decades. The Office of Management and Budget has requested the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to develop a Supplemental Poverty Measure that will offer a complementary perspective on the distribution of economic deprivation provided by the official measure. In FY 2011, BLS will improve its processing systems in order to release 2010 Consumer Expenditure (CE) publication tables in September 2011, one month earlier than in the prior year. With continued improvement to its processing systems, by 2015, the CE will support the September release date of the Census income and poverty report by providing the supplemental poverty thresholds to the Census Bureau in early August. BLS will also begin development in FY 2011 of questions to be added to the CE Interview Survey to support the supplemental measure. Additional questions may be added on topics such as school breakfasts or lunches, or subsidies for utilities. BLS plans to continue its research and development to improve the annual production of supplemental poverty thresholds to be used by the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau will use the poverty thresholds developed by BLS and the National Academy of Sciences' 1995 recommendations for family resources as the basis for a definition of income that is much broader than the current official measure. Several of the components of such an improved measure are not currently collected by the Census Bureau in the Current Population Survey's Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) or the American Community Survey (ACS) and must be modeled. The Census Bureau plans to expand its research and production capacities, and work in coordination with BLS, to complement the official poverty measures with annual supplemental measures of poverty based on data from the CPS ASEC (and eventually the ACS) that follow the NAS recommendations. The Census Bureau plans to: \u2022 expand its data collection efforts to add the questions needed to produce the improved poverty measure including questions on mortgages and property value, childcare expenses, child support expenses, and out-of-pocket medical expenses; \u2022 evaluate, improve, and expand its modeling and estimation techniques to produce the necessary additional resource components on a timely basis; \u2022 create a permanent staff who will produce, evaluate, and update these measures and work with stakeholders to ensure that the measure continues to reflect best practices and takes full advantage of the information available to the Census Bureau; and \u2022 expand the measure to other surveys, particularly the ACS, so states and localities can take advantage of this supplemental poverty measure.
