There are 3 projects proposed for planning/E&D phases and 11 proposed for restoration implementation. Table 2-5 presents the 14 projects and associated project cost. \nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters The Oyster Restoration Engineering project would include an initial alternatives analysis designed to evaluate multiple oyster restoration techniques and explore novel approaches to identify the most costeffective landscape-level application of oyster restoration within the target areas of Galveston Bay. The analysis would evaluate the most effective means of rehabilitating buried oyster reefs and constructing Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters sustainable intertidal reefs that would provide ecosystem benefits and ongoing sources of larval material for surrounding reefs. The Texas TIG would procure the assistance of a qualified professional services provider (PSP) with expertise in the ecological and engineering aspects of oyster restoration and provide oversight of the alternatives analysis. The Oyster Restoration Engineering project would also identify potential future restoration project sites within the targeted areas of the Galveston Bay System. The PSP would utilize existing literature and monitoring data from previously constructed oyster restoration projects and consult with the Texas TIG, TPWD resource managers, and oyster restoration experts to develop restoration site selection parameters. These parameters would then be used to identify the most appropriate restoration sites to rehabilitate buried reefs and restore intertidal oyster reefs using the restoration techniques identified in the alternatives analysis. Using the results of the alternatives analysis and restoration site identification process, detailed engineering, design, and environmental permitting documents would be prepared for one or more projects. A PSP would be tasked with project design, engineering plans and specification development, and preparation of environmental compliance/permitting documents. Engineering tasks could include data collection, obtaining required permit(s) for later construction, development of E&D plans, and determining estimated construction costs associated with different management actions. The E&D component of this project may also involve the collection of field data, including topographicbathymetric surveys, geophysical surveys, and geotechnical borings/samples.\nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters The 100 acres of harvestable (sink) reefs would include approximately 4,850 mounds constructed of river rock as cultch material, and would be constructed with enough vertical relief to increase resiliency and longevity by protecting them from sedimentation and erosion from storm surges. The use of small diameter cultch at sink reefs would improve larval recruitment by increasing the surface area available for attachment when compared to larger materials, and also allow the reefs to be harvestable by both commercial and non-commercial oystermen. When not colonized by oysters, this small cultch would pass through the mesh bags of oyster dredges to maximize dredge efficiency and minimize cultch loss. The 50 acres of source reefs would be constructed with a higher vertical relief than harvestable reefs, using larger-sized cultch materials to inhibit harvest, provide increased interstitial space for aquatic communities, and ensure long term resilience to sedimentation and storm surges.\nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters project according to design, including verification of targeted elevation of cultch materials, and a confirmation that oysters are colonizing the reefs.\nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters historically high rates of relative sea level rise (sea level rise plus subsidence). The project site exhibits several geological growth faults that are likely associated with nearby salt domes but also activities related to oil and gas development. Additional hydrologic modifications associated with the marsh complex include man-made channels such as the Intracoastal Waterway and access channels which have modified natural hydrology and geomorphic processes of the area. \nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Essex Bayou and the Slop Bowl Marsh experience wide swings in salinity and tidal reach. Initial assessments suggest that modifications to the watershed, flow restrictions in Essex Bayou, and diversions of tidal flow are responsible for the extreme salinity conditions. Periods within these wide swings of salinity can produce high biological diversity and productivity, however swings into each extreme salinity condition causes changes to the existing vegetation that biologically and structurally destabilize the system. High salinities cause considerable vegetation damage and allow for only a few species of estuarine organisms to survive. These high salinity levels cause high mortality of wetland plants, invertebrates, and fish species. These conditions result in very poor foraging habitat for birds, fish, and other vertebrate species. In the drier summer months, salinities of 150 parts per thousand (ppt)-approximately five times that of full strength sea water-have been documented. To identify the best method to protect and/or restore the wetland habitats, this project would build on previous lessons learned by evaluating existing site conditions. Previous investigative efforts have included an assessment of shoreline change as well as identification of pipeline rights-of-way, potential fault lines, grazing activity, tidal elevations, elevations at critical locations, and watershed diversions. Some monitoring data of tide levels and bird use of the site have been compiled. This project would further evaluate the conditions responsible and propose solutions to ameliorate extreme salinity conditions. The suite of potential corrective actions would be evaluated for feasibility, cost, and effectiveness. The most effective and appropriate corrective measures would then be selected for 30% E&D development. Scientific and engineering tasks could include data collection (such as bathymetric/topographical survey, growth fault analyses, hydrologic and tidal flow evaluations, magnetometer survey, or soil borings); performance evaluation of the previous efforts noted above; obtaining required permit(s) for later construction; development of E&D plans; and estimating construction costs associated with different management actions. Ultimately, restoration actions implemented in later phases would improve the stability and diversity of approximately 2,000 acres of estuarine habitats (intertidal marsh, salt marsh, sand flat, bayou stream channel and protected shallow water). Restoration of this area would provide secondary benefits to coastal and migratory birds, fishery species, water quality (salinity), and recreational activities such as birding and fishing. Designs developed in the Phase I E&D work would be undertaken in one or more implementation phases. Any subsequent phases proposed for implementation with DWH NRDA funds would be evaluated for consideration in a later restoration plan.\nIn general, construction would require the use of barges, small watercraft, large track hoe excavators, earth moving equipment, hydraulic or clamshell dredges, and a dockside staging area. Equipment and materials for the construction activities would be transported via roads and marine waterways. Large equipment and materials moved by barges would use the established interconnected waterways. This may include the GIWW, the Brownsville Ship Channel and/or other navigation channels.\nThis tract is considered by the USFWS and the south Texas conservation community to be a top priority for conservation of the unique Cameron County coastal habitat complex and meeting the mission of the Bahia Grande Unit of the LANWR. According to the 2006 Texas Wildlife Action Plan Summary Report, \"All factors considered, [South Texas] is among the most threatened of the 10 [Texas] ecoregions and the more threatened of the two high diversity ecoregions.\" Protection and management of the tract would help meet habitat and population objectives of endangered species recovery plans for nine endangered animals. Acquisition of the property also supports the objectives and goals of the following plans: Gulf Coast Joint Venture plans , Rio Grande Joint Venture plans 16 , the Texas State Wildlife Action Plan (TPWD 2005), the LANWR Expansion Plan (USFWS 1999), and the LANWR CCP (USFWS 2010). The American Bird Conservancy has designated the area as a \"globally important bird area\" for its variety of migratory, winter and resident birds and habitats. Several tropical species reach their northernmost range in south Texas, which is also part of the convergence of the Central and Mississippi Flyways. Millions of migratory shorebirds, raptors, songbirds and waterfowl touch down here each year on their journeys between winter homes in Mexico, Central and South America and nesting habitats as far north as the tundra above the Arctic Circle. The most significant outcome of this proposal is the acquisition and permanent protection of over 1,300 acres of habitat for an abundance of flora and fauna and the creation of a permanent travel corridor for animals, including the critically endangered ocelot. Protecting this property from development would provide a buffer to disturbance for wildlife, protect water quality and quantity and allow for large scale hydrologic restoration within the Laguna Madre and Bahia Grande that would be precluded if it were developed. Steps to acquiring the property include: 1) complete due diligence including appraisal, environmental assessment, survey and title search to ensure that the Texas TIG is not paying above market value, that the property is not contaminated, that property boundaries are certain and clear, and that the tract's title is free and clear of objectionable encumbrances, 2) secure the property with a purchase contract, Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters and 3) convey the tract to USFWS for the LANWR. Due diligence for the tract is already underway and a purchase option on the property has been secured.\nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Ridley sea turtle, and is critical habitat for the endangered Piping Plover, Aplomado Falcon, Red Knot, and Snowy and Wilsons Plovers. This tract is adjacent to and has roughly a mile and a half of boundary in common with the LANWR (Figure 3 -19). Under this project, the land would be conveyed to LANWR for management and protection for habitat and wildlife conservation in perpetuity. The proposed acquisition lies within the area outlined in the LANWR Expansion and Conceptual Management Plan (referenced in the LANWR CCP) which limits expansion of the Refuge to areas in eastern Cameron County (around the Laguna Atascosa Unit and on South Padre Island north of Park Road 100) and Willacy County (South Padre Island). In addition, this parcel and adjacent parcels fall within a landscape boundary that has been identified as a priority area for acquisition by the LANWR (USFWS 1999 andUSFWS 2010). The acquisition of this tract would not only add to the conservation value of the NWR, but would prevent incompatible development and uses that might compromise the values of the portions of the island already in conservation. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters The proposed tract acquisition supports the needs or goals of several conservation plans. These plans include but are not limited to the following national, state and regional planning documents:  (Wilson et al. 2014). Steps to acquiring the property include: 1) complete due diligence, including appraisal, environmental assessment, survey, and title search to ensure that the Texas TIG is not paying above market value, that the property is not contaminated, that property boundaries are certain and clear, and that the tract's title is free and clear of encumbrances, 2) secure the property with a purchase contract, and 3) convey the tract to USFWS for the LANWR.\nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters \nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters \nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters  \nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Criteria air pollutants and GHG emissions are largely generated by electricity production, vehicular movements, and commercial and residential buildings using electricity. GHG emissions would result from public use and management of the project from the use of vehicles. Engine exhaust from vehicles would contribute to an increase in GHG emissions. BMPs would be employed to reduce the release of GHG during project land management activities.\nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters The project would have minor, short-term adverse impacts to noise from construction activities. Heavy equipment can cause direct localized and minor adverse impacts due to noise. This impact would be short-term and limited to the period of construction which is anticipated to be no longer than 12 months.\nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters \nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Impacts to wildlife would be avoided via management guidelines and techniques as appropriate. The Sea Turtle and Smalltooth Sawfish Construction Conditions would be followed (NMFS 2006). Long-term impacts would be beneficial with the addition of hard substrate that would support a more diverse community of benthic organisms and fish. Birds that forage in or near the dredge site could be temporarily affected. However, these effects would be short-term and minor as birds would be expected to move away to forage in other readily available foraging habitat during the dredging. Acclimation to construction activities may take place and therefore the limit the intensity of the adverse impact. Once construction has been completed the restored area would provide a greater range of habitats available for birds to use. Increased area of protected marsh would improve habitats and provide a long-term benefit. The proposed actions would also provide additional habitat for many of the above listed bird groups as well as other guilds during the non-nesting season. Consultation with appropriate agencies would be required prior to final design and project implementation. There would be beneficial impacts to EFH from the protection and restoration of marsh habitat. There may be short-term, minor impacts during construction from the movement of sediments, turbidity, and the addition of hard structure to the substrate. The submerged side slopes of the breakwaters would provide hard substrate with interstitial spaces that would enhance foraging areas for fish as well as provide cover for juvenile fish and substrate for establishment of oyster habitat. Fish present in the dredging area could be subject to a temporary increase in sound pressure levels, a decrease in water quality, entrainment in dredge sediments, and removal of benthos from dredged areas. Sound pressure levels or entrainment could result in mortality of individual finfish. This would be a minor short-term adverse effect that would not be expected to reduce local fish populations or designated EFH. Consultation with appropriate agencies would be required prior to final design and project implementation. The project would provide benefits to marine and estuarine fauna by providing additional structural fish habitat. Over the life of the project, the quality of aquatic habitat would increase. If present, dolphins and manatees would likely leave the area to avoid the construction activities and/or would generally avoid the area because optimal habitat does not exist. Manatees are extremely rare in Texas waters with sightings less than one per year on average across the entire Texas coast. However, if marine mammals are sighted within 50 feet of the construction area, work would stop until the animals move away from the area under their own volition. Therefore, marine mammals would not be impacted during construction activities and no incidental take of marine mammals is anticipated.\nDeepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters The five endangered or threatened species that could potentially be affected are listed in Table 4 -18. No activities related to implementation of the project would take place in any area designated as critical habitat. Five species of endangered or threatened species of sea turtles could potentially be affected in the project area: loggerheads, green, hawksbill, leatherback and Kemp's ridley sea turtles. Sea turtles nest on beaches, and most species use nearshore hard bottom reef complexes, shallow water habitat (including seagrasses), or other coastal areas with rocky bottoms to forage for food. This area has not been designated as critical habitat for any of the sea turtle species. Sea turtle nesting activities are not expected to occur here since there is no Gulf facing beach habitat; however, sea turtles could be encountered in the open water.\nThere could be partial developed recreational site closures to protect public safety. The same site capacity and visitor experience could remain unchanged after construction. The impact could be detectable and/or could only affect some recreationists. Users could likely be aware of the action but changes in use could be slight. There could be partial closures to protect public safety. Impacts could be local. There could be a change in local recreational opportunities; however, it could affect relatively few visitors or could not affect any related recreational activities. There could be complete site closures to protect public safety. However, the sites could be reopened after activities occur. There could be slightly reduced site capacity. The visitor experience could be slightly changed but still available. The impact could be readily apparent and/or could affect many recreationists locally and in adjacent areas. Users could be aware of the action. There could be complete closures to protect public safety. However, the areas could be reopened after activities occur. Some users could choose to pursue activities in other available local or regional areas. All developed site capacity could be eliminated because developed facilities could be closed and removed. Visitors could be displaced to facilities over a widespread area and visitor experiences could no longer be available in many locations. The impact could affect most recreationists over a widespread area. Users could be highly aware of the action. Users could choose to pursue activities in other available regional areas."}, {"section_title": "List of Figures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "List of", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill", "text": "Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters many of these response actions had collateral impacts on the environment and on natural resource services. On February 19, 2016, the DWH Trustees issued a Final PDARP/PEIS detailing a specific proposed plan to fund and implement restoration projects across the Gulf of Mexico region into the future as restoration funds become available. That document describes Restoration Types that meet Trustee programmatic restoration goals that the DWH Trustees should use to guide restoration planning. On March 29, 2016, in accordance with OPA and NEPA, the DWH Trustees published a Notice of Availability (NOA) of a ROD for the Final PDARP/PEIS in the Federal Register (81 FR 17438). Based on the DWH Trustees' injury determination established in the Final PDARP/PEIS, the ROD set forth the basis for the DWH Trustees' decision to select Alternative A: Comprehensive Integrated Ecosystem Alternative. The DWH Trustees' selection of Alternative A includes the funding allocations established in the Final PDARP/PEIS. On April 4, 2016, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana entered a consent decree resolving the DWH Trustees' claims against BP for natural resources damages under OPA. Under the Consent Decree Among Defendant BP Exploration & Production Inc. (\"BPXP\"), The United States of America, and the States of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (Consent Decree), BP agreed to pay a total of $8.1 billion in natural resource damages (which includes the $1 billion that BP previously committed to pay for Early Restoration 4 projects) over a 15-year period, and up to an additional $700 million for adaptive management or to address injuries to natural resources that are presently unknown but may come to light in the future. The settlement allocated a specific sum of money to the Restoration Areas in each of the Gulf States, as well as Regionwide and Open Water, to conduct restoration (U.S. Department of Justice 2016). Each Restoration Area has a specific monetary allocation to each of five Restoration Types specified in the Consent Decree.

Galveston Bay was formed during the end of the last glacial period when world sea levels rose in response to melting glaciers (Anderson 2007). Formerly a river valley during the Pleistocene, sediments accumulated in the valley as the sea rose and formed the bay during the Holocene. The Galveston Bay geologic substrates are comprised of clay and silt with some sand. Most of the sand component is delivered from the Gulf by tidal forces. The main sources of sediments entering the system include the Trinity and San Jacinto River systems and to a lesser degree the many small streams and bayous that enter the system. Significant subsidence has occurred as the result of the withdrawal of underground fluids. This has resulted in significant changes to the shorelines of the bay as well as islands formed naturally or by man. Most of the islands in the bay system were created during the construction of waterways by the side casting of dredged material along the newly created channel. The description of the physical environment of Galveston Bay is divided into geology and substrates, hydrology and water quality, air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as noise characteristics of the area.\nThe goal of the Landscape Approach to Oyster Reef Restoration project is to restore up to 150 acres of degraded Galveston Bay oyster reefs using a landscape approach to create a network of oyster populations.

Hurricane Ike, which struck the Galveston Bay area in September 2008, buried approximately 8,000 acres of oyster reef under sediment deposits up to 1.5 meters thick (Freese and Nichols 2015). Reef areas that were covered with a relatively shallow layer of sediment were re-exposed through an effort of dragging bagless oyster dredges. However, oyster reef habitat in Galveston Bay has not recovered since Hurricane Ike to levels desired by resource managers to sustain a robust oyster fishery and provide the full range of ecosystem service benefits. The Texas TIG recognized the need to evaluate buried reefs in the Galveston Bay system as well as identify those areas within the Galveston Bay system that are currently in the greatest need of restoration. These areas include East Bay, Trinity Bay, and Upper Galveston Bay, generally east of the Houston Ship Channel.\nThe Landscape Approach to Oyster Reef Restoration would restore 150 acres of oyster reef habitat in Upper Galveston Bay and Trinity Bay (Figure 3-2), including 50 acres designated as source reefs and 100 acres as harvestable sink reefs. Source reefs as defined for this project would be restricted-harvest oyster reefs with high density oyster populations that would supply planktonic oyster larvae via currents to nearby oyster habitats open to harvest (sink reefs).\nBird Island Cove is part of an estuarine marsh complex within Galveston County, Texas. It is located on the bay side of Galveston Island within West Bay in the Galveston Bay System (Figure 3 -3). West Bay and the larger Galveston Bay System have lost nearly 20% of their wetlands due to subsidence and erosion ). The region's reliance on groundwater beginning in the 1850s and peaking in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters 1970s was a major contributor to the high degree of land surface subsidence (ranging from 1-10 feet) that occurred around Galveston Bay. The creation of the Harris-Galveston Subsidence District by the Texas Legislature in 1975 resulted in a significant reduction in groundwater withdrawals and, subsequently, a reduction in subsidence in the project region over the last twenty-plus years. Today, the issue of land surface subsidence in the project area has largely been abated. Unfortunately, historical subsidence experienced by this coastal region inundated thousands of acres of coastal marsh and exposed shorelines to greater wave activity, resulting in erosion and loss of additional marsh habitat. This project is intended to protect and/or restore estuarine habitats including marshes, and is consistent with the goals and objectives of The Galveston Bay Plan, a comprehensive conservation and management plan for the Galveston Bay system.

The project area is in the western gulf coastal plain -Texas/Louisiana coastal marshes ecoregion. The Chenier Plain was formed over many years by the reworking of riverine sediments. Higher ridges were comprised of the coarse, large-grained sediments while the mudflats and marshes were formed by the fine-grained materials. The project includes the construction of a dune ridge that borders and protects the largest contiguous estuarine marsh complex in Texas. The estuarine marsh complex includes freshwater to estuarine marsh, coastal prairie grasslands, oak ridges, tidal flats, lakes, creeks, basins, and associated aquatic vegetation. The project is located on the upper Texas coast, south of the JD Murphree WMA and Sea Rim State Park, along the beach face of McFaddin NWR (Figure 3  The dunes and beaches in or adjacent to McFaddin NWR have been impacted by human activities as well as natural processes. These activities and processes have resulted in the loss of the dunes, removal of sand from the beach face, and the lack of sandy sediments being transported into the project area. Currently, the project area consists of clay overlain at most by a thin sand veneer, which severely limits the presence of invertebrates and birds. The gulf facing shoreline of Jefferson County, which includes the project location, has retreated a net rate of 2.8 meters/year (Paine et al. 2011). This shoreline retreat has resulted in a change in habitat and a loss of foraging and nesting habitat along the shoreline. Historically, the beach ridge separating the Gulf of Mexico from interior marshes was much higher in elevation than it is today and it prevented sea water inundation from the Gulf under normal tidal conditions. Waters from the Gulf would normally pass over the beach ridge and enter the interior marshes only during storm surges associated with significant storms or hurricanes. The frequency of such inundation was on the order of years to a decade or more. The loss of the beach ridge has decreased the ecological functioning and resiliency of the marsh system on McFaddin NWR. As recent as the late 1990s, McFaddin NWR supported fresh water and intermediate marsh plant communities near the western boundary of the NWR. However, over the last decade these plant communities and valuable submerged aquatic vegetation have been eliminated in this area by periodic catastrophic salinity increases due to loss of the beach ridge. The loss of the beach ridge led to more frequent beach overwash and dramatically increased salinities in the system. These episodic overwashes have trapped higher salinity water and increased marsh sulfide levels, both of which have caused die back of the intermediate marsh plant community creating an increase in open water areas. As these irregular but frequent doses of salt water increase, channels, bayous, and ditches that this water travels through continue to widen, marsh plant communities die off, and the highly erodible substrate is washed away. This continued increase in channel size exacerbates the issue further, ensuring that any freshwater stored in the system is removed at increasingly higher rates. This loss of peat material further leads to increased subsidence, which in turn allows saltwater to flow further into the system. A clay berm was constructed in 2016 as a stop gap measure to prevent the regular influx of seawater into the interior marshes until a more permanent solution, the project proposed, could be implemented. The constructed clay berm is around 300-600 feet inland of the Gulf of Mexico shoreline. This berm would remain in place even after the proposed beach and dune restoration project has been completed and serve as a second line of defense to further prevent the intrusion of sea water. Planning efforts for this project area are underway. Preliminary E&D has been completed and a USACE permit (SWG-2015-00444) has been issued for a 20-mile section of shoreline restoration adjacent to McFaddin NWR. Approximately 3 miles of the 20 miles has been restored in a pilot project that was completed August 2017. Information from this pilot project would be used to inform the final E&D documents for the remainder of the project area as well as other planning and monitoring documents. Other potential funding sources are currently being investigated. This project was on the draft RESTORE Act Bucket 1 project list in Texas. In addition, the NFWF GEBF has agreed to provide monies to complete the final E&D work for the entire project area and may be a source of additional project implementation funds. This project would only be implemented if funding through other sources is allocated so that the entire 20-mile section of beach described in the USACE permit can be completed. This project is supported by NGOs as well as federal, state, and local governmental entities as part of the efforts to restore the greater salt bayou system. The salt bayou system includes marshes, creeks, lakes, and other associated habitats located landward of this beach and dune restoration project. Members of Ducks Unlimited, Jefferson County, NOAA, TGLO, TPWD, TWDB, USACE, and USFWS worked together to form the Salt Bayou Workgroup in order to \"[conserve the] salt bayou system to ensure its continued benefits for wildlife, fisheries, and the communities.\" (TPWD 2013) This group recently updated the Salt Bayou Watershed Restoration Plan (TPWD 2013), which has been adopted by Jefferson County as its official restoration plan for its coastal marshes. The proposed beach and dune project is the last remaining component of the plan's major actions identified as necessary for the restoration of the Salt Bayou system.\nThe Nelda Stark Unit of the Lower Neches WMA in Orange County comprises approximately 3,375 acres located along the eastern bank of the Neches River approximately 5 miles north of the confluence of the Neches and Sabine Rivers at Sabine Lake (Figure 3-6). The area within and surrounding the Nelda Stark Unit is often referred to as the Bessie Heights Marsh and is also the site of the Port Neches oilfield. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters The predominant wetland habitats near the Lower Neches WMA are characterized as marsh and estuarine open water. For the lower Neches River, from Beaumont to Sabine Lake, significant systematic change occurred between the 1950s and the 2000s as palustrine marsh was lost (reduced from 10,184 Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters hectares (ha) to 4,279 ha) and converted to estuarine open water (increased from 694 ha to 5,080 ha). The largest degree of loss of palustrine marsh was in the vicinity of the Lower Neches WMA where oil and gas production in the Port Neches Oil field caused subsidence via the activation of a pair of highangle faults that promoted marsh flooding and conversion to open water (Tremblay and Calnan 2009). Many restoration efforts in Bessie Heights that have focused on restoring estuarine intertidal marsh by construction marsh terraces and through the BUDM. The project would be a continuation of those efforts. Restoration of Texas coastal wetlands through beneficially using dredged material supports the needs or goals of several conservation plans. These plans include but are not limited to the following national, state, and regional planning documents: The Texas TIG would coordinate with the USACE on this project to beneficially use dredged material from maintenance dredging of the SNWW and DMPAs. Dredged material may also be obtained from the dredging of private industrial docks, berths, and channels. The Texas TIG would coordinate with the appropriate parties for each sediment source to ensure the material is not contaminated and is appropriate for marsh restoration. The project would fund the construction of containment levees as needed to contain and dewater the dredged sediments. Sediment would be placed within these containment areas to build bottom elevations suitable for marsh growth as determined from adjacent natural wetlands. This would allow the marshes to return to sustainable and productive intertidal wetlands. Based on existing preliminary designs, the project would place up to 4.8 million cubic yards of material to restore up to 900 acres of intertidal wetland complex. Funding for the final E&D for this project has been awarded under the RESTORE Act Bucket 2. This project would not be implemented until that E&D has been completed. Final material volumes and acreage is dependent upon material available through adjacent dredge projects and selected contractor capabilities. It is anticipated that the next opportunity to partner with USACE to receive dredged material for restoration purposes would be between 2018 and 2020. Much of the funding for this project would be used to fund USACE's incremental costs associated with BUDM. Incremental costs are those that are above the costs for the Federal Standard base plan defined in USACE regulations. These regulations mandate selection of the least costly dredged material disposal or placement alternative (or alternatives) identified by USACE that is consistent with sound engineering practices and meets all federal environmental compliance requirements. When BUDM is selected for a project and that beneficial use is not the Federal Standard option, the costs for the beneficial use option are divided into two categories: 1) the costs assigned to the navigational purpose of the project; and 2) the costs beyond the navigational purpose costs (termed \"incremental costs\").

NEPA analyses for dredging by the USACE and other parties are covered in analyses conducted by those entities.\nPierce Marsh is a subsided intertidal and high salt marsh complex adjacent to Highland Bayou in Hitchcock, Texas, on the north side of West Bay (Figure 3-7). The bay has been adversely affected by historical subsidence, which has led to the loss of much of the once-thriving marsh habitat in the system. This project would beneficially use dredged material to restore estuarine marsh complex (intertidal fringe marsh, salt flat marsh, sand flat, and protected shallow water) within a 364-acre area in Pierce Marsh. The primary objective of this project is to continue ongoing efforts to return current open-water habitat in Pierce Marsh to historical marsh elevations to support habitat restoration and revegetation with smooth cordgrass. This project would route between 120,000 and 400,000 cubic yards of hydraulically dredged material excavated from USACE maintenance dredging at several stations along the GIWW to pre-existing sediment containment levees (cells) or newly constructed levees in Pierce Marsh. 13 This material would be used to raise the elevation of up to 47,050 linear feet of the existing levees and increase elevation of existing substrate to a height not to exceed historical marsh elevations. 14 Portions of the dredged material would be placed above intertidal elevation for restoration of salt flat marsh/sand flat habitat in addition to intertidal smooth cordgrass (i.e., Spartina alterniflora) marsh and would also allow for the migration of intertidal marsh to higher elevations in response to sea level rise. Project actions would restore up to 150 acres of marsh habitat.  This project would contribute to an ongoing, large-scale conservation effort to restore marsh and wetland habitat in the Galveston Bay system. Historical subsidence in the Galveston Bay area has inundated thousands of acres of coastal marsh. Wetland loss in coastal Texas has been rated by the EPA as severe and is greater in the Galveston Bay system than other areas of the state . It is estimated that between 1953 and 1989, Galveston Bay experienced a net loss of approximately 35,100 acres of wetlands . Subsidence in the greater Houston area has slowed considerably since groundwater pumping was severely limited beginning in 1975 ). Restoration of Pierce Marsh supports the needs or goals of several conservation plans. These plans include but are not limited to the following national, state, and regional planning documents: Final E&D stages for this project have recently been funded but not implemented through the RESTORE Act Bucket 2 (GCERC 2015). This project would not be implemented until the final E&D funded under the RESTORE Act has been completed. Estimated material volume and restored acreage is currently based on existing preliminary designs. Final material volumes and acreage is dependent upon material available through adjacent USACE dredge projects and selected contractor capabilities. To implement this project, the Texas TIG would partner with the USACE to use dredged material from the GIWW to increase elevations in leveed open water areas of Pierce Marsh and make them suitable for the establishment and long-term sustainability of a shallow intertidal wetland. It is anticipated that the next opportunity to partner with USACE to receive dredged material for restoration purposes would be between 2018 and 2020. Depending on availability of funding, this project may run more than one maintenance dredging cycle.\nThe Dollar Bay-Moses Lake Wetlands Restoration (Phase IV) project intends to protect and restore coastal wetlands within the Moses Lake and Dollar Bay complex, a 2-mile by 4-mile tidally influenced waterbody on the west side of Galveston Bay in Galveston County, Texas (Figure 3-9). The Nature Conservancy's Texas City Prairie Preserve lies on the western and northern shores of Moses Lake. Historically, much of the perimeter and interior of the project area consisted of estuarine emergent marsh. However, historical subsidence coupled with shoreline erosion greatly impacted these areas, converting marsh to open water.  Rapid development around the Houston metropolitan area has resulted in loss of important coastal habitats, either directly, through transition of natural areas to developed properties, or indirectly, through land surface subsidence, shoreline erosion, and other factors. Historically, the reliance on groundwater beginning in the 1850s and peaking in the 1970s was a major contributor to the high degree of land surface subsidence that occurred around Galveston Bay--anywhere from 1 to up to 10 Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters feet in some areas. The creation of the Harris-Galveston Subsidence District by the Texas Legislature in 1975 resulted in a significant reduction in groundwater withdrawal and, subsequently, subsidence in the project region over the last twenty-plus years. Today, the issue of land surface subsidence in the project area has largely been abated. Unfortunately, historical subsidence experienced by this coastal region inundated thousands of acres of coastal marsh and exposed shorelines to greater wave activity, resulting in erosion of even more marsh habitat. Erosion rates of up to ten feet per year have been documented on some Galveston Bay shorelines. Wetland loss in coastal Texas has been rated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as severe (EPA 1999) and is greater in the Galveston Bay system than other areas of the state. It is estimated that between 1953 and 1989, Galveston Bay experienced a net loss of approximately 35,100 acres of wetlands ). Restoration and protection of the project area from erosion is necessary to ensure the future success and longevity of marsh conservation efforts. This project would restore, enhance, and protect the foraging and nesting habitats of many bird species as well as environmentally and economically crucial estuarine species such as penaeid shrimp, red drum, and blue crab. The hard breakwater structures associated with the project would provide substrate on which oyster spat can attach and develop, benefitting the oyster population. The project would also restore and enhance the foraging and wintering habitat of several coastal-dependent bird species. The Habitat Conservation Blueprint (Blueprint), developed in 1998 by GBF and updated in 2007 by the Environmental Institute of Houston (Biggs et al. 2007), provides a resource document with background information on Galveston Bay habitats and what is happening to them, an inventory of sites with proposed habitat restoration and/or conservation strategies, and a listing of potential funding and technical assistance resources. It specifically recommends restoring marshes within the project area. Furthermore, the protection and restoration of this coastal habitat would contribute to the larger body of established and ongoing conservation efforts in West Galveston Bay. The project would build off of efforts to protect the shoreline of TNC's Texas City Prairie Preserve and complement ongoing conservation efforts such as the West Galveston Bay Conservation Corridor Habitat Preservation, the Gulf Coast Migratory Waterfowl Habitat Enhancement, the North American Waterbird Conservation Plan, as well as other Galveston Bay-area conservation efforts. This project would build upon three other phases of work that, when combined, would restore marsh habitat and help prevent continued erosion in Dollar-Bay and Moses Lake. Phase I was completed during the first half of 2017, which developed the planning, engineering, design, permitting, and budget development required to implement Phase II of the Dollar Bay-Moses Lake Wetlands Restoration project. Phase II, to begin in 2017, will complete construction of breakwaters along TNC's Texas City Prairie Preserve, located along the northwest shoreline of Moses Lake, to protect up to 6,800 linear feet of vulnerable shoreline and adjacent habitat from continued erosion and habitat conversion ( Figure  3-10). Phase II will also restore at least 30 acres of degraded estuarine marsh habitat in Dollar Bay by raising elevations suitable for the creation of emergent and high marsh. As part of Phase III, an alternatives analysis and 50% engineering drawings were completed and a USACE permit application for the project was submitted for consideration. An environmental analysis of the benthic and bottom conditions report has been completed and included in the USACE permit application. Information from Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters this investigation was used to determine the project location and to help create project designs that avoid and/or minimize impacts to sensitive resources. Phase IV, the project proposed herein, would build from planning information generated during Phases I, II, and III to finalize planning activities. Implementation of Phase IV in conjunction with the other three phases would work together to protect and restore estuarine marsh in Moses Lake and Dollar Bay, which is important for migratory and nonmigratory birds, fish, and shellfish species of the Gulf of Mexico. \nThe Bahia Grande is a federally protected 10,000-acre coastal ecosystem estuary and wetland complex, consisting of three shallow water basins (Bahia Grande, Little Laguna Madre, Laguna Larga) located within the LANWR near Port Isabel, Texas (Figure 3-13). The Bahia Grande was naturally formed and frequently inundated with tidal waters from the nearby Gulf of Mexico, making the Bahia Grande an ecologically rich wetland. It served as a natural nursery for fish, shellfish, wildlife, and waterfowl in the South Texas coastal region until the basin was modified by the placement of dredged sediments from the construction of the Brownsville Ship Channel in the mid-1930s and subsequently by the construction of State Highway (SH) 48 in the mid-1950s.  The dredged material and constructed highway essentially cut-off and removed the historic tidal connections, resulting in rapid evaporation of the saline water from the Bahia Grande that eventually led to the formation of a near-permanently dry salt basin, which no longer supported coastal wetlands and is currently characterized by reduced biodiversity. Occasionally heavy rain fills the basin, but the area has been essentially dry and barren for almost 70 years due to strong evaporation and lack of regular tidal exchange with the Laguna Madre. Since becoming tidally isolated, strong coastal winds common to the area swept across the basin and raised dense clouds of salty, clay dust that blanketed area towns causing health problems, clogging air conditioners, shorting power lines, lowering land values, and restricting visibility on SH 48 and 100. Since the Bahia Grande lost tidal exchange in the 1930s, the once thriving ecosystem has been severely degraded. In the early 2000s, the USFWS proposed to flood Bahia Grande by cutting in a channel from the Brownsville Ship Channel. The intention was to create a biologically viable (productive) shallowwater bay that could potentially support seagrass beds and/or black mangroves and provide a nursery for a variety of marine organisms as well as habitat for wading and shore birds.  Trust 2009). High salinity in much of the basin due to insufficient water exchange has prevented full restoration of Bahia Grande to coastal estuary conditions (Ocean Trust 2009). The project would allow for increased tidal exchange and result in decreased salinity in Bahia Grande. The proposed Bahia Grande Hydrologic Restoration project would restore this area by widening and deepening the existing pilot channel between Bahia Grande and the Brownsville Ship Channel, depositing the dredged material in placement areas adjacent to the proposed channel, and installing rip rap scour protection along portions of the channel and the Bahia Grande shoreline. The project would reestablish a higher tidal exchange between Laguna Madre/Gulf of Mexico and the Bahia Grande by dredging, enlarging, and stabilizing the pilot channel. The width of the pilot channel would be increased from 34 feet to 250 feet. The construction of the channel would provide tidal exchange of 32% of total water volume into Bahia Grande and restore its ecosystem functions as a major fish, wildlife, and waterfowl nursery and habitat for the South Texas Coast. Preliminary engineering, design, and permitting for this project has been completed and this project would implement the existing E&D plan to widen the channel. The project would result in a conversion of about 8 acres of non-open water features to open water. Project activities would build upon the progress and efforts of numerous organizations including public and private groups, and state and federal agencies. This project is part of larger initiative to preserve and restore critical habitats within the Bahia Grande ecosystem corridor in South Texas. In addition to the pilot channel, several smaller channel projects within the Bahia Grande were constructed to restore hydrological connections within the estuary. This project is critical to the overall success of the restoration of the Bahia Grande estuary because the channel is the basin's main hydrological connection to the Gulf of Mexico and would enhance the tidal exchange throughout the system. The restoration of the Bahia Grande system supports the needs or goals of several conservation plans. These plans include but are not limited to the following national, state, and regional planning documents: \u2022 Waterbird Conservation for the Americas: The North American Waterbird Conservation Plan, Version 1 (Kushlan et al. 2002 (Figure 3-14). The proposed channel would follow the same general alignment as the existing pilot channel and would be 250 feet wide at the top, 150 feet wide at the bottom, 9 feet deep, and 2,200 feet long. Approximately 220,000 cubic yards of fill would be excavated from the existing pilot channel, adjacent land, the Brownsville Ship Channel, and Bahia Grande.  The channel to be constructed would run under the existing SH 48 Bridge between Brownsville and Port Isabel, Texas. It would serve as the main mechanism for tidal exchange between the Laguna Madre and the Bahia Grande via the Brownsville Ship Channel. Post construction, this channel and its shoreline would be stabilized with rip rap for scour protection. Methods and tools would be approved by the PE and the project team that includes Texas TIG representatives prior to implementation. Environmental considerations, BMPs, and legal and permit requirements must be met regardless of methods and tools chosen. These would be outlined in the bid specification package developed by the PE and contracting officers. This specification package would ensure that the contractor is made aware of not only the engineering specifications but the additional obligations they would incur associated with federal and state laws governing the activities associated with the project. It would also provide the project related approvals needed by the project manager and the PE to conduct the project.\nThe project area is located on Follets Island and is bordered to the northwest by Drum Bay and Christmas Bay and to the southeast by the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 3-15). Follets Island is situated within the Gulf Prairies and Marshes ecological region and recognized by the USFWS as a nationally significant coastal barrier ecosystem. The entire northern shoreline of Christmas Bay is protected within the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Brazoria NWR, and Christmas Bay is designated as a coastal preserve. This project would increase protection for the coastal ecosystem and it would complement the existing Follets Island Conservation Initiative (property owned and managed by TPWD), the Christmas Bay Coastal Preserve (jointly managed by TPWD and TGLO), and other adjacent coastal preservation activities. Follets Island is under significant development pressure. It is one of two barrier islands on the northern Texas coast that has improved infrastructure including roads, electricity, drinking water, and homes. The number of beach development permits on Follets Island has steadily increased from 20 to 115 in less than 5 years (2011-2015) (R. Newby, TGLO, personal communication, 2017). Acquisition and preservation of this property would prevent subdivision and development of the property, eliminate the threat of future developmental degradation of the ecological values of the property, and maintain its current ecological services into the future. birds, grassland birds, raptors, waterfowl, fish species, and many other types of wildlife found in the coastal region. The island also provides nesting habitat for threatened and endangered sea turtles as well as foraging and roosting habitat for a number of shorebirds, including the wintering piping plover and red knot, both federally threatened species. This project would also provide protection to the local watershed by preventing any future development that would increase sewage discharges into Christmas Bay, which TGLO identifies as one of the main threats to this bay system. Steps to acquiring the property include: 1) complete due diligence including appraisal, environmental assessment, survey and title search to ensure that the purchase costs are consistent with market values, that the property is not contaminated, that property boundaries are certain and clear, and that the tract's title is free and clear of objectionable encumbrances, 2) secure the property with a purchase contract, and 3) convey the land to TPWD. Due diligence for the land is already underway.\nThis project would acquire a parcel of land that would be conveyed to the USFWS as a part of the Mid-Coast NWR Complex. The proposed land tract is located in Matagorda County near East Matagorda Bay (Figure 3-16). The project area is composed of several coastal habitat types that include 245 acres of saline coastal prairie dominated by gulf cordgrass, 525 acres of estuarine intertidal emergent wetlands dominated by marshhay cordgrass and smooth cordgrass, and 30 acres of palustrine emergent wetlands dominated by spike rush and rushes. The area is able to support a diverse and abundant estuarine assemblage of plants and animals including secretive marsh birds, wading birds, invertebrates such as shrimp and crabs, as well as juvenile and adult estuarine fish. The tract is adjacent to estuarine waters, a county road, and nearby electrical service and has the potential for subdivision for recreational home site development. The tract is within the San Bernard NWR acquisition boundary. Big Boggy, San Bernard, and Brazoria NWRs are all managed by the USFWS under the Texas Mid-Coast NWR.  North American Landbird Conservation Plan (Rich, et al. 2004) and Gulf Coast Prairie Bird Conservation Region (Vermillion, et al. 2008 Steps to acquiring the property include: 1) complete due diligence including appraisal, environmental assessment, survey and title search to ensure that the purchase costs are consistent with market values, that the property is not contaminated, that property boundaries are certain and clear, and that the tract's title is free and clear of objectionable encumbrances, 2) secure the property with a purchase contract, and 3) convey the tract to USFWS for the Texas Mid-Coast NWR.\nThe project area is located on Matagorda Peninsula and is bordered to the north by East Matagorda Bay, to the south the Gulf of Mexico, to the west by the Colorado River, and to the east by TPWD properties (Figure 3 -17). Matagorda Peninsula is situated within the Gulf Prairies and Marshes ecological region. The land surrounding East Matagorda Bay is mostly in private ownership but is relatively undeveloped. Much of the land north of East Matagorda Bay is within large ranches or is protected as part of Big Boggy NWR. Eastern portions of the peninsula adjacent to the project area were acquired by TPWD largely through RESTORE Act Bucket 2 funding, though some portions remain in private ownership. Areas to the west of the proposed acquisition area contains a Lower Colorado River Authority park recently enhanced in size through a NFWF GEBF grant, as well as limited residential dwellings.  Preservation of beach to bay habitat on the peninsula would remedy harm to a wide range of natural resources of types affected by the Incident. The project area has high quality habitat consisting of beaches, dunes, marshes, tidal flats, salt prairie, as well as other habitats. These areas would provide habitat for a diversity of wildlife including butterflies, neo-tropical song birds, grassland birds, raptors, waterfowl, fish species, and many other types of wildlife found in the coastal region. The peninsula also provides nesting habitat for threatened and endangered sea turtles as well as foraging and roosting habitat for the endangered whooping crane and for shorebirds, including the wintering piping plover and red knot, both federally threatened species. This project would also provide protection to the local watershed by preventing any future development that would increase discharges into East Matagorda Bay. Development pressure would continue to increase as the Galveston area continues to expand and increase in population. Land just west of the project area has already been converted to residential dwellings. Acquisition and preservation of this property would prevent subdivision and development of the property, eliminate the threat of future development and associated degradation of the ecological values of the property, and maintain its existing current ecological services into the future. Steps to acquiring the property include: 1) complete due diligence including appraisal, environmental assessment, survey and title search to ensure that the purchase costs are consistent with market values, that the property is not contaminated, that property boundaries are certain and clear, and that the tract's title is free and clear of objectionable encumbrances, 2) secure the property with a purchase option to ensure the owner would not sell it during negotiations, and 3) convey the land to TPWD.\nThis project would acquire a parcel of land that would be conveyed to the USFWS as a part of the LANWR. This tract is part of the larger Bahia Grande Coastal Corridor, which consists of 105,000 acres that link the globally significant Laguna Madre (one of seven hypersaline lagoons in the world) region of South Texas and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The USFWS and its partners have identified 7,000 acres within the Corridor that it has prioritized for acquisition to reduce development risk to the habitat. The corridor itself includes the LANWR, Boca Chica State Park, and the Lower Rio Grande Valley NWR. The proposed tract is located north of Bahia Grande and west of the Lower Laguna Madre ( Figure  3 -18). This tract would add considerable water frontage, emergent and submergent wetlands, and transitional habitats to the habitat complex along with another tract recently acquired through funds from the Migratory Bird Conservation Act and NFWF GEBF awards.  Over time, increased population growth and associated development along the coast have fragmented land, converted prairies, changed river flows, decreased water quality, and increased sediment loads and pollutants within marsh and estuarine systems of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Specifically, threats to wildlife habitat include land fragmentation driven by rising land prices, roads, industrial facilities, and proposed wind power development. The tract is currently vacant land and proposed for residential development by nearby communities. As a result of the proposed use, TPWD, USFWS, and the many conservation partners are concerned about the fragmentation of large tracts of shore land, wetlands, and thorn scrub in the area, and the impacts that development would have on these fragile areas. Because this property is in imminent threat of being developed, this tract has been identified as a necessary acquisition needed to protect the corridor.\nThis project would acquire a parcel of coastal property on South Padre Island that would be conveyed to the USFWS to be held as a part of the LANWR. The 1,682-acre tract is located on South Padre Island, Texas and is located within the approved expansion boundary of the LANWR. The tract straddles the island and includes healthy, intact examples of all the island's habitats, including Gulf beach, dunes, vegetated and unvegetated flats, and bayside marshes on the Laguna Madre that protect significant shallow water habitats including seagrass beds. The tract includes three-quarters of a mile of Gulf beach in an area known to be used for nesting by threatened and endangered sea turtles, including the Kemps"}, {"section_title": "Completion of the Oyster Restoration", "text": "Engineering project would result in one or more shovel-ready oyster restoration projects that could be readily implemented at a later date. The implementation and construction of these projects would be presented to the public for consideration in a future restoration plan."}, {"section_title": "3.2.1.2", "text": "OPA Evaluation The OPA evaluation of the proposed Oyster Restoration Engineering Project using the criteria established by the OPA regulations in 15 CFR \u00a7990.54(a) is described below."}, {"section_title": "Cost-Effectiveness", "text": "The cost of the proposed Oyster Restoration Engineering project is comparable to past projects of a similar scope and is cost-effective in comparison. The project includes a significant planning component focused on identifying the most cost-effective oyster restoration methodologies. Through the implementation of this project, the Texas TIG expects to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the oyster restoration projects that are developed as a result of this engineering project as well as other subsequent actions to protect and restore oyster habitats in the Galveston Bay System.\nThe cost for the project is based on similar past projects and is cost-effective in comparison. By implementing the restoration in phases, the Texas TIG expects to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of any subsequent actions to protect and restore the estuarine habitats, including wetlands, in Bird Island Cove.\nThe cost for the project is based on similar past projects and is cost-effective in comparison. By implementing the restoration in phases, the Texas TIG expects to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of any subsequent actions to protect and restore the estuarine habitats, including wetlands, in in Essex Bayou and the Slop Bowl Marsh. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nThe cost for the project is based on similar past projects and is cost-effective in comparison. This process of habitat restoration accomplished through partnering with USACE to beneficially use sediments from USACE maintenance dredging is a widely used restoration technique and has proven to be very cost effective in application. In this restoration implementation partnership, the Texas TIG is responsible for the incremental costs of the project above that which the USACE would normally incur from placing dredged material in upland placement cells. There are also costs associated with seeking out and permitting candidate restoration sites that would benefit from BUDM. This project is designed to increase the efficiency of that process for eight restoration sites through development of a Master Plan for the Texas Coast. By developing the Master Plan, the Texas TIG expects to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of subsequent actions to protect and restore wetland habitats.\nThe estimated cost of this project is comparable to the pilot project as well as other beach renourishment projects in Texas. Habitat restoration through the placement of significant volumes of sediment by dredging from approved submerged sediment borrow sites is much more cost effective than trucking material from terrestrial sources, resulting in a lower unit cost for material. The cost for trucking material for shoreline restoration has been shown to be two to three times more costly than dredging for similar sized projects. Although the mobilization and demobilization costs for dredging projects can be up to twice the amount for a truck hauling project, the economy of scale of very large dredge placement projects typically results in exponentially lower total project costs. Information gained during the construction of the pilot project will be used to improve methods and cost-effectiveness, where applicable. Based on the information above, this project is considered cost effective. This project would only be implemented if funding through other sources becomes available so that the entire 20-mile section of beach described in the USACE permit can be completed. The Texas TIG would implement this project as part of a coordinated effort of all funding sources so that the construction is Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters one continuous effort. This increases cost-effectiveness by decreasing the need for multiple mobilization and demobilization efforts and their associated costs.\nThe Texas TIG conducted an extensive screening process that included an evaluation of the cost effectiveness of the submitted projects. BUDM is a cost effective method for restoring intertidal marsh as the technique takes advantage of ongoing projects to provide the sediments needed for restoring marsh elevation. Using these sediments greatly reduces costs as the Texas TIG only proposes funding the sediment placement portion of the project. The estimated cost for the project is based on past projects that were completed in the same area utilizing the same methods. The cost-effectiveness of this project is further enhanced as the final E&D costs are being funded through RESTORE Act Bucket 2 funding. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nThe cost for the project is based on similar projects that have been implemented to restore Pierce Marsh through the BUDM from the GIWW in the past and is cost-effective in comparison. Habitat restoration through the placement of significant volumes of sediment by way of beneficially reusing material from USACE maintenance dredging is much more cost effective than incorporating new dredging into the project activities. USACE maintenance dredging occurs year-round, and would occur regardless of the implementation of this project. Beneficially utilizing material that has been previously Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters dredged is much more cost effective in comparison to contracting an independent dredging operation to harvest new material where the permitting, equipment, and mobilization/demobilization costs are much higher. Because this project is phased through different funding partners, the Texas TIG expects to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the subsequent actions to protect and restore the intertidal marsh habitat of Pierce Marsh.\nEstimated costs for this project are significantly higher than similar restoration projects which provide comparable levels of ecological improvements proposed in this RP/EA. The inclusion of breakwaters as part of this project is needed to help slow erosion of the marsh terraces, but it greatly increases the average cost for each acre of marsh restored. For example, the Pierce Marsh Wetland Restoration project is expected to restore marsh at a cost of about $21,000 per acre while Dollar Bay and Moses Lake Wetlands Restoration project would restore marsh at a cost of about $282,000 per acre. Additionally, the longevity of marsh terraces is not expected to be as great as the other restoration projects, leading to the need for protective breakwaters and the high cost per acre.\nThe cost for the proposed breakwaters is based on a similar project that was constructed directly adjacent to the project area and is cost-effective in comparison to reconstructing each of the high functioning existing habitats (seagrass beds, tidal pools, sand/shell beaches, and wetlands), which would be lost to erosion if the project is not constructed. In addition, the multiple ecosystem services provided along Indian Point would be difficult to replicate in a cost effective manner compared to the actual cost to construct the breakwaters to protect the current services within the project area.\nThe cost for this project is based on initial E&D of project activities. This project presents a unique restoration alternative for the state of Texas; no similar project at this scale has yet been implemented. However, the Texas Trustee agencies have undertaken similarly-scaled efforts to restore 10,000 acres of wetland habitat with different restoration techniques, including acquisition, wetland construction, or installation of water control structures. In comparison, the Bahia Grande Hydrologic Restoration project presents a very cost-effective way of restoring such a large acreage of habitat while simultaneously working within a relatively small footprint for construction. Moreover, a pilot-scale version of this project was implemented in 2005. The Texas TIG expects an increase of the effectiveness and efficiency of this subsequent action to protect and restore the estuarine wetland habitats of Bahia Grande.\nThis proposed acquisition focused project is a cost effective way to conserve and protect habitat. This project would prevent development on coastal barrier island habitat that would degrade the ecological services provided within the boundaries of the specific tracts acquired as well as adjacent habitat. Habitat preservation is sometimes more effective than restoration at providing high quality natural habitat as other options such as habitat construction require a significant period of time to mature, provide a full suite of services, and reach the same level of services provided by existing natural wetland systems. That is certainly the case with respect to the Follets Island tracts given the expense that would be incurred trying to replicate the beach to bay habitats on site. The purchase price of the land would be based on a recent appraisal, so that the Texas TIG can be assured of not expending more than the current market value to acquire the tracts. As part of the screening process, this project budget was determined to be reasonable and relatively cost-effective considering benefits of the project relative to its cost and also considering the timeline provided to complete the project activities. Compared to other barrier island habitat parcels available for purchase along the upper Texas coast, this project is more cost-effective. In general, other available similar tracts that stretch from the beachfront to the bay on nearby Galveston Island are much more expensive than land on Follets Island due to market forces.\nThe estimated cost of the proposed land acquisition ($2,082,000) is similar to past projects and costeffective in comparison. The cost for the project is based on similar past projects and reflects comparable costs associated with land realty sales regionally. Most of the project area contains both low marsh and high marsh habitats, which would allow for marsh migration and support resources that depend on either habitat type or both during their life cycle. Substantial shoreline habitat is associated with the tract and the acquisition of this parcel would protect important shallow water habitats from threats associated with land development. This proposed acquisition project is a cost effective way to conserve and protect habitat by preventing development on coastal habitat that would degrade the ecological services provided within the boundaries of the specific tract acquired as well as adjacent habitat. Habitat preservation is sometimes more effective than restoration at providing high quality natural habitat as other options such as habitat construction require a significant period of time to mature, provide a full suite of services, and reach the same level of services provided by existing natural systems. That is certainly the case with respect to the Texas Mid-Coast Habitat Acquisition given the expense that would be incurred trying to create or replicate the habitats present. The purchase price of the land would be based on a recent appraisal to ensure the acquisition would be in line with current market value.

That is certainly the case with respect to the Matagorda Peninsula land acquisition given the expense that would be incurred trying to replicate the beach to bay habitats present. The purchase price of the land would be based on a recent appraisal, so the Texas TIG can be assured of not spending more than the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters current market value to acquire the land.

Remaining project costs are expected to be borne by mitigation funds, and private and public grants. The cost for the project is based on similar past projects and reflects comparable costs associated with land sales regionally.

As part of the screening process, this project budget was determined to be reasonable and relatively cost-effective considering the benefits of the project relative to its cost and also considering the timeline provided to complete the project activities. The acquisition would be a cost-effective approach to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats. Through acquiring the tract, the Texas TIG expects to increase protected lands in the Bahia Grande Coastal Corridor, which would be maintained and protected by the USFWS, specifically the LANWR.\nThe estimated cost of the proposed land acquisition ($5,397,000) is similar to past projects and costeffective in comparison. The cost for the project is based on similar past projects and reflects comparable costs associated with land realty sales regionally. This proposed acquisition project is a cost effective way to conserve and protect habitat by preventing development on coastal habitat that would degrade the ecological services provided within the boundaries of the specific tract acquired as well as adjacent habitat. Habitat preservation is sometimes more effective than restoration at providing high quality natural habitat as other options such as habitat construction require a significant period of time to mature, provide a full suite of services, and reach the same level of services provided by existing natural systems. That is certainly the case with respect to the Laguna Atascosa Habitat Acquisition given the expense that would be incurred trying to create or replicate the habitats present. The purchase price of the land would be based on a recent appraisal to ensure the acquisition would be in line with current market value. As part of the screening process, this project budget was determined to be reasonable and relatively cost-effective considering benefits of the project relative to its cost and also considering the timeline provided to complete the project activities. The acquisition of this project would be a costeffective approach to protect and conserve marine, coastal, and estuarine habitats.

These past projects often included the participation of restoration experts from federal, state, and nonprofit entities, as well as the services of professional coastal engineers. This documented experience and successful completion of previous projects demonstrates that the project would have a high likelihood of success. The Oyster Restoration Engineering project uses proven techniques with established methods and documented results, and can be implemented with minimal delay. As a result, the project is considered feasible. Additionally, the identification of BMPs resulting from the Oyster Restoration Engineering project would further increase the likelihood of success of future restoration actions. The project would also benefit from similar ongoing oyster restoration projects in Texas.\nThe Landscape Approach to Oyster Reef Restoration is technically feasible, and uses proven techniques with established methods and documented results, and can be implemented with minimal delay. Texas Trustee agencies have successfully implemented restoration construction projects similar in scale and complexity to the Landscape Approach to Oyster Reef Restoration project, such as the Keller Bay Oyster Reef Restoration project and the Restoration of Buried Oyster Reefs in Galveston Bay project, and have participated in the planning, design, and oversight of several oyster restoration projects. Each of these past projects were reviewed by the public and met all environmental conditions and requirements. The sink and source reef methodology proposed in this project has already been applied to modelling oyster restoration efforts in Virginia (Lipcius et al. 2008) and North Carolina (Haase et al. 2012) and has been demonstrated empirically in one case in Virginia (Schulte et al. 2009). The TWDB previously Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters assisted TPWD in 2007 in modelling larval transport, survival, and travel time using the TxBLEND subroutine to successfully site and configure oyster mitigation reefs in Galveston and Matagorda bays. The documented experience and successful completion of these previous projects demonstrates the project has the potential to succeed. However, a greater degree of certainty and likelihood of success could be achieved through an analysis of alternative construction methodologies and more detailed engineering plans. There is also a great deal of uncertainty in predicting the long term success and sustainability of the ecological services associated with the harvestable sink reefs. The longevity and nature of the ecological benefits derived from these reefs may vary significantly, depending upon the level of fishing intensity they receive.\nTexas Trustee agencies have successfully implemented projects similar to the project (contracting for the development of E&D for wetland restoration). This documented experience and successful completion of previous projects demonstrates that the project would have a high likelihood of success.

This documented experience, use of similar construction techniques, and successful completion of previous projects demonstrates that the project would have a high likelihood of success. Additionally, the public as well as federal, state, and tribes previously had the opportunity to review and comment on this project through the USACE permitting process (USACE 2016a). Lessons learned during the pilot project which involved depositing sand along approximately 3 miles of beach will be valuable in undertaking the planning for the completion of the entire project and increase the likelihood of success. This project is technically feasible and uses proven techniques with established methods and documented results. This project would not be undertaken unless there is sufficient funding available from the various sources to ensure that the entire length of the project can be completed.\nTexas Trustee agencies have successfully implemented marsh restoration projects in Bessie Heights using the same marsh restoration techniques proposed to be utilized in this project. This project would be built upon those previous efforts. The Texas TIG and WMA management staff have engaged with the USACE and built a partnership that would facilitate the completion of this project. TPWD WMA management have also coordinated with private industry in the vicinity and there is an interest in using sediment from private dredging projects for marsh restoration in Bessie Heights. The history of marsh restoration in Bessie Heights and the partnerships in place lead to a high probability of success for this project.\nThe proposed marsh restoration technique has been successfully used in previous restoration projects within the project area. The GBF has spent the last 15 years restoring wetlands within Pierce Marsh. Since the late 1990s, GBF has restored 425 acres of emergent estuarine marsh at the site through five projects: a 53-acre terracing project in 1999; a 45-acre terracing project in 2001; a 25-acre terracing project in 2003; a 280-acre BUDM marsh restoration project in 2005-08; and a 22-acre terracing project in 2010. The most recent project to utilize beneficial use material at the site was completed in 2016 and consisted of a partnership and coordination between the GBF, USACE, and Texas Trustees. The project would build upon the success of the 2016 project, taking advantage of the ongoing and similar work in this and nearby areas.

The project is organizationally feasible in that the Texas Trustees have implemented similar projects successfully in the past.\nThis project uses methods successfully employed at many other habitat restoration sites around Galveston Bay to raise elevations and reestablish estuarine intertidal marsh. The methods and technology applied to estuarine marsh protection and restoration in Galveston Bay have been tried and developed over the past several decades. Marsh terraces have been successfully constructed within the northern Texas coastal area. Shoreline protection work has been demonstrated at numerous high wave energy project sites around Galveston Bay with successful results in reducing erosion, accreting sediments, reestablishing fringing marsh, and providing hard substrate suitable for oyster development. Prior shoreline erosion protection work along portions of the Moses Lake and Dollar Bay shorelines has been successfully implemented over the past 10+ years and has resulted in abatement of erosion issues and reestablishment of fringing marsh along portions of the project shoreline. This documented experience and successful completion of previous projects demonstrates that the project would have a high likelihood of success. The project is technically feasible, takes advantage of similar ongoing work in this and nearby areas, and uses proven techniques with established methods and documented results.\nTexas Trustee agencies have successfully implemented projects similar to the project (construction of rock breakwaters). This documented experience and successful completion of previous projects demonstrates that the project would have a high likelihood of success. The project is technically feasible, uses proven techniques with established methods and documented results, and can be implemented with minimal delay because the permits, engineering, and easements have been obtained or completed.\nThis project is part of an ongoing effort in the area to restore the Bahia Grande Unit of the LANWR. An initial pilot channel was successfully constructed in 2005 and resulted in a 2.5% tidal exchange between Bahia Grande and the ship channel. This project would build on the success of the earlier pilot channel, following the same alignment as the existing channel footprint. This project is already permitted through USACE (USACE 2016b). Initial E&D efforts included extensive modelling of channel width relative to anticipated tidal inflow into the system. As a part of this exercise, historical wind and water level data were acquired from monitoring stations around Bahia Grande (CHE 2011). Bathymetry, topography, and geotechnical data were also collected to assist in understanding project site conditions and numerical modeling of coastal processes. The engineering study calculated the maximum possible average flow rate through the channel, developed potential project alternatives, and concluded that the project represents the most efficient design maximizing potential flow rate from the navigation channel to the Bahia Grande Unit. After the RP/EA was released to the public and the project was identified as a possible alternative, the Trustees were made aware that on June 7, 2017 the Port of Brownsville (the Port) executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with NextDecade Corporation and its subsidiary, Rio Grande LNG, LLC (together, NextDecade) that gave NextDecade exclusive rights to implement this project to generate mitigation credits for construction of a proposed liquid natural gas (LNG) facility within the Port of Brownsville. However, after execution of the MOU, the Port's Board of Directors indicated to the TX TIG that if the Bahia Grande Project were selected in the Final RP/EA, the Port's preference would be to have the Texas TIG move forward with construction of the project. On October 3, 2017, the Texas TIG received letters from the Port and NextDecade wherein the Port and NextDecade agreed to amend the exclusivity clause in their MOU to allow the Trustees to construct the project. In addition, the letters stated that the MOU will be modified to expire upon the date that the Trustees initiate construction of the project. The Port and Next Decade agreed that neither would seek to obtain mitigation credits for any part of the project implemented by the Texas TIG as part of NRDA restoration. The letters acknowledged that if the Port and NextDecade are not able to modify the MOU to the satisfaction of the Texas TIG, the Texas TIG may not implement the project, and the funds dedicated to the project would be utilized for a future NRDA restoration project. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Prevent Future Injury and Avoid Collateral Injury Initial E&D geotechnical studies evaluated environmental consequences of several different project design techniques and identified BMPs to minimize injury during implementation (CHE 2011). That analysis indicated that adverse effects from the project would largely be minor, localized, and often of short duration. In addition, any BMPs and measures to avoid and minimize impacts that have been identified during the permitting process or during consultations and reviews with natural resource agencies would be implemented. Because of this existing extensive analysis that was completed prior to USACE permitting in 2016, the Texas TIG is confident that this project would minimize future and collateral injury to other resources and projects in the area.\nThe Texas Trustee agencies have successfully implemented projects similar to the project (acquiring and preserving coastal lands).

Texas Trustee agencies and associated conservation partners have successfully implemented projects similar to the project. These include land acquisition projects that were ultimately deeded to non-profits, state or federal government agencies. Some of these include TNC, TPWD, GBF, USFWS, CBBEP, and the National Park Service.

Subsequent oyster restoration projects implemented from the design developed from this Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters project would also provide recreational fishing and birdwatching opportunities, improvements in water quality, and a reduction in erosion of adjacent sediments.\nIn addition to providing the ecological functions of oysters (water quality maintenance, food sources for predators, ecosystem engineering) the restored reefs would be expected to provide benefits to aquatic and avian resources and provide shoreline protection for surrounding areas. Restoration of oysters would also benefit the oyster fishery in Upper Galveston Bay.\nThe Bird Island Cove Habitat Restoration Engineering project would develop plans to benefit multiple resources including but not limited to birds, fish, crabs, and other wildlife; as well as recreational opportunities for fishing and birding; improvements in water quality; and a reduction in erosion through the eventual creation of wetland habitat.\nThis E&D project would develop plans to benefit multiple resources. If E&D plans are implemented in a subsequent phase of restoration, the restoration project would provide habitat for fauna such as birds, fish, crabs, wetland plants, etc.; improve recreational opportunities for fishing and birding; and improve water quality.\nThis E&D project would develop a Master Plan to benefit multiple resources. If the Master Plan is implemented in one or more subsequent phases of restoration, future restoration project(s) would provide habitat for fauna such as birds, fish, crabs, etc.; recreational opportunities for fishing and birding; improvements in water quality; reduction in erosion; and increased resiliency and storm protection.\nThis project would benefit multiple resources. This project would restore the lost beach ridge and would directly benefit sand beach and dune habitat and its associated fauna, including birds, crabs, and potentially sea turtles. Indirectly, this project would benefit the entire Salt Bayou system (flora and fauna) by preventing regular influxes of salt water, which have caused a shift in species utilization and accelerated conversion of marsh to open water (i.e., land loss).\nThis project provides benefits to multiple resources. Beyond restoring wetlands, coastal, and nearshore habitat within the Salt Bayou and Lower Neches River watersheds, this project would provide benefit to a variety of fauna injured by the Incident (e.g., crabs, birds, fish, etc.) that use the interconnected habitats (marsh, sand flat, and protected shallow water) in the project area.\nThis project provides benefits to multiple resources. Beyond restoring and conserving wetlands, coastal, and nearshore habitat, this restoration project would provide habitat for a variety of ecologically and economically important fauna such as birds, fish, crabs, and many other benthic species. The Galveston Bay watershed provides important habitat for wildlife, including migratory waterfowl, ducks, and wading birds and also serves as a valuable nursery and breeding habitat for numerous estuarine-dependent sport and commercial fish and shellfish. The principal commercial and recreational fishery species of Galveston Bay rely on estuarine marsh during at least some part of their life cycle. The marsh edge is a particularly important habitat for white and brown shrimp (Whaley and Minello 2002). Other marsh dwelling species include blue crab, red drum, spotted seatrout, Southern flounder, and Gulf menhaden. Estuarine marsh acts a nursery to hundreds of non-commercial species that comprise a large part of the bay food web. Bird species, such as snowy egrets, great egrets, roseate spoonbills, tri-colored herons, black-crowned night herons and great blue herons use marsh as feeding habitat. All of these resources would benefit from the creation of additional useable habitat in Pierce Marsh.\nThis project would benefit multiple resources including marsh habitat, hard bottom substrate, protected shallow waters, and associated wildlife including birds, fish, crabs, and oysters. Protection and restoration of wetland habitats within the Galveston Bay System would also benefit a variety of fauna injured by the Incident (e.g., crabs, birds, fish, etc.) that use the interconnected habitats (marsh, hard structure, and protected shallow water) in the project area. This project would also improve water quality by reducing erosion and turbidity.\nThis project would implement construction of a series of breakwaters that would benefit multiple resources. The project would protect habitat for fauna such as birds, fish, crabs, etc.; recreational opportunities for fishing and birding; improve water quality; and reduce erosion. The construction of approximately 2,800 linear feet of rock breakwater would also create hard substrate habitat that would be similar to oyster reef habitat. While rock breakwaters differ from oyster reefs in their structure and formation, they are similar in habitat type and provide some of the same ecological services as reefs. The interstitial spaces between the rocks provide cover for many of the same crustacean and finfish species utilizing oyster reefs. In addition, rock breakwaters provide hard substrate for encrusting species of bivalves, bryozoans, polychaete worms, and barnacles. Avian species also utilize subaerial portions of the breakwaters for foraging and resting areas. The proposed breakwater would provide hard substrate habitat as well as protect other natural habitats (estuarine marsh and seagrass beds) that are rich and abundant in estuarine species.\nThis project would have benefits for multiple natural resources. With the restoration of historical tidal flooding to the basin, marine life including crabs, shellfish, various other invertebrates, and finfish would recolonize the bay. The uplands likewise should support more species than are presently there, and denser populations of native wildlife are an expected result. Not only would the project restore the hydrology and habitat of Bahia Grande, it would also contribute to a landscape-scale restoration effort in the Laguna Madre region and provide vital habitat for a variety of fauna; recreational opportunities for fishing and birding; improvements in water quality; and a reduction in erosion.\nBy acquiring and preserving land on a coastal island, this project would benefit multiple resources such as sea turtles, shorebirds, coastal marshes, dunes, and beaches. This project, if implemented, would benefit flora and fauna by enlarging the amount of protected habitat adjacent to Christmas Bay. This acquisition would protect existing habitat corridors and prevent any future development. This project would also enhance the human experience by providing access to passive recreational activities.\nBy acquiring and preserving land on a coastal island, this project would benefit multiple resources such as sea turtles, shorebirds, seagrasses, coastal marshes, dunes, beaches, and water quality.

Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Public Health and Safety This project would benefit health and safety by preserving coastal habitat that protects public resources and infrastructure further inland from storm impacts and by maintaining marshes that help improve water quality. The preservation of natural habitat would also help improve coastal resiliency. Additionally, this project would provide access to lands for public enjoyment.\nThe acquisition of the tract would benefit multiple resources as the project would ensure protection of multiple diverse habitats and the fauna that they support such as wading and shore birds and aquatic resources. Protection and management of the tract would also help meet habitat and population objectives of endangered species recovery plans. Additionally, under USFWS management, Federal Wildlife Officers and State Game Wardens would have jurisdiction over the property and could monitor and reduce non-compatible, destructive uses, such as off-road and all-terrain vehicle activity, on the habitats.\nThe acquisition of the tract would benefit multiple resources as the project would ensure protection of multiple diverse habitats and the fauna that they support such as wading and shore birds, crabs, and sea turtles.

Implementation of a subsequent phase of restoration would benefit health and safety by protecting an estuarine wetland system that protects Galveston Island from erosion.\nThe Dredged Material Planning for Wetland Restoration project would not affect public health and safety. This project would identify and prioritize eight restoration sites that are candidates for BUDM, and execute all field investigations and permitting necessary for each of those sites to be implementation-ready. Ultimately, this project is laying the groundwork for restoration that would improve public health and safety through a reduction in erosion and increased resiliency and storm protection for nearby communities.\nThis project would provide substantial benefits for public health and safety. Restoration of the beach ridge would ultimately help maintain the resiliency of the interior marshes that protect infrastructure including refineries, homes, and marine waterways from the impacts of severe storms.

All occupational and marine safety regulations and laws would be followed to ensure safety of all workers and monitors.\nThe final design of this project would include specifications to avoid negative impacts on public health and safety. Measures to maintain both commercial and recreational maritime safety would be coordinated with the USACE and the managers of the SNWW or other sources of dredged material. These measures would include routing the pipeline to avoid maritime traffic, marking the pipeline with signage and lighting as needed, submerging the pipeline in areas of high traffic and other measures as appropriate. The Texas TIG would work with the USACE and private industries to ensure that the sediments are free of contamination, including testing following the EPA Inland Testing Manual (EPA and USACE 1998). These measures and other identified during final design would be taken to avoid adversely impacting public health and safety. The creation of marsh can also benefit public safety by improving water quality and buffering storm surges.

Anticipated project outcomes (marsh creation) would increase the ability of the coastline to mitigate storm surges, which would benefit public safety.\nThis project would improve health and safety by restoring marshes and creating breakwaters, which would help decrease wave energy, abate storm impacts, and preserve the nearby public and private infrastructure. Implementation of this project would be managed to prevent impacts to health and safety.\nThis project would minimize adverse impacts to public health and safety during construction of the project by following specific BMPs in the Project Manual. In addition, construction of the breakwaters would benefit health and safety by protecting estuarine marsh systems that shield public infrastructure and residential areas from wave action and erosion. This project would improve coastal resiliency.\nThis project would have benefits to public health and safety. Currently, the Bahia Grande Unit of the LANWR is essentially dry and barren, despite some tidal benefits from the 2005 pilot project. Prior to the 2005 project, strong coastal winds regularly swept across the basin and raised dense clouds of salty, clay dust which blanket nearby communities (Ocean Trust 2009). By reestablishing tidal inflow to the area, the 2005 project helped to ameliorate the dust issue. This project would further reinforce the public health and safety benefits to nearby communities realized in this earlier project.\nThis project would benefit health and safety by preserving barrier island habitat that protects public resources and infrastructure further inland from storm impacts and by maintaining marshes that help improve water quality. Additionally, this project would provide access to lands for public enjoyment.\nThis proposed acquisition would have a benefit to public health and safety by preventing future development in an area that is at high risk of flooding from high tide events. The tract has a very low elevation and is subject to high and storm tide over wash events. Most of the tract is within the 100-year floodplain and is at risk from flooding or flooding and storm surge wave impacts (FEMA 2015). Development on the tract would be placed at a high risk level from damage during flood events.\nThis proposed acquisition would have a benefit to public health and safety. In addition to habitat linkages, this acquisition project would improve flood control and protect the towns of Laguna Vista and Port Isabel from dust and tropical weather related flooding. Protection of this parcel of land from development would also help mitigate impacts from storm surges.\nThis proposed acquisition would have a benefit to public health and safety.

The sediments would then be sculpted to create dune and beach features. A pilot project to restore the sand beach and dune along approximately 3 miles of shoreline was completed in August 2017. Information from the pilot project will be used to inform the final designs of the remaining shoreline length. After construction is completed, approximately 1,004 acres of beaches and dunes along 20 miles of shoreline would be restored. Dune elevation would be increased and approximately 30-40 cubic yards of sandy sediments would be deposited per linear foot of shoreline.\nProject proponents would engage the services of professional surveyors, coastal planners and coastal engineering firms to conduct site assessments and analyses, complete construction drawings, identify potential sources of dredged material, prepare permit applications to the USACE, and otherwise move the project to a shovel-ready state. Construction may require temporary trenches and channels to provide equipment access and routing of dredge pipelines to the restoration sites. The need for and location of temporary channels would be determined in the final E&D. All temporary channels would be backfilled upon completion of construction work. All sources of borrow material would be assessed for suitability from an engineering perspective and would be evaluated for environmental conditions to ensure sediments are uncontaminated and there are no significant impacts to cultural and sensitive resources. Hydraulic dredging utilizes in-situ water to mobilize the sediments through the pipeline. To achieve the target elevation for the restored wetlands, dredged material would be placed such that, after consolidation, elevations suitable to support intertidal marsh vegetation would be present. Mechanically excavated sediment from the existing substrates may be used to form temporary containment levees to contain the dredged material, facilitate dewatering and protect the restoration sites from erosion until vegetation is established. After dewatering, the site would be planted with native species such as smooth cordgrass. The plants would be propagated from upper Texas coast stocks. Specific methods and equipment used would be approved by a professional engineer (PE) and the project team that includes Texas TIG representatives and TPWD land managers prior to construction. Environmental considerations, BMPs, land use approvals, and permit requirements must be met regardless of methods and equipment chosen. These would be outlined in the bid specification package developed by the PE and contracting officers. This specification package would ensure that the contractor is made aware of the engineering specifications as well as any additional obligations they would incur associated with federal and state laws governing activities associated with the project. It would also provide the project related approvals needed by the project manager and the PE to conduct the project. In general, construction would require the use of barges, small watercraft, large track hoe excavators, earth moving equipment, cutterhead-hydraulic or clamshell dredges, and a dockside staging area. Equipment and materials for the construction activities would be transported via roads and marine waterways. Large equipment and materials moved by barges would use the established interconnected waterways. This may include the GIWW, SNWW, and/or other navigation channels. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Beneficial Use of Dredged Material Uncontaminated earthen fill material would be used to raise elevations. Fill material would be sourced from the SNWW or private navigation channels. Another method of BUDM is to mine existing USACE DMPAs that are associated with federally maintained navigation channels. These placement areas are maintained and operated as part of the SNWW federal project. Material would be mined using hydraulic excavation techniques. Environmental compliance requirements for the dredging and placement of material from the SNWW projects are maintained by USACE separate from the BUDM alternative addressed in this section. Screening for potential chemical contaminants would be conducted on a case-by-case basis. For sediments from federally maintained navigation channels or associated DMPAs, previously collected contaminant analysis and bioassay data would be obtained from the USACE Galveston District -Operations Branch records. For private industry docks and channels, state and federal resource agency personnel would be consulted to determine the amount of sampling and the type of chemical analyses that may be needed. All environmental reviews required for the placement of the material obtained as part of a beneficial use disposal process would be coordinated with the project (e.g. a navigation maintenance project) supplying the dredged material. Measures to control turbidity caused by construction activities, decanting water, and sediment movement would be in place to ensure water quality standards are met. These measures may include appropriate water control structures to decant water, as well as the installation of silt fences, hay bales, filter-fabric, and/or temporary levees to control sediments and avoid negative impacts associated with the fill placement. No known oyster reefs, other hard structure reef resources, or seagrass beds are present within or adjacent to the restoration sites that would require the use of significant control measures during project implementation. Either a hydraulic cutter-head dredge or clamshell dredge would be used, as these do not pose a risk to pelagic aquatic organisms such as sea turtles. Material would be transported to the placement area via a hydraulic dredge pipeline. The dredge pipeline would be routed to avoid disturbance to sensitive resource areas such as oyster reefs and seagrass beds if identified along the pipeline route. Any areas containing such resources in the construction area and pipeline route would be protected using BMPs such as hay bales, silt fences or other appropriate methods.\nIn general, construction would require the use of barges, small watercraft, large track hoe excavators, earth moving equipment, hydraulic dredges, and a dockside staging area.

The work includes mobilization/demobilization, surface preparation, placement of geotextile fabric, multiple hydrographic and topographic surveys for measurement and acceptances of placement, aerial photography, and other subsidiary work needed to facilitate the placement of the breakwaters. The project site has direct access Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters through an improved road. The contractor would access the breakwater construction corridor from the shore by utilizing the existing breakwaters, placing the geotextile fabric, and then placing the rock along the corridor until reaching the full extent of the project area. The contractor would then back out of the project area and remove sections of the riprap to create the gaps between the segmented breakwaters. This approach would limit the impacts to surrounding sensitive seagrass beds and fringe marsh. The final elevation for the breakwaters would have a still water elevation of 1 to 2 feet above the water line.

Similar to past projects, it is anticipated that the contractor would use the parking lot adjacent to the pier as a staging area. Breakwater/Armored Levee Breakwaters or armored levees would be installed to protect the sand beach, seagrass beds and wetlands from erosional forces. Graded stone, typically limestone, would be used to construct the breakwaters or armoring. The amount, grading, and size of rock used would be reviewed by the contracted engineer to ensure that the materials meet the specifications outlined in the engineer's project manual (TGLO 2014) developed for the breakwaters that were constructed in 2015. The project manual and engineering documents include the proposed six breakwaters that were not constructed during the previous phase of the project. These considerations, along with physical data collected since the construction of the previous revetment and two breakwaters, would be evaluated by a qualified coastal PE and the project team prior to placement of the additional stone materials.

Typical reasons for a project's slow Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters progress, lack of progress, or even failure can often be attributed to deficiencies in the project E&D (e.g., not adequately protected with breakwaters), construction (e.g., not built to engineered specifications), or planting (e.g., low planting densities or low survival) or a combination of these deficiencies. One reason for the project's lack of progress may be the unexpected shifting of hydraulically dredged sediments in response to environmental conditions affecting the ability of the planted vegetation to take hold and thrive. This project (Phase I) would evaluate the existing site conditions and determine appropriate corrective measures. The development of engineering plans would ensure the habitats are protected through a later phase of restoration (Phase II, not considered for funding in this RP/EA). Engineering tasks could include data collection (such as bathymetric/topographical survey, magnetometer survey, or soil borings in the potential borrow area); performance evaluation of the previous restoration project (completed in 2015); obtaining documents needed to receive USACE permit(s) for later construction; development of E&D plans; and determination of estimated construction costs. Sea level rise and other predicted changes in environmental conditions would be considered during the development of the E&D plans.

This project is proposing to fund about onethird of the estimated $45,000,000 total project cost. The Texas TIG would partner with other funding sources to complete construction implementation, monitoring, and/or planning activities. This project would provide important ecological benefits by restoring lost beach and dune habitat. The estimated cost of the Texas TIG proposed contribution towards this project is $15,874,000. The environmental impacts analysis under NEPA in this RP/EA incorporates by reference two other previously-conducted NEPA analyses and conclusions: 1 The project is not expected to significantly contribute to cumulative effects of (sic) any ESA-listed species. There would be a significant net benefit to the McFaddin NWR and shoreline. All adverse impacts [such as excavation and burying of macrobenthos, turbidity, and disturbance] associated with the construction of the dune ridge/beach nourishment project are considered shortterm and primarily restricted to the construction phase of the operation. No net cumulative impacts are expected as a result of sediment placement. Once sediments have been discharged and spread into associated configurations, new habitats are created for shorebirds and other wildlife. These actions would result in a wider and more stabilized beachhead that is intended to provide protection for the area infrastructure and wetlands for decades to come. This EA is inclusive of the project activities described herein and the EA considers the Incident in the analysis of the affected environment. Adverse impacts would be caused by the dredging and placement of sediments. These actions could cause increases in turbidity, burial of organisms, generation of GHG emissions and noise from the temporary use of heavy equipment. Disturbance would cause protected species as well as other fauna to relocate from the project area and temporary closures of recreation areas (including driving on beaches) to maintain public safety. These actions would negatively affect the viewshed. In addition to the habitats described in the USFWS EA (LJA Engineering 2016), the project area contains supratidal wetland marsh that is fairly uniform throughout the entire project area. The marsh is dominated by gulf cordgrass and bushy seaside tansy. For planning purposes, the Texas TIG is over estimated that there may be wetlands located along the entire project area (approximately 17 miles) and could extend 300 feet inland of the beach face. About 620 acres of wetland could potentially be present within the project area. Although there may be minor adverse impacts to wetlands from the restoration of the dunes and beaches (i.e., addition of material into the wetlands), the impacts would be offset by the protection that the restored dunes would provide to wetlands within McFaddin NWR. This project would benefit the 59,000 acres of wetlands within McFaddin NWR by providing a natural barrier to regular influxes of gulf waters that have caused marsh loss and erosion. The impacts from the project are largely beneficial and the adverse impacts are minor to moderate. Benefits to the physical resources, biological resources, and to human uses and socioeconomics would result if this project was implemented. A TGLO Coastal Surface Lease would be acquired prior to initiation of activities on state owned submerged water bottom to allow for construction activities. BMPs required in the permit, consultations, or environmental reviews would be followed. Additionally, BMPs described in Appendix 6.A of the Final PDARP/PEIS as well as Appendix B of this document would be considered and applied where appropriate, to reduce or eliminate impacts to the environment.

The borrow source area for this project contains roughly 4.1 million cubic yards of appropriate material and is located approximately 1.5 miles offshore of McFaddin NWR (Figure 3-5) in waters over 18 feet deep. Within the borrow area, underwater surveys identified well heads and a pipeline-like structure. Buffer zones ranging from 100 to 500 feet surrounding these features were mapped and would be avoided during construction. The likelihood of contamination is acceptably low and therefore the material from the borrow area does not require any additional evaluation. A clay sediment layer overlaying the sandy sediment would be excavated from the borrow area in order to access sandy material that would be used for beach and dune nourishment. The clay sediments would be placed in one of two placement areas adjacent to the borrow area that have water depths ranging from 20-28 feet. The depth of the placement area minimizes the potential for re-suspension and therefore minimizes impacts from turbidity. Sediments would be dredged from the borrow area using a rotating cutter-head dredge attached to a suction pipe that would be lowered to the seafloor to pick up material. As the material is depleted in each section of the borrow area, the dredge would be moved forward using a combination of spuds, mooring wires, and tender tugs. Material entering the suction pipe would pass through the dredge pump and be transported to the shoreline via a submerged pipeline. Depending on the distance between the dredge and the discharge point on the beach, booster pumps may be required. Uniform, Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters soft bottom substrate, and open gulf waters are located between the borrow area and the shoreline nourishment. The area contains no sensitive habitat. Slopes within the borrow area would not exceed (i.e. be steeper than) 5 horizontal: 1 vertical along the dredged boundaries to ensure integrity of the surrounding seabed (as cited in BOEM 2012). NOTE: Immediately prior to the publication of this Final RP/EA, the Texas TIG learned that, based on the results of a recently completed pilot study, it may be necessary to expand the existing borrow area or identify an additional borrow area. However, the actual ridge construction is not expected to change. Therefore, even if an expanded/additional borrow area becomes necessary, the Texas TIG does not anticipate a change to its evaluation under OPA. However, if the Texas TIG learns of any factors that could affect its OPA analysis (e.g., significant change in project costs, etc.), the Texas TIG will revisit its OPA evaluation of this project.\nUncontaminated earthen fill material would be used to raise elevations. Terrace material would be sourced from the project area. The marsh terraces would be created by excavating adjacent material and piling it into a terrace per design specifications. The borrow areas would be offset a minimum of 20 feet from the toe of the terraces. All sources of borrow material would be assessed for suitability from an engineering perspective and would be evaluated for environmental conditions to ensure there are no significant impacts to cultural and sensitive resources. Additionally, borrow sites would be evaluated for environmental conditions to ensure that any cultural and/or sensitive resources are avoided or properly addressed. The project location and design was based on several factors including the absence of sensitive resources (e.g. oyster reef, seagrasses), geotechnical and sediment quality, and nearby commercial and/or recreational activities. Excavation of material would occur as shallow as possible in order to prevent impacts to water quality, scouring, or the development of deep pockets in a naturally shallow bay system. Screening for potential chemical contaminants would be conducted if needed as part of the USACE permitting process. Local and regional knowledge of historical industrial activities as well as regulatory documentation on past and existing facilities in the vicinity of potential sediment borrow sources would be used to determine the likelihood and type of contaminants that might be expected to be encountered during construction. Based upon this information, USACE and state and federal resource agency personnel would be consulted to determine the amount of sampling and the type of chemical analyses that may be needed. Measures to control turbidity caused by construction activities, decant water, and sediment movement would be in place to ensure sensitive habitats are protected, water quality standards are met, and sensitive resources are not affected. These measures may include appropriate water control structures to decant water, as well as the installation of silt fences, hay bales, filter-fabric, and/or temporary levees to control sediments and avoid negative impacts associated with the fill placement. Breakwater/Armored Levee Breakwaters or armored levees would be installed to protect the shoreline from erosional forces. Graded stone, typically limestone, would be used to construct the breakwaters or armoring. The amount, grading, and size of rock used would be dependent on several factors determined in the final design. It is anticipated that the breakwaters would have a terrace crest width of 3 feet and a side slope of 2:1. Crest elevation is anticipated to be 2 feet above average water level. It is anticipated that a geotextile fabric would be placed under the breakwater structures to help limit scouring and settling. The source of the material is expected to be from known and existing limestone quarries used for coastal construction projects across the western Gulf of Mexico meeting standards specified for the project."}, {"section_title": "Beach and Dune Construction", "text": "Once the pipeline reaches the shore, it would be run parallel to shore until it reaches the active construction area. The active construction area is anticipated to be up to 2,000 feet along the shore. The active construction area would shift approximately 0 -1,000 feet per day as the project progresses. The dredged material would be deposited at the beach as a slurry of sea water and sand. Machinery on the beach would distribute the dredged material and manage the pipe location and extensions. Heavy equipment would be used to create containment dikes which would channelize the flow exiting the dredge pipe to allow the maximum percentage of solids to settle within the construction corridor, thereby minimizing turbidity impacts to the adjacent Gulf of Mexico waters. As this slurry runs along the beach, sediment would settle out within the project area and water would return to the ocean. As the new sandy material builds up in front of the pipe, heavy equipment would grade the material to meet the design specifications of the beach and dunes. Heavy equipment including bulldozers, graders, and other small and large tracked and wheeled vehicles may be used."}, {"section_title": "Vegetation Planting", "text": "Once the beach nourishment and sediment sculpting activities have been completed, the dunes would be planted with native dune species. The planting plan for the pilot project includes vegetating the dune crest as well as the dune side slopes using a row sprigging method. Sprigs would be placed in rows spaced 5 feet apart to a minimum of 1-inch depth. Planted vegetation includes sprigs of native species including bitter panicum, sea oats, sea purslane, and beach morning glory. A vegetation planting plan modified from and based on results from the pilot project would be developed prior to implementation. This plan would provide specifications for the species of native vegetation to be used; acceptable source stock; planting densities and locations for planting; survival performance criteria and corrective actions.\nPlanting of native vegetation would occur in two stages. First, once the earthen fill has dewatered and sediments have settled substantially enough, the marsh would be seeded and/or sprigged with native vegetation such as smooth cordgrass. This can help decrease the time it takes to dewater the sediments through evapotranspiration. During the second stage, once the material has settled to marsh elevations, unvegetated areas of the marsh would be planted with sprigs. Settlement could take between 1 to 5 years after initial construction. Colonization by invasive species is not likely, however there is potential for short-term growth of salt cedar. If encountered this plant and other invasive species would be removed by hand. In the long-term, these species would not survive inundation once the sediments compress to marsh elevation.\nPlanting of native vegetation would occur in two stages.

This planting would likely be within 1 to 5 years after initial construction. Specific targeted number of acres for vegetative plantings for the marsh site would be developed concurrently with the E&D phase of this project. Vegetation success would be monitored as a part of the project's MAM plan.\nThe target elevation for the marsh restoration area would take into account relative-sea level rise and would be sufficient to support emergent or high marsh vegetation. The marsh restoration area would be planted with smooth cordgrass. A Vegetation Planting Plan modified from and based on the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Publication NRCS-TX-612 would be developed prior to implementation (NRCS 2013). This plan would provide acceptable source stock; planting densities and locations for planting; survival targets; and adaptive management strategies. Expected plant cover is approximately 60% at the end of the 5-year monitoring period. Time of year as well as substrate salinity would determine the timing for planting."}, {"section_title": "Construction Schedule", "text": "Construction activities are planned to occur year-round due to the high cost of equipment mobilization associated with this project.

If incorporated, any data from TGLO monitoring would be publicly available. Appropriate lease(s) or modifications to existing leases from TGLO would be obtained prior to implementing the proposed restoration actions.\nFinal engineering, design, and permitting for the project is estimated to be completed in approximately 12 months. Dredged material placement done in coordination with the USACE would be dependent on the dredging schedule of the SNWW. The schedule for the use of dredged material from private industry sources would depend on the timing of construction and maintenance of those facilities.\nCurrently, the project area within Pierce Marsh is comprised of open water and unvegetated levees; therefore, there is no nesting habitat present and construction could occur anytime during the year. Construction and dredged material placement must be done in coordination with the USACE dredging schedule. It is estimated that the next window of availability for this coordination may be 2018. The E&D for this project was funded in 2017 through the RESTORE Act and is estimated to take 6 months to complete once these design activities have begun. Project construction may span either one or two USACE maintenance dredging cycles to gather sufficient material for marsh restoration. Project construction is not expected to take longer than 6 months if only one dredge cycle is needed for sufficient material. The timing of contracting awards and weather conditions could impact the construction schedule. To prevent disturbance to nearby residential communities, construction activities that produce significant noise or require precision, such as dredging and placing material, would be limited to daylight hours.\nActivities associated with construction are not expected to take longer than 1 year.

The description and analysis of the project below are based on a project-specific preliminary design concept rather than detailed engineering plans. Throughout the design process, every practical attempt would be made to avoid and minimize potentially adverse environmental and cultural resource impacts. The following descriptions for each of the construction elements are preliminary and based on current planning efforts and resource agency experience with similar projects. While the Texas TIG does not consider it likely, it is possible that the E&D process could generate a plan that has environmental impacts that are different in type or magnitude from those discussed in this document. If that is the case, the Texas TIG would consider whether further environmental impacts analysis would be necessary. The impacts from the project are largely beneficial and adverse impacts are minor. Benefits to the physical, biological, and human uses and socioeconomics would result if this project was implemented. BMPs required in the permit, consultations, or environmental reviews would be followed. Additionally, BMPs described in Appendix 6.A of the Final PDARP/PEIS as well as Appendix B of this document would be considered and applied where appropriate, to reduce or eliminate impacts to the environment.

The project would protect the existing shoreline from wind and wave driven erosion and protect the remaining marsh and associated coastal habitats adjacent to the shoreline. The estimated cost for the project is $2,199,000. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters 3.3.8.1 Project Description This project would construct approximately 2,800 linear feet of graded rip-rap breakwaters at Indian Point Park in Portland, Nueces County, Texas. The breakwaters would protect adjacent seagrass beds and stabilize the shoreline which would lead to a reduction in the loss of valuable wetland habitats. The project would significantly reduce wind driven wave action from Corpus Christi Bay by breaking and dissipating the energy. The project proposal consists of six segmented breakwaters that would extend from a previously constructed shoreline revetment and two breakwaters. The initial structures were completed in the spring of 2015 with a TGLO Coastal Erosion Planning and Response Grant in partnership with Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries Program. The E&D, permitting, and easement included eight breakwaters; however, due to lack of funding only two were constructed. Without the additional six breakwaters, the sensitive marsh and lagoon habitats within Indian Point Park are susceptible to continued erosion and saltwater intrusion. The park is owned by the City of Portland and the surrounding submerged lands are owned by the Port of Corpus Christi. Coastal Bend Bays and Estuary Program and the TGLO are authorized to complete the construction of the breakwaters through a current easement with the Port of Corpus Christi on the southeastern side of the peninsula, within the current project footprint. The six segmented breakwaters would be about 200-500 feet in length with approximately 30-foot gaps between each segment. The breakwaters would be placed at a minimum of 20 feet away from the nearest seagrasses. The structures would impact approximately 2 acres of non-vegetated bay-bottom. Breakwaters would be constructed with approximately three to four cubic yards of rock fill per linear foot of breakwater. Indian Point is located within the Nueces Estuary system which is one of the major estuary systems in Texas (Figure 3-11). The estuary spans 106,990 acres and is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by a barrier island system. The estuary has two direct connections to the Gulf through Packery Channel and Aransas Pass and receives about 378,000 acre-feet of freshwater inflow each year from the Nueces River Basin and Oso Creek (Asquith et al. 1997).  The typical habitats that occur in the Nueces Estuary are riverine, salt marshes, algal flats, seagrass beds, open bays, scrub/shrub uplands, oyster reefs, and sand and shell beaches. The project area is at the southwestern end of a peninsula that separates Nueces Bay (west-northwest) from the upper part of Corpus Christi Bay (south-southeast). Adjacent to the project area is a very productive and complex mosaic of habitats that include sand and shell beaches, dunes, seagrass beds, tidal flats, scrub/shrub uplands, intertidal and high saltmarsh, and lagoons. The area supports a highly diverse community of flora and fauna. The estuarine subtidal habitats and intertidal and high marsh on Indian Point are sustained by tidal exchange. The palustrine wetlands are dependent on rainfall. The predominant vegetation in these areas includes bushy seaside tansy, Virginia glasswort and dwarf saltwort. The estuarine-emergent marshes are fringe areas along open water lagoons and support smooth cordgrass. These lower mashes occur within the normal tidal range and then transition to higher elevations that support high marsh species such as turtle weed, Virginia glasswort, dwarf saltwort, and shoregrass. As the elevation transitions to uplands, it is dominated by shoregrass which forms thick mats. The adjacent 20-acre subtidal seagrass beds include species such as shoal grass and widgeon grass. The project would protect a mosaic of estuarine marsh, tidal lagoons, and sand/shell water interfaces that are crucial habitat to numerous commercial and recreational inter-jurisdictional estuarine fishery species. These species include brown and white shrimp, blue crab, Gulf menhaden, sand seatrout, southern flounder, red drum, bay anchovy, and other marine organisms. Juvenile penaeid shrimp, blue crabs, and other nekton are abundant in coastal salt marshes of Corpus Christi Bay. Estuarine marsh habitat is critical for larval, post-larval, and juvenile stages of many species. For example, the brown shrimp is dependent on marsh-surface habitat during its post-larval and early juvenile stages (Minello and Zimmerman 1991). The recognition of estuarine emergent marsh as critical to fishery species is reflected by its designation as essential fish habitat (EFH) by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996 (Magnuson-Stevens Act). This project would protect habitat types that are classified as EFH for species under federal fishery management plans (FMPs) such as brown shrimp, white shrimp and pink shrimp, Gulf stone crab, red drum, gray snapper, and blue fish. These species spend a portion of their juvenile life stages in estuarine nurseries. These estuarine habitats also benefit numerous other fishery species not under FMPs. The construction of 2,800 linear feet of segmented rock breakwater would also create hard substrate habitat that would be similar to oyster reef habitat. While rock breakwaters differ from oyster reefs in their structure and formation, they are similar in habitat type and provide some of the same ecological services as reefs. The interstitial spaces between the rocks provide cover for many of the same crustacean and finfish species utilizing oyster reefs. In addition, rock breakwaters provide hard substrate for encrusting species of bivalves, bryozoans, polychaete worms, and barnacles. Avian species also utilize aerial portions of the breakwaters for foraging and resting areas. The proposed breakwater would provide hard substrate habitat as well as protect other natural habitats (estuarine marsh and seagrass beds) that support estuarine species. This project supports goals of the following coastal ecosystem and watershed management plans: \nThe Indian Point Shoreline Erosion Protection project would construct approximately 2,800 linear-feet of segmented breakwaters to protect 50 acres of critical seagrass, coastal marsh, lagoons and associated upland habitats within Indian Point on Corpus Christi Bay in San Patricio County.

These activities include transition of open farm lands to urban development, armoring of the shorelines, shore protection structures that alter downdrift transfer of sediment, and damming of nearby stream segments for irrigation. The cumulative impacts of these alterations, in addition to storm driven erosion, have led to long-term shoreline retreat in the bay system and loss of critical wetland habitats. Tremblay et al. (2008) demonstrated that in the last 50 years, the rate of marsh loss in the Nueces Estuary has averaged about 94 acres/year with a total loss of approximately 4,750 acres. The most extensive loss of habitat was tidal flats which saw a significant decline with roughly 30% lost as these habitats transitioned from tidal flats to estuarine marsh in response to sea level rise. The shoreline of Indian Point Park has been eroding rapidly over the past 50 years. The shoreline has retreated over 500 feet and approximately 19 acres of beach, shallow lagoons, and marsh have been converted to open bay. In addition to conversion to open bay, saltwater intrusion into the lagoons and wetlands have slowly altered the vegetation and habitat services these areas provide.\nThe Indian Point Shoreline Erosion Protection project would construct approximately 2,800 linear-feet of segmented breakwaters to protect 50 acres of critical seagrass, coastal marsh, lagoons and associated upland habitats within Indian Point on Corpus Christi Bay in San Patricio County.

All of the alternatives related to the design and configuration of the project attempted to minimize impacts to the surrounding environment and reduce external effects resulting from weather events. The preferred alternative in this EA is inclusive of the project proposed in this RP/EA, but also includes the construction of one other channel from San Mart\u00edn Lake (referred to as Channel A in the USFWS EA) to maximize hydrologic flow to the area. However, to allow for funding and management flexibility, this preferred alternative would be implemented in phases, and the project proposed in this RP/EA (referred to as Channel E in the USFWS EA) is the first phase. The Channel E project in the USFWS EA is identical to the project proposed in this RP/EA with the exception of channel width. The channel width evaluated in the 2005 USFWS EA was 200 feet, while the project proposed in this RP/EA is 250 feet. However, both the preferred alternative and the project proposed in this RP/EA would divert water directly into the Bahia Grande from the Brownsville Ship Channel through a relatively short, wide channel that would pass under SH 48. In addition, the affected environment has not changed significantly since the time the EA was drafted. The USFWS EA and its analysis are therefore incorporated by reference (per CEQ's NEPA regulations at 40 CFR \u00a71502.21) as applicable. This summation is not fully inclusive of the extensive information found in the EA. Readers should reference the USFWS EA for complete information. Overall, the conclusion of the EA indicates impacts of the project would result in beneficial impacts over the long-term and negligible short-or long-term adverse impacts. This project would contribute not only to the restoration and conservation of wetlands and coastal habitats but help to increase resiliency of coastal habitats and ameliorate potential adverse impacts associated with past, present and future changes expected for the lower Texas coast. Additionally, a Section 10/404 permit (SWG-2003-01954) for this project, the Bahia Grande Main Channel project, was approved by the USACE in December 2015. An EA was prepared as a part of Brownsville Navigation District's application for the Bahia Grande Main Channel project permit. An SOF was issued by the USACE in response. The EA and SOF did not identify any significant environmental effects resulting from the proposed work. The USACE evaluated the impact of this proposed activity on aspects affecting the quality of the human environment and determined that this action does not require an environmental impact statement (USACE 2015).

Within the CCP are also Land Protection Plans for each refuge that provide a regional and resource based rationale and plan for land conservation and sets goals for land protection. The CCP and accompanying EA address USFWS legal mandates, policies, goals, and NEPA compliance. A Finding of No Significant Impacts (FONSI) was issued in 2013. The NEPA analysis of the environmental consequences suggests no adverse impacts are anticipated to result from the acquisition of the tract. For the purposes of this project, the Texas TIG has incorporated by reference the analyses and conclusions of the 2013 Texas Mid-Coast NWR CCP EA (USFWS 2013). It also identifies, describes, and compares the consequences (or impacts) of implementing three management alternatives including current management on the physical, biological, and human environments described in the CCP. The CCP and EA are incorporated here by reference. This proposed acquisition would be incorporated into the Mid-Coast CCP and EA. This proposed tract would fall under the San Bernard Refuge Land Protection Plan. The 2013 CCP EA presents a range of alternatives for habitat and wildlife management, visitor services, and facilities management that consider issues and opportunities on the Complex. It also identifies, describes, and compares the consequences (or impacts) of implementing three management alternatives (including current management) on the physical, biological, and human environments described in the CCP. The management actions included in the selected alternative of the CCP EA are inclusive of the activities proposed in the Mid-Coast Habitat Acquisition. However, the scope of the project is limited only to acquisition and habitat monitoring activities, and does not include activities such as public recreation or construction of facilities. Therefore, only those impacts analyses that fall within the scope of the project are incorporated by reference below. All resource categories are fully analyzed below, even those not addressed in the CCP EA. The impacts from the project are largely beneficial and adverse impacts are minor. Benefits to the physical, biological, and human uses and socioeconomics would result if this project was implemented. BMPs required in consultations or environmental reviews would be followed. Additionally, BMPs described in Appendix 6.A of the Final PDARP/PEIS as well as Appendix B of this document would be considered and applied where appropriate, to reduce or eliminate impacts to the environment.

A turbid surface layer of suspended particles is associated with the freshwater plume from these rivers. The river system supplies nitrate, phosphate, and silicate to the shelf (Minerals Management Service 2005). Water quality in the Gulf of Mexico is sufficient to support aquatic life use, recreation use, and general use (CWA \u00a7303c; 40 CFR \u00a7131). However, there are restricted consumption advisories due to elevated levels of mercury in edible tissues of some tuna, jack, mackerel, shark, and bill fish species. Information regarding the recommended level of consumption for fish that could contain high mercury levels is described on the TPWD's website (http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/regulations/outdoor-annual/fishing/general-rulesregulations/fish-consumption-bans-and-advisories).

As appropriate in a tiered analysis, the evaluation of each project focuses on the specific resources with a potential to be affected by the project. The proposed acquisition is within the approved expansion boundaries for the LANWR. USFWS completed the CCP and conducted an EA for the LANWR, which includes the Bahia Grande unit, in 2010. The CCP provides a vision for the NWR and offers management direction for conducting scientific research, habitat restoration, and maintenance and management of compatible public uses of refuge resources. The CCP and accompanying EA address USFWS legal mandates, policies, goals, and NEPA compliance. A FONSI was issued in fall 2010. The NEPA analysis of the environmental consequences suggests no adverse impacts are anticipated to result from the acquisition of the tract. For the purposes of this project, the Texas TIG has incorporated by reference the analyses and conclusions of the 2010 LANWR CCP EA (USFWS 2010). In its CCP EA, the USFWS selected Alternative B: Implement CCP as its proposed action. This alternative encompasses the action of adopting and implementing the CCP, including an emphasis on all federal trust species (e.g., migratory birds and federally-listed species) and priority species and their habitats within the Refuge, and invasive species control. This alternative also would improve and expand compatible public uses, improve and add new facilities, and enhance educational and outreach programs. This alternative would continue to use successful pre-existing Refuge management strategies, as well as a series of new planning strategies to protect, maintain, and restore native brush land, coastal prairies, wetlands, and other biotic communities on the Refuge for federal trust and priority species. With respect to land acquisition, additional activities proposed under this alternative are to pursue acquisitions in Cameron and Willacy Counties as well as coordinate land acquisition activities with the Lower Rio Grande Valley NWR to establish several wildlife corridors (Ranchito Corridor, South Coastal Corridor, Boca Chica Corridor, North Coastal Corridor, and North Valley Corridor) to establish connectivity between endangered ocelot populations. These actions are inclusive of the activities proposed in the Bahia Grande Coastal Corridor Acquisition.

The northern Gulf of Mexico comprises a vast regional ecosystem-an interactive, interdependent network of organisms (from microbes to plants to animals) and their chemical, biological, and physical environment. Ranging from the coastline itself, to its bays and estuaries, expansive continental shelf, and vast open ocean and deep sea, the northern Gulf of Mexico ecosystem contains some of the Nation's most diverse and productive natural resources, as described in detail in Chapter 3 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which is incorporated by reference here. Focusing on the state of Texas, it too is comprised of a diverse set of ecosystems. The Texas Gulf Coast stretches along the Gulf of Mexico for 367 miles from the Louisiana border south to the Texas-Mexico border. Texas bays and Gulf waters are home to thousands of fish, shellfish, birds, and other animals, all of which depend on the coast's diverse habitats for food and shelter. The Texas coast is comprised of a diverse array of habitat types. The 21,000-square-mile region includes a wide variety of habitat types, including barrier islands along the coast, marshes surrounding bays and estuaries, remnant tallgrass prairies, shallow intertidal areas, tidal flats, estuarine to brackish wetlands, owing to the substantial variation in rainfall and hydrology across the coast. The amount of rainfall within Texas dramatically affects coastal habitats. Progressing westward, rainfall dramatically declines. Changes in the rainfall amounts affects freshwater inflows into the bays and estuaries as well as the habitat present long the Texas Coast. The northern Texas coast typically has rainfall amounts averaging over 55 inches a year, while the southern Texas coast has average rainfall totals averaging under 29 inches a year (TAMU 2017). As a result, habitats along the southern Texas coast have much higher salinities than those on the northern Texas Coast. For example, salinities in the Lower Laguna Madre (southern Texas coast) are historically hypersaline and have been as high as 120 ppt, whereas the northernmost bay in Texas, Sabine Lake is the least saline estuary in the state. NEPA requires a description of the existing environment that has the potential to be affected by the alternatives under consideration, with emphasis commensurate with the importance of the impact on those resources (40 CFR \u00a71502.15). Because four project alternatives are being proposed for only E&D at this time, the NEPA compliance to address those four projects was previously evaluated in the Final PDARP/PEIS in Section 6.4.1.14, which is incorporated by reference, and the discussion of the affected environments for those projects is not included in this plan. If any of these projects are proposed for subsequent phases of restoration, the affected environment would be detailed in the associated NEPA compliance documents associated with that decision. The remaining 12 construction and acquisition project alternatives each include a description of the relevant affected environment with its evaluation of environmental consequences in Chapter 4. Specific information on the affected environment is described in subsequent alternative-specific discussions in Section 4.5 in order to provide the level of detail needed to fully evaluate potential environmental consequences of future proposed actions. The alternative-specific environmental consequences evaluation in Section 4.5 is based on the specific project detail and location. Between late August and early September of 2017, Hurricane Harvey impacted Texas. Based on preliminary investigations, Trustees re-evaluated the proposed preferred project sites and determined that environmental conditions did not change sufficiently to warrant a change in the suite of projects selected in this restoration plan. However, the Texas TIG will incorporate new site conditions if any exist into the final engineering and design plans of relevant projects."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Consequences", "text": "Under NEPA, federal agencies must consider the environmental effects of their actions that include, among others, impacts on social, cultural, and economic resources, as well as natural resources. The alternatives addressed in this section are proposed under OPA and thus meet the level of federal agency involvement to require review. In order to determine whether an action has the potential to result in significant impacts, the context and intensity of the action must be considered. Context refers to area of impacts (local, state-wide, etc.) and their duration (e.g., whether they are short-or long-term impacts). Intensity refers to the severity of impact and could include the timing of the action (e.g., more intense impacts would occur during critical periods like high visitation or wildlife breeding/rearing, etc.). Intensity is also described in terms of whether the impact would be beneficial or adverse. For purposes of this document, impacts are characterized as minor, moderate or major, and temporary or long-term. The analysis of beneficial impacts focuses on the duration (short-or long-term), without attempting to specify the intensity of the benefit. The definition of these characterizations is consistent with that used in the Final PDARP/PEIS, and can be found in Appendix C. \"Adverse\" is used in this section only to describe the federal Trustees' evaluation under NEPA. That term is defined and applied differently in consultations conducted pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and other protected resource statutes. Accordingly, in the protected resources sections below, there may be adverse impacts identified under NEPA; however, this does not necessarily mean that an action would be likely to adversely affect the same species under protected resources statutes. The results of any completed protected resource consultations are included in the Administrative Record. This Environmental Consequences Section analyzes the beneficial and adverse impacts that would result from the implementation of any of the alternatives considered in this RP/EA. The resource categories presented in this chapter correspond to the descriptions of existing conditions in Chapter 3, Affected Environment of the Final PDARP/PEIS. This balance of this chapter is divided into two sections: Section 4.3 addresses alternatives that are only being considered in the RP/EA for funding of E&D at this time (i.e., Oyster Reef Restoration Engineering, Bird Island Cove Habitat Restoration, Essex Bayou Habitat Restoration, and Dredged Material Planning for Wetland Restoration), while Section 4.4 provides a detailed analysis of the alternatives that would be funded in their entirety, which could include E&D, construction, and or acquisition as applicable.

Impacts from projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat were described as causing short-term, minor adverse impacts. The project is consistent with the impacts and activities described in the Final PDARP/PEIS. This project would have short-term, minor adverse impacts on water quality. Activities such as anchoring marker buoys and signs, and placement of cultch materials during construction would temporarily increase turbidity. This project would have long-term benefits on water quality due to increased filter feeding by oysters.\nSection 6.4.12.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to air quality from restoration projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat, is incorporated here by reference.

Short-term, minor adverse impacts on air quality, such as engine exhaust from barges, boats, excavators, and other construction equipment, would be anticipated during cultch placement activities. BMPs would be employed to reduce the release of GHG during project implementation. To the extent possible, the project would consider resource conservation measures and technology to reduce energy use. Longterm, minor adverse impacts on air quality would be expected through emissions associated with increased recreational and commercial use of the restored oyster habitat.\nSection 6.4.12.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to noise from restoration projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat were described as causing short-and long-term minor adverse impacts. The project would create a minor, localized, and short-term increase in noise during cultch placement activities. Increased noise from a greater amount of boat traffic resulting from increased recreational and commercial harvesting activities would create a long-term, minor, localized adverse impact.\nSection 6.4.12.1.2 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to habitat from restoration projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat were described as causing long-term, minor adverse impacts. Anchors installed for buoys or signs near restored oyster reefs would potentially create long-term, localized, and minor adverse impacts to habitat in the footprint of the anchor. Short and long-term minor impacts would also result from the conversion of sandy and firm benthic habitats to oyster reef habitats. Restoration of degraded oyster reef habitat would have a long-term benefit by creating higher quality habitat for oysters, and create protection, habitat, foraging, and propagation grounds for fish, shellfish, mollusks, encrusting benthic invertebrate communities and, when intertidal reefs are exposed, birds.\nSection 6.4.12.1.2 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to biological resources from restoration projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat were described as causing short-term minor adverse impacts. Oyster habitat restoration activities would be expected to cause short-term increases in turbidity, reducing water clarity and photosynthetically available light, increasing crab predator abundance and subsequent predation on oyster spat. Cultch placement activities may also cause short-term, moderate adverse impacts to fish in the form of direct injury and/or mortality. Long-term minor impacts would result from the burial of existing benthic communities. Restored reef habitat would have a long term benefit on oyster populations in Upper Galveston Bay by providing improved, more resilient habitat. Fish and other aquatic species present in the restoration sites could be subject to a temporary increase in sound pressure levels, a decrease in water quality, entrainment in cultch material, and removal of benthos in newly covered areas. Sound pressure level increases or entrainment could result in mortality of individuals. This would be a minor short-term adverse effect that would not be expected to reduce local populations overall. Restored reef habitat would have a long-term benefit on ecosystem-level resources in Upper Galveston Bay by enhancing the overall abundance and variety of fauna. Birds using the restoration sites for foraging or roosting would be forced to other parts of the bay or other surrounding areas during construction activities. This would be temporary, however, and once the project was completed, the project would have long-term benefits to birds from increased food sources from fauna associated with reef habitat. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Protected Species Protected species and their habitats include Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed species and designated critical habitats, which are regulated by either the USFWS or the NMFS. Protected species and habitat also include marine mammals protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, EFH protected under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, migratory birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and eagles protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.\nSection 6.4.12.1.2 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to biological resources from restoration projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat were described as causing long-term, minor adverse impacts. Cultch placement activities may cause short-term, minor adverse impacts to fish (including EFH), sea turtles, dolphins, and (albeit unlikely) manatees in the form of direct injury and/or mortality. Cultch placement activities would be halted immediately if sea turtles or marine mammals were spotted near work areas, and work would only resume after the animals had moved away.  (NMFS 2008). The construction of oyster reef would result in a positive benefit for protected species. Additional habitat complexity and increased productivity associated with reef habitats provide for greater production of fisheries resources that benefit protected species directly or indirectly through the production additional food sources. All required consultations (EFH, ESA etc.) would be completed prior to project implementation.\nSection 6.4.12.1.3 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to socioeconomic resources from restoration projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat were described as causing minor to moderate short-and long-term adverse impacts to human use within the areas designated as oyster reserves. Designation of some restored reefs as closed to harvest could result in a short-and long-term, minor adverse effect; oyster harvesters should benefit long term through increased oyster recruitment to fished reefs over the long term, due to the increased supply of oyster larvae to the system provided by the reserves. This project would not adversely affect socioeconomics and or environmental justice. Existing reefs would not be closed as part of this restoration project. In consideration of Executive Order (EO) 12898, Environmental Justice, this restoration activity does not have the potential to adversely and/or disproportionately affect minority or low-income populations, including economically, socially, or in terms of conditions affecting their health. Restoration of the oyster reefs would not be directly affecting any residents. This restoration project would help restore an environment that is of benefit to all citizens, populations, and groups in Texas and beyond. Long-term beneficial socioeconomic impacts would be expected from implementation of this restoration alternative by ultimately increasing recreational and commercial shellfish harvest opportunities. Restoration could increase the natural productivity of the shallow water area, thereby improving the quality of habitat and increasing oyster recruitment, potentially leading to increased revenue from commercial and recreational activities. The restoration of the reefs as a living shoreline could also provide long-term socioeconomic benefits by reducing the risk of potential hazards, such as storm surges, and improve shoreline integrity to areas near the restored reefs. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Short-term beneficial impacts to the local and regional economies would occur from increases in construction jobs and demand for workforce to support the restoration projects. These jobs would provide income, sales, and downstream economic activity in the region. Any non-local workers, brought in for a short period of time, would bring in additional spending as workers stay in local hotels and eat in local eating and drinking establishments. Project spending would include and contribute to support of the workforce needed to design, engineer, manage, and carry out the projects. Additionally, locally purchased (or rented) equipment and materials would also benefit regional economies. Commercial fishing (shrimp, crab and oyster fisheries) occur in Upper Galveston Bay and would benefit over the long term from this project.\nSection 6.4.12.1.3 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to cultural resources from restoration projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat, is incorporated here by reference. Restoring oyster reef habitat could result in minor (temporary disturbance) to moderate (disturbance without loss of cultural information) impacts on cultural or historic resources that may be located in the area of the restoration. No adverse impacts to cultural resources are anticipated as a result of this project. Coordination under Section 106 NHPA has been initiated for this project. If any culturally or historically important resources are identified during project preparations or pre-deployment surveys, such areas would be avoided during construction. A complete review of this project under Section 106 of the NHPA is ongoing and would be completed prior to any project activities that would restrict consideration of measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects on historic properties located within the project area. This project would be implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning the protection of cultural and historic resources.\nNo adverse impacts to infrastructure are anticipated to occur since new infrastructure would not be built and existing infrastructure in the area would be avoided.\nThe project is not anticipated to adversely impact land and marine management, since the project would be consistent with the prevailing management, practices, plans, and direction governing the use of the areas where the oyster reef restoration would take place. A net enhancement of the managed oyster fishery is anticipated by the creation of additional oyster reefs within upper Galveston Bay.\nSection 6.4.12.1.3 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to socioeconomic resources from restoration projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat, is incorporated here by reference. As Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, long-term beneficial impacts would be expected from increasing recreational shellfish harvest opportunities. This project would result in minor short-term adverse impacts to tourism and recreation in the vicinity of the project construction due to construction noise, equipment, and activities. Long-term beneficial impacts to tourism and recreational use would be expected from implementation of this restoration alternative by ultimately increasing recreational shellfish harvest opportunities as well as enhanced recreational fishing in the vicinity of the constructed reef structures. Restoration could increase the natural productivity of the shallow water area, thereby improving the quality of habitat and increasing oyster recruitment, potentially leading to increased revenue from recreational activities.\nThis alternative could result in minor short-term and long-term adverse impacts to human use within the areas designated as oyster reserves; designation as a source reef would remove some areas from potential harvest. This is expected to be a short-term, minor adverse effect, as oyster harvesters should begin to see increased oyster recruitment to fished sink reefs over the long-term due to the increased supply of oyster larvae to the system provided by the source reefs. Long-term beneficial impacts to fisheries and aquaculture would be expected from implementation of this restoration alternative by ultimately increasing recreational and commercial shellfish harvest opportunities. Restoration could increase the natural productivity of the shallow water area, thereby improving the quality of habitat and increasing oyster recruitment, potentially leading to increased revenue from commercial and recreational activities. Oyster reefs are designated as EFH for red drum and white and brown shrimp. An increase is the areal coverage of oyster reefs could lead to an increase in nursery and foraging habitat for those species.\nAny adverse impacts would be minor and short-term associated with the temporary increases in road and water traffic resulting from the transportation of workers and equipment during construction activities. Shipping routes would be identified prior to the selection of reef restoration sites to prevent any impacts to marine transportation. Activities related to construction would require coordination with the users of the waterway. Barges would be staged adjacent to the restoration sites and not within approved waterways. It is expected that activities would not interrupt traffic to any significant degree. Most commercial traffic would take place on a routine schedule, and construction activities would be timed to reduce any interference with commercial operators.\nConstruction activities would be expected to have a minor, short-term adverse impact on aesthetics and visual resources in Upper Galveston Bay by the presence of barges, excavators, and workers on the water at restoration sites. Restoration of the oyster reefs would be expected to have a long-term benefit to the aesthetics and visual resources by improving wildlife variety and abundance.\nShort-term minor indirect adverse impacts in the immediate area could occur during construction through limits on recreational activities near the construction areas to protect public safety. Construction activities could result in short-term minor adverse impacts to public health and safety as a result of the operation of heavy equipment and construction materials. In addition, if hazardous chemicals or other materials are unintentionally released into the environment, soils, groundwater, and surface waters would be adversely impacted. Similarly, construction projects involving the use of boats and barges, and associated equipment, for the placement of materials to create habitat could impact the public through construction activities and the potential to contaminate surface waters. Any hazardous materials handled during construction would be contained and appropriate barriers would be in place to ensure the protection of adjacent water resources from potential spills and leaks. In the event of a discharge of oil or release of hazardous substances, the release would be reported to the National Response Center and Texas Emergency Oil Spill and Hazardous Substance Reporting line as required. BMPs in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state and local requirements would be incorporated into construction activities to ensure the proper handling, storage, transport and disposal of all hazardous substances. Personal protective equipment would be required for all construction personnel. Due to the potential increase in small boat traffic (construction related) in the area, appropriate safety measures would be employed to ensure water related accidents and conflicts are minimized. Benefits to public health and safety would occur from the increased filtration of pollutants by oysters. This would benefit the public by having cleaner water and, thereby improving coastal resiliency.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to geology and substrates from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as having minor to moderate short-term adverse impacts on geology and substrates as well as beneficial impacts. As explained in the 2011 USACE Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the SNWW Channel Improvement Project, impacts on local geology during dredging and dredged material placement associated with the proposed BUDM construction would include redistribution of existing sediment, potential increase of local scouring and shoaling rates, and reduced erosion of inshore channel shorelines. While local changes would occur to bathymetry and topography during construction and operation of the project, these alterations would be expected to have negligible impacts on the regional physiography of the submerged and subaerial portions of the project area. No impacts associated with geologic hazards are expected, and impacts on local geology are expected to be minimal (USACE 2011). The project would have minor short-term adverse impacts to geology and substrates. Impacts from construction activities, use of heavy equipment, and trenching for sediment transport can cause direct localized and short-term, minor adverse impacts from sediment disturbance and compaction. Longterm, minor adverse indirect impacts on the physical environment could occur from the placement of dredged material, which may affect sediment dynamics. BMPs would be used where and when appropriate to minimize adverse impacts. Additionally, this project provides beneficial impacts to Bessie Heights by restoring the area to a suitable elevation to sustain historical marsh habitat. Mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts to geology and substrates could include employment of standard BMPs for construction to reduce erosion and loss of sediments.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to hydrology and water quality from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, enhance, or restore coastal wetlands were described as having some short-term minor to moderate adverse impacts to turbidity with some longterm, minor impacts to existing substrate and hydrology. The Final PDARP/PEIS also describes beneficial impacts from this Restoration Approach on water quality and hydrology. The project would have minor, short-term adverse impacts to water quality from increased turbidity during dredging activities and placement of fill material. Areas where dredged material would be placed for wetland restoration would be isolated from surrounding waters by temporary containment levees with weir structures to minimize the discharge of turbid water. These impacts would be localized to the project area and would be temporary in nature. The fill material would eventually settle in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters placement area and the turbidity due to project activities would no longer occur. Similar impacts due to turbidity at the borrow site would occur regardless of the implementation of this project, as maintenance dredging of the GIWW and SNWW is an ongoing activity of USACE and is scheduled independently of this project. Additional long-term, minor adverse impacts may occur to the existing substrate due to placement of dredged materials. This may in turn have long-term minor adverse impacts to hydrology where tidal connectivity is modified per the project design. However, long-term benefits would also occur from the restoration and levee protection of the marsh. This alternative would reconnect coastal marshes to tidal flooding, and would restore the natural hydrology of this habitat. This alternative also supports linkages within the broader coastal and nearshore ecosystem by restoring the natural movement of water, sediments, energy, and nutrients among habitats. Measures to control turbidity and sediment movement would be in place to ensure water quality standards are met and sensitive resources are not affected. These measures may include appropriate water control structures to decant water, as well as the installation of silt fences or curtains, hay bales, filter-fabric, and/or temporary levees to control sediments and avoid negative impacts associated with the fill placement.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to air quality and GHG emissions from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Adverse impacts to air quality from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as being short-term and minor. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters This project would have minor, short-term adverse impacts to air quality. Project implementation would require the use of equipment which would temporarily affect air quality in the project vicinity due to construction vehicle emissions. During dredging, excavation, or placement of materials to restore marshland elevations, there could be minor adverse impacts to air quality from the use of these heavy equipment and vehicles. The use of gasoline and diesel-powered construction vehicles and equipment could contribute to GHG emissions. Where applicable, electricity requirements would be met by local suppliers. To the extent possible, the project would consider resource conservation measures and technology to reduce energy use. Adverse impacts to air quality would be short-term, only occurring during active construction activities. Where appropriate, additional BMPs for minimizing impacts to air quality at the construction sites would be utilized (Appendix B). Additionally, implementation of the project may have long-term benefits for air quality. Wetland and marsh soils are an important carbon sink. Reconstruction of marsh habitat and revegetation of newly deposited sediment would provide a means of carbon capture and a long-term benefit.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to noise from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Adverse impacts due to noise were described as being minor to moderate and short term. The project would have minor, short-term adverse impacts due to noise from construction activities. Heavy equipment can cause direct localized and minor adverse impacts due to noise. This impact would be short-term and limited to the period of construction. Impacts on noise would be short-term because it would be limited to the construction period. In order to mitigate some of the potential impacts from project activities due to noise, the timing of noise producing activities would be planned to minimize disturbance to nesting birds. To prevent disturbance to nearby residential communities, construction activities that produce significant noise would be limited to daylight hours.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describe the impacts to habitats from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as having short-term to long-term, minor to moderate adverse impacts on habitats. The project would have short-term, minor adverse impacts to the habitat in the vicinity of the project area. The project would convert shallow open water to intertidal marsh. However, the project is anticipated to be an overall benefit to the local ecosystem. Mosaics of shallow open water and vegetated marsh have been shown to have higher ecologic function than either these habitats in Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters isolation. Therefore, the final design would ensure adequate shallow open water would remain in Bessie Heights to maintain the synergies between these two habitats.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to living coastal and marine resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term minor to moderate adverse impacts from construction could displace land-based or aquatic faunal species resulting from staging equipment and materials, as well as entrapment of marine mammals. For this project, minor, adverse short-term impacts to living coastal marine resources would occur during project construction. However, the creation of additional highly-productive marsh habitat is anticipated to be largely ecologically beneficial. The creation of additional salt marsh habitat generates additional nursery habitat for many ecologically and economically important fish and invertebrate species. It is possible that birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Texas Parks and Wildlife Code may nest in the project area. Efforts would be made to avoid construction activities during the nesting season (Feb 15 through Jul 31). However, if construction activities occur during the nesting season, the area affected by project activities would be surveyed for the presence of nesting birds by a qualified biologist. If nesting birds are present or indications of pre-nesting behavior are observed, appropriate BMPs would be employed to ensure that no incidental take of any individuals occurs. Example BMPs may include virtual fencing, signage, exclusion zones for workers and equipment, hazing, and deterrents. BMP activities would be coordinated with USFWS and TPWD biologists. \nThere would be short-and long-term minor adverse impacts to protected species. During construction, there would be short-term minor impacts to EFH through dredged material deposition and increased turbidity. The conversion of shallow open water to intertidal marsh would result in long-term minor adverse impacts to this habitat and species that utilize the habitat, including bald or golden eagles. However, this impact would be offset by the long-term major beneficial impact from restoring intertidal marsh. This project has been designed to meet the PDCs described in NMFS's Framework Biological Opinion on Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Final Programmatic Damage Assessment and Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Impact Statement (SER-2015-17459). NMFS' PDCs consider where construction would occur, construction methodologies, BMPs that would be implemented, and reporting requirements (NMFS 2016). No known colonial water bird rookeries are located in the vicinity of Bessie Heights. The project is not likely to adversely affect piping plover or red knot. Piping plovers and red knots are not expected to occur in the construction area because typical habitats, beach and bayside tidal flat habitats, for the species do not exist. Piping plovers and red knots, if present and disturbed by construction noise, have access to nearby habitat that is within their normal flying distances for daily foraging movement. Forested areas in the construction right-of-way would be surveyed prior to construction to avoid impacting nesting bald eagles to ensure no adverse impacts to these species.\nImplementation of this project would not disproportionately place any adverse environmental, economic, social, or health impacts on minority and low-income populations. The project would have a positive, beneficial socioeconomic impact on surrounding communities of people equally. No residential communities are located adjacent to the project. As a result, there would be no potential for short-term impacts from construction. The project may provide long-term benefits to recreationists through increased opportunities for wildlife viewing, kayaking, canoeing, hunting, fishing, and other recreational activities. Benefits to the local economy could accrue through an increase in employment and associated spending in the project area during construction and increased expenditures due to increased recreational visitation. In consideration of EO 12898, Environmental Justice, this restoration activity does not have the potential Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters to adversely and/or disproportionately affect minority or low-income populations, including economically, socially, or in terms of conditions affecting their health. This restoration project would help restore an environment that is of benefit to all citizens, populations and groups in Texas and beyond.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to cultural resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the Final PDARP/PEIS, minor (small area of disturbance without substantial loss of cultural information) to moderate (disturbance without substantial loss of cultural information) impacts on cultural and historic resources due to construction activities such as dredging, addition of sediments or borrow materials, and/or removal of sediments could occur, depending on the scale of the action and site-specific characteristics. If cultural resources are discovered at the site, adverse impacts could include physical destruction or alteration of resources and may alter, damage, or destroy resources such as historic shipwrecks, engineering structures or landscapes, or connectivity with related sites. No adverse impacts to cultural resources are anticipated as a result of this project. If any culturally or historically important resources are identified during project preparations or pre-deployment surveys, such areas would be avoided during construction. A complete review of this project under Section 106 of the NHPA is ongoing and would be completed prior to any project activities that would restrict consideration of measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects on historic properties located within the project area. This project would be implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning the protection of cultural and historic resources.\nNone of the proposed actions involves activities or potential results that could directly or indirectly affect, positively or negatively, energy production, transport, or infrastructure in this area of coastal Texas. The proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to infrastructure, since new infrastructure Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters would not be built and existing infrastructure in the area would be avoided. Final E&D would include measures to avoid known oil and gas pipeline is the Bessie Heights marsh. Magnetometer surveys would be used as necessary to minimize uncertainty to avoid impacting any pipelines.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine management, since projects would be consistent with the prevailing management, practices, plans, and direction governing the use of the areas where restoration actions would take place.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to tourism and recreational use from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term indirect adverse impacts in the immediate area could occur during construction through limits on recreational activities near the construction area and temporary increases in road traffic due to movement of construction vehicles. The marsh habitat in Bessie Heights is a foundation for many recreational activities (e.g., fishing, bird watching, etc.) and the improvement in site conditions would enhance opportunities for, and quality of, a variety of recreational uses. Long-term benefits would come from restoring the nursery habitat of many recreationally important fish species which in turn, would be expected to benefit recreational fishing in the area.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to fisheries and aquaculture from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, the noise and increased turbidity of surface waters arising from earth-moving activities during project construction are expected to cause minor, short-term impacts to existing fisheries. However, long-term benefits would arise from the improvement of habitat for commercially important brown and white shrimp fisheries and the recreational red drum fishery.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine transportation. As there is minimal access to the site, there would be no impact to land based traffic. Shipping routes would be identified prior to the dredge and beneficial use operations to prevent any impacts to marine transportation. Activities related to construction would require coordination with the users of the waterway. While the SNWW would be used to transport equipment and materials, barges would be staged adjacent to the project area and not within the authorized waterway. It is expected that activities would not interrupt the channel traffic to any significant degree. Most of the commercial traffic takes place on a routine schedule and construction activities would be timed to reduce any interference with commercial operators. The pipeline route would be clearly marked to avoid vessel strikes.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to aesthetics and visual resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, there may be short-term adverse effects in the immediate area to aesthetics due to the presence of construction equipment during the construction period. There would be long-term minor impacts to aesthetics associated with the constructed Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters breakwater structures. Upon completion, this project would have benefits to the area's aesthetics and visual resources. The creation of marsh habitat and planting of a mixture of emergent and upland vegetation would improve the overall viewscape of the project area. In addition, the new habitat is anticipated to attract additional birds and wildlife, which could be enjoyed by recreational users of the area.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to public health and safety from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term indirect adverse impacts in the immediate area could occur during construction through limits on recreational activities near the construction area to protect public safety. Additionally, construction projects involving the use of boats and barges, and associated equipment, for the placement of materials to create habitat could impact the public through construction activities and the potential to contaminate surface waters, resulting in short-term minor adverse impacts. BMPs in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state and local requirements would be incorporated into construction activities on site to ensure the proper handling, storage, transport and disposal of all hazardous substances. Personal protective equipment would be required for all construction personnel and authorized access zones would be established at the perimeter of the worksite during construction. Due to the potential increase in small boat traffic (construction related) in the area, appropriate safety measures would be employed to ensure water related accidents and conflicts are minimized. No adverse effects to public health and safety are expected as a result of this project. Outreach with recreational users of the site would also be used to inform the public of the bathymetry and topography of Bessie Heights marsh that would result from the project. Impacts to public safety would be minor and short-term as the user groups would adapt to the new conditions on site in a relatively short period of time. Improvements in water quality resulting from increased water filtration from these activities could also contribute long-term benefits to public health. Construction of breakwaters and wetland restoration and enhancement activities could provide benefits to coastal populations and infrastructure through improved flood and shoreline protection, thereby improving coastal resiliency. This benefit is particularly effective for low-energy storm events. \nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to geology and substrates from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as having minor to moderate short-term adverse impacts on geology an substrates as well as beneficial impacts. The project would have minor short-term adverse impacts to geology and substrates. Impacts from construction activities, use of heavy equipment, and trenching for sediment transport can cause direct localized and short-term, minor adverse impacts from sediment disturbance and compaction. Preexisting levees may be raised to a sufficient height to contain dredged sediment at the appropriate depth to establish marsh habitat. This action would affect marsh substrates during the construction period. Long-term, minor adverse indirect impacts on the physical environment could occur from the placement of dredged material, which may affect sediment dynamics. BMPs would be used where and when appropriate to minimize adverse impacts. Additionally, this project provides beneficial impacts to Pierce Marsh by restoring the area to a suitable elevation to sustain historical marsh habitat. Mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts to geology and substrates could include employment of standard BMPs for construction to reduce erosion and loss of sediments.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to hydrology and water quality from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, enhance, or restore coastal wetlands were described as having some short-term minor to moderate adverse impacts to turbidity with some longterm, minor impacts to existing substrate and hydrology. The Final PDARP/PEIS also describes beneficial impacts from this restoration approach on water quality and hydrology. The project would have minor, short-term adverse impacts to water quality from increased turbidity during dredging activities and placement of fill material. These impacts would be localized to the project area and would be temporary in nature. The fill material would eventually settle in the placement area and the turbidity due to project activities would no longer occur. Similar impacts due to turbidity at the borrow site would occur regardless of the implementation of this project, as maintenance dredging of the GIWW is an ongoing activity of USACE and is scheduled independently of this project. Additional long-term, minor adverse impacts may occur to the existing substrate due to placement of dredged materials. This may in turn have long-term minor adverse impacts to hydrology where tidal connectivity is modified per the project design. However, long-term benefits would also occur from the restoration and levee protection of the marsh. This approach would reconnect coastal marshes to tidal flooding, and would restore the natural hydrology of this habitat. This approach also supports linkages within the broader coastal and nearshore ecosystem by restoring the natural movement of water, sediments, energy, and nutrients among habitats.

Adverse impacts to air quality from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as being short-term and minor. This project would have minor, short-term adverse impacts to air quality. Project implementation would require the use of equipment which would temporarily affect air quality in the project vicinity due to construction vehicle emissions. During dredging, excavation, or placement of materials to restore marshland elevations, there could be minor adverse impacts to air quality from the use of these heavy equipment and vehicles. The use of gasoline and diesel-powered construction vehicles and equipment could contribute to GHG emissions. To the extent possible, the project would consider resource conservation measures and technology to reduce energy use. BMPs would be considered and applied where appropriate and practical to reduce the release of GHGs during project implementation. BMPs considered would include using energy efficient machinery and equipment; the incorporation of antiidling procedures; and the use of gas as compared to diesel. Adverse impacts to air quality would be short-term, only occurring during active construction activities. Where appropriate, additional BMPs for minimizing impacts to air quality at the construction sites would be utilized (Appendix B). Additionally, implementation of the project may have long-term benefits for air quality. Wetland and marsh soils are an important carbon sink. Reconstruction of marsh habitat and revegetation of newly deposited sediment would provide a means of carbon capture and provides a long-term benefit.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS which describes the impacts to habitats from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as having short-term to long-term, minor to moderate adverse impacts on habitats. The project may have short-term, minor adverse impacts to the habitat in the vicinity of the project area due to habitat-disturbing construction activities, such as use of heavy machinery, pipeline construction, and transportation of sediment, associated with marsh creation. Additionally, the project would have long-term adverse impacts associated with the transition of one habitat type (subtidal mudflats) to another (salt marsh). This conversion is integral to the restoration process, and the creation of up to 150 acres of highly-productive nursey habitat in West Bay is anticipated to be an overall benefit to the local ecosystem. The extent to which habitats are impacted may change as E&D phases of this project are completed, and a precise project location is identified. While the Texas TIG does not consider it likely, it is possible that the E&D process could generate a plan that has environmental impacts that are different in type or magnitude from those discussed in this document. If that is the case, the Texas TIG would consider whether further environmental impacts analysis would be necessary.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to living coastal and marine resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term minor to moderate adverse impacts from construction could displace land-based or aquatic faunal species resulting from staging equipment and materials, as well as entrapment of marine mammals. Minor long-term adverse impacts could include conversion of one wetland vegetation type to another with changes in the distribution of faunal communities. However, the creation of additional highly-productive marsh habitat is anticipated to be largely ecologically beneficial. The creation of up to 150 acres of additional salt marsh habitat generates additional nursey habitat for many ecologically and economically important fish and invertebrate species, including but not limited to those listed above. This project would also generate additional bird habitat, which is crucial along the central flyway migration route, and benefit the wintering, nesting, and foraging species that regularly utilize the project area. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nThere would be short-and long-term minor adverse impacts to protected species. Sea turtles and marine mammals present in project areas where dredging or underwater use of equipment is occurring could be adversely affected by temporary increases in noise and turbidity, water quality changes, alteration or loss of habitats, and potential interactions with dredging equipment. Potential minor adverse effects of this project could include disturbance to marine mammals, sea turtles, and birds in nearshore waters from increased vessel traffic. Additional minor long-term adverse impacts to species would stem from the conversion of existing subsided habitat to salt marsh, and the loss of habitat associated with that action. If disturbed mobile organisms including birds, sea turtles, and marine mammals would likely leave the area to avoid impacts from construction activities. BMPs including the Sea Turtle and Smalltooth Sawfish Construction Conditions (NMFS 2006) and Measures for Reducing Entrapment Risk to Protected Species (NMFS 2012) would be followed. If marine mammals are sighted within 50 feet of the construction area, work would stop until the animals move away from the area under their own volition. Therefore, no incidental take of marine mammals is anticipated. The project is not likely to adversely affect piping plover or red knot. Piping plovers and red knots are not expected to occur in the construction area because typical habitats, beach and bayside tidal flat habitats, for the species do not exist. Piping plovers and red knots, if present and disturbed by construction noise, have access to nearby habitat that is within their normal flying distances for daily foraging movement. The creation of additional highly-productive marsh habitat is anticipated to be largely ecologically beneficial. habitat for many ecologically and economically important fish and invertebrate species, including but not limited to those listed above. This project would also generate additional bird habitat, which is crucial along the central flyway migration route, and benefit the wintering, nesting, and foraging species that regularly utilize the project area. This project would follow the PDCs described in NMFS's Framework Biological Opinion on Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Final Programmatic Damage Assessment and Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Impact Statement (SER-2015-17459). NMFS' PDCs consider where construction would occur, construction methodologies, BMPs that would be implemented, and reporting requirements (NMFS 2016).\nThere would be no adverse impacts to socioeconomics or environmental justice from this project. Implementation of this project would not disproportionately place any adverse environmental, economic, social, or health impacts on minority and low-income populations. The project would have a positive, beneficial socioeconomic impact on surrounding communities of people equally. No residential communities are located adjacent to the project. As a result, there would be no potential for adverse impacts from construction. In consideration of EO 12898, Environmental Justice, this restoration activity does not have the potential to adversely and/or disproportionately affect minority or low-income populations, including economically, socially, or in terms of conditions affecting their health. This restoration project would help restore an environment that is of benefit to all citizens, populations and groups in Texas and beyond. The project may provide long-term benefits to recreationists through increased opportunities for wildlife viewing, kayaking, canoeing, hunting, fishing, and other recreational activities. Benefits to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters local economy could accrue through an increase in employment and associated spending in the project area during construction and increased expenditures due to increased recreational visitation (USFWS 2005).\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to cultural resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the Final PDARP/PEIS, minor (temporary disturbance) to moderate (disturbance without loss of cultural information) impacts on cultural and historic resources due to construction activities such as dredging, addition of sediments or borrow materials, and/or removal of sediments could occur, depending on the scale of the action and site-specific characteristics. If cultural resources are discovered at the site, adverse impacts could include physical destruction or alteration of resources and may alter, damage, or destroy resources such as historic shipwrecks, engineering structures or landscapes, or connectivity with related sites. No adverse impacts to cultural resources are anticipated as a result of this project. If any culturally or historically important resources are identified during project preparations or pre-deployment surveys, such areas would be avoided during construction. A complete review of this project under Section 106 of the NHPA is ongoing and would be completed prior to any project activities that would restrict consideration of measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects on historic properties located within the project area. This project would be implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning the protection of cultural and historic resources, as such there are no anticipated adverse impacts.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to infrastructure, since new infrastructure would not be built and existing infrastructure in the area would be avoided. Pipelines, active wells, and inactive wells would not be impacted by project activities. Existing infrastructure of this type would be thoroughly mapped and project activities would be planned to avoid the area. None of the proposed Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters actions involves activities or potential results that could directly or indirectly affect, positively or negatively, energy production, transport, or infrastructure in this area of coastal Texas.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine management, since projects would be consistent with the prevailing management, practices, plans, and direction governing the use of the areas where the restoration actions would take place. A TGLO Coastal Surface Lease would be acquired prior to project initiation to allow for construction activities.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to tourism and recreational use from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term indirect adverse impacts in the immediate area could occur during construction through limits on recreational activities near the construction area and temporary increases in road traffic due to movement of construction vehicles. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Efforts would be made to avoid or minimize impacts to public boat launch facilities if they exist in nearby areas. Appropriate signage and buoys markers at the site and at boat ramps would be displayed. Postings in local media would also take place to ensure that efforts are made to inform recreational users. Due to the potential increased small boat traffic (construction related) in the area, appropriate safety measures would be employed to ensure that water-related accidents and conflicts are minimized. Any impacts to tourism and recreation as a result of construction activities are expected to be short term and minor in nature. The marsh habitat in Pierce Marsh is a foundation for many recreational activities (e.g., fishing, bird watching, etc.) and the improvement in site conditions would enhance opportunities for, and quality of, a variety of recreational uses. Long term benefits would come from restoring the nursery habitat of many recreationally important fish species.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to fisheries and aquaculture from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Many estuarine-dependent species of fish are harvested from Galveston Bay, including flounder, Atlantic croaker, spotted seatrout, sand seatrout, and red drum. In addition, five species of invertebrates (oysters, blue crabs, and three penaeid shrimps) are harvested from the Galveston Bay Estuary. The noise and increased turbidity of surface waters arising from earth-moving activities during project construction are expected to cause minor, short-term adverse impacts during the construction period. However, long term benefits would arise from the addition and improvement of nursery habitat for commercially important fisheries.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine transportation. Land-based equipment traffic would occur at the site during the period of construction. There is little to no other land-based traffic around Pierce Marsh, so no effects on other land-based traffic would occur. Once construction is complete, the added land-based equipment traffic would end. Marine transportation routes would be identified prior to the dredge and beneficial use operations. BMPs regarding transportation would be implemented to prevent any impacts to marine transportation. It is expected that activities would not interrupt the channel traffic to any significant degree. Most of the commercial traffic takes place on a routine schedule and construction activities would be timed to reduce any interference with commercial operators.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to aesthetics and visual resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, there may be short-term adverse effects in the immediate area to aesthetics due to the presence of construction equipment, new breakwaters, or other changes to the surrounding environment. For example, equipment and construction activities related to the restoration actions would be visible. These impacts would be minor in nature and limited to the construction period. Upon completion, this project would have benefits to the area's aesthetics and visual resources. The creation of marsh habitat and planting of cordgrasses would improve the overall viewscape of the project area. In addition, the new habitat is anticipated to attract additional birds and wildlife, which could be enjoyed by recreational users of the area.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to public health and safety from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term indirect adverse impacts in the immediate area could occur during construction through limits on recreational activities near the construction area to protect public safety. Additionally, construction projects involving the use of boats and barges, and associated equipment, for the placement of materials to create habitat could impact the public through construction activities and the potential to contaminate surface waters, resulting in short-term minor adverse impacts. Improvements in water quality resulting from increased water filtration from these activities could also contribute long-term benefits to public health. Construction of breakwaters and wetland restoration and enhancement activities could improve coastal resiliency by and benefit the public by providing infrastructure through improved flood and shoreline protection. This benefit is particularly effective for low-energy storm events. Due to the nature and location of the project area, no adverse impacts to public health and safety are anticipated as a result of project implementation. All occupational and marine safety regulations and laws would be followed to ensure safety of all workers and monitors. The project deployment would use mechanical equipment and marine vessels that use oil, lubricants, and fuels. All hazardous materials handled during construction would be contained and appropriate barriers would be in place to ensure the protection of adjacent water resources from potential spills and leaks. In the event of a discharge of oil or release of hazardous substances, the release would be reported to the National Response Center (800-424-8802) and Texas Emergency Oil Spill and Hazardous Substance Reporting line (800-832-8224) as required. BMPs in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state and local requirements would be incorporated into construction activities on site to ensure the proper handling, storage, transport and disposal of all hazardous substances. Personal protective equipment would be required for all construction personnel and authorized access zones would be established at the perimeter of the worksite during construction. Due to the potential increase in small boat traffic (construction related) in the area, appropriate safety measures would be employed to ensure water related accidents and conflicts are minimized. No adverse effects to public health and safety are expected as a result of this project. This project would provide long-term benefits to public health and safety by providing improvements to water quality resulting from the filtering capacity of wetlands that are to be restored or protected. Additionally, the creation of marshes along with breakwaters would improve the safety of nearby communities by protecting infrastructure during storms. The breakwaters would provide a wave break and wetlands absorb energy.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to geology and substrates from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as causing short-and long-term minor to moderate adverse impacts. The project is consistent with the impacts and activities described in the Final PDARP/PEIS. This project would have short-and long-term moderate adverse effects. Impacts would be caused by construction activities as well as the permanent placement of the breakwater and creation of marsh habitat.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to hydrology and water quality from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as causing short-term minor to moderate adverse impacts as well as long-term minor adverse impacts. The project is consistent with the impacts and activities described in the Final PDARP/PEIS. This project would have short-term minor and long-term minor adverse effects. BMPs would be implemented to minimize any adverse effects that may occur. However, long-term benefits would also occur from the marsh restoration and breakwater protection of the marsh. The marshes would filter nutrients and the breakwater could reduce erosion and improve impacts from turbidity.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to air quality and GHG emissions from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as having short-term, adverse impacts to air quality from emissions generated by construction equipment. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, the project would have short-term, minor, and localized adverse impacts to air quality. To the extent possible, the project would consider resource conservation measures and technology to reduce energy use. BMPs would be considered and applied where appropriate and practical to reduce the release of GHGs during project implementation. BMPs considered would include using energy efficient machinery and equipment; the incorporation of antiidling procedures; and the use of gas as compared to diesel. Additionally, this project may indirectly help to slow or minimize marsh loss, thereby providing a benefit to air quality by keeping carbon sequestered.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to noise from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Adverse impacts due to noise were described as being minor to moderate and short term. Instances of increased noise are expected during the construction phases associated with the restoration project. The project would generate construction noise associated with equipment during placement of the fill material, grading, and dredging. Construction equipment noise is known to disturb fish, marine mammals and nesting shorebirds. The timing of noise producing activities would be planned to minimize disturbance to nesting birds. The majority of construction activities would occur outside of the nesting season. Construction noise would be temporary and the construction period is not anticipated to last more than 12 months.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to habitats from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as having short-and long-term minor to moderate adverse as well as beneficial impacts. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, this project would also have minor adverse impacts during construction as well as minor, long-term adverse impacts that would be limited to the project area. Adverse impacts are caused by the change in habitat types. Best practices would be implemented to minimize adverse impacts. Beneficial impacts would occur from the restoration and protection of wetland and coastal habitat. Improved habitat and protection of marsh edge would benefit many estuarine species.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to living coastal and marine resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as having short-and long-term minor to moderate adverse impacts as well as beneficial impacts. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, this project would have short-and long-term minor to moderate adverse as well as beneficial impacts to living coastal and marine resources. Short-term minor adverse impacts would result from the displacement of land-based or aquatic faunal species during construction activities. Areas of scattered shell may have live benthic organisms which may be adversely impacted by the creation of marsh mounds. However, these impacts may be offset by the creation of rock breakwater which could support oysters. Long-term moderate adverse impacts would result from a conversion of habitat types (mud bottom to the breakwater or marsh) that would affect species presence. Beneficial impacts would result from the creation of hard bottom substrate and the restoration of marsh habitat in shallow protected waters. These habitat improvements would benefit fauna that use the interconnected habitats.\nSea turtles and marine mammals present in project areas where dredging or underwater use of equipment is occurring could be adversely affected by temporary increases in noise and turbidity, water quality changes, alteration or loss of habitats, entrapment, and potential interactions with dredging equipment. Potential minor adverse effects of this approach could include disturbance to marine mammals, sea turtles, and birds in nearshore waters from increased vessel traffic. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, this project would have short-term, minor adverse impacts. These impacts could occur from placement of materials in water, dredging, or other borrowing techniques which result in suspended sediments and increased near-site turbidity. Adverse impacts may also occur if species using the project area are temporarily disturbed and must move to another area. The disruptions caused by construction activities would be temporary and once completed the restored and protected marsh area would provide benefits to habitats used by birds, fish, and other wildlife including protected species. Placement of fill material is a slow process allowing mobile organisms to leave the area. Construction activities are not expected to have impacts to protected marine species and their habitats in the areas where the materials would be placed. Material would be removed from the borrow site with a back hoe or a clamshell dredge both of which would have minimal impacts to pelagic species.\nArea closures are anticipated during construction to protect public safety. This may result in short-term adverse impacts associated with limited access to, and opportunities for, tourism and recreation in specific areas. If these closures occur in areas with high levels of hunting, fishing, and tourist activity, resource users may choose to pursue these recreational activities in different locations, or forgo the activity. Adverse impacts to tourism and recreation resulting from potential closures would be expected to be short-term. The proposed restoration of this project would have a positive, beneficial socioeconomic impact on surrounding communities of people. The project may provide long-term benefits to recreationists through enhanced opportunities for wildlife viewing, fishing, and other recreational activities. However, short-term beneficial impacts to the local and regional economies would also occur from increases in construction jobs and demand for workforce to support the restoration projects. These jobs would provide income, sales, and downstream economic activity in the region. Any non-local workers, brought in for a short period of time, would bring in additional spending as workers stay in local hotels and eat in local eating and drinking establishments. Project spending would include and contribute to support of the workforce needed to design, engineer, manage, and carry out the projects. Additionally, locally purchased (or rented) equipment and materials would also benefit the regional economy. In consideration of EO 12898, Environmental Justice, this restoration activity does not have the potential to adversely and/or disproportionately affect minority or low-income populations, including economically, socially, or in terms of conditions affecting their health. This restoration project would help restore an environment that is of benefit to all citizens, populations and groups in Texas and beyond.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to cultural resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the Final PDARP/PEIS, minor (small area of disturbance without substantial Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters loss of cultural information) to moderate (disturbance without substantial loss of cultural information) impacts on cultural and historic resources due to construction activities such as dredging, addition of sediments or borrow materials, and/or removal of sediments could occur, depending on the scale of the action and site-specific characteristics. If cultural resources are discovered at the site, adverse impacts could include physical destruction or alteration of resources and may alter, damage, or destroy resources such as historic shipwrecks, engineering structures or landscapes, or connectivity with related sites. No adverse impacts to cultural resources are anticipated as a result of this project. If any culturally or historically important resources are identified during project preparations or pre-deployment surveys, such areas would be avoided during construction. A complete review of this project under Section 106 of the NHPA is ongoing and would be completed prior to any project activities that would restrict consideration of measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects on historic properties located within the project area. This project would be implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning the protection of cultural and historic resources. All BMPs identified in the coordination process would be followed.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to infrastructure, since new infrastructure would not be built and existing infrastructure in the area would be avoided. None of the proposed actions involves activities or potential results that could directly or indirectly affect, positively or negatively, energy production, transport, or infrastructure in this area of coastal Texas.\nAppropriate leases would be obtained prior to construction. The proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine management, since projects would be consistent with the prevailing management, practices, plans, and direction governing the use of the areas where restoration actions would take place.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to tourism and recreational use from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands would be short-term and adverse. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, the project would have short-term adverse impacts and long-term benefits to tourism and recreational use. Minor short-term adverse impacts would result from limiting recreational activities such as boating and fishing during construction. Benefits to the public would be achieved through the habitat protection activities (i.e., the breakwaters that would help prevent erosion) as well as the increased marsh and hard bottom habitat, which helps provided a nursery area for fishery species and habitat for wildlife such as birds.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to fisheries and aquaculture from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Many estuarine-dependent species of fish are harvested from Galveston Bay, including flounder, Atlantic croaker, spotted seatrout, sand seatrout, and red drum. In addition, five species of invertebrates (Easter oysters, blue crabs, and three penaeid shrimps) are harvested from the Galveston Bay Estuary. The noise and increased turbidity of surface waters arising from earth-moving activities during project construction are expected to cause minor, temporary impacts during the construction Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters period. However, long term benefits would arise from the addition and improvement of nursery habitat for commercially important fisheries.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine transportation. Land-based equipment traffic would not occur at the site during the period of construction. No long-term impacts to traffic in the area are anticipated. Marine transportation routes would be identified prior to construction. BMPs regarding transportation would be implemented to prevent any impacts to marine transportation. It is expected that activities would not interrupt the channel traffic to any significant degree.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to aesthetics and visual resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands were described as having short-and long-term adverse impacts to aesthetics and visual resources. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, this project would have minor short-and long-term adverse impacts to aesthetics and visual resources due to the presence of construction equipment and installation of breakwaters. However, long-term benefits would be realized from the protection and restoration coastal habitats.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to public health and safety from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, improvements in water quality resulting from increased water filtration from these activities could also contribute long-term benefits to public health. Construction of breakwaters and wetland restoration and enhancement activities could provide benefits to coastal populations and infrastructure through improved flood and shoreline protection, thereby improving coastal resiliency. Construction projects involving the use of boats and barges, and associated equipment, for the placement of materials to create habitat could impact the public through construction activities and the potential to contaminate surface waters, resulting in short-term minor adverse impacts. BMPs in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state and local requirements would be incorporated into construction activities on site to ensure the proper handling, storage, transport and disposal of all hazardous substances. Personal protective equipment would be required for all construction personnel and authorized access zones would be established at the perimeter of the worksite during construction. Due to the potential increase in small boat traffic (construction related) in the area, appropriate safety measures would be employed to ensure water related accidents and conflicts are minimized. No adverse effects to public health and safety are expected as a result of this project. Outreach with recreational users of the site would also be used to inform the public of the bathymetry and topography of the constructed marsh and the protective hard structure breakwater that would result from the project. Impacts to public safety would be minor and short-term as the user groups would adapt to the new conditions on site in a relatively short period of time.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to hydrology and water quality from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As described in the Final PDARP/PEIS, minor adverse impacts could occur. Construction, staging areas, and heavy equipment (both shoreline and barges) can cause direct localized and shortterm, moderate adverse impacts from increased turbidity. Localized, minor impacts may occur to the existing substrate due to placement of materials (such as dredged material or riprap). Hydrology also may be affected where tidal connectivity is modified per project design. This modification, however, would be beneficial to the system. BMPs (such as silt curtains, buffer zones, and water quality monitoring) to minimize or avoid adverse impacts would be implemented throughout the duration of construction in order to minimize impacts. For these breakwaters, impacts to hydrology and water quality were analyzed adequately within the PEIS. The PEIS determined that \"create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands by constructing shore protection projects would provide long-term benefits for many ecologically and economically important species by protecting highly productive habitats that provide food, shelter, breeding, and nursery areas\". These would be long-term beneficial effects because they would extend beyond the construction period. Some short-term adverse impacts due to turbidity could occur in the immediate vicinity of the work area. These effects would be minor and short-term as turbidity would dissipate shortly after placement activities are completed.\" No impacts to floodplains or hydrology would occur. Short-term, local, and minor impacts to water quality would result from increased turbidity during the placement of the breakwaters. Long-term benefits would also occur from the breakwater/armored levee protection of the seagrass beds, sand/shell beaches, estuarine marshes, and tidal pools. Measures to control turbidity and sediment movement would be in place to ensure water quality standards are met and sensitive resources are not affected. These measures may include the installation of silt fences and filter-fabric to control sediments and avoid negative impacts associated with the breakwaters. In addition, construction equipment and materials would be staged in an existing parking Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters lot within the park and construction access to the additional breakwaters would utilize the existing breakwaters to access the project area.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to air quality and GHG emissions from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, there could be short-term adverse impacts to air quality from emissions generated by construction equipment and vehicles. Construction activities are anticipated to result in short-term minor adverse impacts to air quality due to pollutants from fuel emissions, including particulate matter, lead, and carbon monoxide. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are specifically addressed in Section 6.14.1, Impacts of Restoration Approaches on GHG Emissions. BMPs would be employed, as appropriate to mitigate any impacts to air quality in the immediate vicinity of the project. For the construction of the breakwaters or groins, impacts to air quality and GHG emissions were analyzed adequately within the Final PDARP/PEIS. The Final PDARP/PEIS determined that \"During dredging, excavation or placement of materials to restore or enhance beaches, barrier islands and wetlands for habitat protection or restoration there could be short-term minor to moderate adverse impacts to air quality from the use of heavy equipment and vehicles. The severity of impacts would be highly dependent on the length and type of construction required and the location of the project. The use of gasoline and diesel-powered construction vehicles and equipment could contribute to a minor increase in GHG emissions.\" Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, project implementation would require the use of equipment which would temporarily affect air quality in the project vicinity due to construction vehicle emissions. Excavation associated with construction of portions of the improvements may produce fine particulate Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters matter; however, sediments deposited would be mixed with water, keeping airborne particles to a minimum. Where applicable, electricity requirements would be met by local suppliers. To the extent possible, the project would consider resource conservation measures and technology to reduce energy use. Adverse impacts to air quality would be minor, local, and temporary, only occurring during active construction activities.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to noise from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS stated that \"During the construction period to create or protect habitats, minor to major short-term adverse impacts to ambient noise levels may occur, particularly during the placement of rock breakwaters. The severity of impacts would depend to a large degree on the location of the project, type of equipment, the amount of noise that these activities would generate, and the distance to sensitive receptors such as recreational users or wildlife. Impacts on noise would be short-term during the construction period and limited to day light hours.\" The project would have localized, minor, and short-term adverse impacts to noise from construction activities. Noise impacts would be short-term and limited to the period of construction which is anticipated to be no longer than 12 months. Heavy equipment can cause direct localized and minor adverse impacts due to noise. Construction equipment noise is known to disturb fish, marine mammals and nesting shorebirds. The timing of noise producing activities would be planned to minimize disturbance to nesting birds. Construction noise would also create a potential nuisance to visitors in areas adjacent to project construction activities. It is unlikely that the noise from construction would be able to travel to the residential dwellings on Indian Point. However, to prevent disturbance of the residential community near Indian Point and in the Park, construction activities that produce significant noise or require precision, such as moving or placing rock would be limited to daylight hours.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to habitats from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, there may be minor, short-term adverse impacts during construction activities to wetland vegetation during construction. Minor, long-term adverse impacts could result from the conversion of one habitat type to another. The project would result in short-and long-term minor impacts associated with the conversion of shallow bay bottom habitats. However, the project would benefit habitat (wetlands, seagrass beds, open water habitats) north of the project area. It would also help protect the existing road infrastructure by providing a buffer to storm impacts. The proposed breakwater would also provide hard substrate habitat as well as protect other natural habitats (estuarine marsh and seagrasses) that are rich and abundant in estuarine species. Avian species also use portions of the breakwaters for foraging and resting areas. This project would protect habitat types that are classified as EFH for species under federal fishery management in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act. This project would protect habitat types that are classified as EFH for species under federal FMPs such as brown shrimp, white shrimp and pink shrimp, Gulf stone crab, red drum, gray snapper, and blue fish. These species spend a portion of their juvenile life stages in estuarine nurseries. These estuarine habitats also benefit numerous other fishery species not under Fishery Management Plans.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to living coastal and marine resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the Final PDARP/PEIS, minor short-term adverse impacts could displace land-based or aquatic faunal species resulting from staging equipment and materials, as well as entrapment of marine mammals. Long-term minor adverse impacts could include conversion of one habitat type to another with changes in the distribution of fauna communities. The Final PDARP/PEIS determined that \"the creation, restoration, and enhancement of coastal wetlands, including marshes, mangroves, and pine savannahs, that provide benefits to injured resources through the replacement of injured wetland resources, provision of habitat for injured faunal resources and/or their prey, and improvement of water quality benefit injured resources in coastal watersheds.\" The Final PDARP/PEIS also found that \"some short-term adverse impacts could occur from the placement of construction of hard structures such as breakwaters can involve use of heavy equipment on the shoreline and barges that can cause direct localized and short-term, moderate adverse impacts Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters from sediment disturbance and compaction, increased turbidity, and noise as the materials are placed in the designed configuration. Long-term, minor adverse indirect impacts on the physical environment could occur from the placement of dredged material and breakwaters in shallow water areas, which may affect sediment dynamics. Placement of materials (such as dredged material or riprap) would result in long-term, but localized, adverse impacts to the existing substrate. Hydrology also may be affected where tidal connectivity is modified per project design. However, projects would typically require implementation of best practices to minimize or avoid adverse impacts. Best practices, such as silt curtains, buffer zones, and water quality monitoring, would be used to minimize such effects. Placement of hard structures could impact local benthic organisms on or near the placement site from compaction, increased turbidity, substrate disturbances or siltation, which could locally increase mortality and inhibit activities in the short-term until the site recovered\". This project would likely result in short-term minor adverse impacts due to construction related disturbances and small changes to sessile species populations if present. However, there would likely be no impact to feeding, reproduction, or other factors affecting population levels. Short-term, minor, and localized impacts to fish and wildlife resources would occur during the construction phase of the project. Mobile aquatic animals including fish and birds would be expected to move away from the area during construction and return following completion of the project. Isolated, short-term effects on pelagic fish eggs and larvae in the immediate area may occur. Sessile and other limited movement species, especially those buried/burrowed in the substrate could be injured or killed by the breakwater placement activity. However, these types of species are typically numerous and recolonize quickly. Any adverse impacts to marine and estuarine fauna (fish, shell beds, benthic organisms) are expected to be temporary, localized, and minor as those species that would be affected are likely numerous in the area. The project would provide overall long-term benefits to living coastal and marine resources by providing additional structural fish habitat and increased hard substrate, which is known to increase productivity compared to soft-bottom bay habitat. Over the life of the project, the quality of aquatic habitat would increase. The construction of an intertidal or subtidal breakwater or armored levee would provide longterm benefits to marine species by providing additional hard structure (including crevices and interstitial voids) habitat. Construction activities would cause temporary impacts to wildlife due to the presence of people and use of heavy equipment within Indian Point Park. These impacts would last for the duration of construction, which is estimated to be a maximum of 12 months. Permanent impacts result from the construction of the breakwaters and associated hard structure habitat would provide long-term benefit to breeding and nesting birds within the Park. Natural colonization of fish and invertebrates along the breakwaters could occur which would provide foraging habitat for many shore and water bird species.\nSection 6.4.1.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS stated that \"some short-term adverse impacts could occur from the placement of rock breakwaters which result in suspended sediments and increased near-site turbidity.\" Adverse effects from the construction of breakwaters may include: Sea turtle and marine mammal individuals may be present in project areas where dredging or underwater use of equipment is occurring. They could be subjected to temporary increased noise, turbidity, and water quality changes. These activities could temporarily displace individuals or prey during construction and could result in short-term, minor impacts. Consultation with appropriate agencies was completed during the issuance of a USACE permit and all required BMPs would be followed in accordance with the USACE permit. Fish present in the placement area could be subject to a temporary increase in sound pressure levels, a decrease in water quality, entrainment in geotextile fabric, and removal of benthos from the breakwater project area. Sound pressure levels or entrainment could result in mortality of individual finfish. This would be a minor short-term adverse effect that would not be expected to reduce local fish populations or designated EFH. Consultation with appropriate agencies was completed during the issuance of a USACE permit and all required BMPs would be followed in accordance with the USACE permit. Birds that forage in or near the breakwater construction site could be temporarily affected. However, these effects would be short-term and minor as birds would be expected to move away to forage in other readily available foraging habitat during the placement of the materials. Consultation with appropriate agencies was completed during the issuance of a USACE permit and all required BMPs would be followed in accordance with the USACE permit. Birds using the sites as roosting and/or loafing areas would be forced to other parts of the peninsula or other surrounding areas during construction activities. This would be temporary, however, and once the project was completed, the project would have long-term benefits to birds for these uses. There will be no take of migratory birds. If construction activities occur during the nesting season, the portion of action area consisting of nesting habitat will be surveyed for the presence of nesting birds by a qualified biologist. If nesting birds are present or indications of pre-nesting behavior are observed, appropriate BMPs will be employed to ensure that no incidental take of any individuals occurs. BMPs will be coordinated with USFWS prior to implementation. Placement of rock material is a slow process allowing plenty of time for sea turtles to leave the area. Breakwater construction activities are not expected to have impacts to protected marine species and their habitats in the areas where the materials would be placed. Short-term minor impacts may occur if species using the project area are temporarily disturbed and must move to another area. Impacts to wildlife would be avoided via management guidelines and techniques as appropriate; therefore, restoration activities are not likely to adversely affect federally-listed sea turtles. Additionally, the Sea Turtle and Smalltooth Sawfish Construction Conditions would be followed (NMFS 2006). Long-term impacts would be beneficial with the addition of hard substrate that would support a more diverse Temporary and localized turbidity impacts during placement of the breakwaters could impact EFH. The placement of the breakwaters would result in the permanent loss of approximately 6 acres of submerged bay habitat designated as EFH for federally managed fish species through the altering of existing estuarine water column and the underlying estuarine mud/sand/shell substrates by converting these aquatic areas to hard structure habitat. The proposed breakwaters would result in the permanent filling of EFH. However, the submerged side slopes of the breakwaters would provide hard substrate with interstitial spaces that would enhance foraging areas for fish as well as provide cover for juvenile fish and substrate for establishment of oyster habitat. Any adverse impacts to marine and estuarine fauna (fish, shell beds, benthic organisms) are expected to be short in duration and minor as those species that would be affected are likely numerous in the area. The project would provide benefits to marine and estuarine fauna by providing additional structural fish habitat which would compensate for loss of benthic bay bottom habitat. Over the life of the project, the quality of aquatic habitat would increase. Marine mammals that may use Corpus Christi Bay (e.g. dolphins and manatees) would likely leave the area to avoid the construction activities and/or would generally avoid the area because optimal habitat does not exist. Manatees are extremely rare in Texas waters with sightings less than one per year on average across the entire Texas coast. However, if marine mammals are sighted within 50 feet of the construction area, work would stop until the animals move away from the area under their own volition. Therefore, marine mammals would not be impacted during construction activities and no incidental take of marine mammals is anticipated. Construction activities would be relatively short-term and occur outside of the nesting season period, and would not affect any bird nesting activities. Birds using the site for loafing and resting during the construction window may use adjacent areas and features during construction if they become acclimatized to the activities. Birds using the nearby open water for foraging may also be displaced to sites more remote from the peninsula. Some minor and temporary displacement of local foraging and roosting birds could occur during operations. The disruptions caused by construction activities would be temporary and once completed the breakwaters would provide a greater protection of the available habitats for birds to use.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to socioeconomics from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS describes acquisition and protection activities has having minor to moderate adverse effects due to changes in development activities, spending, and taxes. In addition, there would also be beneficial impacts from preventing development that would be at risk from future severe storms (e.g., hurricanes, tropical storms, etc.) and opening private lands for public use. This project is not expected to result in any socioeconomic impacts. Short-term beneficial impacts to the local and regional economies would occur from construction associated with project implementation activities. Nature tourism and other recreational activities may increase as a result of this project due to the increase in wildlife resources, which is likely to have a positive impact on the local economy. In addition, commercial and recreational fisheries would be enhanced by restoration of estuarine nursery habitat for shellfish and finfish. The reduction of erosion along the shoreline of the park, would beneficially impact local towns by protecting the natural resources, public roadways, and park infrastructure from further losses. The towns of Portland, Aransas Pass, Corpus Christi, Rockport, Port Aransas, and Ingleside, would all experience an increase in quality of life, due to the protection of the existing park and public infrastructure and preservation of the natural resources. In consideration of EO 12898, Environmental Justice, this restoration activity does not have the potential to adversely and/or disproportionately affect minority or low-income populations, including economically, socially, or in terms of conditions affecting their health. This restoration project would help restore an environment that is of benefit to all citizens, populations and groups in Texas and beyond.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no adverse impacts to existing infrastructure. This project would provide benefits to infrastructure by creating breakwaters that would protect existing roads from storm events.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine management, since projects would be consistent with the prevailing restoration methods, coastal management plans, and the feasibility study specifically developed for protection and preservation of Indian Point Park and the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters natural resources located within the park. Benefits to land management related to the reduction of erosion are expected from the project as park amenities would be protected from damage or loss by the constructed breakwaters.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to tourism and recreational use from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term indirect adverse impacts in the immediate area could occur during construction through limits on recreational activities near the construction area and temporary increases in road traffic due to movement of construction vehicles and temporary storage of materials. Short term impacts to recreation would be limited to the construction period for this project and are expected to be minor. When construction is completed, the project would result in benefits to recreational use by protecting existing recreational infrastructure which includes bird observation trails, a public fishing pier, public bay access, public parking, and educational kiosks. By protecting this infrastructure, the temporary impacts would be offset by long-term benefits.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to fisheries and aquaculture from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters This project would have short-term, minor impacts to fisheries. The noise and increased turbidity of surface waters arising from earth-moving activities during project construction are expected to cause minor, temporary impacts during the construction period. However, long term benefits would arise from the addition and improvement of nursery habitat for commercially important fisheries. The proposed breakwaters project would benefit fisheries and aquaculture by protecting existing seagrass beds and estuarine marshes that provide nursery areas for juvenile finfish, shrimp, and other invertebrates.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine transportation. Land-based equipment traffic would occur during the period of construction. There is little land-based traffic around the project area, so no effects on other land-based traffic would occur. Once construction is complete, the added land-based equipment traffic would end. Marine transportation routes would be identified prior to the dredge and beneficial use operations. BMPs regarding transportation would implemented to prevent any impacts to marine transportation. It is expected that activities would not interrupt the channel traffic. Transportation would be coordinated with local authorities to ensure there are no significant impacts land based transportation corridors.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to aesthetics and visual resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Similar to that described in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term adverse impacts for this project would occur in the immediate area to aesthetics due to the presence of construction equipment or other changes to the surrounding environment. However, there would be a long-term beneficial Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters impact to visual and aesthetic resources related to the protection and persistence of existing wetland habitats once the restoration is completed.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to public health and safety from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, construction projects involving the use of boats and barges, and associated equipment, for the placement of materials to create habitat could impact the public through construction activities and the potential to contaminate surface waters, resulting in short-term minor adverse impacts. Improvements in water quality resulting from increased water filtration from these activities could also contribute long-term benefits to public health. Construction of breakwaters and wetland restoration and enhancement activities could provide benefits to coastal populations and infrastructure through improved flood and shoreline protection. This benefit is particularly effective for low-energy storm events Due to the nature and location of the project area, no adverse impacts to public health and safety are anticipated as a result of project implementation. Efforts would be made to avoid or minimize impacts to public boat launch facilities and the park. Appropriate signage and buoys markers at the park and at boat ramps would be displayed. Postings in local media would also take place to ensure that efforts are made to inform recreational users. Due to the potential increased in small boat traffic (construction related) in the area, appropriate safety measures would be employed to ensure that risk to water related accidents and or conflicts are minimized. Shoreline erosion protection at Indian Point is not anticipated to generate hazardous waste or the need for disposal of hazardous waste. In the event of a discharge of oil or release of hazardous substances, the release would be reported to the National Response Center (800-424-8802) and Texas Emergency Oil Spill and Hazardous Substance Reporting line (800-832-8224) as required. All occupational and marine safety regulations and laws would be followed to ensure safety of all workers and monitors. The project deployment would use mechanical equipment and marine vessels that use oil, lubricants, and fuels. This project would provide long-term benefits to public health and safety by providing improvements to water quality resulting from the filtering capacity of wetlands that are to be restored or protected. Additionally, the retention and creation of marshes along with breakwaters would improve the safety of Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters nearby communities by protecting infrastructure during storms and improving coastal resiliency. The breakwaters would provide a wave break and wetlands absorb energy.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to geology and substrates from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As described in the Final PDARP/PEIS, there may be moderate short-term adverse impacts Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters from construction. Staging areas and heavy equipment (both shoreline and barges) can cause direct localized and short-term, moderate adverse impacts from sediment disturbance and compaction. The removal of sediment to increase the tidal connection would cause long-term moderate adverse impacts to geology and substrates. Standard BMPs for construction to reduce erosion and limit loss of sediments would be employed to minimize adverse impacts to geology and substrates. In fortifying this tidal connection, this project would have a positive benefit to vegetation in the area. In addition, some of the soils removed in digging channels, when appropriate, would be used to \"patch\" eroded gullies and other damage to the existing lomas. This should stabilize existing erosion problems, conserve the topsoil, and encourage colonization by various plant species, which would further stabilize the areas.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to hydrology and water quality from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As described in the Final PDARP/PEIS, minor adverse impacts could occur. Construction, staging areas, and heavy equipment (both shoreline and barges) can cause direct localized and short-term, moderate adverse impacts from increased turbidity. Localized, minor impacts may occur to the existing substrate due to placement of materials (such as dredged material or riprap). Hydrology also may be affected where tidal connectivity is modified per project design. This modification, however, would be beneficial to the system. BMPs (such as silt curtains, buffer zones, and water quality monitoring) to minimize or avoid adverse impacts would be implemented throughout the duration of construction in order to minimize impacts. As explained in analyses of the USFWS EA, restoring tidal hydrological patterns in these waters would greatly increase wildlife and fishery resources, and may provide additional recreational opportunities. The exchange of salt water would contribute to improving water circulation in the Bahia Grande. A total Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters of about 6,500 acres would be flooded in Bahia Grande under this alternative, 4,000 permanently, and 2,500 tidally. In addition, about 1,700 acres in Laguna Larga would be flooded, either by freshwater from the NRCS diversions under SH100, or by saltwater from Bahia Grande. Another 1,400 acres would be inundated in Little Laguna Madre under this alternative. Therefore a total of approximately 9,600 acres would be flooded, either permanently (6,800-plus acres) or periodically by lunar and wind tidal effects (2,800-plus acres) (USFWS 2004).\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to air quality and GHG emissions from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, there could be short-term adverse impacts to air quality from emissions generated by construction equipment and vehicles. Construction activities are anticipated to result in temporary minor adverse impacts to air quality due to pollutants from fuel emissions, including particulate matter, lead, and carbon monoxide. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are specifically addressed in Section 6.14.1, Impacts of Restoration Approaches on GHG Emissions. BMPs would be considered and applied where appropriate and practical to reduce the release of GHGs during project implementation. BMPs considered would include using energy efficient machinery and equipment; the incorporation of anti-idling procedures; and the use of gas as compared to diesel. See Appendix B for other BMPs that may be considered where appropriate. As explained in the USFWS EA, under this alternative, air quality would improve. Blowing dust would still account for most of the particulate matter in the region's air, but it would be reduced in the Bahia Grande area by restoring a tidal hydrological pattern to flood the dry basin. A traffic hazard may still be occasionally present in the form of blowing dust across SH48 and SH100, but it would be much reduced. The major source of blowing dust would be eliminated, representing perhaps 60% of the total problem. Additional dust would still come from Long Island, from the sides of the Brownsville Ship Channel, and from USACE spoil areas in the vicinity (USFWS 2005). \nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to noise from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As described in the Final PDARP/PEIS, the project would have minor, short-term adverse impacts due to noise from construction activities. Instances of increased noise are expected during the construction phases associated with the restoration project. The project would generate construction noise associated with equipment during placement of the fill material, grading, and dredging. This impact would be short-term, minor, and limited to the period of construction which is anticipated to be no longer than 12 months for the Bahia Grande Hydrologic Restoration project. Construction equipment noise is known to disturb fish, marine mammals and nesting shorebirds. In order to limit some of the potential impacts from project activities due to noise, the timing of noise producing activities would be planned to minimize disturbance to nesting birds.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to habitats from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, there may be minor, short-term adverse impacts during construction activities to wetland vegetation during construction. Minor, long-term adverse impacts could result from the conversion of one habitat type to another. In this project, the impacts resulting from this transition would largely be beneficial. As explained in the USFWS EA, benefits would largely outweigh the consequences. The primary goal of this project is improvement of the habitat. The project would also support the natural proliferation of plant life, revegetation of denuded loma sites, and stabilization of all wildlife populations native to the site. The proposed action would provide a much greater circulation, volume and aeration of waters in Bahia Grande, Laguna Larga, and Little Laguna Madre, converting what is currently an arid, dry environment back to historic tidal wetlands. This would result in a proliferation of plant and animal life in the aquatic habitat, and the permanent flooding with tidal waters would benefit upland plants and wildlife on loma and other sites by suppressing the windblown, salty dust that historically has impacted negatively the plants and wildlife thereon.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to living coastal and marine resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the Final PDARP/PEIS, minor short-term adverse impacts could displace land-based or aquatic faunal species resulting from staging equipment and materials, as well as entrapment of marine mammals. Long-term minor adverse impacts could include This project would beneficially impact living coastal and marine resources. As explained in the USFWS EA, there would be greatly improved habitat for wading birds, shorebirds, and threatened species like the piping plover. Migration of marine organisms into and out of the Bahia Grande would be facilitated. Biological productivity would be significantly increased. In addition to the obvious habitat provision for shrimp, crabs, shellfish and other invertebrates, and finfish, these would provide a rich feeding source for shorebirds, wading birds, and waterfowl (USFWS 2004).\nSea turtles and marine mammals present in project areas where dredging or underwater use of equipment is occurring could be adversely affected by temporary increases in noise and turbidity, water quality changes, alteration or loss of habitats, entrapment, and potential interactions with dredging equipment. Potential minor adverse effects of this approach could include disturbance to marine mammals, sea turtles, and birds in nearshore waters from increased vessel traffic. Some short-term minor adverse impacts could occur from dredging which would result in suspended sediments and increased near-site turbidity. The use of BMPs during the project would minimize temporary impacts associated with construction-related erosion and sediment loading that could increase turbidity. Sea turtles and marine mammals present in project areas where dredging or underwater use of equipment is occurring could be adversely affected by temporary increases in noise and turbidity, water quality changes, alteration or loss of habitats, entrapment, and potential interactions with dredging equipment. These activities could temporarily displace individuals or prey during construction and could result in short-term, minor impacts. Consultation with appropriate agencies would be required prior to final design and project implementation. Potential minor adverse effects of this approach could include disturbance to marine mammals, sea turtles, and birds in nearshore waters from increased vessel traffic. Short-term minor impacts may occur if species using the project area are temporarily disturbed and must move to another area. Adverse impacts to wildlife would be avoided via management guidelines and techniques as appropriate; therefore, restoration activities are not likely to adversely affect federally-listed sea turtles. Additionally, the Sea Turtle and Smalltooth Sawfish Construction Conditions would be followed (NMFS 2006). Longterm impacts would be beneficial with the re-establishment of natural habitats that would support a more diverse community of benthic organisms and fish. Fish present in the dredging area could be subject to a temporary increase in sound pressure levels, a decrease in water quality, entrainment in dredge sediments, and removal of benthos from dredged areas. Sound pressure levels or entrainment could result in mortality of individual finfish. This would be a minor short-term adverse effect that would not be expected to reduce local fish populations or designated EFH. Consultation with appropriate agencies would be required prior to final design and project implementation. However, the proposed channel is intended to improve tidal flow into and out of Bahia Grande, with an accompanying re-establishment of natural habitats in the Bahia. This is expected to confer a significant benefit to the ecological diversity of Bahia Grande, including the creation of nursery areas for juvenile finfish, shrimp, and other invertebrates (USACE 2014b). The marine mammals that may use Lower Laguna Madre would likely leave the area to avoid the construction activities and/or would generally avoid the area because optimal habitat does not exist. Manatees are extremely rare in Texas waters with sightings less than one per year on average across the entire Texas coast. However, if marine mammals are sighted within 50 feet of the construction area, work would stop until the animals move away from the area under their own volition. Therefore, marine mammals would not be impacted during construction activities and no incidental take of marine mammals is anticipated. Moreover, there are additional long term benefits to marine mammals due to expected increase in forage areas and food sources that would arise from restoring hydrology to the area. No impacts are expected on migratory birds or their habitat in the project area. Construction contracts would include instructions to avoid impacts on migratory birds and their nests from construction-related activities. The disruptions caused by construction activities would be temporary and once completed the hydrologic restoration would re-establish natural habitats in the Bahia available for birds to use. As explained in the USFWS EA, this project would potential benefit threatened and endangered species through habitat improvements. By restoring historic tidal inflows to the area, species such as the Northern Aplomado Falcon may be encouraged to return to the area (USFWS 2005). Piping and snowy plover habitat would be enhanced by the proposed flooding of Bahia Grande and the ancillary wetlands (USFWS 2005).\nThis project would not adversely affect socioeconomics/environmental justice. Implementation of this project would not disproportionately place any adverse environmental, economic, social, or health impacts on minority and low-income populations. The proposed restoration of Bahia Grande would have a positive, beneficial socioeconomic impact on surrounding communities of people equally. With elimination of the blowing dust from these particular basins, land developers may build houses on the northern bluffs, along SH 100, overlooking the basins. The project may provide long-term benefits to recreationists through increased opportunities for wildlife viewing, kayaking, canoeing, hunting, fishing, and other recreational activities. Benefits to the local economy could accrue through an increase in employment and associated spending in the project area during construction and increased expenditures due to increased recreational visitation (USFWS 2005). In consideration of EO 12898, Environmental Justice, this restoration activity does not have the potential to adversely and/or disproportionately affect minority or low-income populations, including economically, socially, or in terms of conditions affecting their health. This restoration project would help restore an environment that is of benefit to all citizens, populations and groups in Texas and beyond.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to cultural resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the Final PDARP/PEIS, minor (temporary disturbance) to moderate (disturbance without loss of cultural information) impacts on cultural and historic resources due to construction activities such as dredging, addition of sediments or borrow materials, and/or removal of sediments could occur. Long-term, adverse impacts could include physical destruction or alteration of resources and may alter, damage, or destroy resources such as historic shipwrecks, engineering structures or landscapes, or connectivity with related sites. As explained in the USFWS EA, a review of cultural resources was conducted by the USFWS (USFWS 2005). No problems were anticipated, as restoring flow to the Bahia Grande would not produce areas of inundation of water depths greater than what occurred historically under natural high tide conditions Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters more than 70 years ago. It was determined that breaching the railroad bed would not diminish the overall integrity of the property's location, design, setting, materials, or workmanship. The restoration project would replicate historic flooding conditions, would not exceed historical flood levels, and was determined to represent the type of activity that has no potential to cause deleterious effects on historical properties present. The freshwater channel that would bring rainwater into Laguna Larga would cut though an old railroad right of way, but only where local fill materials were used to elevate it. No pilings or other structures would be impacted by this freshwater channel's crossing of the right-ofway. Otherwise, the refuge would continue protection of cultural resources under this alternative. (USFWS 2006). If any culturally or historically important resources are identified during project preparations or predeployment surveys, such areas would be avoided during construction. A complete review of this project under Section 106 of the NHPA is ongoing and would be completed prior to any project activities that would restrict consideration of measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects on historic properties located within the project area. This project would be implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning the protection of cultural and historic resources.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to infrastructure, since new infrastructure would not be built and existing infrastructure in the area would be avoided. The SH48 Bridge is 260 feet wide, which is sufficient to accommodate the width of the proposed channel.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to land and marine management from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. The proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine management, since project activities would be consistent with the prevailing management, practices plans, and direction governing the use of the areas where the island restoration would take place. No change in land or marine management is expected to result from this project. \nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to tourism and recreational use from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term indirect adverse impacts in the immediate area could occur during construction through limits on recreational activities near the construction area and temporary increases in road traffic due to movement of construction vehicles. Impacts to recreation would be limited to the construction period. Additionally, as recreation in the Bahia Grande Unit is currently limited, the severity of the impact may be minimized. As explained in the USFWS EA, opportunities for wildlife-oriented recreation under this alternative would be beneficial for the general public. The restoration of the Bahia Grande would increase wildlife viewing opportunities, such as birdwatching. Additional public uses, including hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, environmental, education, and interpretation, would be explored (USFWS 2005). Efforts would be made to avoid or minimize impacts to public boat launch facilities. Appropriate signage and buoys markers at the site and at boat ramps would be displayed. Postings in local media would also take place to ensure that efforts are made to inform recreational users. Due to the potential increased small boat traffic (construction related) in the area, appropriate safety measures would be employed to ensure that water related accidents and conflicts are minimized.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to fisheries and aquaculture from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. The noise and increased turbidity of surface waters arising from earth-moving activities during project construction are expected to cause minor, temporary impacts during the construction Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters period. However, long-term benefits would arise from the addition and improvement of nursery habitat for commercially important fisheries. The project is not expected to have a permanent adverse effect on any of the species occurring in or near the project area. On the contrary, the proposed main channel is intended to re-establish natural habitats in the area. This is expected to confer a significant benefit to the ecological diversity of Bahia Grande, including the creation of nursery areas for juvenile finfish, shrimp, and other invertebrates.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine transportation. Shipping routes would need to be properly identified prior to the selection of borrow sites for dredge and fill material to prevent any impacts to marine transportation. Activities related to construction would require coordination with the users of the waterway. The shipping channel is not currently planned to be used to transport sediment. It is expected that activities would not interrupt the channel traffic to any significant degree. Most of the commercial traffic takes place on a routine schedule and construction activities would be timed to reduce any interference with commercial operators.\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to aesthetics and visual resources from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As described in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term adverse impacts would occur in the immediate area to aesthetics due to the presence of construction equipment or other changes to the surrounding environment. However, there would be a long-term beneficial impact to visual and aesthetic resources once the restoration is completed. Adverse impacts to aesthetics and visual resources caused by the implementation of this project would be minor and short-term. Equipment and construction activities related to construction activities would be visible during the construction period. Habitat improvements resulting from the project would gradually but favorably alter views. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nSection 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to public health and safety from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the Final PDARP/PEIS, short-term indirect adverse impacts in the immediate area could occur during construction through limits on recreational activities near the construction area to protect public safety. There are anticipated to be minor, short-term adverse impacts to public health and safety arising from potential dust and land disturbance that would be limited to the construction period. For the most part, impacts on public health and safety resulting from project activities are anticipated to be beneficial, further ameliorating the historically persistent dust problem in the basin. All applicable measures to reduce impact to public health and safety would be taken during the construction period. Due to the potential increased small boat traffic (construction related) in the area, appropriate safety measures would be employed to ensure that water related accidents and conflicts are minimized. Restoration and protection of the Bahia Grande are not anticipated to generate hazardous waste or the need for disposal of hazardous waste. All occupational and marine safety regulations and laws would be followed to ensure safety of all workers and monitors. The project deployment would use mechanical equipment and marine vessels that use oil, lubricants, and fuels.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to hydrology and water quality from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats were described as having short-term minor to moderate impacts on water resources. There would be no adverse impacts to hydrology and water quality. The project would have long-term beneficial impacts from land preservation. Preservation of lands would eliminate the potential of development activities which may alter hydrological functions (i.e., flow pathways, wave energy, etc.) and discharge of pollutants that may adversely impact biota. Additionally, marshes on Follets Island help filter nutrient and sediments, thereby maintaining/improving water quality. The project area is located in an area the EPA designates as the HGB. The HGB is in attainment or unclassified with the NAAQS for all criteria pollutants except ozone. The EPA currently lists the HGB as moderate nonattainment for the 2008 ozone standard and is pending designation for the 2015 ozone standard (https://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/sip/hgb/hgb-status).\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to air quality and GHG emissions from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats were described as having short-term, minor to moderate adverse impacts to air quality from emissions generated by construction equipment and vehicles. The project would not have any adverse effects to air quality. There would not be any additional activities that cause the release of GHGs compared to the current conditions. Additionally, the project would have long-term beneficial effects from land preservation. Preservation of lands would eliminate the potential of development activities which could adversely affect air quality. This project would also benefit to air quality by protecting wetlands which sequester carbon.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to noise from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats were described as having short-and long-term adverse impacts to noise from land management activities. Additionally, the Final PDARP/PEIS stated that the preservation of lands may help to maintain natural quiet over a longer term. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters There would be no adverse impacts to noise since noise producing activities over current conditions would not occur. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, this project would help maintain natural quiet over the long-term. Beneficial impacts to noise would result from the prevention of potential development and associated activities. 4.4.8.2 Biological Environment The biological environment is divided into habitats, living coastal and marine resources, and protected species.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to habitats from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats and is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS describes acquisition and protection activities as having long-term beneficial impact on habitats. However, management activities and public use could have short to long-term minor to moderate adverse effects, depending on the intensity of the activity. This project would not adversely affect habitats compared to current conditions. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, beneficial impacts would result from acquisition and protection of lands. The land would provide space that allows marshes to migrate inland in response to sea level rise, thus ensuring Christmas Bay and Brazoria NWR habitats remains of unique high quality and productivity. Open water habitats and seagrasses in the adjacent waters would be protected by preventing the project area from development and maintaining the habitat buffer. The habitat buffer would help filter nutrients and prevent erosion, leading to better water quality.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to living coastal and marine resources from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats and is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats were described as having short-term minor to moderate adverse impacts from land use activities which could include activities such as invasive species management and public use. Additionally, the Final PDARP/PEIS stated that the preservation of these habitats would have long-term benefits. This project would not adversely affect living coastal and marine resources. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, this project would have long-term beneficial impacts from the protection of habitats. Protection of habitats would help water quality by maintaining a natural vegetated buffer, decrease the risk of pollution caused by development (e.g., sedimentation, erosion, leaking septic tanks, stormwater runoff, etc.), connect coastal habitats (bay, wetland, dune, to beach) and provide habitat for foraging, breeding, and resting wildlife.\nThis project would not adversely affect protected species. Increased protection from public ownership would reduce impacts compared to the current condition. TPWD would employ management actions to reduce impacts as much as possible. There would be clear signs to designate the appropriate use of vehicles and other activities on the land, restricting vehicles to appropriate designated roads and access easements. Other management activities such as the installation of bollards may occur in order to preserve and/or enhance habitat quality. The area would also be patrolled by law enforcement professionals and other TPWD staff to enforce regulations to prevent resource damage from illegal vehicular activity. No off-road access would be allowed except through current legal access easements. All management activities would incorporate BMPs to eliminate or minimize any potential adverse effects to protected species. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, this project would provide long-term benefits to protected species. Land would be preserved and managed, thereby maintaining habitat quality and preventing development activities on important habitats necessary for protected species. This project would allow for the upland migration of beach, wetland and other habitat as sea level rises and would also limit development. The preservation of habitat would provide a buffer that would help preserve water quality and habitats for aquatic species in the adjacent waterbodies.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to socioeconomics from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS describes acquisition and protection activities as having minor to moderate adverse effects due to changes in development activities, spending, and taxes. In addition, there would also be beneficial impacts from preventing development that would be at risk from future severe storms (e.g., hurricanes, tropical storms, etc.) and opening private lands for public use. This project would not adversely affect socioeconomics or environmental justice. There are no adverse effects to low income or minority populations anticipated from the proposed action. Furthermore, this project would enhance passive recreation and provide additional access points to areas for beachgoers. In consideration of EO 12898, Environmental Justice, this restoration activity does not have the potential to adversely and/or disproportionately affect minority or low-income populations, including economically, socially, or in terms of conditions affecting their health. This restoration project would help restore an environment that is of benefit to all citizens, populations and groups in Texas and beyond.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to cultural resources from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts to cultural resources and infrastructure resulting from the implementation of a conservation action or habitat management plan could result if conservation includes protecting cultural or infrastructure resources that are within or close to protected areas. Due to the land use objectives of the property (habitat protection), it is anticipated that there would be no effect to cultural resources. Land would be managed by TPWD for habitat protection and passive recreation. Construction would be limited to management activities such as the installation of bollards or signs which would be used to minimize impacts from public use (e.g., accessing the bays and beaches, fishing, etc.). Coordination under Section 106 NHPA has been initiated for this project. All necessary reviews or consultations for cultural resources would occur prior to the implementation of management activities (not funded as part of this project) that could affect any cultural resources. If cultural resources were found to be present on the property, they would be more protected than in the current Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters conditions. TPWD would follow all applicable agency and state policies regarding cultural resources on TPWD property.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impacts to infrastructure, since new infrastructure would not be built and any existing infrastructure would be managed in accordance with management objectives of the property.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to land and marine management from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS states that opening private lands to the public could beneficial. The project would convey the tract to TPWD and change the current land management for the property. This is anticipated to have a minor, long term-adverse impact on local tax revenue. The conveyance of this tract-which is currently zoned as residential/commercial property-to TPWD, represents a loss in taxable property and a corresponding loss in tax revenue to the local economy. Once conveyed, this property would be removed from tax rolls. However, consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, there would be beneficial impacts from the Follets Island Habitat Acquisition project because it would convert private to public lands. The area would be preserved and human activity would be managed to prevent impacts to the land. Trails, roads or access points deemed compatible with the land management objectives associated this preservation project would be maintained for the public to use. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nThere would be no adverse effects to tourism and recreational use from the project. There would be long-term benefits from increased opportunities to access lands including beaches for passive recreational activities.\nLong-term benefits to fisheries and aquaculture would result from the acquisition of lands that contain coastal marshes, an important nursery habitat for commercial and recreational fisheries.\nThe proposed action would have no impact to land and marine transportation. Lands are currently in private holdings and not used for transportation and there would be no change in transportation activities if the project was implemented.\nThere would be no adverse impacts to aesthetics and visual resources. Long-term benefits to aesthetics and visual resources would occur from the preservation of natural habitat and the prevention of future development that could adversely impact aesthetics and visual resources.\nDue to the nature the project (land preservation), no adverse impacts to public health and safety would occur as a result of project implementation. The action of placing the tract into conservation would preserve its current state and preclude development of the tract for recreational residences. This action would prevent development that would be affected by tropical storm winds and tides and thus minimize flood risks to human health and safety. Additionally, the preservation of habitat would allow the landscape to recover quicker after storms and would provide benefits for coastal resiliency. Benefits would also be realized by the public from the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors and participate in recreational activities.\nAs evaluated, the CCP EA addresses impacts related to recreation and public use. However, this property would not be open for public use, but for preservation and conservation only. There would be no public access roads built or other ground-disturbing activity conducted as a part of this project, therefore there are no adverse impacts anticipated to geology and substrates due to the proposed action. The project would have long-term beneficial effects from land preservation. Under the ownership of USFWS, the habitats would be monitored regularly. Placement of this tract into conservation status would ensure the geologic nature of the site is preserved in perpetuity. The most likely use of the tract for its geologic resources would be as a borrow site for clay. Conservation and preservation of the tract by the Texas TIG would prevent the tract from being used as a borrow site. However, there are ample sources of clays and loams in the region. There are no unique geological resources associated with the tract.\nAs evaluated, the CCP EA addresses impacts related to recreation and public use. However, this property would not be open for public use, but for preservation and conservation only. There would be no public access roads built or other ground-disturbing activity conducted as a part of this project, therefore there are no adverse impacts anticipated to water quality and hydrology due to the proposed action. The project would have long-term benefits to water quality from land preservation. The tract would be protected in perpetuity and thereby its contribution to maintaining water quality would be preserved. Management of the site for conservation would prevent development of the tract from reducing water quality in the area. See Section 4.3.2 of the Texas Mid-Coast NWR EA for more information.\nAs evaluated, the CCP EA addresses impacts to air quality related to habitat management activities. Once this property is conveyed to USFWS, the refuge would regularly monitor existing habitat and conduct management activities such as prescribed burns. The CCP EA explains that minor, adverse impacts to air quality may result from these actions but would be temporary in nature limited to the duration of the burn. Because the proposed property acquisition would not allow for public vehicular access to the property, there would be no increased burning in fossil fuels, therefore there are no anticipated adverse impacts to air quality from vehicles. In order to mitigate impacts to air quality from management activities, the refuge would employ the following BMPs: habitat management involving prescribed burning would occur only under ideal weather conditions and smoke management practices would be implemented during all burning events, an approved prescribed burn plan, favorable weather conditions, and adequate firefighting resource would work jointly to prevent pervasive air pollution or unnecessary effects on air quality (USFWS 2013). Incorporation of the tract into the refuge system would have long-term benefits for air quality. Preventing the land from development for recreational home sites would prevent air quality from degrading due to increased burning of fossil fuels and household refuse. Management activities such as prescribed burns would help to restore and conserve additional habitat acreage over the long-term, which would in turn improve air quality.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to noise from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS stated that the preservation of lands may help to maintain natural Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters quiet over a longer term. Because no planned infrastructure development in the form or public access roads or trails is planned as a part of this proposed acquisition, there are no anticipated adverse impacts to noise. Furthermore, incorporation of the tract into the refuge system would have a long-term benefit for noise. Preventing the land from development for recreational home sites would prevent ambient noise levels from being raised.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to habitats from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS describes acquisition and protection activities has having long-term beneficial impact on habitats. The habitat types present at the site are not expected to change once the tract is incorporated into the refuge system. As evaluated, the CCP EA addresses impacts to habitat related to refuge management activities. Once this property is conveyed to USFWS, the refuge would regularly monitor existing habitat and conduct management activities such as prescribed burns. The CCP EA explains that minor, adverse impacts to habitats may result from prescribed burns but they would be temporary in nature (USFWS 2013). Because no planned infrastructure development in the form or public access roads or trails is planned as a part of this proposed acquisition, there are no anticipated adverse impacts to habitats from public use. In order to mitigate impacts to habitats from management activities, the refuge would employ the following BMPs: habitat management involving prescribed burning would occur only under ideal weather conditions and smoke management practices would be implemented during all burning events, an approved prescribed burn plan, favorable weather conditions, and adequate firefighting resource would work jointly to prevent pervasive air pollution or unnecessary effects on air quality (USFWS 2013). Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to living coastal and marine resources from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS stated that the preservation of coastal property would have long-term benefits to living coastal and marine resources. By conveying this tract to the refuge system, and removing the risk of development on the property, the quality of habitat used by the area's living coastal and marine resources would be preserved. As evaluated, the CCP EA, addresses impacts to living coastal and marine resources related management activities. Once this property is conveyed to USFWS, the refuge service would regularly monitor existing habitat and conduct management activities such as prescribed burns. The CCP EA explains that minor, adverse impacts to living coastal and marine resources may result from these actions but they would be temporary in nature (USFWS 2013). Moreover, the property once placed into perpetual conservation would have long-term benefits to conditions for living and coastal marine resources. The site would be monitored and managed to prevent invasion by exotic species, alert managers if problems at the site are encountered such as excessive erosion, trespass or poaching. See Section 4.4.4 for Migratory Birds and Resident Native Wildlife in the Texas Mid-Coast NWR EA.\nBecause there are no ground disturbing activities or public use objectives planned as a part of this project, there are no anticipated adverse impacts to protected species. Through the proposed change in land management, this project would provide long-term benefits to protected species through conservation of habitat and prevention of development on the property in perpetuity. It is the USFWS's responsibility to conserve and protect federally-listed species. Sea turtle protection activities would occur on the property (USFWS 2013).\nAn analysis in the Texas Mid-Coast NWR CCP is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the EA, the conveyance of this tract of land into the refuge system would not disproportionately place any adverse environmental, economic, social, or health impacts on minority and low-income populations. The acquisition of the subject tract to the refuge would have a neutral to slightly positive impact to socioeconomics and environmental justice. As this project does not include any direct engagement or provision for public use, there are no anticipated adverse impacts to environmental justice. Overall, this proposed acquisition would provide for long-term benefits to socioeconomics/environmental justice as resources of the associated tract would be held in the public trust and thus its service flows would be held in perpetuity for the general public. In consideration of EO 12898, Environmental Justice, this restoration activity does not have the potential to adversely and/or disproportionately affect minority or low-income populations, including economically, socially, or in terms of conditions affecting their health. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters This restoration project would help restore an environment that is of benefit to all citizens, populations and groups in Texas and beyond. Further discussion of impacts to the local population and economy are discussed in Section 4.5.1 of the Texas Mid-Coast NWR EA.\nCoordination under Section 106 NHPA has been initiated for all projects. An analysis in the Texas Mid-Coast NWR CCP is incorporated here by reference. Section 4.2 of the Texas Mid-Coast NWR EA discusses potential impacts to cultural resources. There are no anticipated adverse impacts that would arise from implementation of this project. Benefits to cultural resources would be realized through added protection provided by becoming part of a NWR. This project would be implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning the protection of cultural and historic resources.\nThere are no anticipated adverse impacts to infrastructure that would result from this project. The buildings present on the property would be incorporated into refuge management operations or dismantled. The existing roads would be maintained and the three former well pads may be restored or left in place. Impacts related to Public Use and Infrastructure can be found in Section 4.5.3 and 4.5.4 of the Texas Mid-Coast NWR EA. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nThe project would convey the tract to the USFWS refuge system and change the current land management for the property. This is anticipated to have a minor, long term-adverse impact on local tax revenue. The conveyance of this tract-which is currently zoned as residential/commercial property-to USFWS, represents a loss in taxable property and a corresponding loss in tax revenue to the local economy. Once conveyed to the refuge system, this property would be removed from tax rolls. However, Refuge Revenue Sharing Act payments from the DOI are designed to offset the burden that counties feel when Refuge properties are removed from the tax rolls. Long-term benefits from the conveyance of property to the USFWS refuge system would include prevention of recreational, residential, or commercial development of the property and protection of its resources in perpetuity.\nPublic use opportunities are evaluated in Section 4.5.3 of the Texas Mid-Coast NWR EA. While this project is being conveyed to the USFWS refuge system, it would be not open to the public for recreation, but maintained for conservation purposes only. For this reason, there are no anticipated adverse impacts to tourism and recreational use that may arise from the project.\nAs there are no aquaculture operations in the vicinity of the Texas Mid-Coast NWR, the proposed action is anticipated to have no adverse impacts to fisheries and aquaculture. A benefit would be provide by protection of wetlands that provide important nursery habitat for commercial and recreational important species such as blue crab, speckled trout, Southern flounder, white shrimp, and redfish. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine transportation. There are no public land or marine transportation routes on the tract, and this is not anticipated to change upon implementation of the project.\nEvaluated in the CCP EA, that analysis addresses impacts to aesthetics and visual resources related management activities. Once this property is conveyed to USFWS, the refuge service would regularly monitor existing habitat and conduct management activities such as prescribed burns. The CCP EA explains that minor, adverse impacts to aesthetics and visual resources may result from these actions but would be temporary in nature, limited to the duration of the burn (USFWS 2013). In order to mitigate impacts to aesthetics and visual resources from management activities, the refuge would employ the following BMPs: habitat management involving prescribed burning would occur only under ideal weather conditions and smoke management practices would be implemented during all burning events, an approved prescribed burn plan, favorable weather conditions, and adequate firefighting resource would work jointly to prevent pervasive air pollution or unnecessary effects on air quality (USFWS 2013). Long-term benefits to aesthetics and visual resources would occur from the preservation of natural habitat and the prevention of future development that could adversely impact aesthetics and visual resources. These benefits would result from improved aesthetics and opportunities to view wildlife on the protected lands and in nearby areas that are likely to experience improved abundance and diversity of species as a result of the spillover effects of conservation efforts. The tract would be preserved in perpetuity and thus this action would protect current aesthetics and visual resource values. The Texas Mid-Coast NWR EA addresses aesthetics and visual resources in Section 4.5.2. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nAcquisition of the subject tract would have no adverse impacts to public health and safety. The action of placing the tract into conservation would preserve its current state and preclude development of the tract for recreational, residential, or commercial purposes. Preventing development and subsequent land impacts would result in maintenance of coastal resiliency. This action would prevent development that would be affected by tropical storm winds and tides and thus minimize flood risks to human health and safety.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to hydrology and water quality from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, and is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats were described as having short-term minor to moderate impacts on water resources. There would be no adverse impacts to hydrology and water quality. The project would have long-term beneficial impacts from land preservation. Preservation of lands would eliminate the potential of development activities which may alter hydrological functions (i.e., flow pathways, wave energy, etc.) and discharge of constituents that may adversely impact biota. This project would also benefit water quality by preserving wetlands that help filter nutrients and sediments, thereby maintaining/improving water quality.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to noise from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats were described as having short-and long-term adverse impacts to noise from land management activities. Additionally, the Final PDARP/PEIS stated that the preservation of lands may help to maintain natural quiet over a longer term. There would be no adverse impacts to noise since noise producing activities over current conditions would not occur. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, this project would help maintain natural quiet over the long-term.

However, management activities and public use could have short to long-term minor to moderate adverse effects, depending on the intensity of the activity. This project would not adversely affect habitats compared to current conditions. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, beneficial impacts would result from acquisition and protection of lands. The land would provide space that allows marshes to migrate inland in response to sea level rise, thus ensuring East Matagorda Bay and the surrounding protected lands managed by USFWS and TPWD remains of high quality and productivity. Open water habitats and seagrasses in the adjacent waters would be protected by the preventing the project area from development and maintaining the habitat buffer. The habitat buffer would help filter nutrients and prevent erosion, leading to better water quality. This project would protect tidal shoreline and littoral zone, which in turn protects adjacent oyster and seagrass beds from the detrimental effects that inevitably follow shoreline development. This development often includes construction of canal subdivisions, access channels, bulkheads, breakwaters, piers and boat launches, all of which can have direct and indirect impacts on habitat and water quality, including turbidity, nutrient loading, and fuel spills.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to living coastal and marine resources from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats and is incorporated here by reference.

Land would be preserved and managed, thereby maintaining habitat quality and preventing development activities on important habitats necessary for protected species. This project would allow Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters for the upland migration of beach, wetland and other habitat as sea level rises and would also limit development. The preservation of habitat would provide a buffer that would help preserve water quality and habitats for aquatic species in the adjacent waterbodies. This project would not adversely affect protected species. Increased protection from public ownership would reduce impacts compared to the current condition. TPWD would employ management actions to reduce impacts as much as possible. There would be clear signs to designate the appropriate use of vehicles and other activities on the land, restricting vehicles to appropriate designated roads and access easements. Over the long term, if necessary, TPWD would provide alternative pedestrian access and pedestrian trails designed in a manner to allow access but reduce impacts on the island habitats. Other management activities such as the installation of bollards may occur in order to preserve and/or enhance habitat quality. The area would also be patrolled by law enforcement professionals and other TPWD staff to enforce regulations to prevent resource damage from illegal vehicular activity. No offroad access would be allowed except through current legal access easements. All management activities would incorporate BMPs to eliminate or minimize any potential adverse effects to protected species.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describe the impacts to socioeconomics from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS describes acquisition and protection activities as having minor to moderate adverse effects due to changes in development activities, spending, and taxes.

This restoration project would help restore an environment that is of benefit to all citizens, populations and groups in Texas and beyond.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to cultural resources from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts to cultural resources and infrastructure resulting from the implementation of a conservation action or habitat management plan could result if conservation includes protecting cultural or infrastructure resources that are within or close to protected areas. Due to the land use objectives of the property (habitat protection), it is anticipated that there would be no effect to cultural resources. Land would be managed by TPWD for habitat protection and passive recreation. Construction would be limited to management activities such as the installation of bollards or signs which would be used to minimize impacts from public use (e.g., accessing the bays and beaches, fishing, etc.). Coordination under Section 106 NHPA has been initiated for this project. All necessary reviews or consultations for cultural resources would occur prior to the implementation of management activities (not funded as part of this project) that could affect any cultural resources. If cultural resources, were found to be present on the property, they would be more protected than in the current conditions. TPWD would follow all applicable agency and state policies regarding cultural resources on TPWD property.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impacts to infrastructure, since new infrastructure would not be built and any existing infrastructure would be managed in accordance with management objectives of the property.\nThe proposed action would have no impact to land and marine transportation. Lands are currently in private holdings and not used for transportation and there would be no change in transportation activities if the project was implemented.\nThere would be no adverse impacts to aesthetics and visual resources. Long-term benefits to aesthetics and visual resources would occur from the preservation of natural habitat and the prevention of future development that could adversely impact aesthetics and visual resources.\nDue to the nature the project (land preservation), no adverse impacts to public health and safety would occur as a result of project implementation. The action of placing the tract into conservation would preserve its current state and preclude development of the tract. This action would prevent development that would be affected by tropical storm winds and tides and thus minimize flood risks to human health and safety. The preservation of land also maintains a storm buffer that would help protect the city of Matagorda. Additionally, preserving the land would maintain water quality by filtering nutrients and preventing development that would cause pollution into the Bay.\nNo public access roads would be built or other ground-disturbing activity conducted as a part of this project, therefore there are no adverse impacts anticipated to geology and substrates due to the proposed action. This property would not be open for public use, but for preservation and conservation only. The project would have long-term beneficial effects to geology and substrates from land preservation.\nAs evaluated, the CCP EA addresses impacts related to recreation and public use. However, this property would not be open for public use, but for preservation and conservation only. There would be no public access roads built or other ground-disturbing activity conducted as a part of this project, therefore there are no adverse impacts anticipated to water quality and hydrology due to the proposed action. The project would have long-term benefits to water quality from land preservation. In the long-term, conservation projects such as the one proposed would protect the quality of the watershed by protecting or facilitating natural wetland cycling process (USFWS 2010). Under the ownership of USFWS, the habitats would be monitored regularly and are expected to improve upon incorporation into the refuge management system (USFWS 2010).\nAs explained in the existing analysis, the CCP EA addresses impacts to air quality related to recreation and public use. However, this property would not be open for public use, but conveyed to USFWS for preservation and conservation only. Because the proposed property acquisition would not allow for public vehicular access to the property, there would be no increased burning in fossil fuels, therefore there are no anticipated adverse impacts to air quality due to the proposed action. The project would have long-term beneficial effects from land preservation and elimination of the risk of industrial or residential development. Preventing the land from development for recreation, residential, or commercial uses would prevent air quality from degrading due to increased burning of fossil fuels and household refuse. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS describes the impacts to noise from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS stated that the preservation of lands may help to maintain natural quiet over a longer term. Because no planned infrastructure development in the form or public access roads or trails is planned as a part of this proposed acquisition, there are no anticipated adverse impacts to noise. Furthermore, incorporation of the tract into the refuge system would have a long-term benefit for noise. Preventing the land from development for recreation, residential, or commercial uses would prevent ambient noise levels from increasing.\nSection 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to habitats from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS describes acquisition and protection activities as having long-term beneficial impact on habitats. Because no planned infrastructure development in the form or public access roads or trails is planned as a part of this proposed acquisition, there are no anticipated adverse impacts to habitats. The habitat types present at the site are not expected to change once the tract is incorporated into the refuge Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters system. Furthermore, preventing the land from development for recreation, residential, or commercial uses would prevent potential future adverse impacts to habitats.\nThere are no anticipated adverse impacts that would result from the project. Section 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to living coastal and marine resources from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. The Final PDARP/PEIS stated that the preservation of coastal property would have long-term benefits to living coastal and marine resources. By conveying this tract to the refuge system, and removing the risk of development on the property, the quality of habitat used by the area's living coastal and marine resources would be preserved. As evaluated, the CCP EA states that overall, implementing the CCP would have no known adverse impacts to the area's resources and would produce positive benefits in most key environmental areas. Efforts would be directed toward improving and protecting habitats (e.g., habitat restoration, wetland creation, and water level manipulation) for migratory birds, wintering waterfowl, federally-listed species, and resident fish and wildlife that currently occur or historically occurred on the Refuge (USFWS 2010). Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nBecause there are no ground disturbing activities or public use objectives planned as a part of this project, there are no adverse impacts anticipated to protected species. Through the proposed change in land management, this project would provide long-term benefits to protected species through conservation of habitat and prevention of development on the property in perpetuity. It is the USFWS's responsibility to conserve and protect federally-listed species. The USFWS would actively pursue opportunities to strengthen or improve partnerships and cooperative efforts with other agencies and individuals to improve conservation efforts for the recovery of endangered species (USFWS 2010). Land would be preserved and managed, thereby maintaining habitat quality and preventing development activities on important habitats necessary for protected species.\nThis project would not adversely affect socioeconomics/environmental justice. Analysis from the CCP EA (USFWS 2010) is incorporated here by reference. As explained in the CCP EA, expanding the LANWR would not disproportionately place any adverse environmental, economic, social, or health impacts on minority and low-income populations. As this project does not include any direct engagement or provision for public use, there are no anticipated adverse impacts to environmental justice. Overall, this proposed acquisition would provide for long-term benefits to socioeconomics/environmental justice as resources of the associated tract would be held in the public trust and thus its service flows would be held in perpetuity for the general public. In consideration of EO 12898, Environmental Justice, this restoration activity does not have the potential to adversely and/or disproportionately affect minority or low-income populations, including economically, socially, or in terms of conditions affecting their health. This restoration project would help restore an environment that is of benefit to all citizens, populations and groups in Texas and beyond.\nCoordination under Section 106 NHPA has been initiated for this project. There are no anticipated adverse impacts that would arise from implementation of this project. Benefits to cultural resources would be realized through added protection provided by becoming part of a NWR. This project would be implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning the protection of cultural and historic resources.\nThere are no anticipated adverse impacts to infrastructure that would result from this project. The project activities do not encompass any ground-disturbing activities that would directly or indirectly interfere with any infrastructure in the vicinity of the project area.\nThe project would convey the tract to the USFWS refuge system and change the current land management for the property. This is anticipated to have a minor, long term-adverse impact on local tax revenue. The conveyance of this tract-which is currently zoned as residential/commercial property-to USFWS, represents a loss in taxable property and a corresponding loss in tax revenue to the local economy. Once conveyed to the refuge system, this property would be removed from tax rolls. However, Refuge Revenue Sharing Act payments from the DOI are designed to offset the burden that counties feel when Refuge properties are removed from the tax rolls. For example, LANWR's tax payments to Cameron and Willacy counties from 2003 through 2005 averaged $87,273 and $16,330 respectively (USFWS 2010, internal citations omitted). Long-term benefits from the conveyance of property to the USFWS refuge system would include prevention of recreational, residential, or commercial development of the property and protection of its resources in perpetuity.\nWhile efuge system, it would be not open to the public for recrea ses only. For this reason, there are no anticipated advers t may arise from the project.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no adverse impacts to fisheries and aquaculture. The addition of this tract to the LANWR is anticipated to have no direct effect on the relationship of the refuge to surrounding fisheries resources. Long-term benefits to the nearby fisheries and shrimp farms would arise from sustaining preserved, managed habitat in perpetuity, and the prevention of commercial development of the property.\nThe proposed action is anticipated to have no impact to land and marine transportation. There are no public land or marine transportation routes on the tract, and this is not anticipated to change upon implementation of the project.\nThe proposed change in land management is expected to have no anticipated adverse impacts to aesthetics and visual resources. Long-term benefits to aesthetics and visual resources would occur from the preservation of natural habitat and the prevention of future development that could adversely impact aesthetics and visual resources. These benefits would result from improved aesthetics and opportunities to view wildlife on the protected lands and in nearby areas that are likely to experience improved abundance and diversity of species as a result of the spillover effects of conservation efforts.

This alternative would continue to use successful pre-existing Refuge management strategies, as well as a series of new planning strategies to protect, maintain, and restore native brush land, coastal prairies, wetlands, and other biotic communities on the NWR for federal trust and priority species. With respect to land acquisition, additional activities proposed under this alternative are to pursue acquisitions in Cameron and Willacy Counties as well as coordinate land acquisition activities with the Lower Rio Grande Valley NWR to establish several wildlife corridors (Ranchito Corridor, South Coastal Corridor, Boca Chica Corridor, North Coastal Corridor, and North Valley Corridor) to establish connectivity between endangered ocelot populations. These actions are inclusive of the activities proposed in the Laguna Atascosa Habitat Acquisition. However, the scope of the project is limited only to acquisition and habitat monitoring activities, and does not include activities such as public recreation or construction of facilities. Therefore, only those impacts analyses that fall within the scope of the project are incorporated by reference below. All resource categories are fully analyzed below, even those not addressed in the CCP EA. The Incident was not considered as part of the affected environment in the LANWR CCP, and therefore the environmental consequences of the LANWR CCP implementation were not considered in light of the Incident. However, the environmental consequences of the LANWR CCP alternatives would occur regardless of the Incident and the relative impacts of the alternatives considered would not materially change because of the Incident. The impacts from the project are largely beneficial and adverse impacts are minor. Benefits to the physical, biological, and human uses and socioeconomics would result if this project was implemented. BMPs required in consultations or environmental reviews would be followed. Additionally, BMPs described in Appendix 6.A of the Final PDARP/PEIS as well as Appendix B of this document would be considered and applied where appropriate, to reduce or eliminate impacts to the environment. A summary of the conclusions of this analysis are in Table 4-39. Categories and terminology in the table follow a consistent format used for all projects in this RP/EA. Information from this EA was used to populate this table using the definitions provided in Appendix C.  4.4.12.1 Physical Environment The physical environment is divided into geology and substrates, hydrology and water quality, air quality and GHG emissions, as well as noise characteristics of the area.\nNo public access roads would be built or other ground-disturbing activity conducted as a part of this project, therefore there are no adverse impacts anticipated to geology and substrates due to the proposed action. This property would not be open for public use, but for preservation and conservation only. The project would have long-term beneficial effects to geology and substrates from land preservation.

The purpose of the E&D alternatives is to develop sufficient information to fully evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives in a subsequent restoration plan. Although information gathered may inform future alternatives, the outcome of the preliminary phases does not commit the Texas TIG to future actions. If any other subsequent phases are later proposed for implementation with DWH NRDA funds, a NEPA analysis of the impacts from that project would be included in the associated restoration plan. A brief environmental analysis of each of the proposed E&D alternatives is discussed below. An evaluation of environmental consequences related to E&D activities is discussed in Section 6.4.14 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, and is summarized in this section. The Final PDARP/PEIS determined that some preliminary phases of alternative planning would cause direct, short-term, minor impacts through associated fieldwork. These impacts would be very minor and localized to the alternative site. Temporary impacts to the biological and physical environment also could include short-term, temporary disturbance of habitats and species, minor emissions from vehicles, and minor disturbance to terrestrial, estuarine, and marine environments.

The exact location of the reefs to be restored would be determined during the modelling and site selection process. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Environmental Consequences Section 6.4.12.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to geology and substrates from restoration projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to restore oyster reef habitat were described as causing short-term, minor adverse impacts. The project is consistent with the impacts and activities described in the Final PDARP/PEIS. This project would have short-term, minor adverse impacts on geology and the substrate from the placement of anchoring buoys and the disturbance of surrounding sediment from the placement of cultch material onto the substrate. Restoring degraded oyster habitat would have a long-term benefit by providing additional substrate suitable for oyster recruitment. The reefs would also reduce wave energy and erosion of adjacent shorelines, and help to stabilize the underlying substrate.\nHistorically, Pierce Marsh was a salt marsh crisscrossed with channels on the north shore of West Galveston Bay. Currently, the project area is completely inundated primarily due to subsidence. Pierce Marsh would be restored over submerged sediments in subtidal unvegetated flats. Sediment cores have been collected in the project area as a part of ongoing restoration and monitoring projects and the substrate composition has been analyzed. The substrate varies throughout the restoration and borrow sites, but is predominantly comprised of fine silt overlying a lay of clay of varying depths (Howard and Dobberstine 2008). \nThe breakwaters would be built over submerged sediments in subtidal habitat. Sediment cores were taken and the substrate was analyzed. Bathymetric and topographic surveys of the project area were performed by Naismith Marine Services, Inc. on May 16, 2012. The nearshore has prominent sandbars along the entire length of the project shoreline. Seaward of the shelf, the water depth has a steep slope. The upper shore-face is also relatively steep. The dry beach is narrow and decreases in elevation and transitions to wetlands. The dry beach primarily consists of sand, shells, and shell fragments, which contributes to steepness of the upper shore-face. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Environmental Consequences Section 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to geology and substrates from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. As described in the Final PDARP/PEIS, there may be moderate short-and long-term adverse impacts from this project. Staging areas and heavy equipment (both shoreline and barges) can cause direct localized and short-term, moderate adverse impacts from sediment disturbance and compaction. Standard BMPs for construction to reduce erosion and limit loss of sediments would be employed to minimize adverse impacts to geology and substrates. Construction of the breakwaters at Indian Point would affect substrates within the footprint of the project through the placement of hard structural materials and geotextile fabric. The placement of geotextile fabric and breakwaters would have long-term moderate adverse impacts on substrates and geology directly under the structures but it would be limited to approximately two acres of open bay bottom. However, the adverse impacts would be localized and long-term benefits would occur to the bottom substrates adjacent to the breakwaters due to stabilization of sediments and protection of the shoreline from erosion and wave action. In addition, the contractor would access the project area by land across the existing breakwaters; therefore, not disturbing adjacent sediments. Mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts to geology and substrates could include employment of standard BMPs for construction to reduce erosion and loss of sediments.\nSediments associated with this region of the Texas coast are unconsolidated at depth and made from deposition associated with lowered sea levels of the Pleistocene and more recent deposits associated with rising sea levels of the Holocene. The soils present at the site are comprised primarily of saline clays and loams. Upland soil series is used for grazing purposes while the other soil types are predominately too saline for agricultural purposes (NRCS 2002). Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nSoil types occurring on or near the project area include alluvial clays and silty clay lomas. The majority of the project area's topsoil is shallow with underlying, dense, impervious soils resulting in slow percolation. Thus, many ponds and potholes retain water for several weeks, and sometimes months, after a period of heavy rains. The soils are also highly saline due to marine influence (USFWS 1989). The Bahia Grande area is entirely comprised of the Sejita-Lomalta-Barrada soils association (USDA 1977). The soils of the former association are saline, loamy, and clayey at or near sea level, and broad areas of barren clay are inundated by high tides and rains (USDA 1977). The flat topography is interspersed by \"clay dunes\" or \"lomas\" rising 10-40 feet above the surrounding soils. These lomas range from less than one acre to over 100 acres in size (USFWS 2010).\nSediments associated with this tract consist of saline Mustang sands and coastal dune sediments. Mustang sands and coastal dune sediments have a high permeability above the water table. Coastal dune sediments are partly stable and partly active. Coastal dune sediments are steep, choppy, and less stable than surrounding sediments and are not subject to flooding at high tides as are Mustang sand sediments. Coastal dune sediments are subject to recreational activities and development (on southern portions of the island (Cameron County, TX Soil Survey 1977). There are no unique geological resources associated with the tract."}, {"section_title": "Hydrology and Water Quality Affected Resources", "text": "There are three tidal inlets into Galveston Bay, but only two are of major importance with regard to flow. Bolivar Roads (Houston Ship Channel), between Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula, accounts for the majority of the tidal exchange between the bay and the Gulf of Mexico. San Luis Pass, between the western end of Galveston Island and Follets Island, is an unaltered inlet that supplies a lesser amount of the bay's tidal exchange. Rollover Pass is by comparison a small enhanced tidal connection through Bolivar Peninsula connecting East Bay with the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, the natural depth of the bay is relatively shallow, 6 to 12 feet. Tides in Galveston under normal conditions are very small in amplitude, usually less than 3 feet between low and high tide. Wind speed and direction within Galveston Bay plays an important role in affecting tide elevation. It can dampen or enhance the height of waves as well as their potential energy. Prevailing winds are from the southeast, with occasional strong northerly winds that are associated with passing cold fronts. Winds combined with seasonal tide events can greatly exacerbate the tidal range as well as move the range up or down by 1 or 2 feet. Tropical storm tides during Category 4 or 5 hurricanes could be as high as 23 feet above normal water levels (GBEP 2011). According to the water quality index, Galveston Bay received a poor rating. Galveston Bay is rated fair for dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations and rated poor for dissolved inorganic phosphorus concentrations. Thirteen percent of the estuarine area was rated poor for dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations, whereas 68% of the estuarine area was rated poor for dissolved inorganic phosphorus concentrations. Expectations for water clarity are similar to those for normally turbid estuaries, with water clarity rated poor at a sampling site if light penetration at 1 meter was less than 10% of surface illumination. Dissolved oxygen conditions in Galveston Bay are rated good (EPA 2007b). As of August 2015, there are two human health consumption advisories in Galveston Bay for certain seafood species due to high levels of dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/seafood/advisories-bans.aspx). Within the restoration project areas, the advisory is limited to all species of catfish due to high levels of dioxin and PCBs.

The SNWW Navigation Channel system Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters serves as a pathway for both freshwater from the inflowing rivers and the saltwater wedge coming up the deep draft channel through Sabine Pass. This combination results in highly stratified conditions in the navigation channel, bringing saltwater up the SNWW and into the northwest corner of Sabine Lake and the lower reaches of the Neches River. As a result, the observed salinity in Sabine Lake is highest at both the southern end, where the lake connects to Sabine Pass, and the northern end, where the lake connects to the SNWW. The lowest salinities are observed in the central and eastern portions of the lake, which are furthest from sources of salt water (USACE 2011). Natural forces, which shape the system, include dominant south to southeast winds, tropical weather systems, and a substantial rainfall of over 60 inches per year. Flooding and freshwater inflows are key systemic processes, which buffer salinity and provide nutrients and sediments to extensive estuaries in the Sabine region. The Sabine River has the largest water discharge at its mouth of any Texas river. The total basin drainage area is 9,756 square miles with 7,426 square miles within Texas borders (TCEQ n.d.). The tidal portion of the Sabine River, Texas river segment 0501, does not meet assigned water quality standards for bacteria and exceeds allowable concentrations of PCBs in fish tissue (TCEQ 2014). Sampling results of fish tissue in nearby Sabine Lake prompted the issuance of Texas Department of State Health Services Fish and Shellfish Consumption Advisory ADV-46 for Sabine Lake and all contiguous waters that recommended limited consumption of gafftopsail catfish (TDSHS 2011). The GIWW tidal portion, Neches-Trinity Coastal Basin segment 0702 adjacent to the J.D. Murphree WMA, was not found to be covered by any fish advisories and fully supported aquatic life, contact recreation, and general uses (TCEQ 2002). The Neches River has a 10,011 square mile drainage basin that intersects the Sabine River at the north end of Sabine Lake. Similar to the Sabine River tidal portion, the Neches River tidal portion, Texas River segment 0601 adjacent to Bessie Heights, does not meet water quality standards for bacteria and allowable concentrations of PCBs in fish tissue (TCEQ 2015b). This portion of the Neches River discharges into Sabine Lake and is subject to the ADV-16 fish consumption advisory for gafftopsail catfish.\nPierce Marsh is a 2,346-acre area located on the north shore of Galveston Bay within the coastal plains ecoregion. Much of the area consists of marsh and slow-moving coastal bayous. The project area is bordered to the east by Galveston Bay and to the northeast by Swan Lake, a sub-bay of Lower Galveston Bay. Several industrial facilities, including the closed Solutia South 20 site, the GCWDA Campbell Bayou facility, and a closed Texas City landfill are located west of the project area. Protected marsh and wetlands owned by Scenic Galveston, Inc. border the southern portions of Pierce Marsh. Pierce Marsh was once part of Basford Lake, a salt marsh crisscrossed with channels and rich with fish and wildlife. Gradually, the marsh became inundated due to subsidence and much of that salt marsh habitat was lost. Since the late 1990s, several distinct marsh restoration activities, including marsh terracing and BUDM, improved over 400 acres at the site. There is additional capacity within dredged material containment levees constructed for a recently implemented beneficial use project. According to the EPA's water quality index, Galveston Bay received a poor rating. Galveston Bay is rated fair for dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations and rated poor for dissolved inorganic phosphorus concentrations (EPA 2007a). Thirteen percent of the estuarine area was rated poor for dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and 68% of the estuarine area was rated poor for dissolved inorganic phosphorus concentrations. Expectations for water clarity are similar to those for normally turbid estuaries, with water clarity rated poor at a sampling site if light penetration at 1 meter was less than 10% of surface illumination. Dissolved oxygen conditions in Galveston Bay are rated as \"good\" (EPA Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters 2007a). There are restricted consumption advisories in Galveston Bay for all species of catfish, spotted seatrout, and blue crab due to elevated levels of PCBs and dioxin (TDSHS 2013).\nThe project area is adjacent to Moses Lake, which is fed by Moses Bayou and drains into Galveston Bay. Moses Lake and Galveston Bay are connected by a gated levee. The gate is open during periods of normal tide and is closed during periods of high tide and hurricane surge (USGS, https://waterdata.usgs.gov/tx/nwis/wys_rpt/?site_no=08077650&agency_cd=USGS). Water depths in the project area range from 1-3 feet. Water quality in Moses Lake is impaired. It is listed by TCEQ as having impairments from dioxin in edible tissue and PCBs in edible tissue (TCEQ 2015a) Water quality in Moses Bayou is also impaired from bacteria, dioxin in edible tissue, and PCBs in edible tissue. Total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) in Moses Lake and Bayou for dioxin in edible tissue and PCBs in edible tissue are planned. Additional data is being collected before a management strategy is selected for the bacteria impairment.\nThere are two major tidal inlets into Corpus Christi Bay. Aransas Pass (Corpus Christi Ship Channel), between Mustang Island and San Jose Island, which accounts for the majority of the tidal exchange between the bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Packery Channel, between the southwestern end of Mustang Island and North Padre Island, is manmade inlet that supplies a lesser amount of the bay's tidal exchange. Overall, the natural depth of the bay is relatively shallow, with an average depth of approximately 9 feet. Tides in Corpus Christi Bay under normal conditions are very small in amplitude, usually less than 3 feet between low and high tide. Wind speed and direction within Corpus Christi Bay plays an important role in affecting tide elevation. It can dampen or enhance the height of waves as well as their potential energy. Prevailing winds are from the southeast, with occasional strong northerly winds that are associated with passing cold fronts. Winds combined with seasonal tide events can greatly exacerbate the tidal range as well as move the range up or down by 1 or 2 feet. Storm tides during Category 4 or 5 hurricanes could be as high as 15-20 feet above normal water levels according to NOAA's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) Model. The project site is located along Indian Point in Upper Corpus Christi Bay. Indian Point is a small peninsula that extends from the northeastern shore and extends towards Rincon Point on the southwestern shore. The two peninsulas separate Nueces Bay from Upper Corpus Christi Bay. Conditions within project area are primarily influenced by Corpus Christi Bay. The hydrology of the area is affected by tidal actions from the inlets and inflows of freshwater from the Nueces River through the delta into Nueces Bay. The breakwaters have been engineered to withstand existing hydrological tidal Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters pressures in the area and up to category three hurricane wave actions. The recent construction of the adjacent shore protection project and breakwaters, located just northwest of the proposed six breakwaters would be used as a model to implement measures to effectively manage any hydrology related concerns with the existing breakwaters. Corpus Christi Bay has four very specific areas listed in the 2014 Integrated Report of Water Quality Impairments (TCEQ 2015a; TCEQ 2015b) as not meeting recreation use criteria, specifically bacteria. The TCEQ is currently developing a TMDL and implementation plan for the water bodies. These impaired segments are Cole Park Beach, Ropes Park Beach, and Poenisch Park Beach. In addition, Oso Bay has impairments for bacterial and depressed dissolved oxygen. Nueces Bay has an oyster waters impairment listed specifically relating to zinc in the edible tissues. There are no restricted consumption advisories for Corpus Christi Bay.\nSeveral types of wetland habitat are found in the Bahia Grande area including natural inland ponds, small constructed impoundments (for livestock watering), resacas (old oxbow river channels), estuaries and tidal flats. San Mart\u00edn Lake contains permanent water even in drought years. Other surface waters are seasonal in nature. The Bahia Grande, once a tidal bay, was disconnected from the Gulf of Mexico by the construction of the Brownsville Ship Channel in the mid-1930s. Impacts to U.S. Waters and salinity are discussed at length in the 2015 EA referenced above. The TCEQ does not actively monitor the water quality of Bahia Grande. However, TCEQ maintains active water quality stations along adjacent water body, the Brownville Ship Channel (segment 2494). The Brownsville Ship Channel does not meet water quality standards for bacteria levels. However, it is categorized as a 5c water body, where additional data is required prior to development of a TMDL or management strategy (TCEQ 2015a). This segment has been listed on the 303d list for bacterial impairment since 2010 (TCEQ 2015a).\nThe project area has Drum and Christmas Bays in the inland side and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. Christmas Bay and Drum Bay are minor estuaries that border the project area that are protected from the Gulf of Mexico by Follets Island. Christmas Bay is a Coastal Preserve that has been recognized by the TGLO as a unique, high quality area. There is a connection with the Gulf of Mexico through Cold Pass and San Luis Pass. Bastrop Bayou is the main source of freshwater inflow to the system, in addition to runoff from surrounding coastal watersheds. Waters in the Gulf of Mexico are influenced by riverine sediment and nutrients inputs. A turbid surface layer of suspended particles is associated with the freshwater plume from these rivers. The river system supplies nitrate, phosphate, and silicate to the shelf (Minerals Management Service 2005). Water quality in the Gulf of Mexico is sufficient to support aquatic life use, recreation use, and general use (Clean Water Act [CWA] \u00a7303c; 40 CFR \u00a7131). However, there are restricted consumption advisories due to elevated levels of mercury in edible tissues of some tuna, jack, mackerel, shark, and bill fish species. Information regarding the recommended level of consumption for fish that could contain high mercury levels is described on the TPWD's website (http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/regulations/outdoorannual/fishing/general-rules-regulations/fish-consumption-bans-and-advisories). Water quality in Christmas and Drum bays is impacted from bacteria (TCEQ 2015b). Data has shown that localized section of bay segments on the Upper Texas Coast are not suitable for harvesting shellfish because of elevated bacteria concentrations (https://www.tceq.texas.gov/assets/public/waterquality/tmdl/74uppercoast/74-uppercoastbacteriapo.pdf). A TMDL for both bays has been completed and approved by EPA.\nMatagorda County receives an average of 47.61 inches of rain a year (NRCS 2002). The tract is bisected by a small tidally influenced bayou. Surrounding this area and water side portions of the tract, the tide influences the degree of flooding as well as the organisms that live here. There are no degraded water quality conditions known to be present in the area. The nearest degraded conditions known are for the eastern most end of East Matagorda Bay associated with Caney Creek where bacteria levels impair oyster waters designation for that portion of East Matagorda Bay (TCEQ 2015b). See Section 3.2.3 of the Texas Mid-Coast NWR CCP for more information.\nThe project area lies along the Laguna Madre to the east, which is the area's main source of tidal exchange into the system. The Laguna Madre is a unique hypersaline lagoon, and has been the focus of many restoration efforts in Texas. The Lower Laguna Madre is connected to the Gulf of Mexico via the Port Mansfield Channel and Brazos-Santiago Pass. Typically, this estuary receives 743,000 acre-feet of freshwater inflow per year from its major contributing sources, San Fernando Creek through Baffin Bay in the Upper Laguna Madre and the Arroyo Colorado in the Lower Laguna Madre, as well as from surrounding coastal watersheds (Schoenbaechler et al. 2011). The project area occurs within the Arroyo Colorado Watershed (ACW), which has been degraded over time through chemical pollution and other contaminants. The project area receives farmland and residential runoff water. Water quality is an issue in some of the major wetlands in the area, such as Laguna Atascosa Lake (USFWS 2010). Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters\nSouth Padre Island, TX receives an average of 28.94 inches of rain a year (http://www.usclimatedata.com). The tract is a portion of the barrier island with the Gulf of Mexico to the east and the Lower Laguna Madre to the west. The tide influences the degree of flooding on the eastern and western portions of the tract as well as the organisms that live here.

Global atmospheric GHG concentrations are a product of continuous emission (release) and removal (storage) of GHGs over time. In the natural environment, this release and storage is largely cyclical. For instance, through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture atmospheric carbon as they grow and store it in the form of sugars. Human activities such as deforestation, soil disturbance, and burning of fossil fuels disrupt the natural cycle by increasing the GHG emission rate over the storage rate, which results in a net increase of GHGs in the atmosphere. The principal GHGs emitted to the atmosphere through human activities are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride, with carbon dioxide accounting for the largest quantity GHG emitted. Criteria air pollutants and GHG emissions are largely generated by electricity production, vehicular movements, and commercial and residential buildings using electricity. GHG emissions would result from both the implementation and operation of the project from the use of vessels during construction and monitoring activities. Engine exhaust from barges, boats, excavators, and equipment would contribute to an increase in GHG emissions.

Construction equipment noise is known to disturb fish, marine mammals, and nesting shorebirds. The timing of noise producing activities would be planned to minimize disturbance to nesting birds. Construction noise could also potentially create a nuisance to residents and visitors in shoreline areas near reef restoration activities. To prevent undue disturbance, construction activities would be limited to daylight hours. Construction noise would be temporary and not anticipated to last more than 12 months.\nOysters are considered \"ecosystem engineers\" for their role in creating reefs that modify, through their physical presence, the surrounding environment while also providing habitat, refuge, and foraging areas for many other species including benthic organisms and fish (Coen and Luckenbach 2000;Powers et al. 2009;VanderKooy 2012;Wong et al. 2011). Oysters are most abundant in shallow, semi-enclosed water bodies (less than 12 meters in depth) in areas where salinity levels are between 15 and 30 ppt (VanderKooy 2012). Habitat types affected by oyster reef restoration activities are existing degraded oyster reefs and shallow (6 to 12 feet) unvegetated open water.\n\nReef restoration activities would be limited to off-shore, shallow open water areas in Upper Galveston Bay. Active and plugged oil and gas wells and gas gathering and crude transmission lines are present in Upper Galveston Bay (RRC 2017). These resources would be considered during the site selection process and avoided during construction.\nThe Orange County landscape is dominated by the broad flat valleys of the Sabine and Neches Rivers that are covered by coastal-type marsh vegetation. Geologic units exposed in the area include the Beaumont Clay, Deweyville Formation, and Quaternary alluvium. The surface topography of the project Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters area is mainly flat to gently rolling and slopes to the southeast toward the Gulf. The coastal areas are barrier headlands consisting of beach or eroding marsh shores, dune and supratidal habitats that naturally decrease in elevation toward fringing intertidal marshes, lakes, and ponds. The coastal zone is underlain by sedimentary deposits that originated in ancient but similar coastal systems -Recent and Holocene-age alluvium containing thick deposits of clay, silt, sand, and gravel, overlying the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation (Barnes 1982(Barnes , 1987McGowen et al. 1976). These formations consist mainly of stream channel, point bar, natural levee, and backswamp deposits associated with former and current river channels and bayous. The substrate in the vicinity of the restoration sites is predominantly comprised of fine silts, clay alluvium, and peat overlying the Beaumont Clay. The Bessie Heights site would be restored over submerged sediments in subtidal/estuarine marsh habitat.\nThe project location is adjacent to the SNWW, the third busiest waterway in terms of gross tonnage (American Association of Port Authorities 2013). Due to location, the Bessie Heights site experiences the ambient noise of marine transportation and the adjacent industry. Recreational and commercial waterborne traffic are common within Bessie Heights as the public accesses the natural resources and to support the Port Neches oil field.\nLarge estuarine aquatic habitats are present in the Sabine system, including oyster reefs. Sabine Lake is currently closed to commercial oyster harvesting (USACE 2011). In addition to supporting a large commercial fishery, oyster reefs provide important habitats for numerous commercially and recreationally important fishery species, such as red drum and brown shrimp. Oysters are also vital to maintaining the water quality of estuarine systems. Through their filter-feeding activities, oysters remove nutrients, pollutants, and algae from the water column. The shallow Gulf of Mexico waters, tidal flats, and beaches provide important shallow water feeding, breeding and nesting habitat utilized by killdeer, black-necked stilt, and willet (USFWS 2008). This transition from land to sea contains a combination of salt-tolerant marsh and beach plants, which are adapted to shifting sands, high winds, and rising waters and help protect the dunes from erosion. The Sabine Lake intertidal marshes consist of a continuum of vegetation communities comprised of plant species tolerant to the wide range of salinity in Sabine Lake. Salt marsh is located along the Gulf shoreline and higher salinity areas of the estuarine system. Subjected to regular tidal inundation, low saline marsh is dominated by smooth cordgrass and often accompanied by seashore saltgrass, blackrush, perennial saltmarsh aster, and marshhay cordgrass. Brackish marshes grade inland from salt marsh. The dominant species in low brackish marsh is saltmarsh bulrush; seashore saltgrass and marshhay cordgrass are co-dominant species in high brackish marsh. Intermediate marshes are subjected to periodic pulses of salt water and maintain a year-round salinity in the range of 3 to 4 ppt. The diversity and density of plant species are relatively high with marshhay cordgrass as the most dominant species. Co-dominant species in low marsh are seashore paspalum, Olney bulrush, California bulrush, and common reed; bulltongue and sand spikerush are also frequent. Intertidal wetlands often exist as a mosaic of vegetated marsh and shallow sub-tidal flats. These shallow flats support diverse benthic communities that provide food sources for migratory waterfowl, estuarine depend fish and invertebrate species and other marsh fauna.\n\nThe Bessie Heights marsh is part of a WMA that has no infrastructure associated with its operations. Within Bessie Heights, there is infrastructure associated with oil and gas extraction from the Port Neches Oilfield.\nThe marshes and shallow open water of Bessie Heights are designated as EFH for brown and white shrimp and red drum. Commercial crabbing also occurs regularly in the vicinity of the project area. \nThe recreational and industrial users of Bessie Heights are accustomed to navigating the marsh via the existing channels and avoiding shallow areas and areas that contain obstructions. The immediate vicinity of the project area was historically uplands habitat, but has since been inundated primarily due to subsidence from growing industry in the area. This has had adverse impacts on coastal resiliency and deleterious effects on the protectiveness of the area for storm surges.\nThere is a natural soundscape in the project area from wildlife and natural environmental processes such as water movement and wind. Sounds from recreational activities are minimal to moderate, and could include boating general recreational from the nearby yacht club. There are major highways (I-45, Hwy 6) in the general vicinity of the project area which generate road noise. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Environmental Consequences Section 6.4.1.1 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to noise from restoration projects intended to create, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands, is incorporated here by reference. Adverse impacts due to noise were described as being minor to moderate and short term. The project would have minor, short-term adverse impacts due to noise from construction activities. Instances of increased noise are expected during the construction phases associated with the restoration project. Heavy equipment can cause direct localized and minor adverse impacts due to noise. This impact would be short-term and limited to the period of construction. The project would generate construction noise associated with equipment during placement of the fill material, dredging, grading, and levee construction if necessary. Construction equipment noise is known to disturb fish, marine mammals, and nesting shorebirds. The timing of noise producing activities would be planned to minimize disturbance to nesting birds. The majority of construction activities would occur outside of the nesting season. Construction noise would also create a potential nuisance to visitors in areas adjacent to project construction activities. In order to mitigate some of the potential impacts from project activities due to noise, the timing of noise producing activities would be planned to minimize disturbance to nesting birds. To prevent disturbance to nearby residential communities, construction activities that produce significant noise would be limited to daylight hours. Construction noise would be temporary and the construction period is not anticipated to last more than 12 months.\nThe affected habitat resources of the project site includes salt marsh and shallow subtidal mudflats. Seagrasses are not expected in the vicinity of the project area and seagrasses were not identified using the TPWD seagrass viewer (http://tpwd.texas.gov/gis/seagrass/). Additionally, no seagrasses have been reported by resource agency biologists working in the area. Pierce Marsh is a subsided intertidal and high salt marsh complex adjacent to Highland Bayou in Hitchcock, Texas, on the north side of West Bay. The Pierce Marsh complex covers an area of approximately 2,346 acres, owned jointly by the GBF and TNC. Located along the Central Migratory Flyway, shallow subtidal mudflats of Pierce Marsh supports wintering ducks as well as a variety of shore and wading birds. Wading birds and shorebirds utilize the mudflats and shallow marsh ponds located throughout the area. Wintering waterfowl include gadwall, northern pintail, lesser scaup, American widgeon, greenwinged and blue-winged teal, and snow geese. The habitat is also considered EFH, as it is important nursey habitat for a variety of fish and invertebrates. Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters Wetlands in West Bay are a part of important processes that support the bay ecosystem. Estuarine or fringing marsh and freshwater wetlands filter polluted runoff, which enhances water quality, and provides habitat for many species of plants, fish, birds, and other wildlife. The principal commercial and recreational fishery species of Galveston Bay rely on estuarine wetlands during at least some part of their life cycle. The wetland edge is a particularly important habitat for white and brown shrimp (Whaley and Minello 2002), but the habitat also supports a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate fishery species, which rely on the protected waters of the marsh for breeding and foraging (GBF 2003(GBF , 2008. Other marsh dwelling species present in the project area include blue crab, red drum, spotted seatrout, Southern flounder and Gulf menhaden. Wetlands act as nurseries to hundreds of non-commercial species that comprise a large part of the bay food web. Bird species, such as snowy egrets, great egrets, roseate spoonbills, tri-colored herons, black-crowned night herons and great blue herons use marsh as feeding habitat.\nNo public water supply intakes are located in the project area. There are petroleum pipelines within the vicinity of the project area. There are active oil and gas wells within one mile of Pierce Marsh. There are abandoned oil and gas wells within the area of the marsh.\nConstruction would occur on submerged sediments in subtidal habitat in Moses Lake and Dollar Bay, Texas. NOAA nautical charts (http://www.charts.noaa.gov/BookletChart/11327_BookletChart.pdf) show water depths of 0-2 feet in the project area. Sediments within the Lake and Bay are muddy and soft. It is unknown if any hard substrates or oysters exist in the project area. A shallow navigation channel connects Moses Lake with the larger Galveston Bay system.\nThe project area is near residential communities, roads, and undeveloped areas. The residential communities and traffic on the roadways contribute to noise in the landscape. Noise beyond that created from the natural environment (e.g., noise from wind and waves) is minimal.\nThe project area includes Moses Lake and Dollar Bay, which are tidally influenced waterbodies on the western shore of Galveston Bay. Historically, much of the perimeter and interior of the project area once consisted of estuarine emergent marsh. However, historical subsidence coupled with shoreline erosion has greatly impacted these areas, converting marsh to open water. In addition, development around the Houston metropolitan area as well as areas surrounding Dollar Bay and Moses Lake have resulted in loss of important coastal habitats directly through transition of natural areas to developed properties.\n\nThe Project area is bordered to the south and west by residential areas of the city of Texas City. Existing road, water, sewer, power and communication infrastructure are present, however, they would not be affected by project activities. No public water supply intakes are location in the project area. There are no petroleum pipelines or oil field related structures within the vicinity of the project area.\nThe marshes and shallow open water of Mosses Lake and Dollar Bay support a wide range of commercial and recreational important fisheries resources. These water bodies are designated as Essential Fishery Habitat for brown and white shrimp, grey snapper, lane snapper and red drum.\nThe project area consists of open water. Current noise is generated from the natural soundscape (winds, wave action, birds, etc.) as well as recreational users (boaters, anglers, etc.). Indian Point Park is located near the project area and users would contribute noise to the soundscape.\nThe action area includes staging areas, the location of breakwater installation, transportation corridors, and habitats that would be affected by the installation of the breakwaters. The proposed location of the breakwater installation is at the southwestern end of a peninsula that separates Nueces Bay (westnorthwest) from the upper part of Corpus Christi Bay (south-southeast). Habitat in and adjacent to the construction area consists of a very productive and complex mosaic of habitats that include sand and shell beaches, dunes, seagrass beds, tidal flats, scrub/shrub uplands, intertidal and high saltmarsh, and lagoons. Current habitats that could be positively affected by the installation of the breakwaters include: The open water and estuarine marsh habitats in or near the project area are sustained by tidal exchange and the freshwater wetlands are dependent on rainfall. Plant species near the project area include saltwort, sea ox-eye daisy, glassworts, smooth cordgrass, turtle weed, dwarf saltwort, Virginia glasswort, and shoregrass, shoal grass, and widgeon grass. Estuarine marsh habitat is critical for larval, post-larval, and juvenile stages of many species. For example, brown shrimp are dependent on marsh-surface habitat during its post-larval and early juvenile stages (Minello and Zimmerman 1991). The recognition of estuarine emergent marsh as critical to fishery species is reflected in that estuarine emergent marsh is designated as EFH by NMFS in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Installation of rock breakwater would also create hard substrate habitat that would be similar to oyster reef habitat. While rock breakwaters differ from oyster reefs in their structure and formation, they would be similar in habitat type and provide some of the same beneficial ecological services as reefs. The interstitial spaces between the rocks provide cover for many of the same crustacean and finfish species utilizing oyster reefs. In addition, rock breakwaters provide hard substrate for encrusting species of bivalves, bryozoans, polychaete worms, and barnacles.\nThe project is located within open water. It is not part of an identified marine transportation channel. The nearest pipeline is about 1 mile away.\nThe Gulf Coast Plain is geologically of recent origin. The area is typified by sediments deposited during Pleistocene interglacial periods. Most of the sediments were derived from deltaic or fluvial deposits of the ancestral Nueces and Rio Grande Rivers. Large portions were subsequently covered by winddeposited silts and sands. These sediments continue to undergo wind transport and form extensive dune fields on the barrier islands and clay lomas (brushy dunes) in the Rio Grande delta. Wetland soils in the area are scattered and highly variable, usually with little peat and high sand content (USDA 1977, as cited in USFWS 2005.\nThere is a natural soundscape in the project area from wildlife and natural environmental processes such as water movement and wind. There is one major highway (SH 48) that runs directly through the project area, so there is some ambient road noise in the vicinity of the project area.\nIn the project area itself, topographically low areas are generally unvegetated tidal flats, although some algal mats and scattered vegetation may be present. Much of the project area open water or wetland vegetation, with scattered uplands occurring in topographically high areas. Vegetation in wetland areas is dominated by saltwort, shoreline sea-purslane, glasswort, and black mangroves.\n\nThe current channel and proposed expansion run directly under SH48. The pilot channel was dredged to run directly under the highway, and the footprint of the project would widen that channel and remain under the highway. There are several plugged gas wells in the vicinity of the Bahia Grande Unit in addition to several dry holes (RRC 2017). There are no active wells in the project area.\nThe Lower Laguna Madre area has tremendous importance as a finfish and shellfish nursery area on which a major commercial fishery and a lucrative recreational fishery are dependent. The Lower Laguna Madre supports a significant shrimping fleet for the state of Texas.\nThe project area is located on Follets Island, a barrier island, on the northern coast of Texas. The barrier island was formed by wave and tidal action parallel to the shoreline. The island may move and shift during storms and other events, but also absorb energy and protect the coastline. In general, there are sands, clay lomas, and sandy lomas in upland areas and clays in the wetlands. Soils present in the potential project area could include (USDA 2017): Section 6.4.1.5 of the Final PDARP/PEIS, which describes the impacts to geology and substrates from restoration projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats, is incorporated here by reference. Impacts from projects intended to protect and conserve marine, coastal, estuarine, and riparian habitats were described as having beneficial impacts as well as shortterm minor to moderate impacts on geology and substrates. This project would not have any adverse effects to geology and substrates. Implementation of this project would increase protections of the land and decrease impacts caused by trespassers. TPWD would employ management actions to reduce impacts as much as possible. There would be clear signs to designate the appropriate use of vehicles and other activities on the land, restricting vehicles to appropriate designated roads and access easements. Other management activities such as the installation of bollards may occur in order to preserve and/or enhance habitat quality. The area would also be patrolled by law enforcement professionals and other TPWD staff to enforce regulations to prevent resource damage from illegal vehicular activity. No off-road access would be allowed except through current legal access easements. Consistent with the Final PDARP/PEIS, this project would provide beneficial by improving geology and substrates in comparison to current conditions.\nThe project area is located on Follets Island in an area that is relatively undeveloped. Noise in the project area from human activities is minor resulting from activities such as vehicle use, minor construction of facilities, and recreational activities.\nRecognized by the USFWS as a nationally significant coastal barrier ecosystem, Follets Island is situated within the Gulf Prairies and Marshes ecological region and borders Drum and Christmas Bays. Ecological habitats in the project area include beaches, dunes, strand plains, coastal prairies, and wetlands. Seagrasses are located within waters adjacent to the project area. Christmas Bay is a bay of uniquely high quality that is relatively unaltered by human activity, demonstrated by its designation as a Coastal Preserve. The land north of and adjacent to the Christmas Bay Coastal Preserve is the Brazoria NWR, which further protects extensive coastal prairies and marshes and the water quality and wildlife habitat north of Christmas Bay.\n\nLand in the project area is relatively undeveloped. There are trail roads and a major highway, Bluewater Highway, which bisects the project area.\nThe project area contains marshes and boarders Christmas and Drum Bays as well as the Gulf of Mexico. The preservation of the land will help with storm abatement and help protect the existing road, Bluewater Highway.\nThe ambient noise level for the subject tract is relatively low. The project location is remote, far from factors that would cause moderate to high ambient noise levels such as highways, airports, industrial operations, or residential subdivisions. The community of Chinquapin is the closest residences to the subject tract. Nearby agricultural operations may use aerial application of fertilizers and herbicides intermittently. Vessel traffic on the GIWW may increase noise levels when passing near the area. Nearby Chinquapin Road gets light to moderate traffic.\nHabitats associated with the subject tract include salty prairie, high tidal marsh, and low tidal marsh. Marshes near the project area are typically dominated by cordgrass. They are subject to intermittent inundation due to tidal action and high levels of freshwater inflow. Fluctuations in temperature, salinity, water depth, and sediment composition can have a limiting effect on the number of plant species found. (USFWS 2013, internal citations omitted). Additional description of the habitats associated within the Texas Mid-Coast NWR in provided in Section 3.3.1, and vegetation associations are described in Appendix F, Sections IV and V of the Texas Mid-Coast NWR CCP. Additional information on habitats can be found in Land Protection Plan, Appendix I.\nThere is little infrastructure adjacent to the subject tract. Human infrastructure near the tract includes Chinquapin Road, fencing around the tract, and electrical service adjacent to the road that provides electricity to the community of Chinquapin. There currently exist no active oil and gas infrastructure within the project area. The subject tract contains two gravel roads, a cabin, several sheds, and three historic drilling well pads. Additional information concerning refuge infrastructure can be found in Section 3.6.4 of the Texas Mid-Coast NWR CCP.\nThe project area is located on Matagorda Peninsula in an area that is relatively undeveloped and noise in the area is dominated by natural processes (wind, waves, wildlife, etc.). Human activities also contribute to noise in the project area. Noise from human activities is minor resulting from activities such as vehicle use and recreational activities.\nThe lands surrounding East Matagorda Bay are largely undeveloped and have high quality coastal habitat. Much of this land is currently in conservation. Matagorda Peninsula has healthy mosaics of lagoons, coves, washover channels, emergent marshes, tidal and algal flats, and salt meadows. Within Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters the Bay waters there are seagrasses and oyster reefs. Having this mosaic of interconnect habitats provides valuable nursery habitat for a host of aquatic species.\nThreatened or Endangered Species Six species of endangered or threatened species were identified as possibly being affected in the project area: loggerhead sea turtles, green sea turtles, Kemp's ridley sea turtles, piping plovers, whooping cranes, and red knots (Table 4- 33). Although habitat is present for whooping cranes, they have not been observed in the project area. No activities related to implementation of the project would take place in any area designated as critical habitat. The red knot and piping plover are winter residents on the Texas coast and occur in Matagorda County. Additionally both species are known to use shoreline of bays and mudflats. There is critical habitat for piping plover on Matagorda Peninsula. Although there are no records of the whooping crane in the project area, they are present in the Brazoria NWR, which is on the north side of Christmas Bay. Whooping cranes may forage within or near the project area. There is no critical habitat for the whooping crane in the project area. Sea turtle nesting has been observed on Matagorda Peninsula. Green, loggerhead and Kemp's Ridley sea turtles are the only sea turtles known to nest in Texas. Kemp's Ridley sea turtle nests during the day time and is the most abundant nesting species in Texas. Other species of sea turtles nest at night. Sea turtles use nearshore hard bottom reef complexes, shallow water habitat (including seagrasses), or other coastal areas with rocky bottoms to forage for food. The project area has not been designated as critical habitat for any of the sea turtle species. Species of sea turtles, leatherback and Atlantic hawksbill, that do not nest in Texas are not included in this analysis because they would not use habitat that is included in the project area.\nLand in the project area is relatively undeveloped. There are only unpaved roads in project area.\nThe project area contains marshes and boarders East Matagorda Bay. It provides storm protection to nearby communities and habitats.\nThe ambient noise level for the subject tract is relatively low. It is in a remote location, far from many factors that would cause moderate to high ambient noise levels such as highways, airports, industrial operations, or residential subdivisions. The nearest noise source, a major road, is several miles from the tract across a body of water.\nThe tract includes tidal wetlands, thorn scrub, and coastal prairie with more than a mile of frontage on the Lower Laguna Madre and almost 2 miles frontage on a tidal inlet called Laguna Vista Cove. The tract protects extensive tidal flats, mud flats, emergent tidal marshes and seagrass beds. This tract is also part of the Laguna Madre/Bahia Grande wetlands system, which hosts 85 percent of the world population of redhead ducks, one-third of the Great Plains population of endangered piping plover for nine months of the year, and hundreds of threatened peregrine falcons during migration.\nBahia Grande Unit is bounded on the north by SH 100 and on the south by SH 48. These are major, fourlane highways that connect the Town of South Padre Island to the City of Brownsville (SH 48) and to U.S. Highway 77/83 (SH 100), near the City of San Benito. Except for a public boat ramp located off SH 48 at San Mart\u00edn Lake, there are currently no developed public access points to this unit from these highways (USFWS 2010). The tract is currently vacant and new infrastructure is not being proposed as part of this project. There currently exist no active oil and gas infrastructure within the project area (RRC 2017).

There are no seagrasses or oyster reefs/shell pads near the restoration site. These habitats are critical for many species of plants, fish, birds, and other wildlife. The wetland edge is a particularly important habitat for white and brown shrimp (Whaley and Minello 2002). Other marsh dwelling species include blue crab, red drum, spotted seatrout, Southern flounder and Gulf menhaden. Wetlands act as nurseries to hundreds of non-commercial species that comprise a large part of the bay food web. Bird species, such as snowy egrets, great egrets, roseate spoonbills, tri-colored herons, black-crowned night herons and great blue herons use marsh as feeding habitat. The area also supports a large waterfowl population in the winter, as well as a variety of year-round bird species. Wading birds and shorebirds utilize the mudflats and shallow marsh ponds located throughout the area. Wintering waterfowl include gadwall, northern pintail, lesser scaup, American widgeon, and green winged and blue-winged teal. Other birds that utilize the marsh include king and clapper rails, seaside sparrow and other secretive marsh species.\nAs discussed in the previous section, salt marsh and subtidal flats are the two primary habitat types at the project site. There are no oyster reefs/shell pads in the vicinity of any of the site alternatives. However, these two habitat types support a diverse array of species that can be found in the immediate vicinity of the project area. The subtidal flats and salt marsh of the West Bay watershed support an abundance of shrimp, oysters, and blue crab, which are frequently harvested in upper and lower Galveston Bay, as well as in the surrounding salt marshes and throughout the rest of the estuary. These habitats act as nurseries to Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Texas Trustee Implementation Group Final 2017 RP/EA: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; and Oysters hundreds of economically and ecologically important species that comprise a large part of the bay food web. The principal commercial and recreational fishery species of Galveston Bay, White shrimp, brown shrimp, and eastern oysters, are also abundant in the system and rely on estuarine wetlands during at least some part of their life cycle (Whaley and Minello 2002). Other marsh dwelling species in West Bay include blue crab, red drum, spotted seatrout, Southern flounder and Gulf menhaden. The area also supports a large waterfowl population in the winter, as well as a variety of year-round bird species. West bay has vital nesting islands, including North Deer Island, and thus serves as an important feeding area during nesting season. Wading birds and shorebirds utilize the mudflats and shallow marsh ponds located throughout the area. Species such as snowy egrets, great egrets, roseate spoonbills, tricolored herons, black-crowned night herons and great blue herons use marsh as feeding habitat. Wintering waterfowl include gadwall, northern pintail, lesser scaup, American widgeon, green-winged and blue-winged teal, and snow geese. It is possible that birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Texas Parks and Wildlife Code may nest in the Project area. Efforts would be made to avoid construction activities during the nesting season (Feb 15 through Jul 31). However, if construction activities occur during the nesting season, the area affected by project activities would be surveyed for the presence of nesting birds by a qualified biologist. If nesting birds are present or indications of pre-nesting behavior are observed, appropriate BMPs would be employed to ensure that no incidental take of any individuals occurs. Example BMPs may include virtual fencing, signage, exclusion zones for workers and equipment, hazing, and deterrents. BMP activities would be coordinated with USFWS and TPWD biologists.\nMuch of the project would be conducted in shallow open water areas of Moses Lake and Dollar Bay. Benthic surveys were completed in 2015 and no seagrasses were present in the project area. One area of oyster reef was identified and two small areas of scattered shell were identified in Dollar Bay. Preliminary project designs show that a silt fence would be use to protect the oyster reef (USACE permit application). There are a number of aquatic species found in the proposed restoration area. Fish species include sand seatrout, spotted or speckled seatrout, red drum, tonguefish, flounders, Atlantic bumper, and porgys. Water dependent birds may use the open bay to forage and roost. These would include loons, bay ducks, gulls, terns, and pelicans. Texas diamondback terrapins may use the marshes and surrounding waters.

Colonial waterbirds nest and roost in the scrub/shrub vegetation and wading shorebirds forage within the tidal lagoons within Indian Point Park, which is outside of the project area. Texas diamondback terrapins have been observed nearby and may use the project area.\nThe Bahia Grande Unit of the LANWR is located within the Tamaulipan Biotic Province and, in conjunction with surrounding natural lands, is regarded as an important reservoir of natural biological diversity. The area is an important estuarine nursery area, contributing to both recreationally and commercially important fish and benthic species such as shrimp, crab, and finfish (USFWS 2005). The sand/mud/algal flat environments are crucial for other invertebrates such as small crustaceans (crabs and shrimp) and molluscs (clams). The broader area of the Laguna Madre is important nursery habitat for redfish, spotted seatrout, and black drum. It is one of the most productive fisheries on the Gulf Coast. Limited wildlife surveys on the Unit have recorded several of the Valley's birds, the plain chachalaca, groove-billed ani, great kiskadee, and green jay. Other wildlife of interest encountered on the Unit are the Texas horned lizard, Rio Grande lesser siren, bobcat, ocelot, and javelina. The LANWR has documented more than 400 species of birds, one of the highest diversities on NWRs in the nation. The Rio Grande lesser siren, black-spotted newt, green jay, brown jay, tropical parula, Rio Grande ayenia, Coues rice rat, ocelot, and jaguarundi occur only in the Tamaulipan Biotic province (Refuge Checklists). This biotic province extends from the Nueces River of Texas south to the Rio Corona in Tamaulipas. The Lower Laguna Madre area contains important habitat for migratory and resident waterfowl and shorebirds and as well as wading birds. It is an important migration corridor for other birds such as peregrine falcons, ospreys and swallow-tailed kites and is an important resting and feeding area for trans-Gulf neotropical migrant bird species (USFWS 2005).\nThe project area contains a mosaic of coastal habitats that host a variety of wildlife. It borders Christmas Bay, Drum Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. These waterbodies support aquatic-dependent species that use marshes, a habitat type in the project area, for at least part of their life cycle. The marshes serve as nursery grounds for over 95% of the recreational and commercial fish species found in the Gulf of Mexico and are designated as EFH for species under federal FMPs. The wetlands provide habitat for many species of plants, fish, birds, and other wildlife. Many species rely on estuarine wetlands during at least some part of their life cycle.

The railroad bed consists of local fill and windblown sand/clay drifts around approximately 2 miles of degraded cypress pilings on which a narrow-gauge railroad trestle was historically supported. From information provided by the Port Isabel Museum, it has been determined that this railroad may have been originally constructed in 1865 under command of General Phil Sheridan to move Union troops between Brownsville and Port Isabel. Later, in 1872, Sim\u00f3n Celaya converted the army railroad to a \"42-inch gauge\" railroad, and named it the Rio Grande Railroad. This railroad ran a total of 26 miles between Brownsville and Port Isabel. Some of the railroad bed is deteriorated and some pilings are missing; therefore, this resource is no longer fully intact. In previous surveys, two significant archeological sites were found but were determined to be unimpacted by project activities (USFWS 2005).\nThe project area is largely undeveloped and contains high quality natural habitat. There are no known cultural resources in the project area.\nThere are currently no sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places; however, numerous identified archaeological or cultural sites are located within the boundaries of the Complex.

Prior to the construction of the pilot channel, strong coastal winds blew dust from the dry basin into area towns, which caused health problems, clogged air conditioners, shorted power lines, and restricted visibility on SH 48 and SH 100 (Ocean Trust 2009). At one time, blowing dust was the cause for most of the particulate matter in the region's air (USFWS 2005).

Part of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province, the Bahia Grande Unit is close to the Gulf of Mexico and consists of wind tidal flats and high ground that includes brush-covered clay dunes (lomas) that attain heights of up to 30 feet. This matrix of stabilized clay dunes is interspersed with grass and brush-covered uplands, saline flats, marshes, and shallow bays. Historically, the Bahia Grande area was rich in biological resources and contained important waterfowl habitat, especially for wintering waterfowl. Bahia Grande was also an important estuarine nursery area, contributing to a productive sport and commercial fishery. A small island within the bay provided nesting habitat for more than 10,000 terns, gulls and black skimmers (USFWS 2005). With the construction of the Brownsville Ship Channel in the mid-1930s, and the placement of dredge spoil on the north side of the channel, the shallow bay and wind tidal flats were isolated from the Laguna Madre. Open exchange of water was effectively blocked. An additional blockage was caused by the construction of SH48 in the early 1950s, when this roadway paralleled the ship channel on its northern side. These barriers to the natural hydrological connection between Bahia Grande and the Lower Laguna Madre caused a decline in biological productivity on the tidal flats and a loss of wildlife that was dependent on this productivity, including a decline in waterfowl numbers. In its historical condition prior to the 1930's, Bahia Grande reportedly supported wintering flocks of redhead ducks (15,000 were reported in one survey) and other ducks, much as the adjacent Lower Laguna Madre does today. Once converted from a dry basin to one inundated by tidal variations, it is probable that flocks of redheads and other waterfowl would once again use the area on a regular basis in the winter months. In addition, floral assemblages, both upland and wetland, were altered. At present, Bahia Grande is barren and dry most of the year with only portions having ephemeral, moist sediment or standing water conditions. Primary inflows are limited to water captured during precipitation events and occasional storm surges and other high tidal conditions (USFWS 2005). The Bahia Grande area, located along the Gulf Coast of Texas in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, lies approximately 27\u2070 north of the equator and receives an average annual rainfall of 26 inches (50-year average). The climate is both semi-arid and subtropical. Diurnal onshore and nocturnal offshore breezes moderate the thermal highs and lows along the coast. Prevailing winds, from the southeast off the Gulf of Mexico bring high humidity most of the year. Seasonal temperature variations range from a mean of 62\u2070 F in the winter to 84\u2070 F in the summer. Freezing temperatures occur once every four years on the average. Tropical storms and hurricanes periodically strike the area during the summer and fall months. Drought conditions, some of which extend over several years, also occur periodically (USFWS 2005).

As stated in the Final PDARP/PEIS, the No Action alternative \"does not meet the purpose and need for restoration of injured resources and services\" and therefore, was not identified as a preferred alternative. The OPA and NEPA analyses demonstrated that the other 16 proposed alternatives would provide benefits to the physical environment, biological environment, and human uses and socioeconomics resources without causing major adverse impacts. Ultimately the Texas TIG has identified projects that are preferred for implementation in the RP/EA based on the OPA evaluation of cost-effectiveness or likelihood of success. On May 18, 2017, The Texas TIG released the Draft RP/EA to the public for review during a public review period that ended on June 19, 2017. The Texas TIG also held two public meetings in Corpus Christi (June 7, 2017) and La Marque (June 8, 2017). The TIG considered the public comments received during this time, which informed the TIG's analyses and selection of the restoration projects in this document, the Final RP/EA. A summary of the public comments received and the Trustees' responses to those comments is included in Chapter 7. After consideration of the comments received from the public during the review period, the Texas TIG selects the original thirteen projects preferred projects proposed in the Draft RP/EA. Projects not selected as preferred in this RP/EA could be identified as preferred in the future. Thirteen projects have been selected by the Texas TIG as preferred for implementation (Table 7-1). The OPA analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of the Landscape Approach to Oyster Reef Restoration alternative is currently unknown. The preferred oyster alternative would generate information to evaluate cost-effectiveness for other oyster projects. Therefore, only the Oyster Restoration Engineering alternative is preferred at this time. Additionally, the Dollar Bay and Moses Lake Wetland Restoration alternative is not as cost-effective in comparison to alternatives that are restoring similar resources in this RP/EA. The likelihood of success for the Matagorda Peninsula Habitat Acquisition alternative is unknown at this time because willing sellers have not been identified. The complete OPA analyses can be reviewed in Chapter 3. Completion of similar nearby projects or further development of E&D documents may refine cost estimates and non-preferred project may be reconsidered in a later restoration plan. There will be additional opportunities for consideration of restoration projects as the NRDA restoration planning process moves forward.

Human activities and natural processes have resulted in the loss of dunes and Version 1.0, October 2017 removal of sand from the beach face on the shoreline near McFaddin NWR. Currently, the project area consists of clay overlain at most by a thin sand veneer. This project is anticipated to restore the dunes and sandy beach habitat. Based on previous restoration experience by the Texas TIG with similar projects in this area, the outcomes anticipated for this project are typical of this restoration type. As such, performance parameters identified in subsequent sections are sufficient to describe anticipated outcomes. T\nThis project would contribute to an ongoing, large-scale conservation effort to restore marsh and wetland habitat in the Lower Neches WMA. For the lower Neches River, from Beaumont to Sabine Lake, significant systematic change occurred between the 1950s and the 2000s as marsh was lost (reduced from 10,184 hectares (ha) to 4,279 ha) and converted to open water (increased from 694 ha to 5,080 ha). The largest degree of marsh loss was in the vicinity of the Lower Neches WMA where oil and gas production in the Port Neches Oil field caused subsidence via the activation of a pair of high-angle faults that promoted marsh flooding and conversion to open water. The proposed project would be a continuation of other marsh restoration efforts in the area. Subsidence rates would be considered during the design of the project. The anticipated outcome is the creation of up to 900 acres of intertidal and high marsh.\nThis project would contribute to an ongoing, large-scale conservation effort to restore marsh and wetland habitat in the Galveston Bay system. Historical subsidence in the Galveston Bay area has inundated thousands of acres of coastal marsh. Wetland loss in coastal Texas has been rated by the EPA as severe and is greater in the Galveston Bay system than other areas of the state . It is estimated that between 1953 and 1989, Galveston Bay experienced a net loss of approximately 35,100 acres of wetlands . Subsidence in the greater Houston area has slowed considerably since groundwater pumping was severely limited beginning in 1975 . To implement this project, the Texas TIG would partner with the USACE to use dredged material from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) to increase elevations in leveed open water areas of Pierce Marsh and make them suitable for the establishment and long-term sustainability of a shallow intertidal wetland. It is anticipated that the next opportunity to partner with USACE to receive dredged material for restoration purposes would be between 2018 and 2020. Depending on availability of funding, this project may involve more than one GIWW maintenance dredging cycle. Based on a BUDM placement and marsh restoration project completed in in this area, the outcomes anticipated for this project are typical of this restoration type. As such, performance parameters identified in subsequent sections are sufficient to describe anticipated outcomes.\nConveying this property to TPWD would conserve coastal habitat with a high development risk in perpetuity. By acquiring and preserving land on a coastal island, this project would benefit multiple resources such as sea turtles, shorebirds, coastal marshes, dunes, and beaches. This project will benefit flora and fauna by enlarging the amount of protected habitat adjacent to Christmas Bay. This acquisition will protect existing habitat corridors and prevent any future development. This project would also enhance the human experience by providing access to passive recreational activities (e.g., fishing from the shore and wildlife viewing). The diversity of habitats on this tract increases the longevity of benefits derived from this project in consideration of coastal sea level rise."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Uncertainties", "text": "he uncertainties associated with the project and how they would be addressed are discussed in Sections 3.3.4.1 and 3.3.4.4.3 of the RP/EA. The largest sources of uncertainty with this project are future relative sea level rise and the impact of hurricanes. The variability in predicted future increases in eustatic sea level rise combined with potential regional and localized subsidence could result in lowering of elevations of the restoration site resulting in an increase in the frequency of maintenance events needed to maintain adequate elevations. Erosion from hurricanes could cause significant geomorphic change to the restored beach. If monitoring indicates lower than predicted elevations following initial construction and after storm impacts, then provisions through other funding sources could be made to add additional material to the restoration site to adjust the project grade to the desired elevation range.\nThe uncertainties associated with the project and how they would be addressed are discussed in Sections 3.3.6.1 and 3.3.6.3.3 of the RP/EA. The Texas TIG aims to propose and select projects that are feasible and have a high probability of success. Projects that are frequently implemented for this restoration type are technically feasible and have a high probability of success with few, if any, uncertainties. Monitoring can inform the selection of appropriate corrective actions in the event a project is not meeting its performance criteria and can also inform the selection, design, and implementation of future projects. However, not all uncertainties may be resolvable. The largest source of uncertainty with this project is future relative sea level rise of one to four feet over the next century. The variability in predicted future increases in eustatic sea level rise combined with potential regional and localized subsidence could result in lowering of elevations of the restoration site (Melillo et al. 2014). If monitoring indicates lower than predicted elevations following consolidation of dredged material, then provisions could be made to add additional material from subsequent navigation dredging events or mechanically re-distribute sediments within the restoration site to adjust the project grade to the desired elevation range.\nThe uncertainties associated with the project and how they would be addressed are discussed in Sections 3.3.9.1 and 3.3.9.4.3 of the RP/EA.

The Galveston Bay watershed provides important habitat for wildlife, including migratory waterfowl, ducks, and wading birds and also serves as a valuable nursery and breeding habitat for numerous estuarine-dependent sp01i and commercial fish and shellfish. The placement of dredge material and associated planting would restore up to 150 acres of marsh and contribute to m1 ongoing effo1i to restore the wetland complex in West Galveston Bay. The potential environmental effects from the project would be largely minor, localized, and often of short duration. In addition, any BMPs and measures to avoid and minimize impacts that are identified during the permitting process or during consultations and reviews with natural resource agencies would be implemented. As a result, collateral injury would be avoided or minimized during project implementation. Anticipated project outcomes (marsh creation) would increase the ability of the coastline to mitigate storm surges, which would greatly benefit the public. 4.

In the RP/EA, the Texas TIG addressed NEPA requirements by tiering from environmental analyses conducted in the Final PDARP/PEIS, evaluating existing analyses, incorporating by reference relevant analyses from existing project environmental assessments (EAs) and conservation plans, and preparing environmental consequences analyses for projects as appropriate. The RP/EA evaluated both beneficial and adverse impacts of the Proposed Action, which is to implement the thirteen preferred alternatives and associated projects described and analyzed in the RP/EA. Project implementation will provide many benefits to the environment; however, because there is potential to adversely affect one type of resource while improving the condition of another resource, there may at times be minor to moderate site-specific adverse environmental effects. \u2022 The Proposed Action is not expected to result in significant adverse effects on public health or safety. The restoration measures/management activities will provide long-term beneficial impacts to improve natural ecosystem functions, and best practices will be implemented on a site-specific basis to mitigate the potential for adverse effects to occur to public health and safety during implementation. \u2022 The Proposed Action will have no significant adverse impacts to unique characteristics of the geographic areas. The Proposed Action is not expected to have any significant adverse effects on wetlands, floodplains, municipal water sources, ecologically critical areas, wild and scenic river corridors, park lands, wilderness, wilderness research areas, research natural areas, inventoried roadless areas, national recreation areas, or prime farmlands, particularly on a regional basis. The purpose of the Proposed Action is to improve the condition of natural resources damaged by the DWH oil spill. \u2022 The effects of the Proposed Action on the quality of the human environment are not controversial. The Proposed Action is supported by the public. No public comments indicated opposition to the Proposed Action. \u2022 There are no highly uncertain, unique, or unknown risks associated with the Proposed Action. The land acquisition, habitat restoration and management activities, and conservation practices are successful, well-established, and commonly used practices for habitat restoration and land conservation. \u2022 The Proposed Action neither establishes a precedent for future Texas TIG actions with significant effects nor represents a decision in principle about a future consideration. Future Texas TIG actions will be determined through separate planning processes. \u2022 The Proposed Action will not result in significant adverse cumulative impacts. As discussed in the RP/EA, the Proposed Action is intended to benefit natural resources. Though some minor, primarily short-term adverse effects may occur in some locations, the cumulative effects of these actions on the quality of the human environment are not expected to be regionally significant, particularly when focusing on the significant adverse impacts that NEPA is intended to help decision makers avoid, minimize, or mitigate. \u2022 Based on information in the RP/EA, the Proposed Action is not expected to threaten a violation of Federal, state, or local laws, or requirements imposed for environmental protection. However, projects will be monitored appropriately, and approaches and designs may be applied, adopted, or modified from other similar projects as deemed necessary. \u2022 The Proposed Action will not adversely affect vulnerable marine or coastal ecosystems. \u2022 The Proposed Action is not expected to adversely affect biodiversity or ecosystem functioning (e.g., benthic productivity, predator-prey relationships, etc.). \u2022 The Proposed Action is not expected to result in the introduction or spread of a nonindigenous species.
