Baseline demographics are summarized in the table.\nThe impaired awareness group demonstrated lower scores on the ADAS-Cog. Furthermore, participants with MCI in the impaired awareness group also demonstrated a larger deficiency on both the RAVLT-IM and RAVLT-D. No statistically significant differences were observed for MMSE, Category Fluency, TMT-A, or TMT-B (figure e-2, links.lww. com/WNL/A235).\nANCOVAs revealed that compared with individuals with MCI with intact self-awareness, individuals with MCI with impaired self-awareness had higher levels of CSF p-tau, CSF total tau, and global [ were observed. Because 0.5 was the threshold for determining intact vs impaired awareness (with impaired awareness participants having scores below 0.5), a negative correlation between AD biomarkers and patient-caregiver discrepancy is expected.\nA voxel-based regression model demonstrated that individuals with amnestic MCI in the impaired self-awareness group had higher [ 18 F]florbetapir uptake in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and right lateral temporal and parietal cortices than individuals with intact self-awareness ( figure 3A) . Results of a voxel-based regression model revealed that individuals with MCI with impaired awareness had decreased metabolism in the PCC and precuneus (figure 3B). Voxel-based regression model demonstrated that impaired self-awareness in MCI predicts lower [ 18 F]FDG uptake at 24-month follow-up in the PCC, bilateral medial temporal lobes, right lateral temporal lobe, and basal forebrain (figure 4).\nA total of 28.15% of patients with amnestic MCI in the anosognosia group converted to AD dementia, while only 12% in the intact awareness group converted. A multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that impaired awareness of illness predicts diagnostic conversion over 2 years (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.6-5.25). Notably, the only other factor more closely associated with diagnostic conversion at 24-month follow-up was APOE e4 status (OR 3.42, 95% CI 1.88-6.39). Anosognosia remained a significant predictor of progression to dementia (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.44-5.7) when ADAS-Cog scores were employed as a covariate. When each CSF measure of pathology was included in the logistic regression, anosognosia no longer significantly predicted clinical progression (p = 0.09). For the participants with amnestic MCI included in the present analysis, the overall progression rate to probable AD in 2 years was 18.5%. In the intact awareness group, progression to dementia was associated with a significant decline in awareness of illness from baseline (mean 22.27, SD 16.54) to 24-month follow-up (mean \u22124, SD 33.27, p = 0.0006)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our results suggest that anosognosia is linked to Alzheimer disease pathophysiology in vulnerable structures, and predicts subsequent hypometabolism in the default mode network, accompanied by an increased risk of progression to dementia. This highlights the importance of assessing awareness of cognitive decline in the clinical evaluation and management of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment.\nAnosognosia, a syndrome characterized by a lack of awareness of one's illness, is commonly observed in Alzheimer disease (AD). 1 Patients with AD with anosognosia are unaware of their cognitive deficits and the difficulties they face when performing activities of daily living. Anosognosia is also correlated with dementia severity in AD. 2 Hence, anosognosia constitutes an important clinical characteristic of patients with AD.\nThe relationship between anosognosia and AD pathophysiology in the predementia phase of AD is poorly understood. Because anosognosia occurs frequently in AD, further studies focusing on the associations of anosognosia in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD pathophysiology are of paramount importance, given that anosognosia in MCI may represent an important clinical syndrome that signals disease progression. 3 The present study aims to characterize the associations of anosognosia and AD biomarkers based on the recently described amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration construct 4 in MCI, using [ 18 F]florbetapir, CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and [ 18 F]FDG, respectively. In addition, we examine the predictive effect of anosognosia on disease progression and changes in brain glucose metabolism at a 24-month follow-up. Because anosognosia occurs frequently in the symptomatic phase of AD, we also hypothesized that anosognosia is related to an increase in neuropathologic features of AD at baseline, and correspondingly to higher rates of diagnostic conversion at 24-month follow-up. The finding of a significant relationship between anosognosia, AD biomarkers, and disease progression would support a framework where assessments of illness awareness constitute an important role in the clinical management of MCI."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership led by principal investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.\nIn this study, we selected participants meeting criteria for amnestic MCI who have both their baseline everyday cognition (ECog) 5 as well as their study partner's ECog scores. Participants with MCI were defined as having (1) a subjective memory concern as reported by the participant, study partner, or clinician; (2) abnormal memory function documented by scoring within education-adjusted ranges; (3) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 24 and 30; (4) Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5 with a memory box score of at least 0.5; and (5) general cognition and functional performance sufficiently preserved such that a diagnosis of AD cannot be made by the site physician at the time of the screening visit.

Informed written consent was obtained from all participants enrolled in this study.\nDetermining intact and impaired selfawareness We defined intact and impaired self-awareness of cognitive deficits based on the difference between patient and informant global ratings on the ECog questionnaire. Participants with anosognosia are described as those with impaired self-awareness. The ECog questionnaire measures global as well as domain-specific cognitive functions, such as episodic memory and planning, by asking participants to compare their cognitive abilities currently and 10 years earlier. A study partner, such as a spouse or caregiver, who spent a minimum of 10 hours per week with the participant, also completed the ECog questionnaire according to the participant's cognitive abilities. ECog is a useful measure for levels of awareness along the AD spectrum because understanding awareness of deficits in functioning requires the individual to consider performance on everyday activities, where deficits can be observed in MCI. The information provided by caregivers has repeatedly been shown to be highly accurate. [6] [7] [8] The cutoff for the threshold of impaired self-awareness was calculated using the best operational point on a receiver operating characteristic curve contrasting healthy controls (n = 290) and patients with AD (n = 150) from the ADNI cohort.

Defining abnormality based on 95% CIs from the healthy population is a commonly employed approach. 11, 12 To evaluate whether anosognosia is an important risk factor for progression from amnestic MCI to AD, we performed a logistic regression analysis including other known factors related to diagnostic conversion including age, sex, years of education, and APOE e4 status as covariates. We also repeated the logistic regression analysis employing ADAS-Cog scores as an additional covariate to correct for cognitive impairment. Odds ratios (ORs) with respective 95% CIs were calculated."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The present study investigated the relationship among amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration, and anosognosia in amnestic MCI. The results demonstrate that impaired awareness of illness in MCI is accompanied by an increase in AD pathophysiology as well as decreased metabolism in neural structures vulnerable in AD, independently of sex, education, age, and APOE e4 status. The presence of anosognosia at baseline predicted hypometabolism and clinical progression at 24-month follow-up independently of disease severity. Together, these findings highlight the importance of anosognosia as a clinical feature in amnestic MCI.\nWhile MCIs in both groups did not differ on MMSE score, participants with MCI with impaired awareness of illness demonstrated lower global cognitive ability from the ADASCog. This divergence may be attributable to the ADAS-Cog being a more sensitive measure of cognitive dysfunction. 13 Furthermore, the impaired awareness group performed worse on verbal memory and delayed recall, consistent with a recent meta-analysis of the neuropsychological correlates of impaired awareness in MCI.\n14 Furthermore, because metacognitive monitoring abilities are also diminished in dementia, 15 impaired awareness in MCI may be suggestive of incipient AD.\nOur findings of participants with MCI with impaired selfawareness having lower CSF A\u03b2, higher global A\u03b2 deposition, higher CSF p-tau, and higher CSF total tau supports a link between anosognosia and AD pathophysiology according to the A/T/N biomarker classification system. 4 Specifically, in participants with MCI with impaired self-awareness, we found increased amyloid deposition in the PCC compared to individuals with intact self-awareness, a feature observed early in the AD process. 16 Higher global amyloid burden has also been linked to decreased awareness of cognitive decline in MCI. 17 Furthermore, results from a longitudinal study reported that individuals with impaired awareness of memory decline demonstrated increased tau pathology postmortem. 18 While these results suggest that anosognosia in MCI is a clinical manifestation of AD pathophysiology, future work is needed to elucidate the role of cognitive impairment in anosognosia. Because relationships between lack of awareness of cognitive impairment and CSF amyloid and CSF p-tau were no longer significant when accounting for cognitive impairment, the regional distribution of neuropathology likely plays a role in the decline of illness awareness.\nThe association of anosognosia with decreased metabolism and increased amyloid load in the PCC, a key node of the default mode network (DMN), in MCI suggests a link between the PCC and the impairment of self-awareness. The DMN is a large-scale network of brain structures comprising the PCC/precuneus, medial temporal lobes, medial prefrontal cortex, as well as the lateral parietal cortex and is shown to be vulnerable in AD 19 and MCI. 20 Importantly, decreased metabolism in the PCC is regarded as a key feature of the early clinical stages of AD. 21, 22 While the pathologic features of AD typically first appear in the medial temporal lobes, 23 previous work has suggested that the PCC is an area vulnerable to metabolic decline in early AD. 16, 24 Although the precise mechanism of decreased metabolism in the PCC leading to anosognosia in MCI is not known, multiple functional MRI studies have suggested that the PCC plays a key role in mental processing related to oneself [25] [26] [27] and is involved in the retrieval of autobiographical memories. 28 Furthermore, previous research has shown that less neuronal activity in the PCC is observed when patients with MCI with impaired awareness of illness engaged in a selfreferential mental task compared to patients with MCI with intact awareness. 29 It is possible that patients' decreased mental activity relating to themselves may result in patients failing to integrate information about their recent functional difficulties and cognitive decline into their knowledge about themselves.\nAnosognosia in amnestic MCI predicted hypometabolism in the PCC, bilateral medial temporal lobes, right lateral temporal lobe, and basal forebrain at 2-year follow-up. AD and MCI are characterized by significant loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. 30, 31 Our results are also in line with previous results demonstrating that patients with AD with anosognosia had decreased glucose metabolism in the PCC 32 and medial temporal lobes. 33 Crucially, the PCC and medial and lateral temporal lobes are DMN structures particularly vulnerable in AD, suggesting that the presence of anosognosia in MCI may be an important marker of incipient AD dementia. Correspondingly, individuals with amnestic MCI with impaired awareness of cognitive decline were 2.86 times more likely to progress to AD within a 2-year time frame than those with intact awareness. Our results are in agreement with previous research demonstrating that lack of awareness of cognitive decline typically appears 2-3 years before the onset of dementia. 18 Awareness of cognitive decline is not incorporated into screening procedures such as the Alzheimer's Association recommendations for operationalizing the detection of cognitive impairment. 34 If replicated, these findings demonstrating an increase in AD pathophysiology indicate that awareness assessments are a reasonable method to clinically screen individuals for interventions targeting AD pathophysiology in MCI. Indeed, anosognosia could provide clinicians with insights regarding clinical progression to dementia, though future work is needed to determine the methodology to most accurately assess awareness of illness.\nWhile multiple procedures exist for assessing the extent of lack of awareness of cognitive decline, 1 there is currently no ubiquitously accepted gold standard. Currently, approaches to quantifying lack of awareness of cognitive deficits fall into 3 main categories: (1) assessing the difference between subjective ability and objective score on a neuropsychological task, (2) assessment by a clinician, and (3) ), clinicians may be able to gain important prognostic information by assessing a patient's awareness of illness with an informant. Some methodologic considerations make replication of these findings highly desirable. The first is our operational measure of anosognosia; ECog is a measure of activities of daily living and not a measure of self-awareness in the strict sense. Another limitation of ECog is that it requires patients to recall their memories of past cognitive functioning, a faculty impaired in the anosognosia group. Despite the novelty of using the discrepancy of the ECog scores, the methodology of subtracting patient from caregiver scores has wide empirical support and is commonly employed in investigations of anosognosia across the AD spectrum. 2, 32, 33 Furthermore, awareness of illness is not a binary phenomenon and future work is needed to establish the most appropriate method of determining the degree of awareness of illness across the AD spectrum. Another limitation of this research is that ADNI participants are self-selected, and thus may have been interested in participating due to having noticed a decline their cognitive abilities. Therefore, replication in another population-based cohort will strengthen confidence in these findings. However, a unique advantage of the ADNI cohort is that participants do not need to express a concern about their cognitive decline in order to be enrolled in the cohort, thus permitting the study of anosognosia for cognitive decline in MCI.\nThe results of the present study demonstrated that anosognosia in amnestic MCI is related to an increase in neuropathologic features of AD and increased risk of clinical progression to dementia. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of including assessments of self-awareness in medical diagnostic settings in order to provide additional insights into disease severity and clinical management across the AD spectrum.\nAuthor contributions J.
