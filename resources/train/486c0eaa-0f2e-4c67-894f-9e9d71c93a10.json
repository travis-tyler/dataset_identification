Childcare subsidies are intended to increase families' access to quality care, but little is known about subsidy use by children with special needs. Using a nationally representative sample of 4,000 young children who participated in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, we examined the types and quality of childcare received by children with and without special needs who came from subsidy eligible families. We also investigated the extent to which subsidy use and child and family sociodemographic characteristics predicted care type and quality among young children with special needs who used childcare subsidies at 9 months, 2 years, and 4 years. Findings indicated that subsidies increased the use of nonparental care, mainly center-based care, as well as home-based care to a lesser extent among children with special needs relative to peers without special needs and relative to peers with special needs who did not use subsidies. However, use of subsidy did not consistently result in families with children with special needs accessing higher quality care. Sociodemographic characteristics of children, families, and their context were differentially predictive of type and quality care. We discuss implications for practice and policy to foster quality early care and education of young children with special needs who are receiving subsidies."}, {"section_title": "INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN/APRIL-JUNE 2018", "text": "high quality care through provision of grants and vouchers and include specific provisions to benefit children with special needs. Studies suggest that subsidies facilitate receipt of quality care among low-income families (e.g., Ryan, Johnston, Rigby, & Brooks-Gunn, 2011 ), yet there has been little attention to the experiences of families of children with special needs despite evidence to suggest that they face unique barriers to care (Chaudry et al., 2011; Grisham-Brown et al., 2010) . To address this gap in research, the present study investigated the types and quality of childcare accessed by subsidy-recipient families of children with special needs relative to children who were typically developing, as well as predictors of the types and quality of care received by children with special needs.\nThe purpose of the present study was to identify differences among subsidy-eligible families in the type (parental-care only, homebased care, and center-based care) and quality of care accessed by children with and without special needs who used subsidies and between children with special needs who did and did not use subsidies. Accordingly, we addressed the following research questions (RQs):\n1. Among children from subsidy-eligible families, are there differences in use of home-and center-based care by children with and without special needs who used subsidies throughout early childhood? 2. Among children with special needs from subsidy-eligible families, are there differences in the (a) types and (b) quality of care received as measured by adequacy of global quality, child-to-caregiver ratio, and caregiver interactions, as well as by dosage, among those who did and did not use subsidies throughout early childhood? 3. How are subsidy use, child characteristics, and family characteristics related to the (a) types and (b) quality of care received, as measured by adequacy of care and caregiver interaction, among children with special needs from subsidyeligible families? We included in our analyses child demographics, mothers' sociodemographic characteristics, family configuration, and geographic factors shown to be related to subsidy use among low-income families (Herbst, 2008; Shlay et al., 2004) . Collectively, this study extends our understanding of the childcare experiences of young children with special needs who come from lowincome families.\nexceeded the recommended ratio at 2 and 4 years of age, respectively."}, {"section_title": "CHILDCARE CHOICES", "text": "Families' selection of childcare providers is related to a variety of logistic constraints (e.g., cost, hours of operation, location), sociodemographic characteristics, personal beliefs, and preferences (Huston, Chang, & Gennetian, 2002; Peyton, Jacobs, O'Brien, & Roy, 2001; Tang, Coley, & Votubra-Drzal, 2012 ). Conceptual models of care emphasize the relations of families' care choices to child characteristics, maternal sociodemographic characteristics, and families' contexts, such as work schedules, income, and informal care arrangements (Tang et al., 2012) . For many families, home-based care is more affordable and flexible than center-based options, thus being more accessible for low-income families (Tang et al., 2012) .\nEnhancing parent choice and access to high-quality childcare is at the center of federal subsidy policy (Office of Child Care [OCC], 2017) . Subsidies have been found to be associated with earlier use of centerbased care and later use of publicly funded preschool programs (Johnson, Martin, & Ryan, 2014) . In addition, subsidy use seems to be related to a variety of child and family characteristics including mother's English proficiency, mother's education, parental marital/partnership status, child support arrangements, parental employment status, income-to-needs ratio, number of siblings in the home, food security, urbanicity, child age, and childcare cost and proximity (Herbst, 2008; Johnson, Martin, & Brooks-Gunn, 2011; Shlay, Weinraub, Harmon, & Tran, 2004) .\nFamilies of children with special needs report greater challenges and stressors related to securing acceptable care (Knoche, Peterson, Edwards, & Jeon, 2006 ; National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, 2008) . These challenges may help explain why they appear to access childcare later, for fewer hours per week, change providers more often, and rely on relative care to a greater extent than home-based or center-based care when compared with families of children without special needs (BoothLaForce & Kelly, 2004; Knoche et al., 2006) . Families of children with special needs often also perceive home-based care as better meeting the child and family needs (Booth-LaForce & Kelly, 2004) . A notable percentage of these parents (almost 30%) perceive their childcare choices as constrained (Glenn-Applegate, Pentimonti, & Justice, 2011) . This may be because parents encounter providers who lack the willingness or competence to provide appropriate services or physical environment (Forry, Daneri, & Howarth, 2013; GrishamBrown et al., 2010) . Whether the use of subsidies can positively impact the care choices of families of children with special needs has not been explored. Thus, the present study considered whether use of subsidies by families of children with special needs resulted in different care choices regarding use of parental, home-based, and center-based care relative to subsidy-eligible families of children with special needs who did not use subsidies, as well as compared with families of children without special needs, adjusting for other child and family characteristics related to subsidy use (e.g., see the study by Herbst, 2008; Shlay et al., 2004) . low quality, subsidies endeavor to bolster the quality of care received by children from low-income households (OCC, 2017) . Childcare quality is commonly conceptualized by its structural and process dimensions (Cassidy, Hansen, Hedge, Shim, & Hestenes, 2005; Smolensky & Gootman, 2003) . Structural quality is often readily measured and regulated as it refers to characteristics such as childto-adult ratio, group size, setting features and resources, and caregiver training. Families of children with complex special needs may be particularly concerned with structural aspects related to caregivers' knowledge of special needs and equipment required by their children (Glenn-Applegate et al., 2011) . Process quality refers to the interactions among children and caregivers as well as opportunities afforded for social and cognitive stimulation. Process features may be the mechanism by which structural features are experienced, as they are more proximal to the child and directly influence child outcomes. Adult-child interactions, in particular, are key to facilitating children's development (Hamre & Pianta, 2011) . Dosage, or time spent in care, is often considered alongside quality, or as an indicator of exposure to structural quality (Pianta, Downer, & Hamre, 2016) , because it is associated with enhanced benefits from quality care, though evidence for quality by dosage interactions is limited (Zaslow et al., 2016) .\nBoth structural and process quality tend to vary by the age of children served and type of care setting. Infant and toddler care are often rated as low to moderate quality, contrasted with care of preschoolers which is moderate on average (e.g., Kreader, Ferguson, & Lawrence, 2005; Kryzer, Kovan, Phillips, Domagall, & Gunnar, 2007; Phillips & Lowenstein, 2011) . Moreover, quality of care received tends to be lower for children from low-income households (Ruzek, Burchinal, Farkas, & Duncan, 2014) . Center-based care and home-based care also differ in overall quality and structural and process characteristics (e.g., Fuller et al., 2004; Layzer, Goodson, & Brown-Lyons, 2007; Li-Grining & Coley, 2006) . Center-based programs are not only more likely to have higher child-toadult ratios and larger groups but also tend to have more highly educated staff and use formal curricula (Dowsett, Huston, Imes, & Gennetian, 2008) . Home-based care is often of lower global quality than center-based care but may be rated higher on subcomponents of quality (e.g., Fuller et al., 2004) . Overall, research suggests that high-quality care is rare in both centers and home-based settings.\nAmong subsidy-eligible families, subsidy use is associated with higher quality care because it tends to facilitate selection of center-based care; however, those who select home-based care also benefit from access to greater quality (Ryan et al., 2011) . Use of childcare subsidies is associated with greater use of licensed or other regulated care, particularly center-based providers (De Marco, Vernon-Feagans, & Family Life Project Key Investigators, 2015; Forry et al., 2013) . Paradoxically, providers who primarily serve families who use subsidies tend to provide lower quality care (Antle et al., 2008; Jones-Branch, Torquati, Raikes, & Edwards, 2004; Raikes, Raikes, & Wilcox, 2005) . Other research suggests that there is no difference in the quality of care between subsidized and unsubsidized settings (Weinraub, Shlay, Harmon, & Tran, 2005) . Taken together, subsidies appear to increase access to quality care unless the chosen providers serve a high density of subsidy recipients. Subsidies' effect for children with special needs from subsidyeligible families is unknown. Low-income children with disabilities tend to receive poor quality care (Wall, Kisker, Peterson, Carta, & Jeon, 2006) , but if subsidies operate as intended, children with disabilities who receive subsidized care should benefit from higher quality care than they would without subsidy."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "This study utilized data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), which featured a multimethod, multi-informant approach to collect data from a nationally representative sample of approximately 10,700 children born in the United States in 2001 (Najarian, Snow, Lennon, & Kinsey, 2010) .

The ECLS-B researchers excluded children who passed away or were adopted prior to 9 months of age or those who were born to mothers younger than 15 years. To ensure enough participants to allow subgroup analyses, the ECLS-B researchers oversampled infants with low birth weights, twins, and children of American Indian and Asian descent.

Before collecting data, field investigators participated in several days of rigorous training (Najarian et al., 2010) . Consistent with state laws, active and passive consents were obtained before accessing birth certificate records; moreover, parents/guardians provided informed consent before other data were collected (Nord et al., 2006) . The data collection methods included birth record review; interviews with the child's parents and care providers; observations in the home and a subsample of care settings; self-administered questionnaires for adult participants; and direct assessment of children's cognitive, motor, communication, and social-emotional child skills (Nord et al., 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "The variables used in this study were taken from several of the data sources in the ECLS-B data set: birth certificate records, parent interview, direct child assessment, childcare provider interviews, and direct childcare observation data.

Parent interview data from each wave of data collection included child, family, home, subsidy, and childcare characteristics as reported by the child's primary caregiver (typically the child's mother) during a 60-min face-to-face interview using the computer-assisted parent interview (CAPI; National Center for Education Statistics, n.d.).

This measure of structural quality was coded as a dichotomous variable (i.e., better than/recommended ratio and ratio exceeds recommendation) based on recommended child-to-caregiver ratios reported by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (2013) and in previous empirical literature (e.g., Burchinal et al., 2000b) .

The CIS includes 26 items that are rated on a 4-point scale, producing a composite score ranging from 0 to 104. Higher scores indicate more favorable social interactions and relationships (Arnett, 1989) . Caregiver Interaction Scale composite scores were included as a continuous variable.

The Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS; Harms & Clifford, 1989) was administered during the 2-year wave and 4-year wave for home-based care providers. The reliability and validity of scores produced using these standardized direct observation measures have been studied extensively (see Clifford, Reszka, & Rossbach, 2010) , producing strong psychometric properties (e.g., internal reliability: Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.95 for the ECERS, Najarian et al., 2010 ; \u03b1 = 0.88 for the FDCRS, and \u03b1 = 0.86 for the ITERS; Nord et al., 2006) . Furthermore, the field investigators who conducted the observations were highly trained, completing several test observations and achieving interrater reliability exceeding 85% agreement (Mulligan & Flanagan, 2006) . Across all three standardized rating scales, a global quality-rating score was produced using the same metric, which allowed for comparison of childcare quality across settings. Similar to past researchers (e.g., Burchinal et al., 2000b; Johnson, Ryan, & Brooks-Gunn, 2012) , childcare global quality ratings across settings were collapsed into a single quality variable. Because of the limited sample size and distribution of ratings, this variable was operationalized as either inadequate (scores <3) or adequate (scores of 3-7) quality care.

The BSF-R measured fine and gross motor skills as well as object permanence, exploration, receptive and expressive language, and problem solving (Barry, Bridges, & Zaslow, 2004) . Field administrators also rated the children's social-emotional functioning on dimensions of positive affect, negative affect, interest in materials, attention to tasks, and social engagement, using a scale of 1 (low frequency) to 5 (high frequency) throughout the BSF-R.

Failure to account for the complex sampling would produce biased estimates. The weights corrected for design effects, attrition, and nonresponse. Data were also analyzed for missingness and it was determined that the use of the ECLS-B sampling weights sufficiently accounted for missing data without further manipulation to produce results that were nationally representative of children born in 2001 in the United States. To address the RQs, two sets of analyses were completed with subsamples of the analytic sample described previously. This first set of analyses included descriptive statistics of the type of childcare (i.e., parental care, home-based care, or center-based care) used by subsidy recipients with and without special needs during early childhood to answer the first RQ. To assess whether or not there were significant differences in the type and quality of childcare used by these groups of subsidy recipients, z tests of population proportions were produced.

Recent iterations of the law identify children with special needs as a subpopulation warranting unique consideration (Administration for Children and Families [ACF], 2017). As little research has addressed the childcare experiences of these children and their families, the present study sought to ascertain the care type and quality of childcare accessed by children with special needs relative to their peers. The use of ECLS-B data conferred several advantages in terms of sample characteristics and variables related to the quality and type of care. First, ECLS-B is one of the few data sets that is both nationally representative and inclusive of low-income children with special needs who are subsidyeligible. Second, data permitted exploration of type and quality of childcare used over three time points in early childhood. Beyond the RQs of this study, use of ECLS-B allowed us to address some of the methodological challenges identified in past research on subsidy use and childcare choice (Johnson et al., 2012) . Specifically, quality of care was directly observed, region could be included to control for variations in state subsidy policies and supply of care, and an appropriate comparison group of subsidy-eligible families with children with special needs could be drawn. Finally, variables included in the ECLS-B data allowed for a broad inclusion of children with special needs to capture the greatest number of young children with special needs in the sample.\nThe present findings indicate that, as subsidy policy intended, use of subsidies for both children with special needs and those without special needs increased the use of nonparental care, both home-and-center-based. Within these categories of nonparental care, subsidy recipients were more likely to choose center-based care at each age point. Whereas families without subsidies relied primarily on parental care for their children with special needs, followed by home-based care, subsidy recipients overwhelmingly relied on centerbased care; however, children without special needs were accessing center-based care at higher rates than children with special needs at 2 and 4 years of age.\nThis overall finding is consistent with the general findings about parental choice of type of subsidized care favoring center-based care over home-based care (Ertas & Shields, 2012; Forry et al., 2013; Marshall, Robeson, Tracy, Frye, & Roberts, 2013) . In this way, subsidy-eligible parents who have children with special needs appear to make similar choices regarding type of care as subsidyeligible parents with children who do not have special needs. Yet, they may make their decisions about type of care for different reasons. For parents of children with special needs, stability of care, consistent access to resources, and providers' ability to care for their children's specific needs may especially critical considerations when parents choose providers (Glenn-Applegate et al., 2011) . However, past research suggested that parents of children with disabilities are more likely to choose home-based care (BoothLaForce & Kelly, 2004) . Additional research is needed to elucidate the potential reasons for parents' preference for center-based care.\nUse of subsidies resulted in increased use of nonparental care, especially center-based care, and more hours of care; however, it did not result in consistent access to high-quality care. To the contrary, there was little evidence of higher quality care across 2 and 4 years of age. Child-to-caregiver ratios were higher in subsidized settings at both ages. Although at 2 years of age, more children with special needs accessed subsidized care of adequate global quality, by 4 years of age, the unsubsidized care for children with special needs increased use of higher quality care to rates greater than those of subsidized children. There were no differences in the quality of caregiver-child interactions between subsidized and unsubsidized children with special needs. Thus, for families with children with special needs, accessing subsidized centerbased care did not provide an advantage over families without a subsidy in regard to higher quality childcare from 2 to 4 years of age. This pattern stands in contrast to what is known about the quality of care for subsidized children, as center-based prekindergarten programs received the highest rating of quality (Johnson et al., 2012) . Other factors may affect the impact of subsidy use in families with children with special needs. In the present study, variation in the quality of the interactions experienced by subsidy-eligible children with special needs in childcare settings was accounted for in part by child and family characteristics. Further research is necessary to better understand the mechanisms that may account for access to high-quality care when families that have children with special needs do and do not use subsidy. The use of higher hours of subsidized care with limited indicators of quality may help at least partially explain recent findings that subsidy recipients with special needs do not show better school readiness outcomes than comparable peers who did not use subsidies (Sullivan, SusmanStillman, & Farnsworth, 2017) . Accordingly, future research should explore the relations of dosage and quality of care to these children's outcomes.\nOur findings align with other studies showing that use of subsidized care does not necessarily lead to access of higher quality childcare (Antle et al., 2008; Weinraub et al., 2005) . Studies have yielded mixed findings when comparing the quality of care received by children from eligible families who do and do not use subsidies (e.g., Weinraub et al., 2005) . Although previous research suggested that preschoolers, but not toddlers, in subsidized care had higher child-to-caregiver ratios than children in unsubsidized care (Maher, Frestedt, & Grace, 2008) , our study suggests that among children with disabilities, subsidy use is associated with higher ratios for both toddlers and preschool-aged children.\nThus, the findings in this study call into question whether the intended goal of the subsidy program to consistently increase use of quality care for low-income families is being accomplished. This is particularly concerning for low-income children with special needs who experience greater developmental risks and who stand to make the greatest gain from receipt of quality care (Peisner-Feinberg & Burchinal, 1997) . Furthermore, even when accessing subsidized care, there were disparities in quality for children with special needs who were Black, had siblings, and whose mothers worked less than full time or had less than a high school education.\nWhy are parents with children with special needs who use subsidies less likely to access quality childcare especially if they are accessing center-based care? Johnson et al. (2012) found that relative to nonrecipients, subsidy recipients chose childcare that was lower in quality than other public programs (e.g., Head Start, public prekindergarten). Although that finding may be due in part to practical considerations, as Head Start and public prekindergarten programs offer fewer hours of care than childcare centers, there may be additional considerations when families of children with special needs are choosing care. Quality of inclusive preschool classrooms, compared with noninclusive classrooms, is mixed and varies by age of child (Grisham-Brown et al., 2010; Knoche et al., 2006; Wall et al., 2006) . Quality of care for children with special needs is likely affected by whether caregivers are competent and interested in caring for children with special needs (Grisham-Brown et al., 2010) . Furthermore, high quality care is expensive and caring for children with special needs can confer additional costs. Subsidies may not provide sufficient funds to allow parents of children with special needs to afford the highest quality care.\nEven with a childcare subsidy, there may be little advantage to subsidy use if the quality care choices are constrained (Johnson et al., 2012) . Parents of children with special needs report challenges in finding childcare with which they are comfortable and may compromise on childcare choices more than parents of children who do not have special needs (National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, 2008) . Parents of children with special needs are also more likely to prioritize structural aspects of care than parents without children with special needs (Buysse, Skinner, & Grant, 2001; GlennApplegate, Justice, & Kadaravek, 2016) . For example, parents who are aware of the timeintensive needs of their children's disability may be particularly concerned about higher child-to-caregiver ratios but unable to find a childcare center with a lower ratio."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "To explore questions of type and quality of care accessed by low-income families with children with special needs, we chose to conduct secondary analyses using the ECLS-B, a nationally representative data set. There are few other data sets that permit these kinds of analyses, particularly because data on subsidy use by families of children with special needs are extremely limited and most are bound to a geographic region (e.g., Ha, Magnuson, & Ybarra, 2012; Shlay, Weinraub, & Harmon, 2010) . However, there are limitations to this data set that are important to acknowledge. Because the children in the ECLS-B were born in 2001, there have been significant changes in early childhood policies and practices as well as subsidy policies and practices that may affect, positively and negatively, practices with children with special needs and subsidy eligibility. In terms of measuring care, the study design did not include collection of quality data during infancy, leaving open the question about quality of care accessed in infancy. Furthermore, the quality variables included in the ECLS-B gauge structural and process aspects of care may not fully represent the construct of quality. GlennApplegate et al. (2011 GlennApplegate et al. ( , 2016 described the familial aspect of quality as a third dimension distinct from typical structural and process quality dimensions. Likewise, several sociodemographic characteristics represented in the literature were unable to be included in analyses because of extensive nonresponse by providers (e.g., licensing/accreditation). Finally, use of secondary data precluded our ability to explore factors that contributed to parents' use of subsidy and which may be linked to their preferences for type or quality of care (Johnson et al., 2012) . Nonetheless, the ECLS-B offers some of the best available data for exploration of childcare experiences of children with special needs who are subsidy-eligible since federal reporting only recently required collection of special needs status in winter 2016 (ACF, 2012). As such, these analyses may be regarded as baselines for emerging trends as subsidy policy now prioritizes children with disabilities (ACF, 2017)."}, {"section_title": "Implications for practice and policy and future directions", "text": "The findings in this study document that although subsidized children with special needs are more likely to access non-parental care than unsubsidized children with special needs, they are not consistently accessing high quality care. Future research should focus on clarifying parental preferences and motivation for choosing the type and quality of care as there appear to be differences in the care chosen by families whose children do and do not have special needs and who do or do not access subsidies. For example, do families with children with special needs who are subsidy-eligible choose lower quality care because the preferences they have for quality childcare are not available or because the cost of caring for their children is not adequately accounted for by the subsidy? If the aspects of childcare quality prioritized by parents of children with special needs were incorporated into childcare programs (e.g., lower child-to-caregiver ratios), would there be increased use of higher quality childcare? Subsidy policies may not sufficiently accommodate the unique needs of families who have children with special needs; however, with the historic reauthorization of the Child Care Development Block Grant in 2014, and the inclusion of children with special needs as a priority audience, there may be opportunities to further enhance these families' ability to access and pay for quality childcare.\nThe findings of this study also indicate that improving childcare quality for young children throughout early childhood should be a priority. Improving quality will have beneficial effects for all children, including children with special needs. Improvements can be targeted toward both structural and process aspects of quality (e.g., decreasing child-to-caregiver ratio, adjusting the physical environment, enhancing providers' sense of competence about caring for children with special needs). States can use their quality rating and improvement systems and their professional development systems to provide improvement supports to increase program quality with specific attention to children with special needs. For example, providing more robust training on caring for children with special needs and specific information on certain kinds of disabilities can not only improve childcare providers' knowledge and skills but also expand the pool of providers interested in caring for children with special needs. States can also work to remove barriers for childcare providers who are motivated to care for children with special needs. For example, many states offer special rates for providers who care for children with special needs, but providers may need additional supports to qualify and apply for increased reimbursement rates. By supporting childcare providers throughout the process of acquiring special rates, state governments increase childcare access for families with children with special needs. Finally, states may want to target consumer education toward families that have children with special needs to most effectively educate them about quality childcare. As noted by Johnson et al. (2012) , simultaneous efforts to improve both quality and supply are necessary to address the complicated issue of accessing childcare for subsidy-eligible children with special needs."}]
